On Saturday, the 9th of May, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was attending the unloading of one of Dawes's wagons at Newgate-market—there were some hampers in it with directions on them, and one without a direction—I helped to throw that one out of the wagon on to the ground near Blake's stand—two of Mr. Robin<lb/>son's men assisted me—in consequence of there being no direction on it, it was opened, to see if there was any note inside—I saw some sides of veal in it, I cannot say how many, two pigs, and three calves' heads—I know Austin—he was employed that morning in pitching from that wagon—I left the hamper at the side of Blake's stand, not knowing who it belonged to—I had some weigh-bills to make out, and another wagon was coming in.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 9th of May, about half<lb/>past seven o'clock, or between that and eight o'clock, Hutton came to our place, and said there was a hamper of meat coming, and about five mi<lb/>nutes after, he and Tack came with packs on their backs, not with a ham<lb/>per—the meat was packed in cloths—they pitched it at the door—after all the meat was unpacked from the cloths, I looked over it—there were five sides of veal, two pigs with their heads on, and three calves' heads—Hutton came for the cloths some time after, and I gave him the seven cloths that the meat was packed in—he at first claimed six sides of veal, but there were but five—Tack was with him when he came for the cloths, and they went away together.</p>

                  </hi>I am a meat salesman, and live in White Hart-street, Newgate-market. On Saturday morning, the 9th of May, Austin came to my shop, about half-past seven o'clock—that was the first time I saw him—he brought some meat with him, packed in clothe—I was standing out<lb/>side the shop when it was pitched on the pavement at the door—about ten minutes after, Austin came again, and asked me to pay the pitching of the meat—I asked him his demand—he said, "6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>, I suppose"—I paid him, and he then went away—about half-past nine o'clock Hutton came, and inquired whether the meat was sold—I told him it was not all sold—he then went away—he came again about two o'clock, and Tack with him—he then bought a pig at 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—it weighed 10 stone 7lbs., and came to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he did not pay for it but directed it to be taken off the money for the meat, and he would call for the balance on the Monday—the pig was entire, and Wells chopped it down for him—Hutton took his half away in his apron, and Tack had his half cut up in pieces.</p>

                  </hi>I am a tailor, and live in Anchor-street, Haymarket. On the 19th of May I went to a public-house, and had some brandy and water—about one o'clock at night I was coming from Gloucester-place, New-road, and met the prisoner in Mary-le-bone-lane—I had six sove<lb/>reigns in my waistcoat-pocket, and a ₤10 note in my trowsers pocket—I missed the six sovereigns—I did not go any where with her to my know<lb/>ledge—I did not see her take the sovereigns—the policeman came up and found me with her down the mews—I had not given her any thing—I was drunk.</p>

"—she said, "Four sovereigns, " which I took out of her hand—I turned to the prosecutor, and asked if he had lost any thing? —he said, "No, it is all right, it is not my money"—I said, "Have you any money about you?

                  </hi>I live in Chapel-street, St. George's, with my parents. On Saturday night, the 16th of May, I was in Whitechapel-road, looking at a man writing on the pavement—there was a crowd—the policeman asked if I had lost any thing—I took my money out of my pocket, counted it, and missed a shilling, which was safe twenty minutes before.</p>

I was on duty about half-past six o'clock in the evening, in private clothes—I know both the prisoners, and thought it right to watch them—I saw them attempt several females' pockets, both of them, especially Pickering—I saw them at last come up to Steel, opposite the London Hospital, and saw Pickering put his hand in her pocket—the other saw me and gave him a nudge—they both came away—I caught hold of them both, and Pickering dropped a shilling—I went to the prosecutrix, and asked if she had lost any thing—she felt, and missed one shilling—while Pickering was trying the different pockets, Smith was standing behind him covering him.</p>

                  </hi>I live at No. 31, Broad-street, St. Giles's. On the 6th of May I was with Phillips in Grafton-street, Beater and English came up and said they had been and stolen some handkerchiefs out of Stagg's shop in Leicester-square, and they were going to sell them at Mr. O'Brien's—they showed them to me in their bosom, they looked like these—they asked me to go round with them—I went as far as the top of the court in Monmouth-street, where O'Brien lives—they went in, I waited till they came out again—I did not see who they saw in the house—when they came out they said they had sold them for a half-sovereign and eight shillings, and I saw a half-sovereign and eight shillings—I believe these to be the handkerchiefs they showed me.</p>

Nine<lb/>teen—I have known Phillips about eight years; I knew him by going to school with him, he is a respectable boy—I have known him intimately for eight years—I know nothing wrong of him myself—I consider him respectable—I consider myself so—it is about eighteen months since I was at the Refuge—I was sent there for disobedience, for doing that I ought not to have done.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. What was it you ought not to have done, that you did? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Why, stealing—I have not been respectable, but I am now—I was in prison six months ago—there has been no charge against me since that, except on suspicion through Mr. O'Brien's friends—that was for some knives; the same knives that Phillips was taken up about—we were both taken to<lb/>gether last Saturday I believe—I was accused wrongfully—I was never in custody except on those two occasions—yes, for some cigars once about ten weeks ago, but I was innocent.</p>

Oh no, not during my life—I cannot tell how often I have been in jail—I have a very fair memory, but that is a thing I do not recollect—I might have been twenty times in jail—it was partly through such people as the O'Briens—I do not bear them any very good will—I know the archway in Monmouth-street—I was there about three weeks ago—there is a public<lb/>house on one side and an iron shop on the other—I know Thornton by being in the police, that is all—I have known him about six or eight weeks, not on this business, on other business—I am not one of his regular <hi rend="italic">cads</hi>—I</p>

"—she said, "In the course of twenty minutes or half an hour"—he came in at that moment, and I asked him, is her presence, if he had bought any handkerchiefs—he said no, he did not buy such things—I said, "Are you positive? "—he laid, yes, if any thing of the sort had been bought it must have been when he was out, for he never bought anything of the sort, what he bought was furniture and metal—I said, "You had better be positive, and look about, for I believe the information I have received is correct"—O'Brien replied, "You can search my place if you like"—I said, "I am come prepared to search your place, I have a warrant to do so; and since you have denied buying any handkerchiefs, I shall search your place"—he then said to his wife, "Have you bought any handkerchiefs? "—she said, "Yes, four"—I said, "Where are they? Pro<lb/>duce them"—she hesitated some time, went to the back of the shop, took this basket from the wall, and took these six handkerchiefs from it—I then searched the room, and in a drawer I found three others, and a half one, and several other articles.</p>

                  </hi>I am a police inspector. I was with Johnson when the eels were found in the prisoner's boat, about a quarter to five o'clock, nearly opposite Wapping—he was rowing it down the river—I called to him, and said, "What have you in your boat? "—he said, "Eels"—I said, "Where did you get them? "—he said, "I bought them of a man at Bil<lb/>lingsgate"—I said, "Do you know the man? "—he said, "No"—I said, "What did you give for them? "—he said, "Two pounds"—I asked if he had a knife—he said he had not; and in about five minutes afterwards I saw another boat coming down the river with three empty eel-baskets, and rowed by another man—I called to him, and he rowed towards me—I examined the boat, and found the rope, which bad been recently cut, on the baskets—the other end of the rope was fixed to the vessel they were stolen from—I directed my man to search among the eels, and he found a knife—the prisoner is a drudge-man—they call themselves fishermen, but they go about getting coals and what they can from the barges.</p>

"—James was awake all the time from three o'clock, and he got up and said to my father, "What is the matter? "—my mother called him at half-past six o'clock—James and I did not say a word about the banging of the door—I am sure we had breakfast together—we waited breakfast till Thomas came down, and then sat down to breakfast together—we were doing about till then—James cleaned the boots, and we three sat down to breakfast—my father was there, and had an opportunity of seeing what we had for breakfast—James did not clean Thomas's boots—Thomas wore a pair of Blucher shoes that night—I could not see them at night, as it was dark, but in the morning his things laid at the head of the bedstead—I am sure he bad shoes, because his Wellington boots were locked up in the cupboard—my mother had locked them up the night before, that he should not go out, but do the work first—he had tie shoes—I spoke to my father and mother about this, and to Mr. Wooler, the solicitor—his clerk is here—he hat spoken to me on the subject, at Hatton-garden.</p>

On Sunday night, May 10, I went up to my bed-room a little after ten o'clock, in consequence of my wife com<lb/>ing down and telling me something, I found the window thrown open—I bad been in the room that afternoon—I had a chest of drawers in the room, and on it laid a saucer with some fourpenny pieces in it—here are fifteen fourpenny pieces and a brace-button—I had the fourpenny pieces in the saucer on tbe drawers that night, and I believe this brace-button was in the saucer with the fourpenny pieces that night—(<hi rend="italic">examining them</hi>)—we have two empty houses adjoining ours—a man could get in at the window from the adjoining house—when I went up stairs the fourpenny pieces and button were gone—I came down, went to the first empty house, and found the door fastened inside—I tried the other one, and by turning the handle I got in—I held the handle for one or two minutes, and then somebody wanted to come out—I held the handle fast till a policeman came along—I spoke to him—he went in and brought the prisoner up—he was searched in my presence, and two crow-bars and a dark lantern were found on him, and a box of matches—I asked him if he had not some fourpenny pieces—he said he had not—he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out six or seven, and said he had got no more—the policeman then found on him fif<lb/>teen in all, and the button—there were from fifteen to seventeen fourpenny pieces in the saucer—there was a mark on the drawers which corresponded with one of the crow-bars.</p>

                  </hi>(<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi>46.) I was on duty at Stanmore, on Tuesday, the 2nd of June—about a quarter past one o'clock in the morning I saw a man look through Mr. Stevens's rick-yard gate—at that moment two men advanced from the gate towards the Ashford-road—I pursued them—one had a sack on his back—the prisoner I am certain is one of the men—I knew him before perfectly well—I went up to them and asked the prisoner who had the sack what he had got there—be said, "Potatoes"—I put my hand on the sack—it appeared to contain corn, and I said, "You have got corn here, I rather suspect you have stolen it, and you must come with me"—he said, "Where are you going to take us to? "—the man that was on the other side of the stile came over and drew a large bludgeon from under his frock—the prisoner at that moment began to draw the sack from his shoulder and to draw a bludgeon from under the sack, which he had got to support the sack—he flourished the bludgeon, and said if I offered to take him he would take my life—I said I intended to take him if I lost the last drop of blood I had got—the prisoner made a violent blow at me with this bludgeon, which I produce—the blow did not take effect, as I fell back, and he turned himself round in striking—I defended myself from it as he was striking me—we had a desperate struggle—several blows were struck on both sides.</p>

                  </hi>I was in the employment of the late Lord William Russell, as housemaid, ✗ for three years—he resided at No. 14, Norfolk<lb/>street, Park-lane—a cook and valet were the only other servants—the pri<lb/>soner was the valet—the cook had been two years and nine months in his lordship's service—those were all the in-door servants his lordship kept—he had also a coachman and groom who did not live in the house—his lordship was a widower, and lived alone. On Tuesday morning, the 5th of May, I saw his lordship a little before nine o'clock—he came down before breakfast—he went out at one o'clock—the prisoner had been in at<lb/>tendance on him all the morning—after his lordship had gone out, the pri<lb/>soner said Lord Russell had given him five messages to attend to, and he was fearful he should forget some of them—he said one of them was to send the carriage to fetch his lordship from Brooks's at five o'clock—he asked me what Brooks's was—I told him it was a club—the cook, the pri<lb/>soner, and I dined together that day a little after one o'clock, the usual hour—after dinner the prisoner went out off the messages he had been en<lb/>trusted with—he returned a little before five o'clock alone—he told me he should go and get his lordship's things out to dress—soon after he returned, the upholsterer's man came to the house, that was about five o'clock—he was in the house about a quarter of an hour—I saw him leave the house—he went to tighten the pull on the bell of his lordship's bed<lb/>room, to tighten the handle—the prisoner went up stairs with the uphol<lb/>sterer's man—while they were up stairs the servant's bell rang at the area gate—it was a man named Carr, an acquaintance of the prisoner's—I had seen him once before, about a fortnight before—he had then called to see the prisoner—Carr came down the area steps into the kitchen—he re<lb/>mained till about six o'clock—he took tea with us in the kitchen—the prisoner, the cook, myself, and Carr took tea—while we were at tea the</p>

               <p>coachman came in by the area steps—on his coming down something was said about the carriage not having been sent for his lordship—the prisoner said he had forgotten to order it, and he should tell his lordship that he had ordered it at half-past five o'clock—I told him he had better tell his lord<lb/>ship the truth, and his lordship would forgive him—he said, "No, " he should tell his lordship half-past five o'clock; his lordship was very for<lb/>getful, and must pay for his forgetful ness—the coachman upon that left the house—after tea was over the prisoner went into his own pantry with Carr—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a model of the premises</hi>)—this is the kitchen in which we took tea, and this adjoining room is the butler's pantry, where the prisoner went with Carr—they were there about half-an-hour—Lord Russell soon after returned in a hackney <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, about twenty minutes to six o'clock—I went to the pantry door and said, "Courvoisier, his lord<lb/>ship has been obliged to come home in a <hi rend="italic">cab"</hi>—he then went up and let his lordship in—he went into the dining-room, which is on the ground<lb/>floor, immediately over the kitchen—his lordship soon after rang the bell, the prisoner went up, and afterwards came, down with a letter in his hand—he told me he was going to take it to the stable by Lord Russell's direction—he then went out, and Carr with him—I saw nothing more of Carr—the prisoner was not absent more than five or ten minutes, about as long as it would take him to go to the stable—he re<lb/>turned down the area steps—he told me in the pantry that his lordship seemed angry when he first came in, but he got quite good-tempered after—the prisoner brought in a dog of his lordship's when he came from the stable—Lord Russell then went out with his dog for a walk, as it was his custom to do every day—he returned about half-past six o'clock—the pri<lb/>soner was soon after employed in making arrangements for Lord Russell's dinner—seven o'clock was the dinner hour—about seven o'clock a bell<lb/>hanger came to fasten the handle of the door of Lord Russell's room—the prisoner requested me to go up with that workman, and I did so—he Was not in the house more than five or ten minutes—I did not go down stairs with him—he went out by the area—he mended the handle of the door—Lord Russell dined at home alone in the dining-room on the ground-floor—he was waited upon by the prisoner—he afterwards went up into the back drawing-room—he used to go up there to write—I left him there when I went to bed—he did not come down again to my knowledge—the coachman came in a little before nine o'clock to fetch the dog—I saw nothing more of the coachman that evening—the prisoner and I supped together that evening, a little before nine o'clock—the cook had gone out—during supper the prisoner and I had some conversation about change of servants, about a new cook coming into the house—the cook was going away, and a new cook expected—a friend of mine had applied for the place—the prisoner said, if his lordship did not take that friend he should not recommend any one himself—another person had applied—he said he wished he had not come into bis lordship's service, as he did not like it so well as he thought he should—nothing else passed—nothing was said about Richmond that evening—on the 22nd of April, the day Lord Russell came to London, the prisoner said his lordship had been very cross and peevish, as they had changed his room three times while he was stop<lb/>ping at the Castle at Richmond—I told him that must have been the reason that his lordship was angry—he said his lordship had lost a locket while they were at Richmond—he said he did not know how it was lost,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150064"/>
               <p>he could not find it—he said he did not know how the late valet could have stopped so long with his lordship; he did not think his temper would allow him to stop so long—some time after he said he must write to the porter at Richmond about the locket—he did not say what porter—it was not many days before the 5th of May that he said that—I think it was about between the 22nd of April and the 5th of May—I never heard him say any thing after that about the locket—on the evening in question the cook returned soon after ten o'clock—the prisoner let her in—she came in at the front-door—after the cook came in the prisoner went out to fetch her a pint of porter—he went out by the area gate—he was only gone a few minutes—there is a public-house close by—when he returned with the porter I do not know whether he locked the area gate or not—I did not see him bring in any thing but the porter—he made no observation about it—the area-gate was generally kept unlocked in the day—it was either the prisoner's or the cook's duty to fasten it—the key used to hang on a nail in the kitchen—I do not re<lb/>member to have seen the key in the kitchen after he came in with the porter—I left the kitchen a few minutes after ten o'clock to go to bed—it might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after—I slept in the front-room, third-floor, immediately over the room in which Lord Russell slept—the cook slept in the same room—we slept in two separate beds—the room in which we slept had a lumber-room taken off from it—my bed was against the window, and the cook's against the door—I should have to pass the cook's bed in going to or returning from mine—it was my duty before I went to bed to light a fire in Lord Russell's bed-room—I did so that night—after lighting it I went up to my own bed-room—there is a door at the foot of the stairs leading from the landing by Lord Russell's door to the room where I and the cook slept—the prisoner slept in the back-room, third-floor, next to ours—every thing appeared to me in the usual state in Lord Russell's room when I lighted the fire, the same as on other nights—the room immediately joining Lord Russell's bed-room was not used—it is a sort of lumber-room—there is a door from that room leading into Lord Russell's room—the door which opened from the landing had a spring on it which caused it to close of itself—the opening and closing of that door made no noise, without it was shut hard—the door at the foot of the stairs leading up to our room shut easily—the door of Lord Russell's bed<lb/>room was covered with baize—the door at the foot of the stairs had a com<lb/>mon latch, and had no covering—that door was sometimes closed at night, and sometimes left open—the cook came up stairs about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after me—I was in bed when she came up—she went to bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you, or the cook to your knowledge leave that bed-room any more that night? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No, I heard no noise, nor was I disturbed by any thing in the course of the night—it would be the prisoner's duty to remain up below till his lordship went to bed—the fire was left burning in the kitchen, and a supply of coals left—the cook used to attend to the fire—at the time I went to bed Lord Russell was in the back drawing-room—I saw a light in the back drawing-room as I went up stairs, and a little before that I heard the back drawing-room bell ring—I awoke about half-past six o'clock next morning—the cook was then in bed asleep—half-past six o'clock was about the time I usually got up—as I was going down stairs from my own room I knocked at the prisoner's bed-room door—I was accustomed to do that—I did not hear any answer given to my knock—I found the door at the foot of the attic stairs slightly open—I noticed the warming-pan on the landing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150065"/>
               <p>adjoining Lord Russell's room—it was lying on the landing with the handle nearest to the bed-room door—it laid across the door that would go into the back-room which was not used—you would have to step over the warm<lb/>ing-pan to get into the back-room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did it leave the passage to and from Lord Russell's room uninter<lb/>rupted? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—it was the prisoner's duty to warm his lordship's bed every night—the warming-pan was generally taken down into the kitchen afterwards—during the five weeks the prisoner was in the service the bed had been warmed every night when his lordship was in town—once before the warming-pan had been left on the landing—I spoke to him about it, and told him it was not the proper place to leave it—I do not remember how long before the 5th of May that was—I think it was before Lord Russell went to Richmond—I left it there on this occasion, and went into the back<lb/>room adjoining his lordship's bed-room—I was not in that room a moment—I went in there for my broom—I did not observe whether the door between that and Lord Russell's room was closed or not—I then went down stairs into the back drawing-room, where I had left his lordship the night before—I noticed his lordship's writing desk turned round—it is what is called a Davenport-desk, with a sloping top which lifts up—four drawers were open, and the top jammed up with papers—I observed his lordship's bunch of keys and several of his papers lying on the hearth-rug—I no<lb/>ticed a screw-driver lying on his lordship's writing chair—I had seen that in the butler's pantry a few days before, in a bottom cupboard next the fire, in a little tool-box—I had seen it there two or three days before—the tool-box is one that the late valet had—it belonged to the place—I did not notice any thing in the front drawing-room—I opened the front drawing-room shutters—I then went down stairs, and into this passage—(<hi rend="italic">pointing it out on the model</hi>)—when I got into the passage, I saw a number of things lying behind the street-door, which was shut—I went up to the door—it had no fastening but the latch—any body from the outside could open it with a latch-key—there were two bolts to the door, top and bottom, a double lock, and a chain, besides the latch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. What did you first notice when you came down? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I saw a num<lb/>ber of things lying against the door—I was then at the bottom of the stairs—I then went up to the door and noticed bis lordship's large blue cloak—that was part of the number of things—it was not lying very close to the door—a little distance from it, was his lordship's opera-glass, a little trinket box lying on the top, and a number of things tied up in a napkin, which I did not examine at that time,—that was lying a little nearer the door than the cloak—the cloak was folded up very neatly—I did not at that time notice any other article—I examined the things after the police came into the house—there was his lordship's gold pencil-case, a gold tooth-pick and case—the pencil-case was in the folds of the napkin, and the tooth-pick<lb/>case also—there was also a silver sugar-dredger, a little silver caddy-spoon, a silver top of a salt-dredger, a pair of his lordship's spectacles, tipped with silver, a little cayenne spoon, a top of a silver dish-cover, and the cook's silver thimble—I knew the napkin to be the same that I had given out on the Monday for his lordship's dinner—I had seen it on the Tuesday, just before the prisoner went to lay the cloth in the pantry—I asked the prisoner if he wanted a clean one—he said no, he would make it do twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Where were these things usually kept? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. The cloak was kept in the dining-room, on the last chair against the window—the opera-glass in his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150066"/>
               <p>lordship's bed-room, on the shelf over the fire-place, the little trinket-case, to the best of my belief, was kept in his dressing-case, but I am not cer<lb/>tain; the gold pencil-case and tooth-pick his lordship generally carried about with him, and generally put them on a small table in his bed-room at night—he had three pairs of spectacles—I do not know where he kept them—the silver dredger was kept in the cupboard next to the fire in the pantry, and the caddy-spoon, and silver top of the cover—the dish cover was kept in a cupboard in the sideboard in the dining-room—the other part of the dish was also kept there—the prisoner had the key of that cupboard—I do not know whether it was locked or not—when I went up to the street-door I did not examine it, but just looked at it—I set the dining-room door open and saw a number of things lying on the floor—the shutters were closed, and I set the door open to give me light, as I felt alarmed seeing those things, and then I went and opened the shutters—after I had opened the shutters, I saw the candlesticks—I do not know whether they were plated or silver—some were plated and some silver—the bottom of the dish-cover and some sugar was on the floor—all the drawers and cupboard doors were open—I felt dreadfully alarmed, and ran up stairs to tell the cook—I found her in bed—I said something to her—she made me an answer—in consequence of what she said I went to the door of the prisoner's room—I said, "Courvoisier, do you know of any thing being the matter last night? "—he said. ''No"—his room door was shut—it was opened instantly by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. How long elapsed✗ between your first knocking at the door to awake him, and your going and knocking and speaking to him? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I should say ten minutes—when he opened the door he was dressed all but his coat—he used to wash in the pantry below—he was dressed in the usual way that morning, except his coat—he used to put his coat on before he came down—I did not notice any thing but his waistcoat—that was the same he generally wore—he had his shoes on—sometimes I have seen him come down without shoes, and sometimes with them—he generally came down stairs dressed—on his opening the door, I said, "Do you know what has been the matter last night? "—he said, "No"—I said, "All your silver and things are about"—he looked very pale and agitated—he did not make me any answer—he came out of his room, and put his coat on as he was going down the attic stairs—he went down instantly, I with him—he went down first—he took the warming-pan down in his hand to the dining-room—it was my custom to call the prisoner of a morning—he was never so short a time dressing as that morning—he was sometimes half-an-hour, sometimes three<lb/>quarters, and sometimes an hour—the first room he went into was the dining room, and there he left the warming-pan—I did not hear him say any thing then—he then went down stairs into his own pantry—there is a door near the pantry which opens into the back area—I did not notice whether that was open or shut—he went into his pantry—I followed him—there is a cupboard there and drawers, they were all open—he made up to the drawers first, and said, "My God, some one has been robbing us"—I said, "Let us go up stairs"—we both went up stairs, I think as far as the passage, and then I said, "For God's sake let us go and see where his lordship is"—we went up stairs—he went first—I followed him close behind—he went into his lordship's bed-room by the cloth door—the door closed upon me, but I had the handle in my hand, and went in immediately after—when you go in at the door there are three windows fronting the street opposite the door—the head of the bed is against the wall on the right</p>

               <p>hand as you go in—when I went in, the prisoner was opening the shutters of the middle window—he would have to pass the foot of the bed to do that—I went about half way to the middle of the bed, at the foot of the bed, and saw blood on the pillow—before I noticed the blood, I said, "My lord, my lord"—the prisoner said, "Here he is, " or "There he is, " I am not certain which were the words—I cannot say whether that was before or after I saw the blood on the pillow—on seeing the blood I screamed and ran out of the room—there were hangings to the bed—it was a four-post bedstead—the curtains were closed on the side next the door, and about half-way at the foot, the same as I bad left them over night—I left the prisoner in the room, and I think I ran part of the way up the attic stairs, and then I turned round, and ran down into the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Had you any object in going up the attic stairs? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I was going to my fellow-servant the cook, when I thought I would give an alarm out in. the street, and my screams awoke her—I left the house by the street door, and went over to No. 23, Mr. Latham's, and rang the bell—it is nearly opposite—finding they did not come instantly, 1✗ rang the bell at No. 22, Mr. Lloyd's, and the footman came up the area steps immediately—I do not know his name—Young, Mr. Latham's servant, came out while I was standing at the door—I told him what had occurred—I had left the front door of the house open when I ran out—I was not gone many minutes, I merely crossed the street, rang these two bells, and came back again—when I came back to the house I think I met the cook at the bottom of the stairs in the passage—I am not positive—I then went into the dining-room—I do not know whether she followed me or not—at that time no stranger had come into the house—when I went into the dining-room I found the pri<lb/>soner sitting on a chair in the act of writing—he had✗ a pen in his hand and a small piece of paper lying on a large book—he appeared to be writ<lb/>ing on that small piece of paper—I said, "What the devil do you sit here for, why don't you go out and see for some one, or a doctor? " he said, "I must write to Mr. Russell"—he did not continue writing—he only wrote about two words—I said, "Some one must go for Mr. Russell"—I knew him to mean the son of Lord William Russell—he lived at No. 9, Cheshunt-place, Belgrave-square—on my saying that, the prisoner got up and came to the street-door—a sort of labouring man was going past, and the prisoner beckoned to him—I told him not to call such a man as that, and the man went on about his business—the coach<lb/>man came a few minutes after, and Young, Mr. Latham's servant, about the same time—I think the coachman was in the house first—the coachman and Young went up stairs—I am not sure whether I went up with them, I am not positive sure—I do not know what I did at that moment—I think I did—I think the cook went to the bed-room door—I do not know where the prisoner was—I heard Young say something about fetching a doctor—I was on the stairs—I went down and was going to send some one for a doctor, when the coachman ran for Mr. Elsgood, a surgeon in the neighbourhood—the police arrived a very few minutes after that—I went up stairs when the police arrived, into the bed-room—when I went in I saw his lordship's face at that time, and I saw a quantity of blood—I was in the habit of making the bed—his lordship usually laid on the side next the window—there were two pillows—they were usually put side by side, as if for two persons—the pillows were in that state when I saw them that morning—his lordship laid on his right side with his face towards the window—he was lying with his head on the pil<lb/>

               <p>low, nearest the window, and the other pillow was lying behind him—it was on the pillow next the window, on which I first saw the blood when I went into the room with the prisoner—when I went up with the police I did not notice whether there was blood on the other pillow—there was a dressing table in the room—it is the one on which Lord Russell used to put his pencil-case and tooth-pick—it had a white cloth on it—he generally used to leave his rings, which he wore daily, on the table—they were five—I had frequently seen them there of a morning—his lordship would frequently go down to breakfast and leave them there—there were no rings or tooth<lb/>pick, or pencil-case there then—they were all gone—there was a purse there—I took it up—it was empty—the police then took possession of the house, and have remained in it to the present time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Have you ever had conversation with the prisoner on the subject of money? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—the last time was on the Tuesday morning, the 5th—he said he had no money at home, he never took any out with him, and he had no money in the bank—I do not exactly remember what led to that conversation—he afterwards said he had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. some odd shillings in the bank—that was on the same day, in the same conversation—when he first said he had no money in the bank I did not make any observation—he said all the money he had then was 5<hi rend="italic">l.; </hi>when that was gone he must ask his lordship for some more, and that he had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing him on the books against his lordship—nothing passed between the time of his saying he had no money in the bank and his saying that he had money in the bank—the cook was present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do you remember whether any thing passed between you, after hav<lb/>ing first said he had no money, and then saying he had? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I said to him, "Have you spent all that money I saw you take out? "—he said, "Yes"—I do not know how that conversation began—it was at breakfast—I had seen him take some sovereigns out of his box when he came up into his bed-room, and I was in my bed-room, and he had some sovereigns in his hand, which he put into his waistcoat pocket—I cannot say whether this was on Monday or Tuesday—that is what I meant by asking him what he had done with the money I had seen him take out—(I do not know how many there were)—he said he had, for he had paid a tailor's bill—this was on the Tuesday—it was his own tailor's bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Which was mentioned first, having money in the bank, or paying his tailor's bill? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Having money in the bank was mentioned first—I asked him what bank—he said in St. Martin's-lane—I believe there is a Savings' bank there—I told him that was the best bank he could put it in—I do not think he said any thing more at that time—he said he was not so well off as when he first came to England—I think he said that before that time—he said it once before, and he said it again at tea time, when Carr was there on the Tuesday evening—he said on the Tues<lb/>day morning that he had but 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did he say where the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No; he said he had but 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Can you tell us whether he said he had but 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. be<lb/>fore or after he said he had the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd in the bank? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I think it was before he said he had the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the bank—I never saw him in possession of any money of his own, but the sovereigns which I have mentioned—I never saw him with any Bank-note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did he ever speak to you, or in your hearing, on the subject of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150069"/>
               <p>Lord William Russell's property? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes, on two occasions, I heard speak of that—the first occasion was before his lordship went to Richmond—he said <hi rend="italic">Old Billy</hi>was a <hi rend="italic">rum old chap</hi>, and if he had his money he would not remain long in England—I said his lordship was not a very rich man—he said, "Ah, <hi rend="italic">Old Billy</hi>has money, and if I had it I would not remain long in England"—the next occasion was before the Tuesday, but I do not know how long—it was after he returned from Richmond—that was on the same subject—he said the same words as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do you mean to the same effect, or the same words? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. The same words—I was alone with the prisoner at supper the night before the mur<lb/>der—I had a glass of ale—he offered me a glass of something, which I tasted, but did not drink—he drank the same ale I did—in the course of the day on the 6th, I asked the prisoner if he heard me knock at his door—he said he thought he would begin to dress—he did not say whe<lb/>ther he heard me or not—I have frequently seen the prisoner in his lord<lb/>ship's bed-room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you notice any thing particular in his conduct at any time? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—I did several times—I noticed that he was, looking into all his lordship's property, and every thing that he could—I asked him what he wanted in the rooms, and he told me he was looking after something—he has not told me what—this was before he went to Richmond—I cannot mention any article in particular, which he appeared to be looking at—on one occasion I noticed that he had his lordship's dressing-case down in his pantry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Would it be his duty to have it down there to clean it or any thing? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I never knew the other valet to have it down—I cannot tell any article that he was looking at when he was in his lordship's bed-room, because his lordship used to carry the keys, and I never knew his lordship to leave any thing unlocked in the bed-room, except his dressing-case—it was not only in one room that I saw him looking, but every room—I do not know exactly what property his lordship had—one day his lordship left his cash-box unlocked—it was the day his lordship went to Rich<lb/>mond—it was kept in his lordship's bed-room, by the side of the bed—it was a little box his lordship always called his cash-box—it was covered with leather—the prisoner brought it down, and said it was unlocked—his lordship was gone out for a walk at that time—the prisoner brought it down into the dining-room, because his lordship was going to Rich<lb/>mond, and he always took it with him—his lordship burnt a rushlight at night in his room—I set one up that night—it was a whole rushlight—I left it unlit when I went to bed—I have since given one of the rush<lb/>lights out of the same parcel to inspector Beresford.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. You have been examined, I be<lb/>lieve, several times before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—I cannot recollect how many times—it was three I believe, but I do not know how many times—I was also examined before the Coroner—I have not been examined by anybody since the committal of the prisoner, that I swear—not by Mr. Hob<lb/>ler—this is not the first time I have said I saw the prisoner looking not only into one room, but into every room after his lordship's property—I said it before I ever went to Bow-street, to the solicitor who was there when first I was examined, I believe it was Mr. Hobler—I also said it to my fellow<lb/>servant—I have several times told what occurred, without mentioning that I saw him looking after the property—I gave evidence in the house of</p>

               <p>Lord Russell on the first or second day, I am not certain which—I believe what I said was taken down in writing—I have no doubt that it was—Mr. Mayne, the commissioner of police, was there—there was no Magistrate present to my knowledge—I never saw him—there was no attorney there to my knowledge—I did not see any—there were only two per<lb/>sons, Mr. Hobler and Mr. Mayne—I did not know Mr. Hobler was the attorney—I did not know that was the name—the prisoner was not present—when I first went into his lordship's room with the prisoner, I said, "My lord, my lord, " and saw some blood on the pillow, and ran away screaming—I did not see his lordship on that occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Now, attend to me, on the oath you have taken, have you never said, "I saw my lord murdered in the bed? " <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No, sir, I never did—I never said his lordship was murdered, the first time—I did not see his lordship when I first went in with the prisoner—I never said I did, to my recollection—I really was that frightened, I do not know what I said at the moment—I know what I said in the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. But did you ever represent that when you went the first time into the bed-room with Courvoisier, you saw my lord murdered in the bed? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I saw blood—I did not know whether he was murdered—I never said that I saw him murdered in the bed—I am sure I never did—I did not see his lord<lb/>ship the first time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. I am asking what you said; if you said that, on the first occasion when you went in with Courvoisier, you saw his lordship murdered in the bed, would that be true or not? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I do not know whether I said mur<lb/>dered or killed—I think I said something to my fellow servant—I think it was "killed"—she says I said either murdered or killed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. I am talking of the time you went in with Courvoisier; did you represent to any body that, on the first view of the bed on that occasion, you saw my lord murdered in the bed? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No—I do not think I said it—I could not say that, because I never saw my lord then—I did not re<lb/>present that I did, to my belief—I did not, to my knowledge—I cannot say whether I did or not—when I first went in I saw blood on the end of the pillow—I said, "My lord, my lord, " and ran screaming out of the room.</p>

No, I had no doubt at all—I did not think there was any thing the matter—not so much the matter as there was, because I had frequently seen his lordship's papers strewed about, much the same as they were that morning—I never before found the passage strewed with things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Had you any doubt then of any thing being the matter?

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Why ask her? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Because I had nobody else to go to—I did not know what to think when I saw the things in the passage—it surprised me very much—I went immediately up to the cook, and told her what I had seen—I went into the parlour first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Why not instantly go up when you saw the things in the drawing<lb/>room and in the passage? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I did not know what the things were laid there for—I knew nothing about it—I did not go into the parlour before I went up to her—I went up to the door to see the things—I did not exa<lb/>mine the street-door—I could see it from the bottom of the stairs—I went to it to see what the things were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Were you not surprised to find it unchained and unbolted? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I sometimes have found it unfastened before—I cannot say exactly how long before—it might be before his lordship went to Richmond—once Courvoisier had forgotten to fasten it—that surprised me—I do not know whether I mentioned that to the cook or not—it was only once before that I had seen it unfastened—I was surprised at seeing the things strewed about the passage, but I was not so much alarmed till I went into the parlour, I then became more alarmed—I just opened the shutter—I went into the drawing-room to pen the shutters, not to see if property was there—I did not suspect any thing when I went into the front drawing-room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Although you had seen the desk twisted round, the drawers open, and the papers sticking out, you never suspected any thing wrong? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Now it has been opened to us to-day that Courvoisier never took the least trouble to give any assistance; if I remember right, you told me that the prisoner appeared to be writing, and said he was writing to Mr. William Russell? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. He said he must write to Mr. Russell—I said, somebody must be sent for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. And after that, he was about to send the first man he saw at the door? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Not that I know of—he beckoned to the man—he had sat about five minutes after I told him Mr. Russell must be sent for—when he beckoned to the man, I gave him a push, and said, "Don't call such a man as that"—I did not know what he was calling him for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. What did you mean by saying, "Do not send such a man as that? "</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150072"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Because he did not look like a man to send any where—I did not think the prisoner was going to send him for Mr. Russell—he was not a man I should send any where.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. If you found a house robbed, and a murder committed, should you not send the first person you could find? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I do not know whether I should or not—I did not see his lordship when I first went into the room with Courvoisier—I am not certain whether I ever said I saw blood on the pillow, but could not tell whether I saw his lordship—I never said, "I did see his lordship the first time"—I did not see him—I never said, "I was not sure whether I did or not"—I had been living at Mivart's hotel—Lord William was stopping there a short time, not living there—he was there about a fortnight—I left Mivart's after his lordship went away—I do not know how soon after, it might be a fortnight, or it might be more—I did not go into any service after leaving Mivart's—I went into lodg<lb/>ings for two months—I then went into Lord William's service—it was at Mr. Don's, No. 9, Upper John-street, or Lower John-street, Golden-square, where I lodged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. You have stated you took some ale from the prisoner, did you ever say you grew quite drowsy? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—I was not asked the question to-day, I felt quite drowsy afterwards, not immediately—I felt sleepy and drowsy—I feel drowsy of a night, but I felt drowsier that night, after taking the ale—I do not say it was the ale—I do not know whether it was the ale or what it was—the prisoner took some of it—I was sitting there about three<lb/>quarters of an hour—just before I went to bed I became drowsy—I did not become so very shortly after taking the ale—it might be half, or three-quar<lb/>ters of an hour—it might be very shortly—I cannot say exactly the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do I state your sensations truly when I describe them in this way, "I felt very heavy and sleepy, and felt a drowsy sensation come over me very shortly after taking the ale? " <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—it might be the ale that made me so—I did not mean to convey to the jury that he gave me drugged ale—I never tasted any thing particular in the ale—I did not mean to insinuate that it was drugged ale—I mentioned it merely as a matter of course—I never meant to insinuate it was the ale made me so—I was dreadfully frightened after I found that his lordship was murdered—it was after that that I said to the prisoner, "What the devil are you doing there? "—I am not in the habit of speaking so, but I did not know what I was about—I observed what he was about—I should not have said that, had he got up and assisted me—I think it was quite right to apprize Mr. William Russell immediately of the horrid event that had happened—Bel<lb/>grave-square is not very far for a man to ride on horseback—the coachman might have gone—Courvoisier might have gone for the coachman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. And might he not have taken the opportunity of escaping, if he was conscious of any crime? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. He might have escaped—Our sleeping-room is divided from Courvoisier's by a wall—I do not know whether it is lath and plaster—it is not very thick, and not very thin—I have knocked my hand against it—I do not know that it is hollow—I did not knock against it for any thing particular—I did not notice a hollow sound that I know of—when I went down with Courvoisier, and saw the things tossed about, I said, "Let us go and see where his lordship is."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you think any thing was the matter with my lord then? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I did not know what to think—he was unprotected, and nobody went to see—I found my fellow-servants safe.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150073"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Why did you not use the expression, "Let us go and tell his lord<lb/>ship the house is robbed, " instead of saying, "Let us go and see where his lordship is? " <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Those were the words I used—I expected to find him in his bed-room—I did not know whether he was in his bed-room, or not—it is a small house—I had been into every room except the kitchen—I had not been into his lordship's bed-room then—I did not know where he was—I did not expect any mischief was done to him at that time—I was anxious to see where he was—I had no doubt where he was—I believe there has been a great deal of inquiry and search made all about the pre<lb/>mises—I saw a ladder on the premises—it has been there ever since I have been in the house—it was there before I went into it—all the police saw it, and knew it was there—I heard inspector Tedman inquiring about the ladder—I do not know that he mentioned it at any investigation—I heard him mention it, but not at the investigation—I did not mention that there was a ladder on the premises—I heard many inquiries as to how any body could have got over the walls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Is not that ladder exactly the height of the wall which separates the yard of the premises from another? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I never noticed it—the ladder was not always kept in the yard—when it was not there it was kept in the bath-room, which goes off from the house—I cannot tell how high that wall is—I have been in the yard hundreds of times—I have no idea how high the wall is—I have gone up that ladder, but not in the yard—I have had it in the house—I do not know the height of it—it is the height of other ladders—I do not know whether a person on that ladder could get over the side<lb/>wall—I never saw the ladder standing there before the morning of the murder—I did not see it till the police saw it—it was standing in the pas<lb/>sage on the Tuesday, and I asked Courvoisier to take it away, and he took it and placed it there himself—I remember that now—it stood inside when I asked him to take it—it was in the passage just below three stairs—I was cleaning the passage, and said to Courvoisier, "Will you take this away? " and he took it out there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT.</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Standing in the house? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—it had been left there on Monday—the late valet had been there hanging some pictures for his lordship, and left it there—I asked Courvoisier to take it away, and he took it away, took it out of the house, on Tuesday—he set it where it was found by the police, on the side of the wall of No. 15, the left-hand side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS.</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you desire Courvoisier to put it there? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No, I desired him to take it away—I saw where he took it to—it did not sur<lb/>prise me in the least next morning.</p>
               <p>~<hi rend="smallCaps">COURT.</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did it reach to the top of the wall? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Not exactly, that I know—I never noticed it—it stood quite upright.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS.</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Was it leaning against the wall? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. It must be leaning against the wall—I did not see it for a long time after—I saw it in the course of the day leaning against the wall—I do not know how far it was from the top of the wall—any body on the top of that could easily have got over the wall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Now, you were in the house ever since this unhappy event took place, have you seen any people trying chisels, pokers, and instruments of all description, against the doors and wainscoting? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the model</hi>)—this is the glass door leading into the yard—I do not know of any experiment being made on that door and door-post since the police</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150074"/>
               <p>came into the house—I had not observed any marks on that door before the police came into the house—that is the door through which I have gone scores of hundred of times into the yard—I never noticed any marks on that door—I believe I first mentioned about the prisoner giving me the ale at the last examination, but I really do not know—I was never in the house before I went into his lordship's service—I never was in the street before—I had not looked out for a situation while at Mr. Don's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. You preferred living on your means? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No, I did not, I was doing the servant's work in the house—Mr. Don kept two servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. I thought you mentioned it as a lodging? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. It was a lodging when I first went there, but the servant went away, and I did the work of that servant, because I would not be spending my own money—I was, it might be, about a month at Don's before the servant went away, but I do not know—I did not hear of a situation in that month—I inquired of people coming to the house, and the servants in the house asked the tradespeople about a situation for me—I did not go myself—Mr. Don is a tailor—I had never seen the Waterloo medal but once before—I saw it then on the table in his lordship's bed-room—he had emptied a little box—his lordship never kept his bed-room door locked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. How did you find out that my lord wanted a servant? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. When I left Mivart's hotel I asked the head waiter if he heard of a light place to let me know, he said he would, and when his lordship came from abroad he sent for me by one of the men out of the stable—I never, to my recol<lb/>lection, heard Courvoisier mention the wages he had at Mr. Fector's—he had not so much at his lordship's by 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the late valet—I do not know what his wages were—I do not know that it was 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he told me it was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less than the late valet had—I did not hear him say he had double the wages he had at Mr. Fector's—he told me had no money in the Bank, and then said he had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. When you said to Courvoisier, "Let us go and see where his lord<lb/>ship is, " did he not say to you, "What will he say? " <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No, I did not hear him say any thing—I cannot swear he did not—I never heard him say any thing at that time—I can swear I never heard him say that—I do not recollect hearing him say any thing when he was going into the dining<lb/>room—I never heard him—I did not see the area gate at all after the pri<lb/>soner went out for the beer for the cook.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. You have been asked about some examination of per<lb/>sons in the house in the presence of Mr. Mayne and Mr. Hobler, on what day was that? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I do not recollect the day—it was not the day of the murder—I was examined in the absence of the prisoner—the prisoner also went into the room to be examined in my absence—the other servants were examined separately in the same way—we were all kept separate from each other—no one had been at that time charged with, or accused of this offence, to my knowledge—when I went up into the bed-room with Tedman the door was opened by the men that went up stairs—the door had not closed after them before I went in—it remained open—I do not know how near I was to the room when Tedman went in—I was part of the way down stairs—when I went into the room Tedman was round by the side of the bed against the window, near his lordship's head—Young and some other persons had been up in the room before I went up with Tedman—I had seen the Waterloo medal about three months before his lordship's death—his lordship was in the room when I saw it—it was lying open—I never in my life had any quarrel or cause of quarrel with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>I was cook in the late Lord William Russell's service for two years and nine months—his lordship dined at home on the 5th of May—after dinner I washed the plate—I went out a little before nine o'clock, and returned a little before ten—I went out alone and returned alone—Courvoisier let roe in at the front door, and he fastened the door when I came in—he locked, bolted, and chained it—I went down stairs into the kitchen—I did not go out of the house after that time—before I went out at nine o'clock, I went into the yard to fetch the cold meat in for supper, and I bolted the door after me—the cold meat was kept in a safe in the lower yard—the door I bolted was the one which leads from the passage close to the pantry, into the lower yard—there were two bolts to that door, one at the top and the other at the bottom—I do not think I bolted the bottom bolt, because it was out of repair—I had not been in the habit of bolting that bottom bolt of late—on my return home I had my supper in the kitchen—Courvoisier and Manser had already supped—Manser went to bed first—before I went to bed Courvoisier went out and fetched me some beer—he went out by the area gate—I did not notice where he put the key of the area gate on his return—it usually hung up in the kitchen—he had taken it to let himself out of the area gate, but I did not notice on his return whether it was put there again—I went up to bed about half-past ten o'clock—the prisoner did not remain in the kitchen till I went up stain to bed—he was in the pantry when I went to bed—he had not been very long in the pantry before I went to bed, only a few minutes—he had been up stairs while I was at supper—he went up stairs to the draw<lb/>ing-room as the bell rung—when I got up stairs into my bed-room Manser was in bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did she to your knowledge leave; the room in the course of that night? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No, I do not believe she did—I did not leave it at all—I was not disturbed at all in the night by any noise, or any thing out of the common way—Manser got up first next morning—I think it was about a quarter to seven when she went down stain—I was still in bed—she generally used to knock at the prisoner's door as she went down—I heard her do so that morning as she went down—she came up stairs again in about five minutes and made a communication to me—I immediately got up—before I got up she went again to Courvoisier's door, and I heard them both go down stairs—whilst I was dressing I heard the housemaid scream, and on hearing that I finished dressing and ran down stairs—I ran to the lower part, near the dining room—I saw Manser there—she said his lordship was killed—I just went into the front dining-room—I saw the prisoner and Manser there—the prisoner had got a slip of paper and a pen, and was writing something on a book—I then went to the front door—in the course of the morning I saw the prisoner in the back dining<lb/>room—it was a few minutes after I had seen him in the front dining-room—he was sitting in a chair by the middle door—he said, "Oh dear, they will think it is me, and I shall never get a place again"—when I came down I saw some things lying about in the passage—there was his lord<lb/>ship's cloak, an opera glass, and trinket box—I saw a bundle in the pas<lb/>sage by the cloak, tied up with a dinner napkin—the contents of that bundle were not taken out before the police came—I had left a thimble of mine the night before in a work-box in a cupboard in the kitchen—that cupboard is on the right hand as you face the street—in the morning when I went into the kitchen, I found the cupboards and drawers all open—there</p>

               <p>was nothing taken away that I am aware of, except that thimble—there was nothing of any value in the cupboard—I do not know how it had been opened—there was no force used—the lock was shot—I think it could be opened easily—I could not open it when it was locked—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at the plan</hi>) there are two or three doors to it—I did not observe any marks of violence, but the lock was turned, not unlocked—the bolt was shot—I had locked that cupboard myself the night before, and taken the key up stairs—there is a little bolt on one side as well as the lock—I could not be positive that I put that bolt down, I think I did—two of the dresser drawers were open, all out of order, and rummaged—they had not been locked—I left a fire in the kitchen, the night before, when I went to bed—I left the prisoner up, he was to supply it, in case any thing was wanted—his lordship always had his bed warmed—I left coals to feed it with.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. The prisoner, and you, and the others lived comfortably and peaceably together? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes, we never had any quarrel, because we had no reason—when he said that about my lord, I only thought he said it as a joke—he said if he had as much money as <hi rend="italic">Old Billy</hi>he would not remain in England—he is a Swiss—I do not know whether it was his lordship's custom to give him money for the weekly or monthly supply—he has not paid bills, except for his lordship—he said something about money in the Bank—that was when he said he had only 5<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, and when that was gone he must ask his lordship for more—he said something about having 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Bank.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. The 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. did not refer to all he had in the world, but to what he had for the expenses of the house? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I did not properly understand him—he said something about the Bank—I did not give more than 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the thimble—I had had it a very long time, before I went into my lord's service—there was a step-ladder in the yard—it used not to be kept there lately, I think—I believe it had been in the bath-room, except a day or two previous to what happened—it is not a ladder, but steps, which open with a string from one end to the other, and stand by them<lb/>selves—I think it is six or seven feet high—I saw that ladder the follow<lb/>ing morning, after his lordship's death—it stood in the yard, just outside the glass door of the upper yard, and against the wall—it was not quite so high as the wall—there would be no difficulty, in a person who was at the top of that ladder, putting his foot over to the lead at the top—I do not know whether the prisoner sat in a good many places in the course of that day—the back dining-room was the place I saw him in.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150077"/>
               <p>before he came—I do not know who gave the order for Mr. William Russell to be sent for—I do not know whether it was the prisoner—I do not know who sent—the ostler of Mr. Shenton, a neighbour, went—that was after I saw Courvoisier sitting in the back dining-room—I saw him in the back dining-room before any body was sent for Mr. Wm. Russell—it was a minute or two either way—I do not know who went for the man that went for Mr. Russell—I was very much alarmed and agitated—I hardly knew what I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Would you not as soon have sent the first man you met in the street, as have sent the ostler? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No, we knew the man—he came to the door, and knowing him, somebody asked him to go.</p>

Yes, it is a thin partition—I never examined it—I cannot say whether I could hear him turn in his bed—I could hear him in his room, if he moved a chair or any thing—if he had been walking about in his shoes, and I was awake, I should have heard him—I should hear him cough and blow his nose, if I was awake—I was awake when Manser got up at a quarter before seven o'clock—I heard her go out—it might be about half-past six o'clock when she got out of bed—I had not spoken to her before or after she got out of bed—there was no conversation—I had not spoken to her—I do not recollect her speaking before she went out of the room—she was about a quarter of an hour dressing—she washes up stairs—I cannot recollect whether she washed herself that morning—I cannot say whether she did or not—that was about the time she usually got up—the prisoner used to wash and shave himself below—he sometimes was longer dressing than at other times.</p>

I thought it seemed strange, but he was alarmed, and I thought at the time he did not know what he was saying—he seemed as confused and agitated as the rest of us—there was nothing in his appearance to lead me to suppose more than that he was alarmed and agitated—when Manser came up-stairs after being below, she described to me what she had seen—she did not tell me what she had seen in the folds of the napkin then—I came down and saw them—I saw a gold pencil and tortoiseshell toothpick—I saw them when I first went into the passage—I saw the bundle lying, but did not untie it—I saw the pencil-case and toothpick lying in the folds—that was five or ten minutes before the policemen came—I think Manser was with me at the time—I believe she observed them, and pointed out the things—I cannot positively say whether she spoke about the pencil-case and toothpick in the folds of the napkin, or whether I saw them myself—I cannot say whether she repeated the words, but I saw them there—I cannot tell whether she pointed them out to me, or I to her—I observed the bundle lying in the passage, and the cloak, and the pencil-case and toothpick-case in the folds of the napkin—I recollect seeing them—they might be seen by a person going to the spot without meddling with them at all—I did not see my lord's rings found—I had seen his lordship wear rings—they were much more valuable than my thimble—there is some plate which I believe has not been found—I believe there is a reward offered for some—I know there are silver forks and spoons</p>

I believe it was—the prisoner came to the foot of the bed while I was in the room—he raised his hand, and in<lb/>stantly fell back into an arm-chair—he said, "What shall we do? "—he appeared to be very much distressed at the time—I cannot say how long he remained in the arm-chair, but it was some time—it might be ten minutes, or it might be a quarter of an hour—he constantly kept saying, "What shall we do? "—at the end of ten minutes or a quarter of an hour he rose up from the chair, went to a small table in the room, and began to examine a small dressing-case—he took off the top, and also took out the inner part, and put the inner part into a cupboard, very quickly, by the side of the fire-place—by the inner part I mean a kind of tray which lifts out—it con<lb/>tained several articles—he came back with the dressing-case after shutting the cupboard door, and with his hand he removed the rings, which I saw at the bottom of the dressing-case which was under the tray—I saw four rings—he removed them with his hand at the bottom of the dressing-case—I left the prisoner at that moment—during the time he was moving these things he spoke to me about his place—he said, "I have lived with his lordship only five weeks, and what shall I do for my character? "—I did not make any observation to him on that, to my knowledge—he did not interfere with any other article in the room in my sight—he said such and such things were missing, but I do not know what—he mentioned several things that were missing—I remember his saying rings were missing, and likewise his lordship's watch and pins—I did not go out of the room when I left him—I assisted Mr. Elsgood, who had come before that—he came</p>

                  </hi>I am a surgeon, and reside at No. 14, Upper Brook-street, Grosvenor-square. I was called to the house of the late Lord William Russell on the morning of the 6th of May—I got there about half-past seven o'clock—I went up into the bed-room immediately—I found him in bed—the body was then covered up—the clothes were over the body, as usual with a person lying in bed, and the towel was over the face—I turned the clothes down and removed the towel from his lordship's face—when I had done that I observed the body to be lying on the back, partly on the right side, slightly inclined on the right side—there was some blood on the sheet which was turned over, and on the pil<lb/>low, and also on the towel which was over the face—when I turned the clothes down, and removed the towel, the shirt-collar was wide open, and there was a sort of worsted network comforter, over the chest, drawn up to the chin—I was obliged to divide that comforter before I could see the wound—when I had done that I found the wound extended from the top of the left shoulder round to the part called the trachea—it went round to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150081"/>
               <p>right side of the trachea, dividing the throat—that wound was decidedly sufficient to destroy life, and immediately—at the commencement it was about four or five inches deep, and at the termination, I should say, about three—it was made with one incision, I should say, decidedly, and with very great force, by the parts that were divided—it was a wound that might have been made with a knife or some such instrument—I have not been shown any knives that were down stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Having observed the body, and the situation in which his lordship was lying, and the nature of the wound, in your judgment was it possible he could have inflicted it himself? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Decidedly not—utterly impossible—there was no knife, nor any instrument near his lordship whatever—I had never attended Lord William Russell—I had known him by sight for some time—I examined the body again on the Friday evening, and saw that the ball of the thumb of the right hand was nearly cut off, and there was a small incision below that—when I first uncovered the body the left hand gripped the sheet—it had a firm hold of it—there would be a great gush of blood from such a wound from the artery, to the left—I did not observe any appearance indicating that that had taken place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Was there any thing to show how that could have been prevented? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. There was a pillow at the left side of the bed, down by his lordship's head, which was saturated with blood, which induced me to say that had been used—not the pillow on which he was lying—it was at the corner, lying by his side—the corner down by his head had blood on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. How could that have been used to prevent the gush of blood? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>.

               <p>Russell's house a few minutes past seven o'clock—I saw a female at the door, who let me in—Rose was with me—I was accompanied into the parlour—I asked whether there was any man-servant, seeing the things lying about the parlour—she said, "There is the man-servant, sitting be<lb/>hind the door"—I saw a man sitting behind the door, with his hands up to his face—he had his face from me—I asked why he did not get up and tender us assistance—he did not get up or take his hands from his face—he made me no answer—I asked him after that, why in the world he did not get up and render some assistance, but he did not give any answer the second time—I turned round and said to Rose, "Rose, he must know something about this"—the man made no answer to that—I never received any answer—he was near enough to hear what I said—I remained there, col<lb/>lecting the things off the floor, and putting them together—I then accompanied Rose down into the kitchen, to see if there was any thing gone from there—I did not go into the front kitchen—I went to the back kitchen door, the door leading into the back yard at the very bottom of the house—it was standing open—I examined the door—the prisoner was not with me—I walked out into the area, and I thought there was no break in—I observed there had been marks of violence on the door—I then went into the butler's pantry, and saw a person sitting behind the door with his elbows on his knees, and his hands up to his face—it was apparently the same man at I had seen in the parlour—I told him I thought he had made a devilish pretty mess of it, and said, "You must know all about it"—he did not make me any answer—I never was answered by any one—I theft went and examined the back yard—there it a wall on the left hand side as you go out of the door at the back yard—on the top of the wall, there is a lead flat in the upper yard, the yard which is on a level with the passage which comes to the street door—I got up out of the back yard into the top yard—I got up by putting my foot on the window ledge, and on the door of the water-closet—Rose was with me—when I got into the top yard, I first observed the partition wall between Nos. 14 and 15, on the left hand of the yard—it is a white-washed wall—near the top of it, there is a ledge of slate projecting about two inches or two inches and a half.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Were there any marks on the white-washed wall, showing that any person had climbed up? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Not the least whatever, nor any dust brushed off—the ledge of slate was perfect, not broken—I took the steps and got up to the lead flat—I found the steps standing in the yard by the wall of which I have spoken, leaning against the wall—they were not in a position for a person to go up them at they stood—Rose pulled them out—they were not pulled out before, but standing close together—on getting up the steps I had a good view of the top of the lead flat—there was dust on it—there were no foot marks or any appearance of a person having passed over it at all—nor any finger-marks, for I tried it with my own hands—from the state of the dust a person could not have passed over it in the course of the night without marking it—I could not do it myself—I tried it with my hand to see if it would make a mark, and it did—I afterwards got on it and walked on it, and there were the marks of my feet upon it—I also examined the high wall at the back of the yard—there were no marks whatever on that of any person having got up it—there is a low building on the right hand side—I observed no appearance of a person having got out of the yard or got over there—Rose examined that—there were no marks whatever.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS.</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. What were you doing at the time you were angry with the prisoner for not giving you assistance? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Looking at the things—I did not get any information of what was lost—I asked the females what was lost—I was angry with him for not assisting me—the females said they did not know what was lost—they did not tell me the things that were found in the passage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. So that they gave you but little assistance? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. They did all they could—they did not tell me any thing—I could not have made any mis<lb/>take when I got up on the leads—I did the best of my endeavours to see whether there were any marks, but I could find none—I would not make a mistake intentionally—I could not make a mistake there, because then was plenty of dust—I am not liable to make mistakes intentionally—when I tried with my hands I could see that I could make marks with my finger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. A man doing a thing intentionally is a misrepresentation, not a mis<lb/>take; but without intending it, have you not made a mistake in the course of this very examination at the house? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I do not know that I did—when I first examined the kitchen door I thought somebody had broken in—I found afterwards that there was no break in—I thought there was at first, when I saw the door standing open—I did not think so after I examined the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did not you go down to the kitchen, examine the door, and first think somebody had broken in? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. The door was standing open—it might have been a breaking in I thought, till I examined it—I examined the door when I pulled it to, and could see there was no breaking in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you examine the door and think there was a breaking in at first? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. How could I examine the door when it was open—I examined it as soon as I got outside—I did not think there was a break in after I examined the door—I never said I did—it was from seeing the door open that I thought there was a break in—I laid my hand on the lead to see if I could make marks with my fingers—the dust was not very deep—it had been a fine night the night before—there had been no rain for some time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Tolerable good winds in the beginning of May I believe, were there not? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Certainly there were winds—I should not say the wall is thirty<lb/>five feet high—I never measured it—I do not know how high the white<lb/>washed wall is from the ground—I was there a very few minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Perhaps you did not make much observation? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I did all I could—it might be fifteen or sixteen feet high—I cannot say that it is double that height—it did not appear so, in my opinion—I cannot say how many minutes I was there—it was more than four or five minutes—perhaps a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I call that a few minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Have you heard of any reward being offered in this case? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No, never—I have been a policeman several years—I joined it the first day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Now on the oath you have taken, do not you know that a placard with a reward was sent to every station-house in London? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I never saw it—I never heard it to this day—I do not know what it is to this day—I never heard what the reward was—I never heard of it, or of any reward—I have been in Lord William Russell's house three or four times—I have not talked to my brother policeman about this dreadful transac<lb/>tion—I have seen him several times, but had nothing to say to him—I have not talked to different policemen about the murder—it has been men<lb/>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150085"/>
               <p>tioned—I have not heard my brother policemen conversing about it—not with any parties belonging to the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. I am not asking about parties belonging to the house, but about your own brother policemen; do you mean to tell the jury that you have not over and over again conversed with policemen about the murder? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I have certainly spoken to one or two, but never conversed with any body, not with the parties belonging to the house—I have spoken to people I know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. To policemen? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Of course I have—I cannot say to how many I have spoken to on the subject of the murder—I will not swear I have not spoken to twenty—I will not swear I have spoken to twenty—I might have spoken to twenty, thirty, forty, or a hundred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Why, then, did you fix upon one or two? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I fix upon nothing—I spoke to nobody in no particular manner about it—I asked nobody <hi rend="italic">no</hi>question—no policeman belonging to the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do you mean to persist in saying you never heard of a reward being offered? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I do—I never was told of any reward—I can write my name—I cannot read much, I am not a very good scholar—I can read print in very large letters on placards—I belong to Vine-street station-house, Picca<lb/>dilly—that is the station I have belonged to since the 5th of May—I am there every day—I cannot say how many policemen frequent that station<lb/>house—about 184—it is about three-quarters of a mile from Lord William Russell's house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Now, 184 policemen frequenting the same station-house with you, do you still mean, on your oath, to tell the Jury that you never heard of a reward being offered? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I never was told of it—I never heard of the reward—I do not know what the reward is—I never heard of any re<lb/>ward—I never was offered any thing, nor ever heard of any reward—I did not suppose you asked whether any reward was offered to me—I say I know nothing about any reward—I was never employed in searching for the missing spoons or forks—I never read of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward being offered for them myself—I am a very bad scholar—there was something read out in orders about it, in the general orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. What was read out about it in general orders? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. There was some reward, but I do not recollect it—I cannot tell what the reward was for—I do not recollect the sum of money that was mentioned—it is a thing I do not take notice of, sums of money—I was present when it was read out—I do not know what sum of money was named—I cannot tell how long it is since it was read out to me—it cannot be so long as two months ago—I cannot tell whether it was one month ago, or a week ago—I cannot tell whether it was four days ago, or two days ago—it might be one day ago for any thing I know—I cannot tell whether it was yesterday—I cannot tell you any thing at all about it.</p>

               <p>morning of the 6th of May I was called to the house of the late Lord William Russell, about half-past seven o'clock—I believe I found the coachman or groom at the door, and one or two other persons let me in—they were servants in the neighbourhood, but I have not seen them since—my attention was directed to the door of the area, leading into the passage—there is only one door at the bottom of the house, leading into the back area, I mean the door on the floor even with the kitchen and the butler's pantry, the back door—it was open when I examined it—I saw it was bruised—I saw several bruises when I closed the door after me—they appeared to have been made by a blunt instrument—the door was bruised from the top to the bottom, all the way down in different parts—I also examined the door<lb/>post—that was bruised also in a similar manner—the bruises on the door and door-post did not exactly tally—the door was bruised in one part, and the post in another—I could not tell exactly whether those bruises had been made by force from the inside or outside—the top part, I thought at the time, had been done from the outside, and the bottom part I thought had been done inside, by the bolt at the bottom—that bolt could not be fastened without a good deal of forcing, because it was in a very rusty state, as if it had not been fastened for a considerable time—I exerted myself to see if I could fasten it or not—if it had been fastened the night before, I should think it could not have been in the state I found it—some of the marks of violence were near that bolt—those marks appeared to have been made from the inside, and I had not the slightest doubt about the upper part—when I had done examining the door, I saw the housemaid and cook close by—in consequence of what they said to me, I went as far as the pantry—that is on the same floor as the door, close by—when I went into that pantry I saw the prisoner sitting on a chair behind the pantry-door, between that and the cupboard—Sarah Manser said in his presence, "Oh dear, my lord is murdered! "—I said, "Come along with me, and show me where the body of his lordship is"—I said so to Mantel and to the prisoner—I told both to come—I then went up to his lord<lb/>ship's bed-room with both of them, and the cook followed close after—I believe I went first nearly to the door, and when I asked which room it was, I really cannot say which opened the door—I asked for the door, and one of the three opened it, and we made one entry—on entering the room I found the curtains of the bed partly drawn—two of the shutters were open, of the far and middle windows—the shutter in front, where his lordship laid his face, was nearly closed—that was the shutter of the third window, nearest to the head of the bed—that was nearly closed—I opened that window shutter, and then turned to the bed—I saw the bed was covered over, the bed clothes lying as if the body was covered over, and a napkin over the face—I pulled the napkin off, turned the clothes down, and saw a great quantity of blood in the bed, from his lordship's head down to the middle—the blood was in the bed, and on one pillow, there was some blood, but not much—I took the napkin off his lordship's face—he looked as if he was asleep—his eyes were closed, and the tongue protruded a little way out—just as I was doing this, the prisoner was standing at the foot of the bed, and fell back in a chair, and said, "Oh dear, this is a shocking job, " or "a shocking thing, " (I am not certain which, ) " I shall lose my place and character"—I sent for a surgeon, who came and examined the body—there was a watch-stand standing on a night table, close to the head of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150087"/>
               <p>the bed, between that and the window—there was no watch in it—I also saw a Russia leather little box, and a mahogany box, which I have here, and two note cases—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—here is the watch-stand, the Russia box, the mahogany box, and the note cases—the note cases were lying side by side on the night-table—the Russia case was opened, and the silk note case also as they are now—there was nothing in them—upon finding these things, I asked the prisoner if there was any thing missing, pointing first to the watch-stand—he said, "Yes, " the watch was gone—I asked him if his lordship had any money, much money about him—he took hold of this note case, examined it, and said, "Yes, there was a ₤10 and a ₤5 note in that yesterday in the box"—that is the brown note case with the blue bor<lb/>der—I asked him if there was any thing else missing—he said he did not know, he did not think there was—I proceeded to make further search—there was a book on the floor by the side of the bed, with a pair of spec<lb/>tacles in it—it was on the same side, between the bed and the window—it laid open with the spectacles in it—I asked the prisoner, "How did this book come here? "—he said, "I left his lordship reading that when he went to bed last night"—I searched this Russia, box, and found in it a gold ring, a spectacle-case, and two coins, one is copper (I do not know what the other is) and this old note case, which is a third one—that is all I found in that box, except two or three bits of paper—this mahogany rosewood box contained two tooth-picks and two medallions—I then went to the table between the two windows—between the window in front of his lordship's bed, and the middle window—I found a silver candlestick upon it—I have called it a table, but it is a book-shelf, not a table—it had a top to it, and the books were below—the candle was burnt out with a little snuff in the bottom—I have it here—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—that was standing on the book-shelf, five or six feet from the head of his lord<lb/>ship's bed—a person lying on the bed could See to read by the candle, because it was right in front of the face.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS.</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. I believe after this, the surgeon came and exa<lb/>mined the body? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—I found no instrument by which the wounds could have been inflicted—there was no such thing near the place, I mean not near the bed—there was in the room—it was not within reach of any body in the bed—on the book-shelf, near the candle, I found this Russia case with four ivory <hi rend="italic">rouleaus</hi>for sovereigns in it—I have not examined to see how many sovereigns they would hold—I asked the prisoner if there was any thing missing from there, pointing to the book-shelf altogether, he said, "Really I cannot tell you, but Ellis knows" (Ellis was the late valet, to Lord Russell—he is now with Lord Mansfield) the little Russia box was standing open—the tray was separate from the box—the pri<lb/>soner told me it belonged to the box—on the next table, between the other two windows, I found a pair of boot-hooks, and a gold pin—I looked at it, and the prisoner picked it up, and said his lordship wore that yesterday—I found a quantity of silver articles on the table where the looking-glass stood—in the corner of the room near the last win<lb/>dow—the looking-glass was on the table, a shaving-box, and these silver articles all about the table, as a gentleman's dressing-articles would be—there is a crest on them all, I believe—there was an eye-glass, two razors, and some other things—there was no blood, or the slightest mark on either of those razors to denote that they had committed the act</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150088"/>
               <p>—there were four other razors—I say the same of them—there were half<lb/>a-dozen walking canes in the room, four of which have gold about them—on finding these things I said to the prisoner, "It is a very curious thief to leave all this valuable property behind"—he said, "It certainly is very strange"—I did not ask him any thing after that—I then went to the next table, upon which was a dressing-case, which had been wrenched open—I am now speaking of a little table at the foot of the bed, near the fire-place—this is the dressing case—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it was standing in this way, with the back of it towards the bed—the lid was on it, a little way out of its place—it had been wrenched at the hinges, and I consider that was done after it had been unlocked—it was still locked—the lock remained up—I consider that it was unlocked before it was wrenched, and the hinges after<lb/>wards wrenched, forced back, without any instrument—it appeared to me that the box being locked had been opened with a key, the top thrown back, and the hinges broken, and then locked again afterwards—a bunch of keys were found in the back drawing-room, one of which fits the box—Mr. Weymouth, I believe, has them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. You say you suppose the dressing-case had first been un<lb/>locked, and then the hinges wrenched back—can you give any reason what you form your judgment on? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Because I consider if they broke the front part they would not have wanted to break the back—they are inside hinges—there is no mark at the back of their having been praised.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS.</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Could it be opened from the back without some mark being left? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I think it must have left some mark, but I am only giving my opinion of it—after the prisoner and I had examined that box I said, "Is there any thing missing from here? "—there were five gold rings in that dressing-case, and four glass bottles with silver tops—we were counting them—he was looking at it with me—when I asked if there was any thing missing from there, he said, "Yes, five gold rings, which his lordship wore yesterday"—they were missing—here are four mourning and one gold chased ring—when he spoke of the five rings his lordship wore yesterday, he meant five other rings—he had looked into the dressing case when he gave me that answer—I asked him if there was any thing else missing from there—he said, "I can't tell you, but Ellis can"—from there I went to a cupboard, in the left-hand corner as you enter the room—I there found four silver-mounted tobacco-pipes and an opera-glass—I then examined the wardrobe—I asked the prisoner if there was any thing missing from there—he said, "I don't think there is"—the locks of those places were perfect and uninjured, and the hinges not touched—I found a rushlight-stand with a rushlight in it—about a third of it was burnt—the prisoner told me, when I looked at it, that his lord<lb/>ship always had a rushlight burning at night—I asked him what time his lordship went to bed last night—he said, "About half-past twelve, or a quarter to one o'clock"—there was a key in the bed-room door, inside—I asked the prisoner if his lordship locked the door of a night—he said, "No, he never did"—I do not believe I made any observation on the door—the door opens and shuts very gently—I do not think a person lying in bed could hear it if they were awake, when the carpet is down, it is im<lb/>possible—I went from there to the front drawing-room—there was nothing there worth noticing—I then went to the back drawing-room, which is a room in which there are books—I found the Davenport writing-desk turned round a little, moved a little out of its place, and some papers lying on the ground—the papers inside were in confusion, and appeared dis<lb/>

               <p>turbed—I saw a screw-driver on the chair which his lordship used to sit in to write—I believe Mr. Pearse has it—there was a bunch of keys lying by the side of the Davenport writing-desk—I asked the prisoner if the screw<lb/>driver belonged to the house—he said, "I believe it does"—I asked him, "Did his lordship use it yesterday"—he said, "I am sure I can't tell you, " I then went into the front parlour, or dining-room—I found some drawers in the side-board pulled out, and plate and plated articles lying about on the floor—I said to the prisoner, " Is there any thing missing from here? "—he said, "Some spoons and forks, but I cannot tell you how many at present; " I do not think there were any left—I found a cloak, an opera-glass, and a great many things in the passage—I asked the prisoner if they were his lordship's property—he said, "Yes"—I said, "No thief would ever leave this property behind"—he said, "It is certainly very odd"—I asked him if he had locked the street-door at night when he went to bed—he said, "Yes"—he showed me how—he put up the chain, and locked it, and put the two bolts to—he showed me just as he had left it the night pre<lb/>vious—the upper and bottom bolts bolted—I asked how he found it that morning, and after he had unchained, unlocked, and unbolted it, and put the spring of the lock back on the hook, he said, "As you see it now"—the area door of the front kitchen was undamaged, nothing arises from that—there is a door at the end of the street-door passage which goes into the yard—half of that door is glass—that door was not disturbed or moved in any way—the chain was on it, and it was bolted—it had never been disturbed at all—there is an inside shutter to that✗ door, but it was down—it could be taken down without undoing the fastening of the door—it is an inside shutter, it slips down—it shuts up the glass part—when I saw it, the shutter was not placed against the glass—it was the same as it is kept in the day-time—the glass was unbroken—there was not a mark on that door—the area gate was en<lb/>tire—nothing had happened to that, it was locked—that is the area that leads into the street—there is no gate to the back area—I afterwards went into the pantry and saw a press there, in which were some drawers—those drawers were open—the top one was forced, as if it had been done by a chisel or screw-driver—the lock was sprung, as if it was left locked, and forced open in that state—the articles in the drawers were disturbed—there is a window in the pantry—I asked the prisoner whether the window had been fastened that night, whether the window-shutters had been put to, and whether it was fastened—he said, "I do not think it was, I can't say exactly, I am not certain"—I then went to the back door on the basement story, that was found bruised, as I have stated, very much—the prisoner assisted me to examine that door, and pointed out some marks which I had not seen before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you say any thing to him on the examination of that door? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes, I said, "Some of you in the house have done this deed"—he said, "If they have I hope they will be found out"—I said, "There is not much fear but what they will"—I looked about to see how any body could have broken into the house—I examined this wall (<hi rend="italic">pointing out on the model the wall between Nos</hi>. 14 <hi rend="italic">and</hi>15) but could not see any mark of any one having come down that way—there were some slates near the top of the steps, which I should think must have been disturbed by any<lb/>body descending that wall, but I could not say exactly—I saw Baldwin going up the steps to examine it—I should think no one could have got</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150090"/>
               <p>down that wall without disturbing the slates—there was a quantity of dust on the slates, and that was not disturbed at all—I went up on the leads, but Baldwin and Rose were up there before me—there was a great deal of dust on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Could any person or thing have trampled on that dust without making marks? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I think it impossible—I think a man passing there must have left marks of his feet behind—the weather just before had been dry and windy—if a person got over the opposite wall, that is Sir Howard Elphinston's house—I should think they could not have got into Lord Russell's house that way—I examined that carefully and could see no mark—the other constables had not been there—there is a water-closet—they could not have got to the house without getting on that water-closet, and I should think they could not have got on the water-closet without disturbing it—it was not disturbed at all—there is a deep area on the other side of that wall, much deeper I believe than on this side—I ex<lb/>amined it, I did not measure it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you go with the prisoner into his own bed-room? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes, he showed it me—he took me up stairs—I there found a purse containing a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, and six sovereigns—I gave them up—I asked the prisoner how he got that note—he said, he gave his lordship change for it a day or two ago, and the rest of the money was his own, he had had it some time—he showed me his box which contained his linen—I examined every thing in it as I went along, but saw nothing to tend to explain this case at all—he had the key of the box himself—it was left in the room—I left it with him—he left the box open every day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. What had he on at the time? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. In the morning a sort of round morning jacket, and a clean shirt, apparently a very clean one—the prisoner was from that time, though not in custody, yet under the watch of the police, and the female servants also—care was taken to prevent their having any conference with one another—the prisoner was not debarred or hindered from going to his own room if he pleased—he was taken into custody on Friday, the 8th of May, in the afternoon part—he was not taken out of the house till Sunday night, but there was a constable with him constantly in the room, from Friday till Sunday—he was not exactly in my cus<lb/>tody, but there was a constable with him—he was taken to the station<lb/>house on Sunday night, the 10th, and before the Justices, at Bow<lb/>street, on the Monday—there were several examinations, and he was finally committed—on the evening of the 13th, while he was in custody, application was made for some linen for him—his uncle came to the door, and said his nephew wanted a clean shirt and stockings—I did not see the prisoner afterwards, so as to let him know what his uncle had said or done.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you go up to the box? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Next morn<lb/>ing I went up with sergeant Lovett—I did not send the linen that even<lb/>ing, as I was going to Bow-street myself next morning—I went up with Lovett next morning, took a shirt out, unfolded it, held it up by the col<lb/>lar, and these gloves dropped out of it—(<hi rend="italic">producing a pair slightly stained with blood</hi>)—I first unfolded the shirt on the bed, and shook it,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150091"/>
               <p>and these gloves dropped down into the trunk—they are such gloves as servants wear when in attendance on their masters, white cotton gloves—I had not seen those gloves when I examined the trunk before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Had you examined with sufficient accuracy to tell whether they were there? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I pulled the things out, and laid them on the bed, but I certainly did not examine so accurately as I did then—I had unfolded them, but not shaken them—the gloves dropped down when I shook it—I did not perceive them when I unfolded it—I unfolded the shirt, and did not find them before, and I unfolded it then and did not find them.</p>

I undid it—I unfolded it, as if it was lying on a table or a bed, and then held it up and shook it—I did not find the gloves when I unfolded it, but when I shook it I did—when I first searched we unfolded the shirts on tbe bed—I and Beresford merely unfolded them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Have you one of the shirts here? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—I do not think I have a clean one—the prisoner had all the clean ones.</p>
               <p>~<hi rend="smallCaps">COURT.</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you examine the prisoner's hands, to see if there were any scratches on them? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I did—I noticed them that day, and also on that day when I took the gloves—I first examined his hands on the first day, on the 6th, when I examined his room—I did not see the slightest scratch or mark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS.</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you consider it your duty to examine the trunks of the different persons in the house when you were first apprised of this melancholy transaction? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. They all wished me to do it, both the prisoner and the other servants—I did do it—I examined the prisoner's trunk, to see if there was any weapon or any article with marks of blood on it—I satisfied myself on that subject—I searched as carefully as I pos<lb/>sibly could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Mind the form in which I put this question; when you talk of the morning of the 6th, is this true, that you "found two shirts, which you looked at, and found them free from spots? " <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—there were several shirts—on the 14th I unfolded the shirt which I was about to give for the prisoner's use—I unfolded it in the same way as I did in the first instance as nearly as possible, I think—on the 6th I took out every article in the trunk—I and the prisoner both replaced them—I assisted him—whatever was done by him was done in my presence—the prisoner had access to this room, and several of our men and the women also—there was no speck of blood on any thing that I saw in the trunk on the 6th—there was no mark on the area-door with the glass to it, on the 6th—I examined it for the purpose of seeing whether there were any marks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Now, I ask you, not who may have done it, but are there not a number of marks now on that very door which had none on the 6th? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. There are, and also on the post of that door—they appear to have been made with some kind of instrument—the prisoner was under the in<lb/>spection of the police from the very time of our entering the house—my orders were to keep them separate—that is what I mean—sergeant Pullen was appointed over the prisoner—he is with me at the house now, and Cronin, a constable, who is here—I did not find any weapon in the pri<lb/>soner's trunk on the 6th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. You have been asked about unfolding the linen; did you, either✗ on the 6th, 13th, or 14th, when you went for the shirt, do more than lay it down and unfold it, as you would linen you wanted for yourself? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I have said I shook it—I unfolded it and shook it—on the 6th I only unfolded it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. In that unfolding might a pair of gloves be in the shirt and you not see them? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I cannot say—there might be—when I held it up by the collar, and shook it, every thing that was in it would come out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>, Was the extent of your inspection of the prisoner such as to prevent any body from visiting and speaking to him, or only to prevent the women? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Only to prevent the women—nobody could have any con<lb/>versation with the prisoner but ourselves—it was to prevent any body having conversation with him—that was the inspection under which both he and the females were placed—I was not present when the marks were made on the glass door—I did not see who made them—I know nothing, of my own knowledge, of any being made—I had charge of the premises, that is all.</p>

                  </hi>I am an Inspector of police. I received infor<lb/>mation at the station-house about ten minutes past six o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing of the 6th of May, and went to Lord Russell's house—after looking at the body I went down stairs to the bottom of the house, to a door which leads to the area at the back—I examined that back area door and saw several marks upon it, and also on the door-post—my impression was at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150093"/>
               <p>first, that the marks had been made with the door open entirely—I looked at the marks on the door-post—I could scarcely tell with what instrument they had been made—my impression was then that they had been made from the inside, and with the door open—upon further inspection and examination that opinion was altered—I think the marks were made by inserting some instrument between the door and the door-post—the door and door-post do not close exactly, and some instrument had been inserted—I think the marks were made by a person standing outside the door—they might have been made when the door was bolted and fastened, but I think the door was merely on the latch—I think the instrument could not be inserted sufficiently if the door was bolted—that is merely my opinion—the marks did not appear to have been made with n chisel, but I should say with a hammer—I tried that experiment with a hammer upon the half<lb/>glass door up stairs leading into the yard, and Pearse also tried—when I first went to the house there were no marks on that door, but Pearse afterwards took me to show me the experiment he had made—the marks on the door and door-post of the back area door were not on the same level—the marks on the door were something lower—(<hi rend="italic">part of the door and door-post were here brought into court</hi>)—when I got there the socket of the top bolt was lying on the ground—I examined it, and could see some instrument had been put into the socket—it was a dark instrument, at it had left a black mark—it was such a mark as might be left by a poker—that mark could not have been made when the bolt was shot or fastened—the socket was inside the door—I looked at the lower bolt—the socket of that bolt was not injured—it appeared as if it was slightly sprung, but on more particular examination I do not think it was—it was merely from rust and decay—it is much decayed—the bolt would not act in it—I attempted to bolt it, and it was with the greatest effort I could mote the bolt at all—this is the first rail of the door and the door-post—this is the outside of the door next the yard—these are the marks I allude to—one is below the other—if an instrument had been put in, which it must be to get a purchase, it would be quite impossible to do that without injuring this edge of the door, as the point of the instrument must necessarily fall on the edge of the door, and there is no injury whatever on the edge of the door—there is a mark made, but that is not the means by which the door could be prised open from without—there are a great many marks in the place whore the bolt never met the socket—the door shuts in a rabbet—here is no mark on the edge even opposite all this violence—(<hi rend="italic">the witness pointed out to the Jury the various marts on the door and door-post, to which his evidence refers</hi>)—there are marks of violence on the door-post by the lower bolt—I believe these marks to have been made with a screw-driver or chisel—I am speaking of the marks outside on the door-post opposite the door<lb/>bolt—there are no marks on the door opposite to this to correspond with them, scarcely any violence at all—there is one impression, but nothing to correspond with the violence on the door-post—to make the violence on the door-post the instrument must catch here—the next mark is what I have described, as I suppose being done with a hammer—that mark is about six inches below the handle of the latch outside, and is both on the door and on the door-post, one slightly below the other, that on the door being the lowest—I should say both those marks were done from the outside—I am quite certain they were made at the same time, and when the door was closed, from the experiment I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150094"/>
               <p>tried on the other door—they were certainly not made with sufficient vio<lb/>lence to prise open the door—I am quite satisfied of that—not if the top bolt was bolted—if the latch only were latched, it would be sufficient to resist the violence made, even if unbolted—between that and the top there are five marks of exactly a similar nature, with more or less violence—why I feel certain the latch would resist it, is because I tried the upper door with only the latch, and I could make quite as much violence on that door with the latch only resisting, without any bolt—nearly opposite the top bolt outside there are two marks which I have described—I should say all the marks, except those at the bottom bolt, were made with the same instrument—I have no doubt of it—there is certainly not sufficient violence to the top bolt to have forced the socket off from the outside, if it was bolted—sup<lb/>posing the door to have been prised open from the outside, the bolt could not have forced the socket off in the way in which it appears to have been forced off—there are marks inside the socket which it is impossible the bolt could have made—it could not have been forced from the outside without making considerable violence on the door—the mark is partly destroyed, because the plastered wall comes up to the door, and in taking the door away the impression was partly destroyed—it could not be avoided, but still here is the mark of the impression—when I first saw it the dust had come down upon it, and it was evident that the socket had been taken off from the inside, with the door open, because I shot the bolt and found it would not make the marks here made, because it would not touch them—it would not reach this mark within half an inch—I felt quite certain it could not have been made by the bolt itself—the mark of the instrument appeared to have been recently made, because on the end of the instrument reaching the mortar, it had made an indent there, and the dust was there—it had been made within twenty-four hours, I should say—I believe there are no other marks inside the door-post—here is the socket—I found the door would not shut within a certain distance, and this piece of wood was put on to show the exact distance the door would be open in its natural state—it was nailed on to prevent it going further than it would before—it is in the state it was before—the bolt will not reach this black mark here, nor will it touch any of the marks that appear here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you find the door of the prisoner's chamber open? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. When I went up to search his box, I really will not undertake to say whether it was or not—it was not locked, cer<lb/>tainly, at all events, I should say—I really do not recollect whether it was open—I do not know that there is no lock to the door—I never took that notice—I really do not recollect whether there is a lock to the door or not—I was not in the house when you and Mr. Clarkson went up to that room—I do mean to say that I do not recollect whether there is a lock; I believe there is, but there may not be—if I have any belief, it is in favour that there is a lock, but there may not be—the trunk was not open—while we were searching the bed I ordered the prisoner himself to get the trunk open for my search—I suppose he opened it, but we were taking the clothes off the bed very carefully one by one, and I really cannot tell I did not notice whether the trunk was locked or not—the same search was made of the two female servants as of him—I cannot tell whether the trunk was locked or not—I should say I took about half of the things out before I came to the chisel—I certainly took the things that were at the top of the trunk, off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you go to examine it, or had you any specific object? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. On finding the marks on the door, my impression was that they were not made by a house-breaker, and that no house-breaker had got in, and my wish was to examine all the trunks to find if there was any thing suspi<lb/>cious—I went to the trunk for the purpose of examining its contents—I took them out—I did not undo every article—I do not think I took all the articles quite out, for when I got just to the bottom I believe I turned them from one end of the box to the other—I examined sufficiently to convince myself that there was nothing suspicious to be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS.</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Was there more than one trunk or box examined there? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. There was—I examined a black trunk, or I should better have described it as a portmanteau—the prisoner saw me take the chisel out—he did not make any observation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you open any of the articles? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I think I recollect two shirts—I opened them merely to look at the wristbands—I did not shake them nor turn them out.</p>

                  </hi>I am an inspector of the A division of police. I first went to the house of Lord William Russell on Wednesday, the 6th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150096"/>
               <p>of May—after being up stairs I went to the lower part of the premises—I examined carefully the marks on the door and door-post of the door lead<lb/>ing out into the back area—it was not my opinion that it was done for the purpose of breaking in—I arrived at that conclusion after my exami<lb/>nation—the socket which receives the bottom bolt was on—the upper one was forced off—that appeared to me to have been done by some instrument put into the socket when the door was open, and the instrument wrenched both ways to prise it off—I think that was the case, by the marks on the wood of the door-post—it was on Thursday I more particularly exa<lb/>mined it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Explain what marks satisfied you that it was forced off by an in<lb/>strument put into it? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. The top nail was in the socket, and the other nail was at the bottom of the door outside, and the nail bent—when the door is bolted, the bolt does not come to the wood by half an inch—then is a mark on the wood, and the wood is driven back by some instrument, and it appears very recently done—I found marks at such a distance that the bolt, when shot into the socket, could not reach them—I have no doubt those marks were made at the time the socket was forced off—I found this poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the fire-place in the pantry—it is bent—it was in the same state when I found it as it now appears—such an in<lb/>strument would make similar marks to those of which I have been speak<lb/>ing, on the wood—I found a screw-driver on a shelf in the same pantry—I applied that to some marks on the door, and it corresponded with them—I found this hammer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in a cupboard in the pantry—I fitted this to some marks on the door and door-post, and it corresponded with them, by placing the claws of the hammer between the door and door-post when shut, on the outside—supposing the door to have been bolted inside, the pressure caused by the claws of the hammer would not have been sufficient to force it open—it would not be possible with such an instrument to force that door inwardly, supposing it to be bolted inside—the marks by the upper bolt and socket could not possibly have been made by a person on the outside, supposing the door to have been fastened—I found the bottom socket started from its place, but not off—the bolt was rusted in the socket—I should say it had certainly not been used lately—there were marks of violence by that lower bolt—that violence would not be neces<lb/>sary, supposing the bolt had not been shot—I found some marks near the bolt, which, in my judgment, could not have been made if the lower bolt had been shot—(<hi rend="italic">pointing them out</hi>)—here is a mark on the rabbet, as if an instrument had been put in from the outside between the door and door-post—if the bolt had been shot, that could not have been done—there is a mark on the outside which corresponds with the mark I have alluded to—that mark apparently done by an instrument such as this screw-driver—a person outside could not have made the mark inside in the rabbet—he could have made the mark on the outside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. From all your observation and examination of the door and post, in your judgment did any person break that from the outside or not, to enter the house? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Not to enter—some of the marks were made outside when the door was to, and some of them when the door was open—a breaking into the house could not have taken place by means of that door, not by the marks made—I made some experiments on the half-glass door, on the ground-floor—some were made only last Saturday, and some before—till those experiments were made, that door was uninjured, and unmarked in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150097"/>
               <p>all respects—I made the first mark on it myself with the hammer—I made those experiments to see if such an instrument made such a mark as we discovered on this door, and it appeared to do so—there is a latch on the half-glass door—an experiment was made on that door while it was on the latch—it was made with a hammer, by placing the claw of the hammer be<lb/>tween the door and post, and pressing the handle down—the latch resisted the pressure—it made a similar mark to those on the door below, equally deep—I found this pair of tongs, which I applied to this part of the door of the safe in the pantry, which had been forced open—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—the mark on this appears to have been made with the tongs—it is a black round mark—I also found a chisel in that room—I compared the screw<lb/>driver with some marks on the safe, and there were two marks which ap<lb/>peared to have been made with that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN.</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. On the Thursday did you make any inquiry of the prisoner about any missing property? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—I asked him if he knew what money or property had been taken—he said he had seen a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in a purse a few days ago—I asked him where the plate was kept that was found in the passage—he pointed out a cupboard in the sideboard in the dining-room—1 do not think he mentioned any other things as having been missed—I searched the prisoner's box on Friday—Shaw, a constable, was present, nobody else—I was not there at any time with Tedman when any search was made in his room—there was a portmanteau, a deal box, and five drawers in the room—I turned the things out—I did not find any thing that attracted my attention—I saw the shirts—I cannot say that I opened them—to the best of my recollection I saw two clean shirts—they were in the portmanteau, to the best of my belief—on the same day, Friday, I made a search in the prisoner's pantry—at that time work-people had been brought into the house to open the drains, and make search of that kind—they had taken up the drains—I commenced my search by the side of the fire-place, between the fire-place and the sink—the sink is near the fire-place, under the window—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the plan</hi>)—this is the sink in a recess under the window, just at the corner of the fire-place—I took off a piece of skirting-board which runs from the fire-place to the corner, meeting this piece which forms the angle on to the sink—(<hi rend="italic">producing the two pieces of skirting</hi>)—I took this piece down first—this is the piece that faced me—when I pulled that down I saw the purse which I now produce—it was about two inches in behind this piece of skirting which remained—I perceived that the mortar had been disturbed before I took this piece of skirting away—I found in the purse five gold coins—one was in paper—five gold rings, one a wedding-ring, and a small bit of sealing-wax—(<hi rend="italic">The coins were here produced</hi>)—I then took away this piece of skirting-board which ran under the sink, and found this silver Waterloo medal, and a little further on this ₤10 Bank of Eng<lb/>land note folded up—it had nothing round it—the place from which I took it was quite dry—it was very near the fire-place—the prisoner was in the dining-room at the time I found these things—I went up there directly after finding them—he was, to the best of my knowledge, sitting down when I went into the room, but I saw him standing up—I think constable Collier was with him—there was a constable in the room—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150098"/>
               <p>took the things I had found up with me, took them out of the purse, and laid them openly before him, and laid the note on the table before him—I said, "I have found these things concealed in your pantry, behind the skirting-board"—he said, "I know nothing about them, I am innocent, my conscience is clear, I never saw the medal before"—I took him down into the pantry, and pointed out to him the places from whence I had taken the things—he again said, "I am innocent—I know nothing about them"—he remained in the pantry for some time, and I proceeded in my search while he was there—a water-pipe goes round his pantry, and continues into a scullery adjoining it, into which there is a door from the pantry—one of the workmen was removing the pipe which goes round into the pantry, between the pantry and the door leading into the vault—Collier was on my side, and I heard some one say, "There is a ring"—I saw the workman put up his hand behind the pipe, nearly to the bottom part of it, and take the ring from the pipe, and I took it from him—it was one of the men employed there—this is the ring—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it is a split-ring—I continued the search—a pen-mender was found in a drawer in the pantry—the things I have mentioned were all I found secreted below on the first search—after searching below I went up to the prisoner's bed-room, and there searched his person—I found about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, a small locket, and a small bunch of keys on him—I did not apply any of those keys to any of the drawers or doors in the house—there was a variety of keys of dif<lb/>ferent sorts—the name of Lord William Russell is on one of the rings of the keys—he said the locket was his own—I have no reason to believe to the contrary—I then again went below into the pantry, but found nothing more—other officers were pursuing the search, assisted by work<lb/>men—I saw the hearth-stone taken up the same afternoon or evening, after the split-ring had been discovered—I think the prisoner was not there at the time—I did not myself see any thing found there—the hearth<lb/>stone was very firmly fixed in the ground—I should say it had not been recently removed—I did not perceive any chink or opening between the✗ flooring boards and the hearth-stone—I received this tea-spoon and salt<lb/>spoon from Sarah Manser—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>.)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON.</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. I think I understood you to say that you made some experiment with the door leading into the back<lb/>yard? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—that is the door which is partly glazed—I also made the experiment on the door-post—it was done at the same time—I am the person that did it—I did both at the same time—I did some on Saturday last, and there were marks some time before—I cannot tell the date—it might have been a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Are there any marks either on the door or posts of the door that were not made by yourself? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—I think there is one—that was made in my presence by a man named Craker, a carpenter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Now, for the purpose of pointing out to the jury the result of your judgment of the violence you found on the door before you, you have cut away part of the door, and brought here? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I had formed my opinion—it was not from the result of my experiment alone that I came to my conclusion with reference to this door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did that assist your judgment? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. It confirmed it—the com<lb/>parison of the marks I made on the other door and post confirmed my judgment that a similar instrument would make such a mark—I did not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150099"/>
               <p>think it requisite to bring the other door and post here—I thought what was brought quite sufficient for the jury to form their judgment—I made the experiment to show Craker that a hammer would make such a mark—that was partly the reason why I made the experiment—I certainly applied the instrument in the presence of Craker, just to see that a hammer would make such a mark—it was not with the hammer that is produced to-day that I made the experiment, but a similar one—not the hammer to which I attribute these marks, but a similar one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Why not use the same? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Being fearful it might get out of its place, so that I could not produce it in the state in which I found it, I was fearful I should alter the state of it—I have not the hammer here with which I made the experiment—the glass-door is not here, and I have not brought the hammer—it did not occur to me that I should be asked whe<lb/>ther the hammer was the same or not—if it had, I should have brought it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Were there any experiments besides the one which you have spoken of, made by any body but yourself? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I do not know—Inspector Beres<lb/>ford was there—I did not see any—I saw Craker apply a pair of tongs to the glazed door—I have seen it put to, to compare the marks with the tongs—I never saw the tongs in the Commissioner's hands—I saw a man named Christie, who, I believe, is a builder or carpenter—I do not know that I ever put it into the hands of any person, but several might have seen me do it—no one did it that I recollect but myself—I do not know that any one made the experiment with the tongs besides those I have named—Beresford might have done it—I do not recollect seeing the tongs in his hands—Collier did not have the tongs in his hands in my presence, not to my knowledge—no, Collier had not the tongs—I think I can safely say so—he did not have the tongs in his hands making the experiment in my presence—he stood by and saw me compare them—I have no recollec<lb/>tion at all of ever having seen the tongs in his hands—there was no other instrument used to try any experiment on that door but the tongs and the hammer—I remember some gaping experiments on the door-post at the edge, two or three pieces out at the corner—I believe they were made with the hammer—I must have made them, because I was the only person that applied the hammer—if I saw the door I could tell—I made as many as eight or ten, and I have no doubt I made the marks you allude to, because I applied the hammer—I have every reason to be<lb/>lieve I made those marks—I know I made marks, but whether those are the marks you have seen I do not know—there is a mark on the door, and one on the post—I will not swear I made all the marks on the door and door-post—I will swear I made half of them, and more than that—there is one mark of the tongs which Craker made—there are about twenty marks I should say on the door and door-post—no marks were made with this screw-driver in my presence or to my knowledge—I never saw any marks on the glass-door that had the appearance of having been made with this screw-driver—I think I last noticed that glass-door on Monday—I did not receive any orders from my superiors to make the experiments—I did not ask permission of any body to make those experiments before I made them—they were all made after the last exam<lb/>ination before the justice—they were not made at the suggestion of any body, but at my own—I have not brought that door and post with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you bring the door and post which are here to-day by order of your superiors? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Not by the Commissioners, I proposed it—I had them taken away—the parts of the door cut down—that was done by my orders</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150100"/>
               <p>—I had no instructions from any body to do so—I think Mr. Hobler told me to bring them here—I had told Mr. Hobler that I had applied the hammer to the glass door—I received no directions to bring that door here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Are there marks of violence on any of the wood-work you have pro<lb/>duced which you assume to have been made by a chisel like this? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. There is a mark on a drawer which I saw the first day which such an in<lb/>strument would make—I cannot positively say whether there are any marks on any of the wood produced which have been made by such an instrument as this—there are none here which I can speak to—I think if violence to any extent had been used on mahogany or any other hard wood with an instrument like this, it would show that violence had been used to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Then this chisel, in your judgment, is not in such a state as you would expect if it had been used for any violence? It depends entirely on what force is used—I searched the prisoner's boxes on Friday, the 8th—Constable Shaw was with me—he went up with me—I believe I asked him to go up for the purpose of making the search—I consider that I made the search with every degree of minuteness—there was a black leather portmanteau and a box besides—those were the two articles in which the prisoner's things were—the trunk was not locked—it was shut down—I do not think it was strapped—there is a strap to it—one of the buckles might have been fastened—I do not recollect whether it was strap<lb/>ped or not, but I think not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. What induced you to go up on the 8th to examine the portmanteau and box, they having been examined by Tedman on the 6th? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I went to examine the dirty linen, and the coat, waistcoat, and trowsers' pockets, and to examine the clothes; for no other reason—when I make a search, and see any thing that may strike my attention (I may say a general search) I might go again, and be more minute than I was the first time—I generally make a search with every degree of minuteness—I went to make a minute search—I knew that Tedman had already made a search on the 6th—it was impossible for me to tell whether he made a minute search—I was not there—I had never heard he had made a minute search—nobody suggested to me to make a second search, I swear that—it came into my own head—it was on the 8th, the day I found the property—it was after I had found the property, I mean the concealed property—I saw some clean linen there—I looked at it, and examined it—I might have opened some, but I do not recollect that I opened every article I found—I do not think I did, I do not believe I did—I will not swear it, but it is my opinion that I did not—to the best of my belief, there might have been articles that I did not open—there was such a variety I could not examine every article that came into my hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you not turn out from the box and portmanteau every individual article that was in them? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I took them out with my hand—to the best of my belief I did not unfold the shirts—I do not think I have any recol<lb/>lection of opening the clean shirts—I think there were two clean shirts—I think there was only two—I am not certain that I unfolded them—I have no certain knowledge that I did do it, and to the best of my belief I did not unfold them—I took them out—I took out every thing, and put them on the bed, and left them on the bed—I did not put them back again—I saw the prisoner put them back—I had left the room, came there again, and saw the prisoner placing his things away—I put the shirts on the bed with other things.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Now, will you have the kindness to repeat what you say passed be<lb/>tween you and the prisoner when you say his answer to you was, "I am innocent, I know nothing about them—my conscience is clear? " <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. They are about the exact words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. I want to know what was the act done, or the words said by you, which preceded that observation of his? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I said, "I found this property concealed in your pantry."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. What was the object of your making that observation to him? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I thought it my duty to acquaint him, because I suspected that he had put them there—I thought as an officer I was in duty bound to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. It was not to get a confession from him? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I never tried it—it was not for that purpose—it was for no other reason than I thought it my duty, in that stage, to make the prisoner acquainted with what was found, and where—I naturally expected he would make some reply—it was im<lb/>possible for me to tell what reply I expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do you really mean to tell the Jury, and to pledge your sacred oath to that answer, that in making that display of the things, and telling him that, that you had no object to obtain from him a confession? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I expected he would make a reply—I suspected what he might say might be evidence—it might be for him and it might be against him—what I expected it is impossible for me to know—am I bound to answer the question, what I expected?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT.</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. You can state what passed in your own mind? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I naturally expected he would make some remark, and I considered it my duty to make him acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON.</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. On your oath, did you hope or expect, when you produced the things, and made that statement, that you would obtain from him a confession, or any thing to that effect? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I was anxious, decidedly, to do all I could in the case; but as to being anxious that he should make a confession to me, I was not particularly anxious. I felt an anxiety to arrive further into the state of the business—I am sot aware that the question was an improper one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you do that entirely of your own suggestion? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I suggested it first—Mr. Mayne, the Commissioner, was in the room—he it a Magis<lb/>trate, I believe—I first suggested the producing of the things—I thought it my duty at once to make the prisoner acquainted with what had been found in the pantry—Mr. Mayne coincided with me—Mr. Mayne said, "Take the property up stairs, and let him see it, " to the best of my recol<lb/>lection—Mr. Hobler was present, as well as me and Mr. Mayne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Now attend to this—did you not state this to the prisoner—be care<lb/>ful how you answer—"I have found these things concealed in your pantry; <hi rend="italic">con you know look me in the face? "</hi>—did you make that observation? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes, I made that observation with others—those were the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. On your solemn oath, why did you suppress those words when my friend (Mr. Bodkin) asked you the question, having, as you say, no hope or expectation of obtaining a confession from the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Why I should not mention to the Counsel that I found them concealed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. No—you say you went to the prisoner, and in the discharge of your duty presented the things to him, and said, "I have found this property concealed in your pantry"—why suppress the remaining part of the sen<lb/>tence, "Can you now look me in the face? " <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I had no motive or reason for suppressing it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Will you now swear you did not expect to obtain a confession from him, when you said, "Can you now look me in the face? " <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. It was impossible for me to say what he would say—I did not expect a confession—I have told you over and over my motive—I considered it my duty to do it—I thought it was no other than a proper question to put to him—I used no intimidation—I cannot say whether that might intimidate him or not—it was very likely to do so if he was a guilty man—I do not think the question I put was an intimidation—it might be taken in that light by the Court, but I did not think so—if I had thought so I should not have put the question—There is a reward in this case—I believe it it 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is also 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. offered for the recovery of some plate stolen from his lordship's house—I do not belong to the same station as Baldwin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do you expect to get any of the reward, if the prisoner Is convicted? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Very likely I may—I do expect it, in the course of my duty—if I should say no, I should say false—I have had nothing at all yet, not a farthing from any body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. How long after the reward was offered did you make the discovery in the skirting board? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. The property was found before I was aware there was a reward offered—I found the property on the Friday, and on that evening late, I think twelve o'clock, I called at the station-house, and found there was a reward offered—that was after all the property was found by me—I have not the least notion what share I shall get if there is a conviction—I am not aware that I shall get any if there is not a conviction—the reward is upon conviction—if the prisoner is not convicted there will be no reward—I never thought of a reward at the time I said to the pri<lb/>soner, "Can you now look me in the face? "—if there had been any blood<lb/>stained articles in the prisoner's box, when I examined it on the 8th, I think I should have seen them—I believe I should have seen them, if they had been in the box or the portmanteau—I searched the prisoner's person, and found a locket on him—that locket was never claimed as being his lordship's, not by me—I have no reason to believe it is my lord's locket—I have reason to believe it belongs to the prisoner—I took it from him, because I thought it my duty to take what property he had from him, particularly such an article as that—I did not know at that time that his lordship had lost a locket—I did not see Ellis on the subject of this locket—I never heard Ellis say he thought it was my lord's—he said it Was not—I think I did hear Ellis say he thought it was my lord's, whilst in the room, but not at the time I took it from the prisoner—I think I saw Ellis before I found the locket on the prisoner—I saw him in his lordship's house—I was not aware, till after the locket was found in the prisoner's possession, that there was one missing—that locket was not produced to Lady Sarah Bailey, to my knowledge—I was not present at the time she saw it.</p>

                  </hi>I am a carpenter and builder, and life in the New Cat, Lambeth. On Saturday last, the 13th of June, I went to No. 14, Norfolk-street, and examined this part of the door and door-post—it was shown me by inspector Pearse—I examined it carefully—I saw some marks on the outside of the door, and also on the door-post outside—the marks of violence on the outside, were not, in my judgment, sufficient to have forced the door open if it had been bolted—if forced open from the outside, the marks of violence must certainly have been greater—I ex<lb/>

               <p>amined the socket of the upper bolt—I should say that had been forced off by a poker—by applying my magnifying-glass to it, I could tee that by the grain of the wood—that socket could not have been forced off by the poker, if the poker had been used from the outside, while the door was closed—in my judgment, the poker must have been used after the door was opened—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the poker produced</hi>)—I should say it could have been done by this poker—if it was bolted, they could not get the poker in—I am quite sure it could not have been done by the bolt.</p>

Supposing the bolt to have been shot into the socket, and the door forced open, could the socket have been forced off by the bolt, in the manner it it? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No, I do not think it could, because the poker could not be used—the staple was on too fast for the violence used to force it off—the marks on the door do not appear sufficient—I see no mark inside the door-post where the bolt shuts against—there is plenty of room—the bolt does not go at far into the socket as the mark of the poker extends—I also observe tome marks at the bottom of the door where the bottom bolt is—I looked at the bottom bolt and socket—I should not suppose from the appearance of the bolt that it had been bolted at all, very little, if any—the marks of violence at the bottom of the door near the bolt, were not considerable—part had been made by a screw-driver, and part by a poker—they had been used from the outside, when the door was closed, only on the latch—it could have only been on the latch, because I should say they could not get at it well without—I should have thought the instrument would have cut the door, if it had been dose extent when on the latch—(<hi rend="italic">The witness here pointed out to the Jury the several marks on the door, and door-post</hi>)—here is the mark of a screw-driver—if it bad been used to force it open, it would have marked the edge of the door with it—here it where the poker hat been applied to it—besides the marks at the top and bottom, where the bolts are, there are three or, four little hammer-marks outside the door and post—they do not appear to have been done with sufficient violence to force the staple off—from the whole appearance of this doot, it is my opinion it was not opened with force from without—it must have been opened first before that violence was used—all these impressions were done while it was on the latch, and not boiled—I have teen this part of the cupboard door before, and hare compared the tongs—there is an impression of these tongs.</p>

               <p>left the pantry, and went up stairs to the prisoner with the things—I fol<lb/>lowed him up to the parlour—the prisoner afterwards came down into the pantry—I went on with my search about the place—I saw Mr. Pearse find a split ring—it fell from behind a leaden pipe, which is against the wall—the prisoner continued in the pantry some time while we were searching, three or four hours, I should think—I saw some rings in the possession of Pearse, which he took from behind the skirting—I did not hear the prisoner asked any questions about them—I heard him say he never saw the medal—he said nothing to Pearse about the rings, but he did to me—he was in company with me in the pantry, and I asked him if those were his Lord<lb/>ship's rings which Pearse had found—he said they, were, and his Lordship had worn them yesterday—I asked him where his Lordship had put them when he went to bed—he said, "On the table, in his bed-room"—I asked him if his Lordship had a gold split ring—he said he had, and he used to keep his seals on it—this was not before the split ring had been found—I said to him, "It is a most shocking thing"—he said, "It is, I am inno<lb/>cent of it, but it would not look so bad against me had not the property been found in my pantry"—I said it looked very suspicious—he said, "I shall say nothing, at least, until I hear that the whole truth is told"—he was then taken up stairs and searched—he was then taken into strict custody—next morning I again searched the scullery, adjoining the pantry, along with Shaw, the police-sergeant—I assisted in taking down a plate<lb/>rack, and behind the leaden pipe, which runs close against the wall, and adjoining the plate-rack, I found this seal—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I immediately showed it to Shaw, and marked it—it has a coat-of-arms on it—it was entirely concealed between the pipe and the wall—there was just room for it between the pipe and the wall—I searched another leaden pipe in the scullery, leading to the pantry, and found this signet ring behind it—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it was behind the same pipe as the seal was found behind—the ring was bent with the pressure—it was squeezed down behind the pipe—the ring part was bent down exactly as it is now—it was close to the pipe, so that it could not be seen without feeling there—I was in the pantry on Wednesday, the 13th, when the flooring was taken up—I took the carpenter there—(I had still continued searching the drains and parts, and found nothing)—it it a wooden floor—from under the second board that was removed, which required some force to take up, the plumber pulled a handful of rubbish, among which was this sovereign, (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>, ) which he gave to me, and I marked it—it was close to the door of the pantry into the scullery—on the following morning, Thursday, the 14th, I and Cronin went into the dining-room, and saw Tedman, and in conse<lb/>quence of what he informed us, we went up stairs, and in a portmanteau, in the prisoner's bed-room, I found these two handkerchiefs, one cotton, and one silk, near the top of the portmanteau; and likewise in the same port<lb/>manteau, this shirt-front—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—the handkerchiefs are both marked "B C"—there were a great many other articles of wearing-apparel in the portmanteau—I saw some spots or marks of blood on both the hand<lb/>kerchiefs—there are several spots—they are dirty handkerchiefs—I was present some days before this when that portmanteau was examined—I attended to the examination that was then made of it—I could not swear that I noticed either of these things then—I did not find any shirt any where, that this front would match—the handkerchiefs and front are is precisely✗ the same state as when I found them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. And the prisoner did not upon that tell you he would speak nothing farther to you whatever? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. He did not—I have stated the facts word for word that passed between the prisoner and me—I did not say, "Do you suppose for a moment that a stranger would have come and put these things behind the skirting-board"—nothing of the kind, and the prisoner did not say, "It is very strange"—Cronin was with me when I searched the portmanteau, on the 14th—I believe it was Shaw that I saw search the portmanteau some time before—I will not be certain, but I know it was searched—I am not sure it was not Shaw and Cronin, or Shaw and Staple, I was busy searching another part of the room, and did not pay much attention to it—I assisted in the examination—I could see what was going on—that might be three days before the 14th—it was some time between Saturday and the 14th—Saturday was the 9th—I believe the prisoner was sent to prison on Sunday night, the 10th—I cannot state whether the search was on Sunday, because nothing transpired to bring any thing to my recollection—I helped to search the trunk—we were searching it for several things, as a good deal of property was missing then—I knew the trunk had been searched on the 6th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. And you went to look for spoons and forks, on the 9th? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I went to look for several things—there was no bloody shirt found—I did not know what might be found—the inspector was as likely to overlook a thing, as me—I thought I might find the forks and spoons—it was on the 8th that I knew the box had been searched—I did not know it had been searched on the 6th—it was on the Friday, the day Mr. Pearse found the property that he and Shaw searched it—I never heard of Tedman searching it on the 6th, not up to this instant—I did hear of inspector Pearse and sergeant Shaw searching it on the 8th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. And you went on the 9th, hoping to find a bloody shirt, and forks, and spoons, and some of the missing things? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I do not know about hope—I went to see if I could find any thing—I went to search what I could find, or for any marks of any thing bloody, that is what I went to look for—I suppose it was searched with that same object, on the 8th—I sup<lb/>pose inspector Pearse and sergeant Shaw would not fill the stations they do, if they were not officers of some reputation—I have stated that I found the two handkerchiefs very near the top of the trunk—I did not overlook them—I found them directly—I took up one handkerchief first, and I and Cronin took it to the window—I did not take any thing else to the window before I took the handkerchief, because the rest was linen, and we could see—I did not expect any thing was on it—I took it to see if there was any thing on it—I could not expect about it, I did not know—I took the other to the window in the same way—I searched the whole of the box—it was not locked—the room door was not locked—I did not notice whether there was a lock on it—I had no charge of the trunk—there were a great many police in the house—sergeant Pullen is in the house now—superintendent Baker, and police-constable Humphries, and one or two of the C division—I should think there are eight or ten altogether—I will not swear to one—the handkerchiefs were lying very near the top, no one could search the portmanteau without seeing them, if they had any eyes</p>

               <p>—I found the shirt-front after I found the handkerchiefs—near the middle, a little below, under the handkerchiefs—I should consider a torn shirt-front was a thing that would attract attention—it attracted my attention—I do not see how any one could miss seeing it, I could not, I know—if a person took each article one by one, out of the trunk, I do not think he could have missed seeing it, or the handkerchiefs either, if they had been there—I do not think the prisoner was in the house when I searched the trunk after the 9th—I cannot tell what day it was—I think it was after the Sunday, but I could not say what day it was—I do not think it was on Sunday—I think it was on Monday morning—I believe it was Shaw and Humphries who searched it with me—they searched more particular than I did—I was searching other places—I helped a little—I mean to say I did not search the box minutely myself—I saw them searching—I was searching other places at the same time there, a band-box, and other things—they appeared to me to be minutely searching the box—I ob<lb/>served none of these things on that day—the prisoner was certainly not in the house on the Monday—any body might have access to that room, for what I know—my duty was below stairs—I found the door open—I can<lb/>not tell whether every body might have had access on that morning, for I was not there—I have not brought the trunk here—it is a moderate sized travelling portmanteau—I found it strapped—there was one strap on it—it was buckled—it was not locked, but there was one strap—it was about eleven o'clock on the morning of the 14th, that I went to search it—I can<lb/>not tell whether the other time was on the Monday, or not—I cannot tell what o'clock it was—if I could tell you what o'clock it was, I could tell you the exact day—I think it must have been in the afternoon—I should say it was in the afternoon, after two o'clock—it could not have been many days before the 14th, because Monday would be the 11th—if I knew how many days it was, I could swear to the day—I cannot tell whether it was two days before.</p>

                  </hi>(<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi>158.) I went to Lord William Rus<lb/>sell's house on Wednesday morning, the 6th of May, about half-past seven o'clock, but I did not go into the house till half-past ten—I was outside the door till then—I remained there every day and night until Sa<lb/>turday—I assisted Mr. Pearse in searching the pantry, and saw him pull down two boards of the skirting, and take out a gold-clasp purse—he found it just on the corner inside the skirting-board—I also saw him draw out a ribbon, and attached to it was a Waterloo medal—he took that from behind the second skirting—I next saw him draw out a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I be<lb/>lieve Mr. Pearse took possession of all that property—it was on Friday,</p>

               <p>the 8th, that Mr. Pearse made this search, and found the property, about eleven o'clock in the day, or about twelve or one, as near as I can recollect—on Tuesday, the 12th, I went there again, in the morning, with Mr. Pearse—I had left the house after Saturday night—I had done nothing in the house from Saturday night till Tuesday morning—on the 12th I went into the scullery, leading from the pantry, and examined the flooring, particularly under a small vault attached to the scullery—I passed my hand along the boards composing the flooring of the scullery, and in doing so my finger struck against what I considered to be a ring—it is a very dark small place attached to the scullery—I drew my hand out in the dark—I had no light—I drew it out with some difficulty, and it ap<lb/>peared to me to be part of a watch-key with the pipe and ring broken off—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I went again on the following day, Wednes<lb/>day—I first searched in the pantry, and afterwards up in a yard—there are two yards, one above the other—it was in the upper yard I searched—I went there with Collier for the purpose of raising some stones which appeared loose—after raising the stones I saw a leaden sink encased with wood—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it came from the pantry—I had seen it in the butler's pantry—it was a fixture there, just over the place where Pearse found the property—I saw the sink taken down, and, I believe, it was placed in the yard afterwards—I looked at the sink round the edges—it appeared to me that the lead had been turned up and put down again—not the whole of it, only a small place in front—I turned up the front with an iron chisel which I had in my hand, looked inside, and saw a watch there—I imme<lb/>diately called Collier, who saw me take the watch out—I kept it and sealed it up almost immediately afterwards—I produced it at Bow-street, and have had it ever since in my custody—it was in the same state as it is now, with the glass out of it.</p>

                  </hi>I am at present in the service of the Earl of Mansfield. I was for two years and eight months in the service of the late Lord Wil<lb/>liam Russell—I left I believe on the 1st of April this year—the prisoner succeeded me in my situation—I remained two days there to initiate him into his duties—I am perfectly well acquainted with three out of these five rings—they belonged to Lord William Russell, and it is my firm belief that the other two belonged to him—he was always in the habit of wearing those five rings daily—when his lordship retired to bed, they were usually placed on a small dressing-table in the bed-room, which stood between the two further windows—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the watch</hi>)—I used to wind up Lord Russell's watch for him, on a common average, five days out of the seven—I firmly believe this to be the watch which I was always in the habit of winding up—that I placed at night always in a watch-stand on a little table by the side of his lordship's bed—here is a name inside it, but it appears to me to be the maker's name—I never noticed that his lordship had a watch in which his own name was engraved—this name is engraved on the inside case of the watch—I am perfectly acquainted with this seal, these two watch<lb/>keys, and this signet ring—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—they were all the property of his lordship—this split ring appears to be the same which was always worn to the watch—it is rather broken, but it is a similar ring to what his lordship used—the watch-key also appears to be the same, but a portion of it it gone—his lordship had a chased key of precisely the same pattern—I know that his lordship had a Waterloo medal, but I never examined it, and he had a ribbon attached to it—this Russia leather box was called the cash-box—I know that, and these note cases I can speak positively to—his</p>

               <p>lordship had always foreign gold coins in the cash-box, but I never examined them—it was always evident to me they were not English money—I remember to have seen this miniature in Lord Russell's posses<lb/>sion—it was always in the small cash-box—I never saw it any where else while I was in the service—this gold pencil-case I know perfectly well by marks which I now see on it—that was his lordship's—he was in the habit of carrying it in his pocket every day—this tooth-pick-case appears to me precisely similar to the one always carried by Lord William Russell—they were generally placed on the small table at night, where the rings were placed—this sugar-sifter I am positive to—it was always used by me when in Lord Russell's service, and this dish-cover is the top of a hash dish always used by me in Lord William's service—this cloak appears to be his lordship's evening cloak—it appears precisely the same as when I left his lordship's service—a card is sown in it—I have seen a locket in his lordship's possession—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the one found in the pantry</hi>)—it might have resembled this, but I am not quite positive of it—I never by any chance had much cause to examine it, only if his lordship left it in any part of the house, he desired me to fetch it—I am not at all positive to the locket—it was a similar one.</p>

Every night when his lordship re<lb/>tired to bed—his lordship was never in the habit of reading in bed at all, to my knowledge—I never observed it—the candle, by which his lordship went to bed, was always put out by me when, his lordship retired to bed, and put on the table by the side of the rushlight—I never observed the candle to have been left to burn out in the socket—his lordship was par<lb/>ticularly careful on the subject of fire—he has very often cautioned me—I remember his lordship's returning from a short visit to Richmond—I saw the prisoner several times after that, before I left London—probably two or three times—once I recollect very well the prisoner asking me if I had any recollection of his lordship's having a locket—I told him I had—he then said his lordship had lost the locket while out of town at Rich<lb/>mond—I said I wondered how it could be lost, as his lordship always carried it in the note-case—the prisoner also said he could not account for its being lost, unless it had fallen from the pocket of his lordship's clothes while he Was brushing them—he said his lordship had written, or was going to write, to Mr.Ellis, the proprietor of the hotel at Richmond, concerning the locket—there are only two days in particular that I recollect having con<lb/>versation with the prisoner—one day was shortly after the return from Richmond, and the other the Monday before the murder—I rather think this conversation was a day or two after the return from Richmond—when I left Lord Russell's service, I handed over to the prisoner the plate that was in my care—I had a list of it, which I gave to the Commissioners, I believe—(<hi rend="italic">the plate box was here produced</hi>)—the list is inside this—I examined the contents of the box at the house with my list, before it went to the banking<lb/>house—this is my own list—it is the list by which I checked the plate before I delivered it over to the prisoner—I examined the contents of the chest with this list shortly after this event—four table-spoons, four large forks, four dessert-spoons, and two tea-spoons were then missing—the greater portion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150110"/>
               <p>of the plate was always kept in my own bed-room at the top of the house, in a drawer belonging to a large dressing-table, standing in the valet's room—they were generally deposited there, but not always—I considered it the safest place for them—the plate in ordinary use was kept in a cup<lb/>board in the pantry below—(<hi rend="italic">several articles of plate were here produced by Mr. Cumming</hi>)—to my firm belief these are the articles that were missing from the house, according to my list—they correspond in quan<lb/>tity and size, and they have the crest of Lord Russell on them—the same as I have always seen.</p>

"—I said, "No, I do not"—he said, "I am John, that used to live with you some time, over in the Square"—I recollected him then—he staid a few minutes, and then went away—I believe I asked him if he was in a situation, and he said, "Yes"—I said, "I am very glad of it"—he said, "With a gentleman"—he did not tell me his name—I saw him again, I think it was on the Sunday week after<lb/>wards, or the Sunday fortnight—it was on a Sunday evening—he merely came in and asked me how I was—it was in the evening—he had a paper parcel in his hand—he asked me if I would take care of it till the Tuesday following, and he would call for it—I said, certainly I would, and he left it with me, and went away—I put the parcel in a closet, and locked it up—it is a closet I use generally—I had no notion at that time what the parcel contained—it was a sort of round parcel, tied with a string, and sealed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. About what a clock in the day yesterday was this? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. About four, I think—we have a billiard table in our hotel—it is not much frequented—merely by the gentlemen who board and lodge in the house—there are a few that come—it is not exclusively kept for the guests—any body can go and play that likes—any stranger may come in and play—there are no other games played in the house—not backgammon—it is a peaceful house—the police have not been there at all—no one was ever taken out of it, I think I can swear that—I never heard of it—there was never any gang of suspected persons taken out of our house by the police, nor any person.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. What did you mean by saying you think you could swear it? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Because I am never down in the billiard-room myself, but I never beard any noise—I do not think there is any gambling-house in Leicester-place but ours, and ours is not a gambling house—there are not a great many gambling-houses in Leicester-place that I am aware of—we have lived there two years next September—I never inquired much whether there were gambling-houses there—our house is very much frequented by foreigners—there are generally a good many there—the prisoner went by the name of <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi>in our service—that was the name I gave him—I do not know whether his name was <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi>—I called him so for convenience sake—because it would be easy for us all in the house—I never knew him by any other name—we do not take in English papers at our house—I very seldom read them, I have not time—a few English gentlemen occasionally come to our house—we never take in any but French newspapers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Have you not had for the last five weeks heard continual conversations about this dreadful event, the murder of Lord William Russell? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No—I am never among the gentlemen down stairs, who have conversations—I have a husband, but he is in France—he has only been gone a fortnight—he is the master of the hotel, that is all—I have not heard my husband speak of the murder, to my knowledge—if he has I have forgotten it, but I do not think he has mentioned the subject to me—I do not walk in the streets on Sundays—I go to church sometimes—I have not observed the pla<lb/>cards of the Sunday newspapers—I have never seen posted up in large letters, "The Murder of Lord William Russell, " nor heard the confessions of the prisoner cried about the street—I think I heard of the murder the day after it was committed—I was certainly very much shocked—I do not know that I said any thing to my husband about it—it might have been named, I cannot recollect whether we did or did not speak of it—I have not time to think of these sort of things—I am always occupied—my husband and I very seldom dine together—we breakfast together some<lb/>times—I do not know whether it was my occupations that prevented</p>

No—the police have never to my knowledge broken in and taken any one out—it has never happened while we have lived there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Respecting your conversation with your husband, do you, like other women, converse with your husband on things that pass, and think no more of it after it is over? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes.</p>

No—parcels are sometimes left in our care, at the counter down stairs—I put the parcel in question in my closet, and locked it up—I never moved it out—it was put at the bottom—the closet is in the first floor—the billiard-room has no connexion or communication with that—the billiard-room is on the parlour floor—whoever comes to play at billiards have no business up stairs—there is no backgammon table in our house.</p>

                  </hi>On the 4th of June, I was going past the Peacock pub<lb/>lic-house, from half-past ten o'clock to eleven—I heard a noise in the skittle-ground, and went in—the prisoner was fighting with my brother, Henry Potter—Hocket struck me on my left eye, because I was parting my brother from the prisoner—I went into the tap-room, and heard Stapler call out—I came into the passage, and saw the prisoner being brought out pinioned by the arms by Banham—I perceived something extended from the bottom part of the prisoner's right hand—he was taken out into the street—I then saw Stapler come into the passage with his hand up to his left eye, which was bleeding profusely.</p>

That I would not have any words with any of the party—my coat was out in the ground—I did not go into the room to pull my coat off—I went out into the yard again to strike the person who had struck me—two or three blows passed between us—I had been in a bit of a scuffle—I put my coat in the tap room, and then I came into the passage to go into the yard again—I did not go along the passage, there was not room—I was going to see how they got on, and as I waited in the passage I saw the prisoner, and immediately after that I saw Mr. Stapler going towards the front door out of the house—I was not quite sober—I knew what I was about—I had been to the Three Cranes public-house at Hackney—I was not accused of breaking a glass that evening—there was one broken by a man named Holland, who was in my company—the publican did not order us all out—we quitted the house in a few minutes—I then went to the Black Boy public-house in Well-street to have a bottle of ginger-beer—I then went to the Peacock public-house—I did not drink there—I am grave-digger of the parish—I struck the prisoner's father once.</p>

                  </hi>I live at Homerton. I am a member of the College of Surgeons at Edinburgh, and Apothecaries' Hall. On the 4th of June I was called to the Peacock public-house about eleven o'clock at night—Mr. Stapler was bathing his left-eye—I found the lower eye-lid was cut, and the integuments and the upper part of the eye very much swollen—the pupil was very much dilated, and quite insensible to light—it appeared to have bled a great deal—I directed him to come to my sur<lb/>gery, and there I dressed his eye—he has been under my care ever since—I have no doubt but that he has lost the sight of his eye for life—I attri<lb/>bute that more to the blow than to the cut—I saw a slight scar above the brow of the same eye—the wound on the lower eye-lid was in my judg<lb/>ment occasioned by a knife or some sharp instrument—I have seen the same sort of cuts occasioned by falling against some sharp instrument or against the edge of a chair—I do not think such a cut would be occasioned by a fist or by the feet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. What was the depth of it? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. It might be about a quarter of an inch or deeper at the upper part—I have seen clean cuts made with the fist on the cheek, but not on the eye, because the parts about the eye are more protected—I thought at one time that the eye-ball had been penetrated by the knife, but I find it had not—the eye exhibited marks of having received a blow from some such thing as a fist, and a very heavy blow it must have been—it is barely possible that this cut might have been inflicted by the nail of the man's thumb.</p>

                  </hi>I am a police-inspector. About one o'clock on Mon<lb/>day morning, the 18th of May, I was going my round, and was called by Stephen Keen, the landlord of the Prince's Head public-house, Battersea—I found the prisoner there—he was not sober—he was partly undressed—he had his coat off—I was called in in consequence of his refusing to go to bed—he said he would neither leave the house nor go to bed—he had taken a lodging there—the landlord was afraid to go to bed, and to leave him rambling about the house—after I got him up stairs, circumstances arose which excited my suspicion, and I searched him—I found on him this purse with four duplicates and the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and three other purses; one was empty, one with eleven duplicates in it, one with a seven-shilling piece and half-a-crown in it, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver loose in his pocket, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper in the same pocket—I found two pencil-cases, a penknife, a pair of tweezers, a split ring on which was appended a small gold seal with a cornelian stone and two metal keys—I also found a bunch of keys, a com<lb/>mon metal seal, two old foreign coins, a woman's pocket, and, in his hat, a new stock of figured silk, a pair of slippers, a pair of gloves, two odd stockings, and a neck-handkerchief with two stiffeners in it—in lifting his coat off the ground I found this tablecloth (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) folded along under<lb/>neath between the coat and the floor—I asked whose cloth it was—he said it was his wife's—I asked what mark was on it—he said he did not know, be thought it was the mark of some of his wife's friends, and he had brought it away from home unknown to her—I sent him to the station-house—at the station-house I searched him further—I found, concealed between his draw<lb/>ers and his skin, inside the right thigh, two tablecloths, and one in the inner part of his left thigh—I told him I should detain him on my own respon<lb/>sibility till I made inquiries—he then asked for pen, ink, and paper—I cautioned him that he must be very careful, he was not compelled to write any thing, nor to say any thing; if he chose to make a voluntary state<lb/>ment I should assuredly make use of it—I said I had no doubt, without assistance from him, I could find out who these things belonged to—he then, in my presence, wrote this letter, addressed to Mr. Clarkson, Wands<lb/>worth—I called on Mr. Clarkson about half-past five o'clock—he came with me to the station-house, and identified these tablecloths, and recog<lb/>nised the prisoner as having slept there on the Saturday night—the pri<lb/>soner was present when he did that, and shook hands with Mr. Clarkson—I afterwards took the bunch of keys I found, and among the rest I found one which locked and unlocked the drawer in which Mr. Clarkson stated these tablecloths had been put, in his bed-room—Mr. Clarkson was by when I tried it, I showed the note to Mr. Clarkson.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>)—"To Mr. Clarkson, Wandsworth. My dear Sir, You will, no doubt, feel shocked to find I have been your enemy instead of your friend, when you see this letter, and will be surprised to think that I</p>

                  </hi>I am a constable in the service of the London Dock Company. In consequence of instructions I had received, I was watching on the 9th of June with two other officers in the docks, near a privy at the back of the south warehouses—I could see who came in and out of the privy, without being seen myself—about twelve o'clock in the day I saw the prisoner Jones come to the privy door, and go in—he came out again immediately, went to a dust heap close by, picked up a piece of printed paper, and seemed reading it—in about five minutes a man, having the appearance of a butcher's man, came out of the privy—Jones did not return to the privy then, but remained at the heap about five minutes longer—he appeared to be looking at the paper, and frequently looking towards the brandy vault, and also towards the South-quay—I then saw him look towards the brandy-vault, and make a motion with his hands to his head, and go into the privy—in about half a minute Dale followed him—he is a labourer in the company's employ, and was em<lb/>ployed in the brandy-vault at that time—when Jones first came to the privy, he came from the direction of the brandy-vault—Dale remained in the privy about a minute—he was not there long enough to have per<lb/>formed any office of nature—when he came out, Rudkins the constable</p>

               <p>seized him—I went into the privy, and saw Jones standing with his back to one of the seats, buttoning up his trowsers—there are five seats in that privy—I laid hold of him, and said, "You are my prisoner"—I searched him, and found concealed in the seat of his trowsers, and fas<lb/>tened round his body with a string, this India-rubber bag, containing seven pints of French brandy—I asked him where he got it from—he said he had found it in the privy, lying under a piece of old sack—I observed that there was not a piece of old sack there—the prisoners were both takes to the station-house—I asked Dale what he was doing in the privy—he said he went there to ease himself—I said, "Then were you <hi rend="italic">taken short? "</hi>—he said, "Yes"—I said, "And yet you passed two privies to go there, and there is one alongside the vault at which you work, and you know that" he made no answer—he had passed two privies before he came to this out—I then went to the brandy-vault, to the gang where Dale was working—I found a bottle of brandy near where I understand Dale had been working—I had not seen him there myself—I also found a valinch or syphon wet with brandy.</p>

There are—I believe there were eight labourers in the brandy-vault that day, but more than that have admission—the privy Dale went to is about three hundred yards from the brandy-vault—it is between the south quay and the brandy-vault—Jones looked first one way, and then the other—I cannot tell why he looked towards the south quay.</p>

                  </hi>I was on duty with Clements on the 9th of Jane, and a little after twelve o'clock saw Dale on the brandy-quay, which joins the brandy-vault—I saw him come towards the bridge which leads to the south-quay—he walked to the back of the south warehouses, and I fol<lb/>lowed him, and saw him go into the privy—he had passed two privies be<lb/>fore he got there—he remained there about a minute—I stopped him when he came out, and asked where he worked—he said, "In the brandy<lb/>vault"—I asked what business he had at that privy—he gave no answer—I searched him, but found nothing on him—he was in a working dress—this bag might very well have been concealed about his dress.</p>

                  </hi>I am a cooper of the brandy-vault. I examined two puncheons of brandy on Wednesday morning, the 10th of June, to see if they were of the same description at that found in the bag—I found the bungs had been forced out and stuck in again—one appears to be the same colour and the same quality of spirit, but not the same strength; but every time spirit is turned from one thing into another, the strength enapo<lb/>rates—going into this bag would alter it materially—Clements told me what was done with the brandy—I think what he says has been done with it would account for the deficiency in strength—in other respects the brandy is precisely similar—two gallons Were missing from one cask.</p>

On the 19th of May last in the morning I was on duty at the branch office at Chelsea—the prisoner was there sorting letters, separating them to different divisions—he is a carrier to one of the divisions as well as a sorter—his division is Chelsea—some<lb/>thing struck me while he was sorting his letters, in consequence of which I watched him and observed him take a letter from a bundle which was before him, and put it into the left-hand breastpocket of his coat—I mentioned it to the charge-taker, Mr. Vorley—I went out into the street—the prisoner came to the door—I beckoned him, and asked him if he bad not got a letter that did not belong to him—he said he had not—I asked him a second time, and he then said he had not—I then asked him to let me look in his breast coat pocket—upon this he pulled out come letters himself, amongst them was one which did not belong to his walk—it was directed to "Mrs. Sha<lb/>lor, 45, Arthur-street, Chelsea"—I told him he had no business with it, and it did not belong to him—I felt money in it.</p>

                  </hi>I am charge-taker of the Chelsea division of the Post-office. On the 19th of May I received a communication from Blackall, and I observed the prisoner to leave the office shortly after—I then went out, and saw him in the street—I believe he had just left Blackall—I said, "Reed, I think yon have a letter in your possession which don't belong to you"—he said he had not—I said he bad, and he had better give it up to me, and he took the letter out of his breast-pocket—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I only saw this one—I looked at the direction, and also at the hour stamped on it—I said, "Reed, how could you think of taking a letter that did not belong to you? "—he said if I would not report him he would not do it again—I wrote to the Post-office, and he was taken that day, but not at that time—my impression was, that I could not act in this case without instructions—this letter was not within his delivery—it might have come into his possession in sorting.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday the 12th of May, at Roastan, a small village eight miles from Edinburgh—I charged him with robbing Mr. Gardner, of Great Wild-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, London—on commencing to search him I saw him take from his pocket a gold stud, which he handed to my assistant, who handed it to me immediately—I did not tell him it would be better for him if he would confess what he had done, or worse if he did not—I asked him how he committed the robbery—he said the boy who lodged along with him, of the name of Gilbert, stole the key of the cellar—he said he had lived at Mr. Gardner's, in London—he said he had observed Mr. Gardner putting money into a drawer of a chest of drawers, in the back-parlour, and they both agreed to break open that drawer, and carry off the property, and that Gilbert stole the key of the cellar, underneath Mr. Gardner's shop—they entered the cellar, and there is a hatchway from the cellar to the shop, and that he held Gilbert on his shoulder up the hatchway to the shop, and that he himself had considerable difficulty in getting up; that they lighted the candle in the shop from lucifer-matches, which they had procured, looked round the</p>

Bank of England note, and the two gold studs; that they placed the pocket<lb/>book in the fire-place, came out of the room, locked the door, and pushed the key underneath the door—I only got one stud from him—he said he had lost the other—another gold stud was delivered to me by Gilbert's father—they are both here—the prisoner is a Scotch lad—I carried him the same night before the Magistrate, he was committed, and detained till an officer came from Bow-street for him—this is the stud I received from my assistant.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. That was the cause of your making out this tale? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do umbrella-makers generally keep such things? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No; but I formerly kept an old-iron shop, and I suppose you thought I might have such things—you did not want to purchase them, but to borrow them—I could not say whether you were serious or joking—I passed it myself y a joke, but I cannot say what your intention was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. If you had not seen your name mentioned in the newspaper, should you have thought of coming to give evidence? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. You are the last per<lb/>son in the world I should have come against, or thought of coming against, or seeing in the situation in which you are placed—I said I was sorry to see you as you were, because you seemed to be so poor, and when you were in the public-house you always had a shilling in your pocket—you told me you had no money—I believe you said so after I said I was sorry to see you as you were, but I will not be positive.</p>

On Monday, the 16th of March, I went to fetch my husband home from the Rainbow public<lb/>house—I found him in the tap-room—Gould was there—we all came out to<lb/>gether about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock—I noticed something in the prisoner's pocket, it was long and it stuck out—we parted from the prisoner about three minutes after we got out of the house—I and my husband went home—I saw the prisoner go away, he went towards Mr. Temple<lb/>man's—no one went along with him; he went alone—what I observed in the prisoner's pocket was larger than a rushlight; it appeared long—the cost pocket stuck out a good deal on one side.</p>

               <p>was sober—he would not have to pass through my room to get to his—he would have to open my front door, and exactly at the same time as he opened the front door, he would open his own door—it was quite light, so that I saw him pass from one door to the other—the front door opens im<lb/>mediately opposite to where I was sleeping—he merely bad to pass the corner of our room—he had to come into it—he got up next morning about the same time as the morning before, between seven and nine o'clock—when he came out of his bed-room, be came right across our room, and went out at the door leading to the wash-house—I and my wife were sit<lb/>ting at breakfast in the same room as we sleep in—there is a privy which you can go through the wash-house to go to, or there is a way round without going into the wash-house—you can get to it without coming through the house, by coming up the garden, and going round the house—the privy is in the same wall as the wash-house is—a person outside the house could get to it without having to get over any fence or wall—I have half an acre of garden, and the house stands in the centre—it is not en<lb/>closed in any particular way—part is fenced, and part not—you can get to the privy from the garden without coming into the house, or getting over any fence or wall—no stranger has a right to come into my garden—I am confident the prisoner went into the privy when he went into the wash-house, because I beard him lift up the latch of the door—I heard the latch of the privy door close, so I am confident be either opened or shut it, I cannot tell which—I do not recollect whether my wife went into the wash-house while he was there—I saw him come out of the place again—he had been there between twenty minutes and half-an-hour—he had on a pair of heavy nailed shoes, which I had made, and when he came out of the wash-house they were blacked, and shined—he frequently cleaned his shoes of a morning—he left the house immediately he came out of the wash-house—he passed through the house, bid us good morning, and went out—I saw him again between seven and eight o'clock that same evening at my house—I had been out to fetch a pint of porter for supper, and when I came home I found him sitting in my place—my wife was there with him—I had at that time heard of the murder of Mr. Templeman—my cottage is between 300 and 500 yards from Mr. Templeman's—when I came in, my wife was holding conversation with the prisoner respecting the murder—I sat down, and did not interfere with the conversation, till Richard turned round, and said, did not I suppose that Mr. Templeman bad done it himself? —I said, "Richard, it is not very likely that after his hands were tied, and his head bound up, that he had committed suicide; it did not look feasible"—I do not remember that he made any reply to that—my wife still continued conversing with him—whilst I was sitting, having some supper, Richard said he should like something to eat, and he asked me if I would go and fetch him a slice of bacon, and a pot of beer, and some to<lb/>bacco—I said, "Richard, why not fetch it yourself"—he said, "You know the reason why I do not wish to go out"—I knew no reason why he did not wish to go out, otherwise than there was an assault warrant out against him—I went and bought the bacon, beer, and tobacco for him—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for them—he did not take any more money out of his pocket—I no<lb/>ticed that he had a pair of new shoes on, and while I was looking at them, he said he had been over to his aunt's at Clapham, or somewhere in that neigh<lb/>bourhood, I cannot exactly be certain where, he had been very fortunate—he had called on his cousin who had a pair of shoes which fitted him,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. Have you never said it was two years ago since you saw the lantern? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I never swore so—I do not recollect saying so—I said I had it to go and look at the sow—the pig-stye and the house are all attached together—it is all one brick wall—the privy and pig-stye is all one build<lb/>ing, and all attached, but you must go out of the house to go to the pig-stye—I have been frequently in the habit of putting different lumber and garden tools over the wash-house ceiling, but for the last month or two, I had not had power to lift my hand so high—I did sot keep my garden tools there last winter—I could not put them there—I did not cause any body else to put them there—after I used the lantern I placed it in the cupboard—I am confident I put it there, but after using it for the pigs I used it in the wash-house, and in the course of that week I used it four or five times, and then my wife put it either in the cupboard or the box—she can speak more clearly where it was—you washed every morning, but did not clean your shoes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Have you not been often troubled by persons crossing your garden, both after you have been in bed, and in the day time? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Sometimes there have been people gone across my garden, and I have noticed it, but I was not troubled with any body, because I did not see them—I have had occasion to go out to stop them from crossing the garden, but I do not term that trouble—I only did it as a friendly action—I have not been frequently robbed of little things by my neighbours' children—I have lost things twice since I have been there, but I always found them again—I have used the lantern so often I can almost swear it is my father's lantern—I never carried one when I was in the police—I used only to lock up prisoners that were in the watch-house when I helped my father.</p>

The prisoner slept at our house seven or eight nights before this occurred—I have known him for twelve months—on Saturday, the 14th, he slept there—on Sunday, the 15th, he complained of being ill, and he went to bed in the afternoon—when he got up he asked for a little tea, and he gave my little boy 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to fetch him some tea and sugar—he had some bread and butter with me, and with the tea and sugar, that came to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was all expended—he said he had taken 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. since he had been out—he slept at our house on Sunday night, and did not get up on Monday morning till half-past eight o'clock, when Mrs. Jarvis called him up—she is the wife of a man living in a cottage in the neighbourhood—she had called at my house for him three or four times—I do not know where he generally breakfasted—he went out about a quarter of an hour after she called him—I did not see him after at all that day—I was in bed very early that night, by eight o'clock—I slept till the prisoner came home, and awoke me—I had an infant weaning—I expected him home early, and had left my door ajar, as I thought I should awake my baby, by getting out of bed—he pushed the door, which awoke me—it was two o'clock, as near as I can guess—I did not hear the clock strike about that time, but he awoke me and my baby, and I did not go to sleep any more—I had to get up with my child—it was day-light very soon after he came in—I did not hear any clock strike soon after he came in—I judged the time by the light—when he came in I said, "It is morning, Richard, " and he said, "It is early"—he then went into his own room—I got up next morning about six o'clock—I had my fire lighted before six o'clock—he did not get up till half-past seven o'clock—when he got up he went through our room into the wash-house—we live in the same room as we sleep in—a door opens out of the wash-house into the privy—I heard him open that door into the privy—I am quite sure I heard the noise—I went into the wash<lb/>house about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after, and found him standing by a table, doing something to his trowsere—I did not pay attention whether the door into the privy was open or shut—I came out directly—he remained there about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour after I went in—he then came out, and asked me for a towel—I gave him one—he had washed himself, and wanted the towel—he merely said, "What time is it? "—I did not answer him, for he said, "The clock is striking eight"—I heard the clock striking just as he asked the question—he left the house directly—I saw him again, about a quarter after seven o'clock the same evening—I bad heard of the murder and robbery of Mr. Templeman about twelve o'clock in the day—when he returned in the evening, I said, "Richard, I am glad you are come home, as I should not have left my door open for you any more, " in consequence, I told him, of the murder and robbery which had oc<lb/>curred so near us—he made answer, and said, "I expected as much"—I did not mention the person who was murdered, at that moment, I did di<lb/>rectly after—he said, "I have just heard something about it, but I do not know any particulars, " as he had called in at the Rainbow public-house as he came along—my husband had gone out, and he came in about that time—when the prisoner said he had just heard of it, I asked him where be had been that he had not heard of it before—I believe he then walked through the house, and went into the wash-house to the privy—as soon as he came back, he said he had been to his aunt's, and asked my husband</p>

               <p>to fetch him some beer, and a rasher of bacon, and some tobacco—he did not say where his aunt lived—he had represented that he had an aunt, but I had never seen her—he gave my husband 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for the beer and bacon, and when he gave it to him, I fancied I heard more money in his pocket—he told me he had been to see his aunt, and she had given him tome money—I noticed that he had a pair of new shoes on—he told me he had called on his cousin, who had a pair of shoes too large for him, and had given them to him—we proceeded to have supper—while at sapper some conversation took place respecting the murder of Mr. Templeman—I asked him where he had been the night before—he told me he had been playing at skittles at the Rainbow—I made answer that he could not have been playing at skittles till that time of morning, and he said he had been gossipping after he came from the Rainbow—he did not say with whom—he went to bed very soon after—the moment he went in, my hus<lb/>band went and bolted the door of his room on the outside—he made an observation to me when he bolted the door—about an hour and a half after he was bolted in the police came and took him into custody—I was in his room on the Monday, and noticed a pair of stockings lying on the box, dirty—they were rolled up the same as a clean pair of stockings—I merely took them up to see what stockings they were, and laid them down again—I did not undo them at all—I looked at them, because it was an unusual thing to have any of his clothing in the house—he never left any thing in the house, and I looked to see what it was—I am quite tore there was more than than one stocking there—they were rolled up so that I could only see one stocking, folded op as clean white stockings usually are—I had washed for him some months before—latterly, I be<lb/>lieve, Mrs. Jarvis washed for him—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a stocking</hi>)—this is a cotton stocking, and this is the stocking which was folded outside—it laid in this direction—I took hold of it, to see what it was, and laid it down again—this is exactly the same sort of stocking, the same make of stocking, and I judged, when I saw it, that it was Richard's stocking—(<hi rend="italic">looking at another stocking</hi>)—this is not the fellow-stocking to the other—they are two odd ones—they are both cotton—when I washed for him, through getting wet in his feet one day, he put on one fresh stocking, and so they got mismatched—they continued to be washed as a pair afterwards, though they were odd ones, the whole time he was with me—the first stock<lb/>ing I have looked at, was shown to me on the Wednesday by a policeman—at that time it contained money—I was afterwards shown where it was taken from—I had never put any money or property of that sort in that place, nor did I ever know of its being there—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the lantern</hi>)—I remember that my husband had such a lantern as this in the house—it may be twelve or eighteen months, or longer, since I saw it—my hus<lb/>band used it about two years ago, to go to the sow when she pigged, and I have some recollection of putting it into a cupboard or box, I do not know which—I know I put it away—the cupboard and box were both in the wash-house—the box was not removed to ray knowledge for a length of time—it was never in the room the prisoner slept in—it was never moved out of the wash-house, that I remember—my box was in the pri<lb/>soner's room—that is a rubbish box—it was not in that box I put it—it was in the wash-house—I have some recollection of putting it away my<lb/>self—I cannot positively say—I never burnt a rushlight in it, when it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150180"/>
               <p>was used—during the time the prisoner slept at our house, I never knew him have a light—if I offered him a candle he would not have it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. What sort of a night was this? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Very moonlight, very light—I have stated it was about two o'clock when you came home—I judge so because my baby awoke me, and I was awake the remainder of the night, and did not go to sleep any more—I was out of bed three or four times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. If you had been awake, could not you have heard the clock strike? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I might not be attending—there is no fastening to your bed-room win<lb/>dow—I could not have got out of it myself without difficulty—I do not know whether you could have got out of it—I do not know how high the window is from the ground—you can stand in the room and look out of it—you cannot reach to the top of the window, you can to the centre—I remember taking the lantern off the table and putting it away after my husband used it—we have never had any one lodging in our house since we had the lantern, but you and Wright—I cannot say whether you were in the habit of going to my boxes or cupboards, you were often in the house, you could go to them if you liked—I have not washed for you since you went to the Barnsbury Castle public-house, that was about six weeks before Christmas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. You say that is like the stocking you saw on the box, is there any nark on it which causes you to think so? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. It is exactly the same kind of stocking, and here is the mark round the top, and the appearance of the stocking altogether—I looked at it, and when I saw it next morning, I saw it was exactly the same stocking—I have not found any stockings in my room myself—I have never seen any found in a bedstead since, nor have I heard of it—you were poorly when you came home on Sunday—you told me you had been drinking some beer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Was it not the custom for me, all the time I lodged with you, to go regularly every Sunday morning to collect what money I had due to me by weekly instalments? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Not since you left the Barnsbury Castle—you owed me about ₤1 or ₤2, at this time, but I have never cast it up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Now tell the truth, if you had known that I had money in my pos<lb/>session, would you not have thought me unprincipled not to pay you? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. You have had money and offered to pay me, and I have said, "If you are short, you had better let it alone"—I have said so in many instances, and I never expected you would pay me, being out of employment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. How could I be without money when I offered it you? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. You have had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or so, and said, "I will pay for my tea, " and I have said, "Never mind"—you have said, "I have a trifle, " and I have said, "Never mind"—I knew you were in distress, and did not wish to trouble you—we have one door into the garden, and one into the wash-house—we cannot fasten the outer door, nor do I want—it is off the hinges—I have footed stockings for you when I washed for you—I have no recollection whatever of mending this one—you had two pairs when I washed for you a month before Christmas—I had mended them for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do you suppose two pairs of white cotton stockings in constant use would last me that time, and be as good as these? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I can't say whe<lb/>ther you wore them all the time or not—I know nothing about your re<lb/>placing those stockings.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150181"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Have you ever known me out for improper motives, or any thing unlawful? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I do not know what you were out for—I am not obliged to give you a character—I know nothing of your conduct out of my house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN.</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Have you ever had any quarrel or difference with him? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Never in my life—I was not present when the stocking was found; I was in the room when the policeman brought it in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. Have not I purchased shoes of your husband? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. You had one pair of me.</p>

                  </hi>(<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi>. 131.) I was on duty on the 17th of March, at Islington—I came on duty at nine o'clock in the morning—I received information at half-past eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and went to Mr. Templeman's cottage, the door was closed—I got in by the sitting-room window—it was about a third open—I found the sitting-room in a confused state—there was a chest of drawers in it, and I observed the top drawer was open—two drawers were open—they had been opened by a chisel—there was a mark on the drawer—I afterwards went into the bed-room and found Mr. Templeman lying on the floor, dead—I returned to the sitting-room, and found inside the top drawer a small box which Collins took possession of—there was nothing in it—it was open, there is a lock to it—I cannot say what it had been opened with—there was the mark of a chisel close to the lock of the tap drawer—I observed the win<lb/>dow by which I had got into the room, there was a pane of glass in it with a small bit out—it had been an old break, and a nail was put in to keep it in its place—it was knocked down, so that a finger could be put into open the window—I do not remember seeing any paper there—I went in by myself—I did not fit any chisel to the marks myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. Is the cottage situated within your beat? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No; this was not my beat at that time—Middleton, No, 235, was on that beat that morning—he came on at nine o'clock—Peacock had been on at nine the night before and off at six—the man before him came on at six and went off at nine—neither of those officers are here—I do not recollect seeing any broken glass about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. The window did not appear as if any violence at all bad been used to it? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. There was the violence of just shoving a finger in—I saw where the window was broken—I went there with two surgeons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. From what you saw, how many persons do you think had been en<lb/>gaged in the murder of Mr. Templeman, and robbing him? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I cannot tell—I think one strong man might do it himself, he being a feeble old man—I have never said I was certatn✗ there were two or more—I was never asked the question—Mr. Roe, the surgeon of Canonbury-square, first gave me information.</p>

                  </hi>I am a police-sergeant. I went to Mr. Templeman's cottage on the morning of the 17th—I got there a little after eleven o'clock, soon after Kerr—I examined the state of the sitting-room, and looked at the window particularly—one coiner of the pane of glass appeared to have been broken out, so that a person might put his finger through on to a button with which it was fastened inside—there was then nothing to pre<lb/>vent pushing it up—it was a swing window opening inward—a person could only get his fingers in—I looked at the drawers and found marks of violence on one drawer—in that drawer I found a quantity of bills and</p>

               <p>memorandums and two boxes, one mahogany, and one covered with paper, and among the papers I found two notes of the "Bank of Elegance"—one for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they are <hi rend="italic">flash</hi>notes—I produced them at the last trial, and have not seen them since—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>)—I believe these to be the same—they were notes like these—this is the box—it was not fastened—I should think either a small crow-bar or chisel had forced the drawer open—on the 12th of May last, in consequence of directions which I received from Inspector Miller, I searched a pond in Pocock's<lb/>fields, about three or four hundred yards from Mr. Templeman's, or it might be five hundred, and about thirty yards, or not so much, from Allen's—I found this lantern in that pond, with the piece of rushlight in it the same as it is now, except that this was fast in the frame—I did not find or see any thing else found—I had not heard the prisoner make any state<lb/>ment to Sergeant Otway.</p>

                  </hi>I am an Inspector of the N division of police. On Tuesday, the 17th of March, I was stationed at Islington. Pocock's-fields are in the Islington-station—I know Mr. Templeman's house—it is in the parish of St. Mary, Islington—I first went to Mr. Templeman's house between twelve and one o'clock on the 17th of March—I examined the window of the sitting room, and found it open, and the top pane of glass broken—a small piece was broken out of the corner—I found a piece of glass on the sill of the window inside—it was in such a situation as it would have fallen from the vacant space if pushed in—I saw a chest of drawers in the sitting room—the top drawer had been forced open and there were two marks on it—I produce a chisel and the drawer—I have compared the marks on the drawer with that chisel, and they correspond—the chisel has got a notch in it, and there is a mark on the brass of the lock, corresponding with the notch—it is a vacancy in the mark, a part where the chisel has not touched—there is a second mark in the wood-work, which also corresponds, but that is cut into the wood-work rather deeply, and there is no defect in the chisel mark there—the drawer appears to have been opened by those means—I took the prisoner into custody at a quarter after eleven o'clock the same night (Tuesday) at Allen's cottage in the same fields—he was in bed—the bed-room door was bolted outside—he was in bed with two children of Allen's—he appeared to be asleep—I disturbed him—he did not get up then—I procured a light, and he then got up, after my arousing him a second time—I searched his clothes, and found in his trowsers pocket 9<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>, all in shillings—while I was counting the money I asked if he knew what money he had—he said, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found seven lucifer matches</p>

At Bow<lb/>street police-court, on Monday, the 11th of May—persons had not been searching on the Sunday previous for wood—I saw Sergeant Otway on Satur<lb/>day night the 9th of May—he did not come with the intention of stopping some of my proceedings on account of what you had said—he told me you had implicated Jarvis and his wife—he told me you had made a statement—he did not tell me all—he did not show any statement to me—you had not mentioned any thing about a chisel before, to my knowledge—I did not hear any thing mentioned about one previous to its being found—I think there are six ponds in Pocock's-fields—you pointed out no particular spot—you said, "a pond in Pocock's fields"—when I first apprehended you, the stockings you had on were a pair—you were given into my cus<lb/>tody the last time at the station-house in Gardener-lane—I remember your saying you should not say a word about it—that was in answer to my question if you wished to say any thing to me—you said, no, you had already said too much—Sergeant Otway said you were no prisoner of his, he handed you over to me—he did not say you had no occasion to mention any thing which had taken place between you, as he did not in<lb/>tend to do any thing against you—he said you were no longer a prisoner of his, and he handed you over to me, he had no evidence to give—I do not recollect any thing more—when I first apprehended you, on the 17th of March, you said you had been to Norwich—I put a question to you con<lb/>cerning a pair of shoes which you had, the next morning—you were in</p>

Not more than three or four hours—I first visited you there at eleven o'clock at night—I represented myself to be an officer—I was dressed in plain clothes—I had no Macintosh on my arm—I left you in about half an hour—I said I had come by desire to show you a copy of the letter of the Secretary of State—you asked me to show you the letter—you were in the cuddy when I first came on board—you read the letter twice, I believe—you had it time enough to do so—after reading it you put it on one side, and said you had made up your mind you would have nothing to do with it—you did not tell you knew nothing about it—the paper offered 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward for the dis<lb/>covery of the parties who committed the murder of the late Mr. Temple<lb/>man—you asked me to show you the letter again—I did so, and then you said, "I will hare nothing to do with it, but I will tell you what I will do; if they will give me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will tell who the parties were"—I then asked you who the actual parties were that committed the murder—you said, "I shall be required to remain in England"—I told you you would so—you then said, "I will tell who the parties are that actually committed the murder, if you will give me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and pay my passage-money"—that was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after I had been with you—it might be twenty minutes, I am not certain what time I stopped, whether it was half or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. On your oath, did you not persuade me, as I had seen so much trouble through this affair, to make something by it now I had the oppor<lb/>tunity? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Certainly not—I did not tell you how serviceable the money would be to you, as you were about to leave the country—I did not ask you to come to town—I said I should not ask you any questions—I said nothing about a gentleman coming to be security—I said, "It is not likely you will see me again in the Downs."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do you pretend to swear, that for a quarter of an hour, nothing was said after I refused to have any thing to do with it for the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. The greater part of the time, you were leaning your head on your arms, think<lb/>ing—in consequence of what you said, I made a report to the Commissioners of police—I did not ask you to have any thing to drink—we did not have any thing—you asked me whether you could be tried again for the murder—I told you no, but you could be tried for the robbery—I did not say you could be punished, as you had said you knew who the parties were, if you did not make a disclosure—scarcely any thing further passed on the subject on the way to London—I was not with you, you were in one part of the vessel,</p>

               <p>and I in the other—I let you walk about just as you liked—you went down to breakfast by yourself—I gave you into Inspector Miller's custody it the station-house—I do not recollect that you made any remark at that time—I did not say there that you bad no occasion to take notice of any thing that had taken place between us, for I did not intend to do so against you—the conversation you allude to, took place in a <hi rend="italic">cob</hi>, in the presence of Inspector Miller, after you had been placed at the bar at Bow<lb/>street and charged with robbery—I accompanied Mr. Miller to the lock-up place to you—I was not there by myself a moment—I went in and came out with Mr. Miller—you asked me whether I should be disengaged next day, and if I was whether I could step up to the prison—I said I did not know whether I should, but if I could I would come up after chapel—you asked me to bring you a clean shirt and some shoes—I did not advise you to make a statement and get out of it—I never mentioned any thing about it—I do not remember telling you any thing in presence of the principal turnkey at Coldbath-fields prison—you sent for me there one night—when I got to the prison you said you had made up your mind to tell all you knew about the affair—to the best of my recollection, my reply was, "I am very glad of it; " I do not believe I made any other observation—I cannot tell on what conditions you made the statement; you had made it to the turnkey before I got there—I did not tell you in the presence of the turnkey, that by making a statement you would be entitled to the whole reward and be perfectly clear—I did not with to retire with you—we did retire, by your wish—I believe, the principal turnkey and the governor were present as well—you were very anxious for me to take Jarvis into custody, but I wanted to hear a little more about it before I took him—I same there next day by your directions—you said there were several other things connected with the case which you would write down, and if I would call up, you would have them ready in writing for me.</p>

                  </hi>I live in Liverpool Cottages, Islington. I knew the late Mr. John Templeman—I was in treaty with him to sell a cottage a little after Michaelmas, last year—it was not my cottage—he offered to deposit 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my hands to pay for it—that was the price of the cottage—I saw a quantity of money in his possession, which I think was about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in shillings and gold, and two notes which appeared to me like Bank of England notes—he put them down on the table before me, but I did not notice the amount of either of them—I mentioned his dealing for the cot<lb/>tage among the people living in the neighbourhood.</p>

"—you held up your head and said, "Don't say you saw me here"—that was about a month previous to the murder—I never saw you talking to Mr. Templeman—I heard him complain of your getting over his palings, against his wish—I repeatedly heard that, and he was very much offended with you for so doing—it was not a general thing to make a short cut that way—it was Mr. Templeman's own premises, and no one had a right to go through them without his leave—he allowed me to go through his place whenever I liked—I never saw you go that way.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. My Lord, as this is a very intricate case, I am to<lb/>tally unable to explain the nature of the evidence myself. I most earnestly crave your Lordship's protection, as I am undefended. There are some portions of the evidence which, I think, perhaps it is necessary that I should make some remarks upon, although I am not aware that I am compelled to explain every little thing that might transpire. It appears, gentlemen, al<lb/>though there is a great mass of evidence produced against me, that there is very little of it which appears at all to affect me; but I shall explain, in the best manner I can, to you, that part that I think does. And first, the witnesses state that I was in the skittle-ground, playing at skittles, and had no money but three halfpence. Now, gentlemen, the very name of a skittle<lb/>ground will convince you of the motive of my denying my pocket there. It is not likely, if I had a few shillings of my hard earnings and savings in my pocket that I should go and throw it away among a parcel of men in a skittle-ground, especially when I could get as much beer as I liked by saying I had no money. One of the witnesses states that I sent him for a rushlight. I did so, I acknowledge, but I made no secret of it. If I had wanted a rushlight for any particular occasion, I should have gone and got it myself, the shop is but a few yards from the public-house. I sent for it in the open tap-room, and he brought it to me in the tap-room. Then, as to the time at which I am stated to have gone home that night, I would ask you whether it is likely, on a moon-light night, like that was, that they can tell what time I went in? In their own evidence they state that it was as light as day, and still they take upon themselves to swear that it was two o'clock. With regard to my telling the Aliens that I had no money, my reason for that must be very obvious to you: I owed them between 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, and there was still something standing for boots: if I had told them that I had money in my pocket, or that I had been and bought new boots, Allen, being a shoemaker, would naturally have thought it very unprincipled of me to go and lay out my ready money at another shop, at the same time that I owed him money. There are a parcel of wit<lb/>nesses who come and give some and very various accounts of convers<lb/>ations that they say took place between us previous to the murder; but you see with what caution they have managed it, so that there should never be a third person to hear those conversations. First notice Mr. Wright—he can recollect every thing I said to him, but he does not recol<lb/>lect any thing that was said in the presence of Squires; he does not recol<lb/>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150188"/>
               <p>lect what he told Squires; and it also appears that Mr. Wright knew all these places as well as I did; he knew Allen's cottage, and he knew the wash-house, and the water-closet, and the garden, but he states he never saw a lantern; for what reason Squires is kept out of the way I am not aware; but he is not forthcoming to day to certify as to the truth of what Wright has stated. Next come Mr. Jobson and Mr. Rogers. I will ask you, whether their characters are worthy of the least attention. You must have been convinced, by the way they answered those questions which I put to them, that they are not to be credited for a moment. But there is one thing which I should particularly wish to draw your attention to, and that is, the very unfair, if not illegal, means by which I have been drawn into the predicament in which I now stand. This Sergeant Otway (although he comes here and denies it; why does he do so? for the sake of what he shall get, if I am convicted) knew that I was at the Compter; but he would not come there to me. No, he watches his opportunity, when he well knew I should be among strangers, and should wish not to be known; and mark the time he comes, at eleven o'clock at night, when I am in bed and asleep, taking me by surprise, and thinking that day being the first I had been at liberty for some time, that I should have been drinking a little, that that would be the best time. When he came to me he represented himself as a gentleman, sent to me by the Secretary of State, with an especial message to offer me 100<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, if I could give him any information that would lead to the conviction of the parties concerned in the murder of Mr. Templeman. What did I tell him? I at once told him that I did not know any thing about it, that I would have nothing to do with it; he has confessed here to-day, that I told him so more than once. I said I would have nothing to do with it for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. He then sat down, and began reasoning with me, telling me as I was a young man, and about leaving the country, how serviceable money would be to me, how much better it would be to go out with 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket than nothing at all, and as I had seen a great deal of trouble, I should be very foolish if I did not now make something of it, if I could. Well, with these persuasions, and as he positively assured me that I could not be tried again, I am free to acknowledge, that I did feel inclined, if I could make any thing of it, to do so, and I made up my mind to tell a lie for the sake of the reward. Now, I will ask you, Gentlemen, if that was a fair way of transacting business? He then got me to agree to his proposal. After I had said several times that I would not have any thing to do with it for 200<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, I said, "In the event of there not being a conviction, how should I be situated? for if I was to stop behind I should lose my pas<lb/>sage, and lose every thing." He then said, "Putting that on one side, will you, or would you, if I was to bring you 100<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, and lay it on this table, tell me who the actual parties were? " I said I would. He then asked me if I was required to lose my passage, what would I do so for. I said, "For the passage money." He then left me. I will ask you, Gentlemen, whether you think that the conversation he states was all that transpired, would occupy half-an-hour? and he was obliged to acknowledge that he was there at least half-an-hour. I saw nothing of him till the next morning, or the morning after, when he came down, and instead of bringing the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he talked about he brought a warrant. Of course I found I was very much taken in somehow; but I did not take any notice of it then. In the course of our journey to London, I asked him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150189"/>
               <p>how it was that I could be apprehended on the warrant. He told me how things stood; that I could be tried for the robbery, and at I had acknow<lb/>ledged to him that I knew who the parties were, I could be punished if I did not make a disclosure. I then saw, for the first time, that I had been taken in, and how awkwardly I was situated. He then took me to the station-house, and from thence to Bow-street, where I was charged with the robbery. After I had been so charged, he came to me in the lock-up place, and told me the only way for me to get ont of the scrape was to make a full statement of the whole affair, and then I should be not only entitled to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but 200<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, and likewise that I should be committed as evidence, and taken great care of. Of course I could not make any statement at all; but I told him I would consider of it, and if be came to me next day at the prison, I would give him a decisive answer. He then left me there locked up by myself, and finding they had driven me into a comer, and not knowing in what way at all to get out of it, I was driven almost to desperation, and I then made up my mind to make it appear, as though I really had been concerned, and also to accuse innocent parties, with the intent of getting out of it myself. You will say that that was a very rash proceeding; and so I will allow, and so I felt it to be, when I came a little to myself; but I never thought of there being a conviction at that time; it was merely because he promised me that I should be able to turn evidence; it was on that that I made the statement. After I had made up my mind to do so, I sent for him. He came to me in prison, and in the presence of the under-governor, and the principal turnkey, I told him that I was making this statement on condition that I was to be myself perfectly clear. He said he would tell me then, as he had told me before, that I should be admitted as evidence, and likewise that I should have the reward. For what reason the principal turnkey is kept away, I am not aware; he was a witness that would have been very necessary to have been here, to prove that part of my statement; but he is not. I had commenced making this statement to the principal turnkey when the officer came; but I had told him what were my motives for making it, and likewise told him that I would send for the officer. They thought; I was to be admitted as evidence, and on that account I was not treated as prisoners generally are. I was allowed sheets and tobacco, and to buy what I liked. Sergeant Otway also gave me some money there, and told me whatever I wanted I could have. Now, gentlemen, I will appeal to you whether, if it is not an unlawful proceeding, it is not, at least, a very unfair one? With regard to the lantern, it must be very evident to every, one of you, that I did not know it was there. The reason of my men<lb/>tioning the lantern was, because there had been, a lantern mentioned on a previous occasion. Is it likely that if I bad known there was a lantern in Allen's house, I should have been running any where else inquiring after one? as some of the witnesses try so to make it appear I was, a day or two previous. If I had in reality been engaged in this horrid affair, should I not have given some convincing proof of it? Do you think that a transaction of that kind could be carried on, a crime of that kind committed, without something having been traced to the parties themselves? What proof is there about that lantern? None. Where has it been for two years? whose hands has it been in?

I had seen Simpson about the neighbourhood, but did not know his name—he had never lived in my house before the end of February—the officers asked whose room it was—I told them it was William Carter's; in fact, it was Carter's—I never treated any one else as the tenant—I will swear I saw Simpson on the 14th of May, about dusk in the evening—it might be about five, or six, or seven o'clock—I am quite sure it was on the 14th of May, on the Thursday—it was not so late as nine o'clock—I will swear it was as late as four—I have a clock in my house—I did not look at it—it must have been after three o'clock—I do not know where the Mint is—I think I know a large house on the eastern side of Tower-hill—I have never been in it—Mr. Powell's office is in Lincoln's Inn-fields—I have been there, but only once—that was after the officers went into Carter's room—I saw Simpson on the day that the officers were at my house—there was a crowd round the door when the officers were there—I did not see Simpson in that crowd—I asked some person in the crowd to go and fetch me a sheet of writing paper—I do not know whether it was Simpson whom I asked to fetch it, and who brought it—a great many people flocked into the house—I cannot say who it was that brought it—the officers were not in the house when I told Simpson to take away the furniture—they had gone about a quarter of an hour—I cannot say whether, up to the time of Simpson's being taken into custody, I had mentioned to the officers that he had any thing to do with that room—I did to the Magistrate, after he was in custody—I never was asked, and did not mention his name at all before he was taken—I did not know where he had gone to live from my house—Buckeridge-street is about thirty yards from my house—I do not know where Simpson was taken—I know Banks, who kept a lodging-house—I never knew that Simpson slept there—it did not occur to me, when Simpson came to the house a quarter of an hour after the officers left, to go to the station-house, and say, "Here is a person who lived in that room occasionally."</p>

                  </hi>I am the wife of James Bowden, a tailor, liv<lb/>ing at Laytonstone, Essex. On the night of the 7th of June, between eleven o'clock and half-past, I was returning home from Stratford, with my sister, Mary Ann Gregory—when we got to Cam Hall-lane, a man came out of the lane, caught hold of my arm, and told me I must give him my money—he had something white over his dress, like a smock-frock and a handkerchief tied over his mouth, and his hat over hit forehead—I never saw him before—I told him I had none—he then asked me who I was—I told him I was a poor woman, and had no money, or I would gave it to him—he then stood and frowned at me, and said, all at once, "Well, you may go on"—I ran to the first house I came to, which was the Thatched House public-house, about 100 yards off—they were just shutting up—they opened the door, and a policeman came up—he afterwards brought the prisoner back to me—I knew him again—he was then dressed with something white over his coat, and hit hat over hit forehead, the same as when he stopped me—I had no money or I should have given it to him.</p>

"—I said, " Yes you are "—he asked, " For what? " I said, " For stopping two ladies on the road "—he said, as he went to the station-house, he was not ashamed of what he had done—I was present when he was examined be<lb/>fore Mr. Broughton, and saw Mr. Broughton sign this—this is his hand<lb/>writing—it was read over to the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—" The prisoner says, All I said to the ladies was, 'Who are you?, as we were walking along the road; I made no stop at all; they said they were poor people; I said, ' Go on, ' and they kept on walking; that is all that passed between us."</p>

In May last I had some carriage-horses and harness at Mr. Liddiard's, at Knightsbridge—a man named Matthews was in my service at that time—it was his duty to look after the property I had at Liddiard's stables—in consequence of what I heard, I went there on the 1st of June, to inquire after a pony—I</p>

                  </hi>I am a policeman. I heard the alarm about half<lb/>past nine o'clock, as if it was a female's voice screaming—I hastened to the spot, and saw the prosecutrix leaning against the wall in a fainting state—I pushed through the crowd, and the prisoner had run away with the knife—after she came to herself, the prisoner was coming up the street on the opposite aide of the way—I went over, took him, and asked him what he meant by acting in this sort of manner—he said though he had not murdered her, he would do it if he saw her in any other person's com<lb/>"pany or speaking to any body—I said he must give me the knife, which he did, and in going to the station-house he repeated he would murder her if he saw her with any body else—next morning I asked him how be came to do it—he said if he had not committed suicide he should have made a job for Mr. Calcrafe.</p>

                  </hi>I am clerk to an engineer. On Saturday evening, the 30th of May, a few minutes before twelve o'clock, I was passing through Red-lion-street, Whitechapel, and seeing a crowd round Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">COX'S</hi>door, and having previously known Mr.<hi rend="smallCaps">COX, </hi>I went to see what was the matter—I found he bad taken a boy, named Carey, into custody for stealing a woman's purse—he was tried in the New Court this morn<lb/>ing and transported—after I had got in, a tremendous rush was made at the door, with violent cries of " Let the boy go, what do you want to keep him for? "—Scott was very prominent among them—I held the door to prevent any one from coming in, and he made a blow at me through the glass—be broke the square of glass, and struck me—the blow almost stunned me—I was obliged to leave go of the door, a rush then took place into the house, but I gave Scott in charge, and the policeman took the boy to the station-house—an attempt was made to rescue him—I saw Goodson with the mob, but did not see him do any thing—there were a hundred or a hundred and fifty persons.</p>

                  </hi>I am the wife of Daniel Burell, a baker, in Hounds<lb/>ditch. Mr. Hales, in February last, gave me a bill of exchange to get discounted for him—I kept it about a fortnight, and not being able to get it discounted for him, I returned it to him—I never by myself, nor by any body, caused the prisoner to go to Mr. Hales to ask for the bill—I never saw him before he was aprehended—he is a perfect stranger to me—we have cards of our business—I gave a card or something to a Mr.</p>

On the 12th of February I packed up a trunk of her wearing apparel—the articles here produced are part of what I packed up—I saw three boxes put in, which, I believe, contained jewel<lb/>lery, but I did not look inside them—we were going to Brighton, and when we got to Croydon the trunk was missed—I bad seen it strapped behind the carriage, and the straps appeared to have been cut—on the 30th of May I accompanied the inspector to a house in Hoxton, and we there found this pink frock, this blonde, a muslin collar, and part of a cape—these were part of the property which had been in the trunk.</p>

                  </hi>I am a miller, and live at Staines. Grunsell is my wagoner—I sent him to Hammersmith with some flour—he generally took a little hay with him for the horses before they give them water—about twenty pounds of hay is quite sufficient for them to take, and he had his nose-bags besides, with corn in them—he had to go about sixteen miles—he had the care of the hay in my loft—some hay has been produced to me which is very much like mine—there are some mouldy spots in it, where the wet got in—it is the same species of hay, and as far as I can judge, it is mine—he had no right to take it.</p>

"—he said, "A pint of beer,,—they both went into the house together—I went and looked in the wagon, and saw ft bundle of hay in the wagon—I went to the loft with Griffin, and searched—I saw some hay there which he said was just like the hay that had been on the wagon—he then went down into the yard, came up again and found one truss with a dock in it, which he said he had put in, in Staines road—he</p>

                  </hi>I am a farrier, and live in Upper East Smithfield—I knew Taylor by sight. On the 26th of April, I charged him with stealing some horse-shoes of mine, and he took me to Mr. Whitehead's shop where I saw the prisoner Clibon—I asked if she knew that boy, she said, " No" at first, and afterwards acknowledged she had seen him—I asked if she had bought any shoes of him—she said, " No"—I turned round, saw them, and said, " How can you tell me such a falsity, when here they are, before my eyes? "—I said, " You say you do not know this boy "—she then said, '' I think I have seen him before "—Taylor then said, " How can you tell such a falsity? I have been here not many minutes ago "—she then said, ''I think I have seen you before "—I said to Taylor, " Tell me the truth, how many have you taken away? "—he said he had taken a great many, and that Welsh, a lad I employed, encouraged him to do it—I said to Clibon, " How is it you can buy so many shoes of boys, without making inquiry? "—I said, "Did he name the name of Simmonds? "—she said, " Yes, I think that was the name "—I found about fifty horse-shoes there, and they are stubbed together with new nails—I understand Clibon is ser<lb/>vant to Mr. Whitehead.</p>

On the night of the 14th of June, between nine and ten o'clock, I was watching near Three Colt-street—Howard lives in Three Colt-street, adjoining the railway—there is an archway adjoining his pre<lb/>mises—I saw Cox throw several pieces of timber called battens over into Howard's premises—he took them from the archway adjoining—he threw them over a fence, from eight to ten feet high—Howard was at that time in his own yard, and took one of them up—I said, " Halloo, what game do you call this? this game won't do for me"—Howard made no reply, but brought the piece of timber a little way back towards the archway—be went into his own house—I came off the railway down into Three Colt-street—I met Cox and Howard both together—they said they were very sorry for what had been done—I said I should apply to my master and leave him to do as he thought proper—Howard said he was very sorry it had happened, he hoped I would not do any thing in it, or say any thing about it, would I go and take any thing to drink? Cox said he wanted several pieces of sticks to put up the dahlias in his garden—Cox went back into Howard's yard and threw the pieces of battens back again—he came to me and said he hoped I would not say any thing about it any further, as he had put them back again—I told my employer, and then picked up the pieces of wood—these are them.</p>

The prisoner was our pot-boy—on the 5th of June my husband marked some money—it was put into the till in my pre<lb/>sence—we then went to bed—I went down about seven o'clock, and saw the prisoner lay across the counter, and take some money out of the till, and put it into his pocket—he then went on scouring his counter—I gave him into custody—I saw him searched—eight pence and four halfpence were found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Phillips. Q. I believe your husband did not wish to prosecute? A. No, he wished him to have some slight punish<lb/>ment on account of his good behaviour before—the till was not locked.</p>

On the 2nd of June I delivered 21lbs. weight of hone<lb/>hair to Withers, who was a pauper in that workhouse, to take to the Horse Bazaar; it had been picked by the paupers, and he was to take it back—I had sent him with 271bs. weight before, which was taken safe—in conse<lb/>quence of some suspicion, I watched him with the last load—he went to No. 8, Upper Dorset-street, Bryanston-square, where Evans lives, in' the back kitchen (that is quite out of the road from the workhouse to the ba<lb/>zaar)—he went in, and stopped there two or three minutes, then came out without either the bag or hair—he went to a beer-shop in Seymour<lb/>place, stopped there about half-an-hour, and when he came out he had the empty bag with him—I had kept at the corner, and had seen one other person go into the beer-shop, but I do not know who it was—when</p>

               <p>Withers came out, be went through the iron railings towards Bryantson<lb/>squere—I overtook him at Windham-place—I said, " What have you done with the bag of hair I sent you with to the bazaar? "—I repeated the ques<lb/>tion, and he said, " I left it at the bazaar"—I gave him into custody—I and the policeman then went to the house in Dorset-street—Evans was not at home—I left the policeman at the house while I went to the beer-shop in Seymour-place—I found Evans there, and told him I wanted to speak to him—we came out, and I said, " What has become of that hair that I saw a man take into your house half-an-hour ago? "—he said, " What hair? "—I said, " You need not make yourself strange, you know all about if,—he said, " Oh, the bag of hair the man brought, and requested leave to leave it there while he went further"—I said, " Did he leave bag and all? —he said, " No, he took the bag with him"—I said, "That is not the case, " I watched him with the hair and bag, and he came out without either—he said, " Oh, I forgot, the man requested me to empty the hair, and bring the bag with me to the beer-shop",—that the man was an old acquaintance of his—we went to his lodging—he unlocked the kitchen door, and when we got in, I saw the hair emptied out loose in the kitchen—I said, "That is the hair"—he replied, " Yes, it is, " and I gave him into custody.</p>

" and he said, " The Rev. Mr. Preston"—the carpet<lb/>bag was opened, and contained some straw, three bricks, and a piece of paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live in Blackfriars-road. The prisoner has been twenty years in my employ—about eight o'clock, on the morning of the 23rd of May, in consequence of suspicion, I sent for a policeman; and as the prisoner went out for breakfast I called him into the counting-house, and said I suspected he had some of my pro<lb/> perty, which he denied—I asked if he objected to be searched—he said, " No"—the policeman searched him, and found these copper rivets and burrs in his possession—I have every reason to believe they are mine, as, in consequence of suspicion, I did not let him take work out of the fac<lb/> tory; and on this occasion I was led to believe he had possession of the property—I believe it to be mine—he said it was the first time, and he hoped I would not be severe with him—he offered to pay for them, and said I might discharge him, and that would settle it—I have often found a deficiency of forty or fifty rivets from his work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cellarman to Messrs. James Goding and Company. There are other partners, I believe—there is a cellar where a particular sort of ale is placed—it is my duty to lock and take charge of that cellar—I had suspicion that ale was taken out at different times, and watched—on Thursday evening, the 28th of May, about nine o'clock, an hour and a half after the premises were locked up, I went to the cellar, and, on opening the door, I heard a noise of somebody falling over a pail—it struck me that somebody was in the cellar—I left the door a little ajar, and heard somebody come to the top of the stairs, and make a peculiar noise of clucking, like a hen calling her chickens—on looking up I perceived a person on the watch, and, on looking down the cellar, I perceived somebody moving backwards and forwards, there being no light in the cellar but through an air-hole—he walked up to the door—I laid hold of him, and it was Douglas—he was a miller on the premises, and had no business in the cellar at that time of night, and could not have got in by any fair means—I said, " Douglas, I know you"—about a second afterwards Newberry came up, with a can containing ale—he came up to the top of the stairs—he ran round to make his escape—I said, "Newberry, I know you, that is sufficient"—he threw down the can, and ran away—there was about a gallon of ale in it—it was spilt—the can belonged to the men in the tun-room, to drink out of—I left the prisoners in the storehouse, and took the can to the watchman—next day I told the clerk, and they were taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Manchester warehouseman, and live in Camberwell New-road. The prisoner was my servant for about thirteen months—I missed a sovereign on the 17th of May, and got an officer to search her box in my presence—it was not locked—it was in her bed<lb/> room—the articles stated in the indictment were found in her box—these are the articles now produced—these rings had been taken out of Mrs. Hatfield's casket, where the sovereign was lost from—the prisoner was present when her box was searched, and said she had found the rings, and the other articles she meant to return before she left the situation—the officer is ill, and not able to attend.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. My mistress asked me to lend her a basket to put these things in; not having one, I offered her the loan of my box; she made no answer; I thought she did not object to it, and I put the articles there with intent to bring them safe when we removed to Camberwell New-road. The reason of my box being searched was, Mrs. Hatfield said she had lost money which she found she had not, and having had no time to unpack after we moved, these things remained there; the smallest of these rings I found in the high road five months ago; I did not know my mistress had lost one; the other ring I found under the drawers in her bed-room; I intended to give it her, but she did not come home till late, and I forgot it; the silver thimble she told me to work with, and take care of it.</p>
