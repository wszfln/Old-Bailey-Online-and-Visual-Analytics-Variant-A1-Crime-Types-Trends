             sworn. - On the 29th of April last, I lost the articles in the indictment, which were in a trunk, and stolen out of a cart in Fleet-street; the Bow-street officers have found some of them in different places, and some were found on the prisoner; he came to my house, and told me his sister, who was convicted, knew where some of the property could be found; and if I would intercede for her, she would deliver up the different articles I am now in possession of; I said, that was not sufficient, but, provided she would come forward with more property, I would; he came at different times, and always told the same story; I was not with the officer when they were found, but I have them here, and know them to be mine. (Produces the articles.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Mrs. Hayes, the prisoner's sister, has been convicted on your prosecution? - A. Yes, for receiving this very property.</p>
               <p>Q. And a person of the name of Faulkner was also convicted of receiving those things? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A person of the name of Hayes was also tried? - A. Yes, he was tried, but acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. And one Peake? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him? - A. I don't know; he got clear some how or other.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was admitted to bail by the Justice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he has now surrendered to take his trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that the prisoner at the bar had nothing to do originally with receiving these goods, but that they were delivered to him by Mrs. Hayes? - A. He never told me of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know Mrs. Hayes brought those things to him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Or ever heard any thing of it? -

            No, the things were found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner gave you information where the things might be found? - A. Yes; after she was convicted, his sister said, she knew where the things could be purchased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know they were in the prisoner's possession? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: On the 31st of July, I went with a search-warrant to the prisoner's house, No. 2, Gibson's-court, St. James's, about one o'clock; he was not at home, but he came immediately; I asked him if his name was Denight; he said, it was; I said, I suppose you know what I am come for; he said, no; I said, I have a search-warrant; he said, for what; I told him for a pair of diamond ear-rings and other articles; he said, they were not in his house, but that he could get them; and, if I would give time, he would bring them to the office; I said, I was sure they were in the house, and I must search it; he said, he would not pretend to say he knew nothing about them, but, if I would give him time, he would bring them down; I said, I must search the house; well then, said he, come up stairs; I went up one pair of stairs to the front room; he returned down again, and went into the cellar; I followed him, and asked him what he wanted; he said, he wanted something to open the place where the diamonds were; he put his hand on a carpenter's bench, took up a piece of wood, and laid it down again; then we went up stairs again, but I did not see he had any tool with him; he put his hand to the book-case, pulled out two or three books, and then pulled out a paper containing the things Mr. Weppler has produced; I took him, and he said Mr. Weppler knew he had them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You know the prisoner is the brother of Mrs. Hayes? - A. I know it now.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that it was in consequence of the prisoner's information, after Mrs. Hayes was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170004"/>convicted, that led to his house? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-2-person65">A. </persName>
            Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know he said he had the things delivered to him by Mrs. Hayes merely for being taken care of? - A. He said so when I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not always say they were the property of Mrs. Hayes, and placed with him as a deposit? - A. Yes, I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not understood so by you and the Justice at the time of examination? - A. Yes, and I think so still; I think he only kept them on condition of getting his sister a pardon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know, from any thing that passed from the prisoner, that he really had the custody of those things by direction of Mrs. Hayes? - A. I cannot say that; my opinion is, from what he said, that he had them as a deposit till Mr. Weppler got a pardon for his sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand from him that Mr. Weppler had promised a pardon? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. From what passed, have you any doubt about the truth of his story that he kept this as a deposit? - A. I don't think he meant to sell the things; he only held them as a deposit, and merely to get a pardon for his sister, not to make any property of them for his own use.(The record of the conviction of Thomas Colley, otherwise Thomas Putty, read.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner delivered a written defence, which was read, as follows:</p>
               <p>"On the 24th of April last, Mr. Weppler lost the box; Colley, a glazier, said, he found it in the Strand, and carried it to the Bell, in Red-Lion market, kept by a person of the name of Hayes; that he opened it, and wanted Mr. Hayes to buy it of him, but he would not, as he thought he had better wait for the advertisement; he went home, and the next day brought the box, but he did not know the value of the contents; for the beads, as he called them, proved to be pearls; he threw a number of loose ones behind the fire, and somebody said they would have them, and picked them up; other little things he gave to children, and the other things he sold to be melted for the gold and silver, not knowing the value of them; about three days afterwards he went to Mr. Hayes, and said, would they buy some napkins; he had got three dozen, and they bought them; Mrs. Hayes suffered by false swearing that she bought the box and contents for seven pounds; but it happened in this way: the servant had warning, and she, not being pleased with going, and having some words, got with a soldier in the neighbourhood, and he, with others, persuaded her she would get one hundred and fifty pounds reward, if she informed, which she did by the description Putty gave of the box; Mrs. Hayes, her child, and all were taken, and Mrs. Hayes was convicted by the girl's false swearing; when Putty found what state he was in,(for what reason I cannot say,) he sent a statement how he disposed of the things; Mrs. Weppler went to the house of Mrs. Hinton, and said she much wished to see Mrs. Hayes, and wished Mrs. Hinton to present her to her; but, searing a sudden visit might hurt her; begged her to acquaint Mrs. Hayes that Mrs. Weppler would see her to-morrow. Mr. and Mrs. Weppler, with Mrs. Hinton, and myself, went the next day to Newgate in a coach, and Mrs. Weppler staid in it while we went in; Mrs. Weppler said, she was sorry for her unfortunate situation, and was come to give her all the comfort in her power; but, as she was well assured she was not guilty, she was sorry steps so rash had been taken by Mr. Weppler, as she thought it would be the best way to hear of the property, and secure the great expence they had been at; and the more so, as they had not got any of the things again but trifles; however they could not prevail on him, and she was now come to acquaint her that she would obtain her pardon if she would restore the things not destroyed by the melter; she said, that a pair of diamond earrings and the picture of her former husband were of more value to her than all the rest, and gave the word of honour of a lady that she would perform her promise; I was appointed by my sister, as being the only friend she had to do any thing for her; Mrs. Weppler gave me her address, in her own handwriting, and left the place with a seeming affection for Mrs. Hayes; they did not wait my going the day after, but sent Miller, the Bow-street officer; Mrs. Hayes gave a list of what she had; Mr. Weppler then went himself, and Mrs. Hayes was called to Mr. Kirby's office; Mrs. Hayes said, she had the promise of them, but it would be some days first; and, according to Mr. Weppler's promise, she could not think of delivering them till her pardon was produced; Mrs. Weppler had said she would pay any thing in reason, but Mr. Weppler made a demand of a sum of money; and Mrs. Hayes thanked him for letting her know in time, as she had something to go with. The next day they visited her again, and, instead of performing the promise, said, the articles should all be delivered; a week passed, and, after different appointments, I went to inform them that Mrs. Hayes had got these things in her own hands, and was ready to deliver them on the pardon being produced; Mr. Weppler told me he was about the business, and promised me he would do as was said, but told me I must get a petition made out, and it should be signed; I promised I would do any thing that was right, and as much as I could for the recovery, to convince them my sister had been wronged; I went with the petition the next day to Mrs. Weppler, and I saw Mr. Weppler the next day; he said it was wrong, because it said Mrs. Hayes never had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170005"/>the property in her possession; he said, I must leave it, but it would not be right to do any thing more about it at present, because Mr. Hayes was an evidence against Faulkner, and it would be said Hayes had done it for his wife's pardon; Mr. Weppler promised he would not go further if Faulkner would give up the diamonds he had; I went to him in prison, and he said Mr. Weppler might be d - d; I went to him till I was in danger from the prisoners, as Faulkner said he was no friend of his; I was with Mr. Weppler ten times, and in that time they promised a great many times that she and Faulkner should have their liberty if they would send word where the things were.</p>


               <p>"After Faulkner was convicted, they hoped the things they had would be put into such hands that they might be got; I promised I would answer for them; and, if they thought proper, would appoint a time; I would be imprisoned till they were brought forward; they said, they did not doubt I would; Mrs. Weppler afterwards said the loss had been so great, that Mr. Weppler would not accept the things without money beside, he having had one hundred and fifty pieces of cambric seized by the Custom-house officers in the morning, and at night be lost his box; that they had run also great danger in bringing the diamonds over, as they were obliged to bring them concealed about the most secret parts of them; they shewed me a box, like that which was lost, except the colour; it would be impossible to speak to all the promises made to me, being sometimes two hours in discourse; my sister afterwards begged I would take the things in my care, as she feared necessity might make her part with them, and she knew she could trust to me to bring them when wanted; I had no reason to think I was doing any thing but what was legal and right, and I thought they might as well attempt to take any thing else out of my house as to take them; and I complied with her desire, and kept the things; I called at Mrs. Weppler's, and she said I must call again tomorrow, for Mr. Weppler was on the carter's trial; and, if he gained it, it would be better for Mrs. Hayes, as she was convinced he would not sign a petition without a sum of money as well as the things; next morning Mrs. Hayes wrote a letter, containing a list of the things I had got, and I went and saw Mr. Weppler, who said, the legal expences were very great, and he had not yet recovered; he wished he had never heard of the box, and gave me a bill, which he had of Mr. Reeves, of Bow-street, of twenty pounds; I said, I had got the things, and would be answerable for them, as I had before said; he said, the things were trivial, and he was determined not to sign it without a handsome sum of money; I said, it was impossible to do so, as she had distressed herself to buy the things. This was the cause of my distress, and I have lost a place of work I was in many years; I had nothing but hard labour to provide for myself and family, and it was not in my power to do any thing for her, and I said I wished he would make up his mind what to do; Mrs. Weppler said, she would, by that day week, send word by letter what they would do for her; the time came, but no letter. About a fortnight after, the Bow-street officers came, and said they had a warrant to search my house, and that I knew what they wanted, and that I had better give them up; I said, Mr. Weppler had got a list of what I had, and hoped they would not take them, for what would become of Mrs. Hayes; however they would have them, and I gave them solded up in silver paper; they then made a prisoner of me; Mr. Bond understood Mr. Weppler knew something of the things, otherwise I should not have been on bail."</p>

On Thursday the 13th of August, I sent the waiter of the Moorgate Coffee-house to Mr. Pring's, to know if I could have a horse to go to Dartford, in Kent; Mr. Pring's man brought a black mare, which I mounted; I told him I was going to Dartford, I told him I should return probably to-morrow evening; I went to Dartford in expectation of returning next day; when I got to Dartford, I had the misfortune to meet with a brother of mine, who was a lieutenant on board his Majesty's ship, Charlotte; he told me, he heard that the ship I belonged to, the Charger, was going to sail; I desired him to ride the mare to town, supposing I could put confidence in my brother, and told him to return the horse to Mr. Pring; I gave him a guinea to pay for it; I always paid Mr. Pring half-a-guinea a day; I rested satisfied that the horse was returned, and went off the next morning with the coach for Plymouth; I understood afterwards, that my brother had gone to Liverpool, and sold the mare there; I have since learnt, that, at that time, he had lost his commistion, but I did not then know it; I heard, about a fortnight ago, that he is in America.</p>

             sworn. - I am an apprentice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170009"/>to Mr. Riley; a pair of sugar-tongs were brought to be repaired, and when the man came to enquire for them, they were missing; after that, I went to Messrs. Cox and Merle's, in Little-Britain; I saw them, and knew them to be the same.</p>
               <p>NATHANIEL PHILLIPS sworn. - I am an apprentice to Mr. Riley; I know the tongs to be the same that I mended on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BENNETT sworn. - I am servant to Messrs. Cox and Merle's, refiners, in Little-Britain: On the 19th of January, the prisoner brought me a pair of silver sugar-tongs to sell as old silver; I supposed him to have come by them regularly; I had known him many years, he kept a silversmith's shop, in Barbican, and I did not know but he was a master at that time; about half an hour after I had purchased them, a servant of Mr. Riley's came to me, to know if I had bought a pair of old fashioned tea tongs that morning; I told him, I had, and shewed them to him; I have had them ever since. (The witness produced the tongs, which were identified by all the other witnesses.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have only to say, that of late years my mental faculties have been much impaired, but I hope the evidence that will appear to my character, will operate in my favour.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18020217-8-verdict37" type="verdictDescription">

            Are you able to swear to it if it is produced? - A. Yes; I have found none of the other articles; the coat, in the right-hand pocket, is stained with tobacco; he said, if I would go with him by myself, he would get me every thing again; I was loath to go with him for fear he should get away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are there any particular marks to those things? - A. Yes, the right-hand pocket is stained with tobacco; I chew tobacco, and put it into my coat-pocket; I am perfectly sure it is my own; the waistcoat was one my uncle gave me, very much darned, the pockets are sewed up; there is a mother of pearl button on the left-hand side, and two upon the right; the shirt is tied with a piece of bobbin, it is very much torn with stooping.</p>
               <p>RACHAEL CARPENTER sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness; the prisoner at the bar was a flight acquaintance of my husband's; he frequently used to call upon us; he eat and drank with us part of what we had, when he came up; he called on Friday afternoon, the 22d of January; he had tea with us in the evening; he told us he had got a job of work to go to, on the Monday; he went about eight o'clock in the evening; he returned again about the 23d in the morning, between the hours of nine and ten o'clock, my husband was gone to his work; he sat down for some time; he asked me if I would drink any thing: I thanked him, I had just had my breakfast; he asked me, if I would fetch him a pint of two penny, and half an ounce of tobacco; I told him yes; I put on my bonnet and cloak, and went down stairs; the public-house was opposite; I ordered a pint of two penny to be got ready; I went for the tobacco, when I came back, the pint of twopenny was on the bar, waiting for me; I was gone five or six minutes at the farthest; I went up stairs, and immediately found my door was wide open; the prisoner at the bar was gone; I missed a box and tea-chest from off the table, and a deal box, containing a coat, waistcoat, two half-handkerchiefs, a pair of stockings, a shirt, and a hat-band; I know those articles were in the box; this is my husband's property, and my box stood upon this; the articles in the indictment were in my husband's box; he did not take that away.</p>

            Did he put them into your box? - A. I don't know, that box was left empty behind; he took two boxes, and left one empty behind him; I have seen the property that was taken from him; my husband's coat and waistcoat, a shirt, and a pair of stockings, were in the coat-pocket; they were taken from him when he was taken to the watch-house; I was at the watch-house, and was with my hus<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170010"/>band at the taking of him; I know these articles to be my husband's property, the name R. P. is on the stockings; they were kept in the box that was empty.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARWOOD sworn. - I am inspector of the watch and lamps of St. Andrew's, Holborn; I saw the prisoner taken; the man and his wife brought the prisoner in, and another man with them; he said, he had been robbed, I searched him, and there were two small boxes, one tortoise-shell, the other brass, and cut in the form of a shoe; the small box was in his coat-pocket; when he was before the Alderman, he was stripped of the coat, waistcoat, and shirt, I have kept them ever since.(Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Carpenter. They are my boxes; a tortoise-shell box, with a looking-glass, one is a wooden shoe, with an oval on it; the cloaths are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, these things, as I was coming down St. Giles's, I picked up, tied up in a bundle, I put them upon my back; going up St. Giles's, this man came past me; soon after, I went past him, and this man followed me, overtook me, and swore they were his property, before I ever saw him; I am entirely a stranger.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the chaise going fast or slow? - A. Middling, not particularly fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how the box was fastened to the chaise? - A. No.</p>

            Which of them did you see carrying it? - A. The prisoner Dungworth.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the chaise were they then? - A. About the space of two or three yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fastening about the trunk, or cord? - A. A cord; one end was broke or cut, I do not know which; I cannot say whether it was broke or cut; I followed Dungworth up a court; I took him up the court, and took him by the collar, and said, he had stole the box from the back of the chaise; they made some resistance, and were assisted; they got away from me, and took the box with them; I followed them again into the Mews, near Bedford-square, (Carlisle-Mews.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of them? - A. Yes, while they went round the corner of Russell-street into the Mews, a minute or two; there I got Dungworth again, and he let the box fall, and went on.</p>
               <p>Q. Dungworth still had it? - A. I cannot say which had it then.</p>
               <p>Q. They let it drop, in order to get away? - A. I was going to let them go away, but I wasadvised not, and I followed them again, and endeavoured to take them a third time, near Bedford-square; and this man, Bowles, assisted me, and took them.</p>
               <p>Q. All the time you followed them, did not you give alarm? - A. Yes, but no person gave any assistance; I called out stop thief; I saw the box drop from one of them; I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this be after you saw them come from the chaise? - A. All in the course of six or seven minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the box? - A. Yes, it is the same;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170011"/>I took the prisoner Dungworth and the box in a coach, and went to Bow-street immediately.</p>

            , son to John Keirnan. I requested Mr. Wright to call for more assistance, as we were not force enough to go into the house; I continued watching when Wright went off for assistance; Wright, in going for assistance, disturbed a dog in the soap-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what became of the cart? - A. No, I did not; I was obliged to quit the barn for my personal safety. The dog being disturbed came down and made a great noise, when Keirnan came out of the soap-house, called to the dog, and bid him be quiet.</p>
               <p>Q. John Keirnan was convicted here? - A. Yes; he bid the dog be quiet, and I left the barn for fear they should discover me, and went to another part of the soap-house. On the 21st, between the hours of four and five o'clock in the morning, I went towards the barn again, not hearing any body at work; on looking into the barn, I saw no person but the prisoner at the bar, on which I went in, and made a survey, examined the premises, and found a box of soap, which had been newly cleansed, concealed under two other boxes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. A box which the liquid had been poured into? - A. Yes; when taken from the copper; the prisoner at the bar informed me that was the whole that had been cleansed that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that true or not? - A. Not true; I saw a greater quantity cleansed; I then quitted the soap-house, and went towards Riley's house, or Keirnan's house, with whom he lived, about one eighth or a mile across a couple of fields; I met Wright previously to my arriving there. I went into Keirnan's premises, and saw an empty cart, Keirnan asked me what business I had there; I told him I had come for a quantity of soap which was brought there, Wright saw it; he informed me that it was false, that there had not been any soap brought there, and ordered me to quit the premises, at the same time, taking up a pitch-fork, he threatened my destruction unless I quitted the premises.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he know who you were? - A. He did; I had surveyed the house many times.</p>

After Wright left me, I began to reason with Keirnan on the impropriety of his conduct, when he request me to walk in, and see if we could not accommodate the matter; to settle the matter, and make it up between us, he thought I was a different sort of person; I told him I came there to do my duty, and would do my duty, and and refused to go in with him; Keirnan's son went out on the common and caught a horse, which horse he brought into Keirnan's yard; Keirnan harnessed it, and put it in the cart; he took a key from his pocket, and placed four boxes of soap in this cart, and

The prisoner at the bar, with the hoe in his hand, came and said, lay him out, and I will finish him; after that, he struck me two or three blows on the head with the hoe, the blunt part; but having my high-crowned hat on, with a handkerchief inside, it did not materially injure me; I then requested them to consider what they were at, and not for one crime they had committed, add one of a more atrocious nature.</p>

Treat me ill; when I regained my legs, they told me, unless I desisted from pursuing the cart, they would put an end to me, or be my destruction; I still followed the cart, and the prisoner at the bar, and Brady, both aimed blows at me, which I avoided by putting my head forward.</p>

            Had the prisoner at the bar the same weapon with him? - A. He had; I put my hand into my inside pocket, and took out a pistol, and turning round towards them, I threatened to fire if either of them struck me another blow. The cart being now got a great way on the common, I made away after it, they still followed; one of the soldiers had been wounded, and was gone for assistance, he had been wounded in the sleshy part of his arm; the other was attacked by the prisoner at the bar; John Keirnan told the soldiers that I was no officer but a highwayman; I still kept following the cart, when I was again interrupted by Keirnan, who threatened to run me through with a pitch-fork; and, when he found I was going on, he reversed the pitch-fork, and hit me on the arm; the blow was aimed at my head; I then told him, if he struck me another blow, I should fire at him; and one of the soldiers told me more assistance was coming; he had been for assistance, and was returning with two others; I passed-Keirnan, and came up with the cart with one of the soldiers, and I received two or three blows from the lad who was driving the cart; I jumped up in the cart, and took off the cover of the boxes, and saw the soap in a fluid state, and made my seizure.</p>
               <p>Q. About what quantity of soap, in this fluid state, was there in the cart? - A. About seven hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Q. You seized it, and it was afterwards condemned? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, Rooke, know you before this time? - A. He had seen me several times at the soap-house; he knew me as an officer of Excise when I surveyed the house, and the other officer had been ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Though so many times assaulted, or beaten, by these people, did you fire your pistol at all? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you feel the effect of the blows you received? - A. My arms were black for a fortnight afterwards. The handkerchief in my hat prevented the mischief to my head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Q. The boxes you found in the cart were full of soap, not in the regular frames which soap-makers put them into? - A. Yes, they were improper boxes, and unentered untensils.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. If I understand you rightly, you mean to say, this injury you sustained was from the other man, and not much from the prisoner at the bar? - A. Principally from Brady and Keirnan.</p>
               <p>Q. Though these men struck you, the blows did not injure you? - A. No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not the regular officer surveying the premises belonging to his master? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not an opportunity of knowing you were an Excise-officer? - A. I had frequently surveyed the premises while the officer was ill.</p>
               <p>Q. But was the prisoner at the bar there? - A. Yes, always.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not warrant on this occasion? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your deputation about you, to shew you were an officer? - A. I cannot recollect that I had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. The injury was prevented by your hat being stuffed with a handkerchief? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You acted with the other officer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley said, the facts against the defendant being clearly proved, he should not take up the time of the Court, in addressing the Jury, but hoped, that in consideration of his family, which would become a burden on the parish to which he belonged, and the punishment he had already suffered by being obliged to absent himself from his home for seven years; and also the irreproachable character he had sustained, he trusted the Court would see fit to mitigate his punishment, upon which the Court directed the Jury to find the defendant <rs id="t18020217-11-verdict54" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners or either of them? - A. Yes; I had seen them about the house, I saw them at the house together once; I found a shirt the same day in a box, in the prisoner's apartment, No. 10, Marygold-court, in the Strand; the prisoners were both at home; I went with the officers who had a search-warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know when the things were lost? - A. I put them in the chest after six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You never found more than two of these articles, a gown and a shirt? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know in whose apartments you found it? - A. The prisoners; they cohabited together two or three years; they were in the room at the time I went to execute the search-warrant; I came to a box, and asked whose it was, the prisoner Whittick said, it is mine; I asked whose cloaths they were in the box, he said, they are mine; I asked whose shirt it was, he said, it is mine; there was a coat, waistcoat and breeches, his wearing apparel, in the box, this shirt was along with them; I took the shirt out and shewed the prosecutrix; she said, it was her property; I asked Bennet where the duplicate of the gown was, and she told me it was under the leas of the cardtable, between the green baize, which I took, (produces it;) there were three or four more duplicates with it; I went there and found it; I kept the duplicate, I have it now.</p>

             sworn. - I keep the Coal-hole in the Strand: Mary Southall lodged at my house; the prisoner Whittick was at my house on the 25th, of January, in the evening, at the club; the clubroom has a small room detached off, where there is a large chest; he was there sometime among the rest of his acquaintance and companions.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all members of a club at your house? - A. Yes; he stopped there about an hour and a half; they went away two or three at a time: On Wednesday morning, the prosecutrix, who kept her things unlocked in that chest, went to the chest, and missed them; on the lid of this large chest I put a bedstead, and a mahogany side-board upon that, for the purpose of securing the property, because I had no lock on the chest; it must be a strong arm to list the lid up, and take away the things; after the company was gone, the prosecutrix slept in that small room that night: On Tuesday morning, the door was locked, and kept locked the whole of that day; on Tuesday night she slept there; on Wednesday morning she missed these things, and made enquiry of the pawnbrokers; I was present when she found it at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the pawnbroker's man here? - A. Yes; Bennet told the Magistrate at Bow-street she had the gown and shirt given to her by a man at the top of Fountain-court; the shirt Whittick claimed as his, at their lodgings in Marygold-court, I was present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe you invited this man to come to your club that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not give him some tickets to distribute? - A. I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not give him tickets to distribute, and bring persons to your club? - A. I am not certain; I think I did not for that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not frequently? - A. No; I have never seen him above three or four times at furthest.</p>
               <p>Q. You had given him tickets to distribute? - A. Yes; I did it when I was a little acquainted with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear you did not give him tickets that night? - A. I did not that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it? - A. I don't think I did; I cannot be positive.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have known this woman some time as a person who pledged things? - A. Yes.</p>

I live with Mr. Ware: On the 9th of January, between six and seven, or near seven o'clock, I went to the lower old shed; I found four pair and a half of boot legs concealed under a beam; I took them out to see who they were dressed by; they were dressed by a person in the manufactory, whose work I knew; a person shewed me where they were; I went to the upper old shed, and concealed myself under the stiffing board; I had a perfect view of the lower old shed; there was no flooring to the upper old shed; in the course of half an hour, this

            Samuel Ware and Richard-Cumberledge Ware: Having received information that some boot legs had been secreted with a design to be carried away, and put into an improper place, Roberts was appointed by Mr. Ware himself to watch who should take those legs away; Roberts went from the accompting-house with that design; he came down, and said George Oswald had secreted the legs; in consequence of that, we begged he would watch him out; and as soon as I saw him pass through the accompting-house to the shop, at that time Roberts was at the door, I laid hold of his coat, and said, he must come back to the accompting-house, and must unbutton and take those things out; he unbuttoned his waistcoat, and we took the legs from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the legs marked? - A. Yes, I marked them myself; they are the same.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows:</p>
               <p>"My Lord, intruding on your time and the patience of the Court, in addressing your Lordship, I wish not to vindicate my conduct, but, on the contrary, acknowledge the justness of the prosecution against me; but I wish, at the same time, to lay before your Lordship the true circumstances relating to my fate: - having been desired by one of my shop-mates to take the property mentioned in the indictment, concealed by him for that purpose, I went, and was carrying it away, during which time a watch was set for the purpose of discovering the person; the goods having been found by a man, after they had been concealed, previous to my taking them away, I was followed, taken back, and the property found on me; I was committed to prison, and, with the advice of my prosecutors, who promised they would shew lenity, I made a full confession of the affair; but to no purpose, as information was given to the receivers, who, in consequence of the notice, left their habitation, and have not since been apprehended. I therefore place myself on the mercy of the Court, hoping you Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury will consider these facts in my favour; I hope it may be the means of extending mercy to your unhappy prisoner, having a disconsolate wife and two helpless children entirely destitute of support, and wanting a friend to give them assistance: and, in addition to this, I have to state, that I labour under a dreadful complaint, which renders me incapable of hard labour, the testimonials of which the surgeon can produce, as also Mr. Kirby, who afforded me the earliest relief, and treated me with the greatest humanity. Hoping this defence from your unhappy prisoner will operate on my behalf, I place myself on the humanity and mercy of this honourable Court, to the sense of which I bow with submission."</p>

               <p>Q. He was not employed then? - A. Not then; I had employed him; I went away, and returned again in about three or four minutes after; I was informed by a man who met me, that a man had taken a plank from the pile; I asked in what direction he went; he told me; I pursued him, and desired the man to follow me; about one hundred and fifty yards from the place, in an alley, called Green-Dragon-alley, I saw the prisoner standing with the plank, one end on the ground, the other against the wall, in the alley, about three yards from the top; he was bending below the plank to ake it on his shoulder; he listed himself from underneath the plank; I took hold of him; when he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170017"/>saw me, he came from underneath, and I seized him by the collar; the plank was between us; he catched hold of the slap of his breeches; he told me two men had left it there while he was making water; he entreated me much to let him go, and said he was distressed; I kept hold of him; I did not wish to leave him; in the course of two minutes, the people gathered round, and a Marine-Police officer took him in custody; we took the plank and the prisoner to the office, as such I was bound over to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the plank? - A. Yes; there is a mark in chalk across the middle with a figure, signifying the length; that figure is made before they come to us, to shew the measurement.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, in Long-acre; (produces the velvet;) I believe the prisoner at the bar brought it to me on the 21st of January, between eight and nine in the morning to pawn; he had one pound fourteen shillings advanced upon it; he said it was his own property; On the 21st of January, he came and had four yards of it away, he had two pounds first, and it was afterwards reduced to one pound fourteen shillings; Mr. Stubbs came on the 21st and claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. He pawned this in his own name? - A. Yes; John Hotton.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he should take it out again soon? - A. Before the 16th of January, we had that piece of velvet in and out, he redeemed it frequently; I believe it to be the same velvet.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure the name he assumed, when he came to you, was John, and not William Horton? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020217-17-person202">Q. </persName>
            (To Mr. Stubbs.) Look at the velvet - do you know it by any particular marks? - A. Yes, by this piece being cut off the end; I have no doubt at all of that being my property; it was left in a large store-room, where there are a vast number of valuable things; there are eight or ten dozen of skins in my house; I do not deliver them to my workmen, but through means of an under clerk, sometimes by my foreman, and the young man, but it is in my dwelling-house, detached from the work-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to miss it? - A. Four yards of velvet were wanted on the 21st, and the prisoner, William Horton, was applied to for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you apply to him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that did? - A. I believe Horton produced the four yards, but I did not see it then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you present yourself at the time when he produced it? - A. No; but the four yards cut off this are still in my possession at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you measure it? - A. No, the person did, whom it was given to; I have no doubt at all of the identity of that property; I went to the pawnbroker's, and told him not to part with the property, that it was mine; the prisoner confessed that he had taken it.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that confession here? - A. No; I have a note from him to one of my men to take it out, and he would give him the money again; I know the hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the young man's name? -

               <p>Q. If it had been the prisoner's design to prevent it coming into your possession again, he might have so altered it, that it should never be known again? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Who did you receive that paper from? - A. I took it from the prisoner myself by violence; I saw it in his hand when the Bow-street officer took him.</p>

Yes; he stood there under the appearance of making water; he had his head fixed in Mr. Smith's window; I saw him snatch, or cut the shoes from the window, put them under his coat and run away; he was perceived by me and another man, the other man followed him closer than I did; he threw the shoes away, the other man picked them up; I pursued him, but I did not take him till two nights following, Friday the 15th.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the shoes picked up when he threw them away? - A. Yes, immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether these are the shoes? - A. Yes, I marked them myself; I am sure these are the shoes.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you known him before - what is he? - A. I understand he is a carpenter, he said he lived somewhere about Old-street.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. (Produces a release.) Q. You are an attorney? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Living where? - A. In Old Broad-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in your service? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - A. He was with me two months previous to the 8th of January last.</p>
               <p>Q. He was two months with you before he absconded? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the habit of taking checks to your banker's? - A. Small ones of four or five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that four pound note - did you give him, on the 18th of December, a check for four pounds upon your banker? - A. I never gave him this check on my banker.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's hand-writing? - A. Yes, he used to write in my office.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able, from seeing him write in your office, to say whether that is his hand-writing or not? - A. To the best of my knowledge and belief it is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. None occurs to my mind whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you occasion to speak to him about taking your book to your bankers? - A. Yes; I think it was the day before he absconded, I said, I intended to take it to my banker's for it to be made up, or to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any reply to that? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep your book? - A. No; but I frequently used, when I went out, to tell him where I was going.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after that? - A. Yes, I am sure I saw him after that; I am not sure whether he absconded that day or the next, I cannot be positive; it was the 8th of January that he absconded; he was at the office till about twelve or one o'clock; I am positive I did not see him after three.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of you missing him, and making this discovery, did you apply to the Lord-Mayor for a warrant? - A. No; I delivered up the checks to the bankers, leaving it to them to act as they thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you afterwards see the prisoner? - A. The first time I saw him, since he absconded, was on Tuesday last, at the Poultry-Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him at the Poultry-Compter? - A. I asked him what could induce him to do any thing of this sort, was it any unkindness on my part.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hold out to him any promise of favour, or use any threat, before he said what you are going to state? - A. None, whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. He said, he did not know that he had done any harm; I asked him to what extent he had injured me, and he said he had drawn the drafts, and received the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else? - A. I don't recollect any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any other conversation at any other time? - A. Only at the Mansion-house the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed there was taken in writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or any body else, in your presence, ask him what he had done with the money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that what the prisoner said, was taken down in writing? - A. I believe, what the prisoner said, was not taken down; I did not see it taken down.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said in your presence by the prisoner before the Lord-Mayor? - A. He was asked if he had a father living; he said, no; he had a mother, who obtained her livelhood by keeping pigs; he was asked what he had done with the money that he had received for the drafts, and he said, he had spent some of it in tarts, and that he had given some to another lad in an adjacent office, who recommended him to my office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I take it for granted you cannot undertake to say, whether that writing was made in the County of Middlesex, or the City of London.? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-19-person232">A. </persName>
            Certainly, I did not see him write it.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of directions you received from the Lord-Mayor, did you go down to Bristol for the purpose of apprehending the prisoner? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend him, and where? - A. I did, at a Mr. Long's, in Newton's-court, Broad-street, Bristol, on Sunday morning, the 7th of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of his apprehension, did any thing particular pass? - A. No, I brought him to London, I had no particular conversation with him till I got into Piccadilly; I then related to him -</p>

               <p>Q. Did you frighten him into saying any thing? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-19-person234">A. </persName>
            Nothing at all; when I came to Piccadilly, I related to him that I had a warrant upon suspicion of forgery, upon which he coloured very much; I asked him how many drafts he had drawn forgeries of Mr. Windus's name; he said, he could not directly say how many; I then asked him if he could recollect whether there were four, or five, or half a dozen, or what number, and to what amount; he could not recollect for some little time; but, upon his recollection, he said, he thought it was about three or four, for three pounds each; I then asked him if he recollected one of the amount of six pounds; he said, yes, he did; I recommended him then to recollect himself, and say how many he had really forged; he said, it might be four, or it might be half a dozen, he really could not say; about twelve o'clock I took him before the Lord-Mayor, and he was remanded till the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation take place the next day? - A. I asked him, in the presence of Mr. Windus, how many he had forged; he said, he could not exactly recollect how many; I asked him how he had laid out the money; he said, he laid out some in tarts, some he had given to a lad in another office, and he had bought a watch in Holborn for a guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the drafts shewn to him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Are you sure you made him no promise of favour? - A. I am sorry you should ask me that question.</p>
               <p>Q. It is my duty to ask you? - A. I did not say any thing to him of that kind.</p>
               <p>The check read:</p>

            As I was coming by the door of this house, about a quarter before nine, an alarm was made that people had broke into Mr. Garrick's house; there was no attempt made to open the door, and they were a considerable while about it; they could not break it open at the upper part of the door; I said to the smith, give me the bar, and I will try at the bottom part; I put the bar to the bottom part, got it under the door, and wrenched it open; we were the best part of a quarter of an hour; when the door was opened, I plunged into the house, and found the prisoner,

The tall one; we secured him, and gave him into the watchman's hands; after that, upon breaking open the parlour door, I thought I saw somebody go up the chimney; I made towards the chimney, and, in the mean while, Mr. Barr, the witness, picked

               <p>Q. Did you examine the rest of the house to see that all was fast? - A. Yes; we examined every part of the house, and found it barred and safe.</p>

I was standing at my door, about a quarter before nine o'clock, and heard the rattles spring; I ran immediately, and they had just got the door open; I went into the passage, and found the parlour door fast; the last witness broke it open; when I went in, I found the prisoner Smith lying flat upon his face on the carpet; he pretended to be asleep, and wanted to know where he was; he said, he thought it was a public-house, and came in there to have something to drink; I took him to the watch-house, and there searched-him; we found nothing upon him but some cords, and the other prisoner, Brown, a screw-driver.</p>

            (To Channer.) Was there not a quantity of plate on the side-board in the parlour which might have been easily conveyed away if these persons had meant to commit a felony? - A. Yes, it might.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What place was there? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-20-person254">A. </persName>
            Half a dozen table-spoons, half a dozen desert-spoons, a gravy-spoon, a silver cheese-knife, a pair of salts, and a pair of plated candlesticks.</p>

            In what situation was this plate? - A. The spoons were in the knife-cases upon the sideheard.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the knife-cases open? - A. No, they were locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the other articles? - A. The fans were in the drawers of the side-board.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the drawers locked? - A. Yes, I had the keys in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of it lying open on the side-board? -

            No, it was all locked up.</p>
               <p>Smith's defence. We had been to Paddington, and made rather too free with drink; when we came to this house, Brown fell down; I got him up, and observed to him that the door was open, and we went in to lie down, to get the better of the drink; we did not go in for the purpose of plundering the house, and I hope the respectable witnesses your Lordship will hear presently will do away that prejudice.</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. I can say no more; that is exactly the truth; the witnesses have said that the matches were found at my feet, but they were not found till after I was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. The matches were taken to the watch-house with him.</p>
               <p>Chanson. I found the matches immediately, while the watchman had him by the collar; I took up the matches and the wax taper, and put them in my pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called three witnesses each, who gave them a good character.</p>

            Were you on horseback? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was he? - A. He was in the high road; the other two came up, one on the right hand, and the other on the left hand, and took me up upon the foot-path; I asked them what they wanted of me.</p>
               <p>Q. They had not spoke to you? - A. I don't recollect that they had; Condon pulled a pistol out, held it up to me, and said, he wanted my money; he was distressed for money, and money he must have; I said, he should have what little money I had, and welcome; I then put my hand into my pocket to take out what I had, while Condon put his hand over the horse's neck, and felt the watch-chain; the seal was tucked in my pocket; there was only a link or so out; he rugged two or three times, and broke the chain, and put that in his waistcoat-pocket; one of them then desired me to pull the watch our myself, I cannot say which of them it was; I had some difficulty in getting the watch out of a long sob, and Duggan said, shoot, d - n you, shoot; I got the watch out, and gave it to Condon; I dropped my glove; I said to them, be so kind as pick my glove up; Condon picked it up, and gave it to me; as I turned off the foot-path into the road to go away, a fourth person then, whom I had not seen before, stood by, and said, is it done? Duggan said, yes, or something to that purpose, and then I left them; he was at about thirty yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you saw no more of them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoke to Condon being the principal person concerned, and you have spoke to Duggan telling him to shoot - what did Ogle do? - A. He assisted in bringing me up upon the footpath.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing else to say? - A. I met with a person who sent the patrol after them; Duggan had something in his hand, I thought it was a cane or a sword, I cannot say; I was minding the pistol that was against my breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the night dark, or how? - A. It was very light, moonlight.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this take up? - A. Three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how they were dressed? - A. Yes; Ogle stood at the right hand of me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170023"/>with a light-coloured coat on, and the other two had dark coats.</p>

            Common round hats, or slapped over their faces? - A. I did not see any thing particular, they were common round hats.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the moon shine towards you, in your face, or on your back? - A. The moon shone upon my back.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had an opportunity of seeing their faces distinctly? - A. Yes, I saw them very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from them when you first discovered them? - A. I was but just got out of Kensington Gravel-pits, I suppose nothing near one hundred yards from the last house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean positively to say, that you had so fair a view of them as to enable you to speak positively to their persons? - A. Yes, I think I had without a doubt; Condon and Ogle I have not the least doubt of; and Duggan I think I have no doubt of; the fourth person was shorter than either of these.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them afterwards? - A. On the Thursday following, at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they were taken up upon your information? - A. I heard they were, which made me come to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you give information to? - A. To one Carter, who keeps a cow-yard at Tyburn-gate; I told him if he went any further he would be robbed, he rode very fast, and I believe was afraid of me; I told him I was a friend, and he went back with me to Shepherd's-bush; he said the patrol could not be far off, and he would send them after the men; he rode home before the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them immediately, when you saw them at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons with them when you saw them at Bow-street, or were they brought up by themselves? - A. There was nobody else.</p>

                  <persName id="t18020217-21-person271">Q. </persName>
            Had they the same clothes on that they had when they robbed you? - A. It appeared so to me; one had a light-coloured coat, and the other two, dark ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in great coats, or common coats? - A. Common coats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. (Counsel for Duggan and Condon.) Q. Had you never seen any of these persons before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not before this transaction that you have been speaking of? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There were three persons, and another person coming up afterwards, attacking you, I should think you must have been a little agitated? - A. It was very little indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. This was between six and seven o'clock in the evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nobody by? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody passing along the road? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you were very little agitated when three or four persons were attacking you in this way? - A. Very little.</p>
               <p>Q. One person having a pistol at your breast, and another desiring that person to shoot, and yet you were very little agitated? - A. Very little indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt at all of the persons of these men? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I understand you right, when my Lord put the question to you, that you did not know what was in the hand of the other person? - A. I saw something in his hand that looked like a sword.</p>

               <p>Q. Though you are able to speak to the persons of these men, you cannot say what that was? - A. It was either a stick, a cane, or a sword.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you did not look particularly, because the pistol was at your breast? - A. I did not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they round hats on? - A. I did not take particular notice of their hats.</p>
               <p>Q. Do try and recollect? - A. I make no doubt but they had, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether they had round hats on or not, you cannot say; but as to their faces under round hats, you have no doubt of? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Bow-street with the expectation of seeing the persons who had robbed you? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-21-person272">A. </persName>
            Certainly I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the room at Bow-street, were they not pointed out to you as the persons who had committed the robbery? - A. They were not pointed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not told those were the persons who were charged to have robbed you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not mixed with others for you to pick them out? - Q. No; they were brought out and I identified them immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, I dare say, or have heard since this business, that there are three forty pounds reward, that is one hundred and twenty pounds, if these men are convicted? - A. I have never heard it, no body has said any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard that there is a forty pounds reward upon the conviction of a highwayman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not expect to have a share of these rewards? - A. I never understood that, I understood those who took them would have it; I never heard of any thing of the kind in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you lived all your life then? - A. I have lived in Warwick, and in Gloucestershire.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What do you know of this? - A. I am one of the patrols of Bow-street: On Sunday evening, the 7th of this month, I heard there were three or four footpads on the Uxbridge-road; I went with three others of our people, Barrett, Barker, and Griffiths, and as we were going into the country, we met with the three men at the bar, near Bayswater.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you had heard of this robbery that night? - A. Yes; just before I met the prisoners; I laid hold of Duggan, and on the right-hand side, inside his coat, I found this pistol,(produces it); upon further searching him, in his pockets I found two seven-shilling-pieces, two sixpences, and one halfpenny; then I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they dressed? - A. I believe two of them were in blue, but the middleman, Condon, had a light-coloured coat on, they had round hats.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Round slapped hats? - A. Common round hats.</p>
               <p>Q. There was other money found I suppose? - A. Yes; three guineas, and two half guineas, in a little purse.</p>

               <p>Q. The pistol was not loaded? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You found nothing upon Ogle but four shillings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was Condon that had the light-coloured coat on, and not Ogle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is an old pistol with the handle knocked off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Wood.) Q. I forgot to ask you what you were robbed of besides the watch? - A. Two seven-shilling-pieces, and about half-a-crown.</p>

             sworn. - I went into the room where the prosecutor was dining, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner was standing by the door looking at his change; the waiter came in to serve me, and, going out, asked the prisoner if his change was not good; he said, yes, but still kept looking at it; when the waite left the room, the prisoner took the bundle under his arm, and went out; it was a bundle in a silk handkerchief laying on a chair next the door; Mr. Hooper was reading the paper with his back to the prisoner; the landlord came in, and asked him if he brought a bundle in; he said, he did; then he told him it was gone, and they pursued the prisoner.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DAVIDSON sworn. - I keep an alamode beef shop in Holborn: On the 14th of January, the prisoner came to dine; I attended him myself, and just as he was going, Mr. Hooper came in; the waiter served him, and nobody else was in the room at that time; Mr. Richardson came in just before the prisoner left the room, and I saw him looking at his change a long time; I recollected Mr. Hooper came in with a bundle, but did not remember the prisoner had any; I saw the bundle in a chair before the prisoner went away; while I was getting Mr. Richardson's dinner ready, the prisoner came out of the parlour; I turned round to thank him, and saw the bundle under his arm, which immediately struck me; I went and asked Mr. Hooper about it; we then pursued the prisoner, and took him in a house in Short's Gardens, Drury-lane, in a back yard, in a kind of lumber place, quite dark.</p>

               <p>LAUGHLIN RICHIE sworn. - I live at No. 16, South-street, Manchester-square: On the 21st of November, I was in the parlour at the Bedford arms, in South-street, between five and six o'clock; the prisoner came in a little after me, who I did not know, and several neighbours came in soon after, who use the room; the landlord paid me a one pound note and half-a-guinea, which he owed me, and presently the prisoner changed his place, and came and sat next to me on my right-hand; he saw the landlord pay me, and saw me put the note in my pocket-book, and put my book in my left-hand waistcoat pocket, which is very deep; about an hour after, I wanted to go home, I got up, and left Moody sitting; I was in the center of the room, and began feeling for the half-guinea to pay the reckoning; I did not know which pocket I had put it into, but I took the book out, and searched that pocket, I could not find it in either; I then said to the company, I had lost half-a-guinea, upon which Moody got up to me, and said, do you think I have robbed you? I said, I did not say you did; he came up and felt round me, saying, if you will pay half a gallon of ale, I will find it for you; I made no reply to that; he asked again about the ale, and felt round my pocket, and in an instant plunged two fingers in, and then held his hand as high as his head, saying, there is the half-guinea for you; he gave me the half-guinea, which I changed, and paid my reckoning; Moody asked me, if I was going home, and if he should go with me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170027"/>I told him, I only lived next door but one, and I did not want company; he asked me several times, I told him to keep his own company, for I had nothing to say to him, but nevertheless he forced his conversation; I went out, and he followed me close; there is a middle door that goes with a pulley, he came up close to me, and pushed me against the door; I opened it, and walked out first; he walked behind me till I got to the stone, where men generally stop, at the extremity of the house, and while I was making water, he turned his back to me for a few minutes; as I was coming away from the stone, he suddenly darted his hand into my waistcoat-pocket; I seized him, and told him, he must go back with me; I had not time to look after my book, but when I got him in the house, I searched, and finding I had it, I did not take much more notice of him; I went into the parlour and told the company how he had served me; I pulled the book out, and was going to open it before some master tradesmen; but some of them, out of friendship, advised me not, but to put it in my pocket and take care of it; I staid some time longer, and then went straight home; I got home about ten o'clock, and opened the book, when I missed the notes, all but the ragged pound note, the landlord gave me; next morning, I went to Bow-street, and enquired for an officer; I got one, and we went to the prisoner's mother's, but could not find him; but the officer knowing him, and where to find him, took me to some court in Drury-lane, and we did not find him or the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long afterwards was it you took him? -

            About nine weeks.</p>

               <persName id="t18020217-24-person296">Q. </persName>
            Have you got the notes again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober that night? - A. I was capable of knowing what I was about; I had had a few glasses of ale, but was quite sensible of what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know how long the sense of a drunken man lasts - were you so drunk that you did not know what you were doing? - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not sober? - A. I had very little to make me unsober.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You will not swear you were sober? - A. I don't know what you call sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober, or any thing like it? - A. I was quite sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. I don't understand what you mean by sober.</p>
               <p>Q. You really don't? - A. No, I tell you I was sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in the house? - A. I went in at near six o'clock, and came out at near ten.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not make any display of the 100l. note, I dare say? - A. No, not in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room was it? - A. I did not in any room; I might mention it as Mr. Walker was joking me, and saying will you lend me one hundred pounds, I said, I suppose you think I am not worth one.</p>

               <p>Q. When you went out, were you asked, are your notes safe? - A. I might; I thought them safe myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not put your hand to your pocket, and say, O yes, all's safe? - A. I don't know that I did; I cannot say whether I did or not; I thought the book safe enough.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the note last? - A. I had seen it when I put the pound note in; it was in the book then; there was nobody but the prisoner and Mr. Hooley there.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure that you then saw the one hundred pound note, that you tied a string round your pocket-book, and put it in your pocket? - A. Yes.</p>

            When you went home, you found you had lost it, and went back, no doubt? - A. No; I knew the prisoner was gone; I did not go back, because he might be alarmed, I might have seen him before, nor did I know he was the son of my opposite neighbour, but I heard he was after he was gone.</p>

             sworn. - I went into the room between seven and eight o'clock; I set on Mr. Richie's right-hand, and the prisoner on his left; Mr. Richie said, he had lost half-a-guinea, the prisoner started up, and said, he suspected him; Mr. Richie said, no; he did not; the prisoner then felt on the outside of his pockets, and said, no, you have not got it, sure enough; he then put his finger and thumb in, and said, here is the half-guinea; the note I know nothing about; they went out, and I stopped till they came back, when the prosecutor related what he has here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You did not go in till about eight o'clock? - A. It might be seven or eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay till the prosecutor went home? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What state was he in? - A. He appeared to be very merry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the 100l. note at all? - A. No, I did not stay above an hour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I saw him take the one-pound note out of his pocket to light his pipe with, and heard the half-guinea jink on the table; about half an hour after, he said he had lost it; I put my finger into a corner of his pocket, and took it out, and the gentlemen said he ought to forfeit half-a-crown bowl of punch for taking away a young mans character. <rs id="t18020217-24-verdict126" type="verdictDescription">

Rodgers asked him three several times, Sir, be positive, I have a reason for asking; have you been out of the house to-day or not? no, I have not, he said three different times; I said, Mr. Sirdefield, I know you have been out to-day; O yes, I recollect, said he, I did go to your other shop, next door but one; yes, said I, you have been to the doctor's too; O yes, says he, I have, but they both slipped my memory; he was then examined, but nothing found on him; the officer has two of the notes which I have seen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. When had you taken those notes? - A. In the course of the morning, but had not put my name on them; the prisoner had no reason to suppose I should be angry at his leaving the shop; I had given no orders the shopmen should not.</p>
               <p>JOHN VINE sworn. - I was shopman to Mr. Drake: On the 25th of January, while Mr. Drake was at dinner, the prisoner complained of the piles, which he had done for some time, and asked me what was good for them; I told him to get some cooling ointment; he said he would go then before he came down, but I advised him twice not to go; he went before Mr. Drake came down, and I heard him ask him whether he had been out; he said, he had not; I had informed Mr. Drake, because he appeared to be very uneasy about the notes; then I told him positively he had been out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. It was by your advice he got some cooling ointment? - A. Yes, and he shewed me the box.</p>
               <p>LUCY WEEKS sworn. - I live at No. 38, Catherine-street, about three minutes walk from Mr. Drake's; the prisoner lodged with me about a week before he went to Mr. Drake's, and left some things in a box; on the day he was taken up, he came to me, about two o'clock, and asked me to get some things out of pawn for him; he gave me six one-pound and one two-pound Bank of England notes; I went to Mr. Byrne's, in Wood-street, Cheapside; the things came to three pounds nine shillings, or three pounds ten shillings, which I paid by a two-pound note and two ones; as I was going along, I bought some tea and sugar for myself, and changed one of the notes; I took two home, which the officer has; I put the things into the prisoner's box, but when the officer came, he took them out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. - Q. When Rodgers came, did you give him the notes directly? - A. No; just at that time I was very frightened, and threw them into the garden, but I fetched them to him; I was taken into custody, and have been so ever since.</p>

               <p>EDWARD RODGERS sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Shadwell office, and was applied to by Mr. Drake to apprehend the prisoner on the 25th of January; I asked the prisoner if he had been out in the course of the evening, as I had received information that he had; he said, he was not; I asked him two or three times to be sure, as I should tell the Magistrates what he said; he still said he was not out; Mr. Drake said something to him, but I don't know what; he then said, that he recollected that he had been at the other shop, and also at the doctor's for some ointment; I told them to look about the shop, as perhaps they were mislaid; not finding the notes, I said I was under the necessity of searching him, which I did, but found nothing; I went to Mrs. Weeks's the same afternoon, and was a considerable time with her before she acknowledged; then she went to the back place behind the house, and picked from some dust a morocco pocket-book, with two notes in it, which I have kept ever since; she also shewed me a quantity of things, which she said she had got out of pawn; I took them out of the box, and have them here; she told me the box was his, and he said me cloathing she had given me was his property, and he said that no blame was due to her, for that he had employed her to go to the pawnbroker's for him; I never threatened or promised him any thing if he would confess.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170029"/>(The things were produced, and identified by Weeks, Smith, and Rodgers.)(Two one-pound notes produced, and shewn to Mr. Drake.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Drake. This note I can positively swear to, and this I believe to be the other, because it was found with it; I recollect taking this of a person, and seeing the name of Smith on it; I am in the habit of taking a great number of notes of a Mr. Smith, but it is not the same Mr. Smith, because I have compared the writing; I live at No. 118, in Ratcliff-highway, with my family, and had not been out of the house above a yard or two.</p>

I saw them on the 4th of this month at the Police-Office; William Loosely, the owner of the mare, had taken his passage to go to the West-Indies, and he could not carry on the prosecution on that account; the Magistrates at Bow-street desired to know if any person there could prove the mare to be the property of

               <p>Q. Did you watch them? - A. Yes; they did not go into Harrow, but went within one or two hundred yards of the town; they stopped there about ten minutes, and then came back upon the common.</p>

I might be gone about ten minutes; when we came back, we found the same two men surrounding three horses, and trying to catch one of them, but they could not; and when they found they could not, they returned to the lane, and put the bridle on the other horse, and was riding off with it.</p>

               <p>ANN NAYLOR sworn. - I am the wife of John Naylor: On Monday last I was going to the play-house in Well-street, about six o'clock in the evening, Charles Allen was with me; I had a child in my arms, and felt something at my pocket; as soon as I could get out of the mob, I felt for my money, and it was all gone; I had a half-guinea, a seven-shilling piece, two half-crowns, and two shilling and six-pence in silver; I immediately called out that I was robbed; the prisoner was behind me; I turned round, and pulled my gown over.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen your money since? - A. No, I found half-a-crown upon the stairs.</p>

               <p>CHARLES ALLEN sworn. - I was with Mrs. Naylor; I had my hand upon her shoulder to keep the mob off from her child; she cried out that she was robbed; I immediately went down stairs; I laid hold of the prisoner, and charged him with having robbed her; I had observed him having hold of her clothes near the pocket-hole.</p>
               <p>Q. When you observed that, why did you wait till she called out? - A. The mob made a push all at once; and when she said she was robbed, she said that was the man making down stairs; immediately upon her calling out, the prisoner made down stairs, and had got about as far as I am from your Lordship; I held him till the constable came; I was present when he was searched at the watch-house; there was a seven-shilling piece and a knife found upon him.</p>
               <p>JOHN TALBOT sworn. - I am a constable: On Monday night, between five and six o'clock, I was sent for to take charge of a man; it was between light and dark; I cannot say whether the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to the theatre, and I might be behind the lady, I cannot say; all of a sudden, she said she was robbed, and, in turning round sharp, several people fell backwards on the stairs; I was one, and then they laid hold of me. <rs id="t18020217-27-verdict143" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. What was contained in your purse? - A. A seven-shilling piece and two sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay in the room all the while with them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

            You did not go into any other room? - A. No; we did not leave the table.</p>
               <p>Q. After all this, you could not be very sober? - A. I was sober enough to know what I did; I called the watchman, and described them to him; then they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>- MACDONALD sworn. - I am a watchman: Going along St. Martin's-lane, I saw these girls, and, soon after, I heard this man say, I am robbed by two women, and if I saw them, I should know them very well; I took him into the gin-shop at the corner of New-street, where they were; he put his hand on Watson's left shoulder, and said, this is the woman that robbed me; they were both together at that time.</p>

            Did the prosecutor speak of them both? - A. He said, this is the woman that was in my company, and this is the woman that robbed me; he swore to one more than the other, he swore most to Watson; I put my hand on her left shoulder, and told her, she must got with me; when she moved, I saw this purse (producing it) lying on her right toe in the wine vaults; that was about ten minutes before six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in the purse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Simmons. I know this purse to be mine, because it is broke on one side; I bought it in Brook-street about three months ago.</p>

            (To Macdonald.) Was there any body else in the wine-vaults? - A. No, only Paterson, the master, as we were going along, Williams said, before I go to prison, the best way is to tell the truth; you know you have the money, give it up; she said, she had the money either in her cloaths, or in her mouth; I took her to the constable of the night, and he searched her in my presence, but found nothing but brass.</p>

I met this young woman; she asked me if I would have any thing to drink; we had some purl and gin, and then we met the prosecutor; he asked us to have something to drink; we went to a public-house, and he called for a pint of rum; then he called for some water; we staid about ten minutes, it was then near six o'clock; we went away, and in St. Martin's-lane this young woman met a man she knew, and we went to have something to drink; then the prosecutor came in, and said, we had robbed him, and they took us to the watch-house.</p>

He did not quit it at all: On Friday, the 5th, I went up stairs into my club-room, and found him sitting there with the door shut; I asked him what business he had there, that was not his place, that his place was up stairs, in his own apartment, in the room where he lodged; he was counting some half-pence and penny-pieces, but what quantity I don't know, or whose they were I don't know; he went up to his own room, and I imagine he staid there a quarter of an hour, when he came into the taproom, and went out, and I never saw him till he was apprehended for the robbery.</p>

The 9th, the Tuesday morning; when I came down stairs at seven o'clock that morning to open my house, I went to open the back window, and found some papers lying on the ground that had not a right to be there; I then looked into a cupboard where there was a bag with between thirty and forty pounds.</p>

            I cannot swear to a guinea or two; there were bank-notes of one or two pounds, half-guineas, seven-shilling pieces, guineas, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences; I cannot describe them particularly, but altogether to the amount of thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bag left or taken away? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-32-person369">A. </persName>
            They were all taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then? - A. I looked at the back part of the bar, and found a pane of glass broke, where the prisoner had entered into the bar; the leaden casement window was unbolted, and opened.</p>
               <p>

            Suppose the casement open, was there room for a man to get in? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-32-person371">A. </persName>
            Plenty of room; I went up to my wife, and told her, and in the course of the morning I went up to the office, and inquired of the officers; they came with me, and saw the situation of the place; they then went to apprehend the prisoner; we found him at the Marquis of Granby, in the Almonry, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find him there? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-32-person372">A. </persName>
            About the hour of twelve o'clock, it might be a quarter or twenty minutes after; I cannot say to five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when he was searched? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any bank-notes? - A. There were three two-pound notes, a one-pound note, and six guineas, lodged in the hands of the landlady of the house where he was drinking; she delivered them up to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear to any of the money? - A. I cannot say; I can only speak to the crooked half-guinea, I think I can swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed? - A. At twelve o'clock; I was up last.</p>

               <p>Q. Was all fastened? - A. Yes, it was all fastened; and, when I went to bed, the pane of glass was safe, the window bolted, and the cupboard locked up, with the keys in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Mrs. JAMES sworn. - Q. Do you know any thing about the robbery? - A. I know the bag was my property before I was married.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he come to you for? - A. To purchase a watch.</p>

            (To Ward.) Did he give you the watch? - A. No; when he came, there was a quarrel, and he gave me the bag and all to take care of, as he was going to fight, but in a very few minutes he asked me to give him the bag again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch at that time? - A. Yes; he said he gave three pounds for it that morning; it was silver watch with a steel chain.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take so much notice of it as to know it again? - A. No; he only pulled it out, and said he had given three pounds for it at Mr. Wright's; the one pound note, the three two pound notes, and the six guineas, I wrapped up directly and put in a bag with my own money, but so that it should not mix.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the bag? - A. I did not examine his bag; I don't know what was in it.</p>

               <p>Q. The night before the robbery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you drink together? - A. The first place I lit on him was, at the Marquis of Granby.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was with you? - A. James Barlow, and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with them? - A. Yes, we did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that? - A. That was when we left the Marquis of Granby, not above twenty or thirty yards; he went up stairs, and we stopped at the door; from there we went to a house, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170035"/>don't know the sign; we drank there till two or three o'clock in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. How much was it? - A. Four shillings and nine-pence; I had three and sixpence to take out of it, and the remainder I did not give to him, we all paid our own shot.</p>

               <p>Q. What followed then - what did you tell them when they asked you whether they had any money? - A. I told them they always had money when I was there; I was confined there a twelvemonth myself; Levy Cohen then took out the notes, and said, here are six fives, and five twos.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of notes did they appear to be? - A. I cannot read or write, but they appeared to me to look like Bank notes;

             said, do you think they will buy them; I said, I dare say they would, and gave Cohen the pocket-book again in his hand; they asked me when I would go to Jemmy Ogden and Ikey Bull, they told me to ask them twenty-five pounds for the notes, and to take no less; I told them I would go towards the evening, and towards the evening I went to the Blue Anchor in Petticoat-lane, and there I saw Cohen and Jacobs; then we all three went together as far as Newgate-street, and at the corner of Newgate-street I left them; Levi Cohen gave me the pocketbook, and said, mind, take no less than twenty-five pounds for the forty pound's worth of notes; then I went into Newgate, and saw James Ogden, I sold him the pocket-book for twenty-five pounds, he gave me three five pound notes, and the rest in cash.</p>

He had not, Ikey Bull furnished something, but how much I cannot tell; when I came away, I saw Cohen and Jacobs in the road, by the coach rank, in the Old-Bailey, I told them I had sold the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170036"/>notes, and gave them the money; they called for a coach directly, and Ephraim Jacobs said, you have no occasion to get into the coach, you must get somebody to go and let them know they are forged notes; I said, do you mean forged notes; says

No, I had not; they told the coachman to drive to Whitechapel, and desired me to call at the Blue Anchor in Petticoat-lane; I afterwards went to the Blue Anchor, and told them I met a girl in Cheapside, and sent her to tell them; and that Jemmy Ogden had told her I might go to hell, and she along with me;

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more about it? - A. Yes; I went along with the thieving boy who lives with Cohen; Cohen asked him if he knew a good sence, Jacobs was present.</p>
               <p>Q. What is a sence? - A. A receiver of stolen goods; they would not trust the boy to go alone, and desired me to go with him; I went with him, and took a pocket-book with forty pound's worth of notes in it, to one Jacobs, a glass-flowerer, in Petticoat-lane, the boy gave Mr. Jacobs the notes; Jacobs took the notes in his hand, but refused to keep them, because, he said, they were all forged; I went back with the boy, and told them what he said; the pocket-book and notes were returned to the prisoners; and that is all I know.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character. <rs id="t18020217-36-verdict191" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you recollect having any parcel from Mattocks, directed for Mr. Charles Smith, of Bunhill-row? - A. Yes, a little deal box; I took it till I got just beyond Whitebread's brewhouse, the prisoner at the bar came up to me -</p>

            Between twelve and one, he asked me whether I was going to Mr. Smith's -</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it? - A. On the Tuesday; I told him; he said, you young dog, why did you not bring it before; I told him I could not conveniently bring it before, for it came in but last night; he said, I know better than that, for it came in yesterday; says he, I have not money enough now, you must bring it here; going along Bunhill-row, he said, I have got money enough now, and gave me two shillings, I gave him four pennyworth of halfpence in change; he then went as far as the first pair of gates up Bunhill-row, on the left-hand side of the way; there was a parcel of women, he talked to them upwards of a minute, and as I had been served such a trick when I was a school-boy, I followed him up as far as Mr. Smith's court; I crossed over to the court, and saw the gate shut too after him; then I thought I had delivered it right; I charged one shilling and eightpence for the carriage, but it was not the proper charge; I got as far as the India-house, and then I found I was wrong; I went back to Mr. Smith's to rectify the mistake, and they told me no parcel had been there; I saw the prisoner again on the Friday following, at the office in Hatton-garden; there were thirteen or fourteen together, and I picked out the prisoner; I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long is it that you have been quite sure the prisoner is the man? - A. When I saw him at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. No, you were not, I was there, you know? - A. I did not know him when I first went in, till they desired him to stand up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, at the last examination, that you were not quite certain, but you believed he was the man? - A. I did not say so, I was always sure he was the man.</p>

            Has it happened that you have been in Newgate yourself? - A. No, never; I was locked up three hours in Worship-street, because they said I was connected with the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give a description of the person who took the box from you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been walking about two or three days to find him out? - A. No; I went one day through all the little courts and alleys to see if I could find him.</p>

               <p>ANN IVES sworn. - On Saturday, the 6th of this month, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner at the bar was sent to fetch some pots to scour; I live in the house in which my aunt lives, who employs the prisoner; she was sent to Mr. Everitt's, and, on her return, about half past nine o'clock, I saw her come on tip-toe, into the passage of the house where my aunt lives; she took the basket from off her head, and placed it on the bannisters of the one pair of stairs; from there she placed it in the passage against the back parlour door; she took either a pint or a quart pot out of the basket, but her hand concealing a part of it, I could not tell which, and put it into her pocket; after that she went down stairs, and, on my going down, I met her coming up stairs again to fetch some more pots from another house to be cleaned; she took down the remainder of the pots, and brought up an empty basket to fetch another load; upon her return back with that load, it was not then ten o'clock, I said to her, Mrs. Spooner, you must now deliver to me the property that you have in your pocket belonging to Mr. Everitt; upon that she refused, and very stoutly resisted; I then said, I saw her put pots in her pocket; she then pulled out a small pocket; I said, upon my soul, that will not do, I saw you put pots in your pocket; I then shook her by the side, and, to my great surprise, these two pots sell out of her pocket; I did not expect to find more than one; I, not knowing the law, was afraid to take them, and made her return them to the; she gave me a pint first, and then a quart; when she had given them, she said, there, now you have got them, you can neither prove me a thief, nor yet transport me. (The pots were produced, and identified by Everitt.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to Mr. Everitt's, the basket would not hold all the pots, and I put these into my pocket; I did not take them out of the house; but when Mrs. Ives charged me with it, I gave her them directly; I had worked a year and a half for her aunt; she said she would transport me, and if she could not Mr. Everitt should.</p>

               <p>PETER WARD sworn. - On the 23d of January, between two and three o'clock, I lost a game cock, from <placeName id="t18020217-42-crimeloc222">Sloane-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Is that boy here? - A. No, I have not seen him since; I took the prisoner before Mr. Bond, who was sitting at the Prince of Wales's, and there another bag was found upon him, but nothing in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sowl dead, or alive? - A. Alive.</p>
               <p>SARAH WARD sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness; I saw a man, whom I believe to be the prisoner, just before the sowl was missing, but I cannot swear he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Prisoner's defence. I was going to work at Mr. Benwell's, in Sloane-street, all night; I was running pretty fast down Sloane-street, when this man came up, and said I had stole his sowl; it is a very likely story that I should steal his sowl, and come past the door again within an hour after.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18020217-42-verdict223" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - On Tuesday the 9th of this month, I was passing along, and observed a man run out of the Castle and Falcon yard with a parcel upon his shoulder, he was going with a degree of violence that excited my suspicion; I followed him up St. Ann's-lane, through Maiden-lane, and Lad-lane, and when he came to St. Lawtences's Church, there was resting-place for porters, he there stopped for the space of half a minute; he then went forward through Throg morton-street into Bartholomew-lane, he stopped by the side of the Bank, took a knife out of his pocket, and cut off the direction; he then proceeded up Cornhill, and Leadenhall-street, down Billiter-lane, across Fenchurch-street, into Church-passage, where the India warehouses are; when he got there, he threw away the direction, which I picked up, that circumstance confirmed my suspicions; I followed him into Seething-lane, I mentioned my suspicions to one of the porters of the India-house, requesting that he would go with me; we followed him to the steps leading from Tower-street to Tower-hill, he there pitched the parcel down upon the steps; the man who was with me accosted him - you seem to have got a heavy load, my friend; - no, not very heavy, was his reply; - have you got far to carry it; - not very far. I then asked him where he had brought it from; he said from Billingsgate, from on board a Gravesend-boat; I told him, I apprehended he had made a mistake, he had not been to Billingsgate lately, and I must beg leave to send for a constable, which I did, (produces the direction); I had never lost fight of the prisoner; his face came almost in contact with mine at first coming out of the gateway; I am sure he is the man.</p>

            Suppose you had seen it at York, would you have sworn to it? - A. No; but I saw the prisoner come from our shop with it.</p>
               <p>Boot. We mark all the quarters differently; I kill a great many sheep for graziers, and we are obliged to mark them differently that we may know them one from another.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. When they are cut for the Jews, they only mark the sides, and, I believe, there are people in Court, that can testify they never saw a pair of hind quarters marked.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it? - A. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170049"/>moon had been down about twenty minutes or more; a man came up to me with a pistol in his hand, and said, stop and deliver your money, or I will blow your brains out; I then saw three other men; I made answer to him, are you going to spill the blood of a man that never hurt you in his life? I told him I earned but nine shillings a week, and hardly that, how could he think of robbing such poor people as us; he then told us to go along; then I saw one of the men in the cart; there was nothing in the cart but two old chairs, an old sack, and a nose-bag, that I had to give my horse some corn; then I saw my kinsman knocked down, and a short man in a smock-frock came from the off side with a pistol in his hand, and ran it into my eye; I could not see for some time; I rubbed my eye, and he then shoved the pistol into my throat; I still kept following him up, and then there came another behind me with a pistol and a stick, and he kept paying me as hard as he could upon my head with the stick and pistol; he cut my head on both sides; I tacked about to the man behind me, and the other man with the pistol came up and payed me over the head and back with his pistol again; that was the short man; I begged for mercy, but I had none, and so it was of no use to ask for it; they gave me a number of blows after I begged for mercy, and then they took my great coat from me; the blood was pouring down from my head in streams.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the great coat you wore? - A. Yes; the collar was all over blood, and my shirt was as if it was dipped in a blood-tub, all about the neck and shoulders; I lost six shillings, but I don't think they took it out of my pocket; I might have lost it in the skirmish; I cannot swear to either of the men; I think I could have sworn to the short man in the smock-frock.</p>

             sworn. - I am the nephew of the last witness; on the 10th of January, I had two sisters come from town, and a brother-in-law, and another acquaintance, to see me; my uncle said, if you will stop a little later at night, I will borrow a horse and cart; we came to town, and going back as far as Kingstand, we stopped and had something to drink; then we came on to the Jolly Butcher's-hill, I walked, and my uncle said he was very cold, and would walk up the hill too; I was whipping the horse along, and my uncle was behind, with his hand upon the tail-board, and going by Ball's-pond, a man came up in a smock-frock, and said, d - n your eyes, stop, I said, stop, for what, and before I could well say a word, I had a blow on the side of my head; they very much beat my uncle, and took his great-coat from him; it was a great-coat with brass metal buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the persons of any of them? - A. There were five of them altogether, two in smock-frocks, and three in long coats; when they bid us go away, there were only four, but neither of those four had our clothes, but from what I saw of them, by the light, I have no doubt the prisoner was one of the party.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a dark night? - A. The moon had been gone down about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, and the stars were all gone in; it was quite cloudy, but the snow on the ground gave rather a light.</p>

My nephew, living in my house; he came home with me in the coach with his great coat on; he hung his great coat upon a deg in the passage of the dining-room, and that was missing; I then made some enqulty among the servants; I went down stairs, and viewed the door of the house leading into Lombard-street; the house extends from Cornhill to Lombard-street; it was evident the lock had been taken off on the inside, because the heads of the bolts which fastened it on, were on the outside in the street, and screwed with nuts on the inside, and the bolt of the door shoots into the door-post, so that the door being double locked, it was impossible to get the door open without taking the lock off; I found the lock lying inside of the house, close to the door; there were appearances, as if something had been used to wrench the lock off; the door was bruised; the bottom hinge of the door that leads to the cellar, was wrenched off, and the bolt that fastened it, had a variety of seratches; apparently in endeavouring to put it back.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any shavings in that cellar? - A. In the cellar of that house there were a great many shavings, because there had been men at work in the house; I then went to the Mansion-house; and got Mr. Canner, the under marshal, to come and view the place; Mr. Canner came with Cartwright and Read.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner, Parsey, taken up? - A. Three or four days after; I had seen him in my house glazing and cleaning the windows; he was journeyman to the glazier that I employed, who lives in Queen-street, Cheapside, and has a shop in Grocer's-alley; the prisoner lived in Chimney Sweepers'-court, Wood-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Parsey? - A. Yes; the first time I ever saw him was on the 8th of November last, at a house in Gloucester-court, Whitecross street; there were James Parsey, James Ricketts, Richard White, and two young women; the prisoner said he had been cleaning windows at Mr. Bish's, in Cornhill, that day, and he had got something out of the house that day to the amount of five or six shillings; he made use of many bad expressions, and said, he saw more things in the house, and he would be d - d if he would not have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170051"/>some more before it was long: On Wednesday morning, the 6th of January, about eleven o'clock, I was going up Cornhill; there were some men sticking up bills, by which bills I saw that Mr. Bish's house had been robbed, and it struck me directly that Parsey was the man who had robbed the house; I then went in pursuit of Persey to different places, but did not find him till the Friday; I came up with Parsey, Gill, Raymond, and a person of the name of Holloway, in Barbican; I followed them along Barbican sometime; I heard them talking to each other; Parsey said he had hid two large silver table spoons, half a dozen small spoons, and four guineas, in the cellar of the house in which he lived, in Chimney Sweepers'-court; I followed them a little farther, and Gill wanted to know what I was following them for; he said he was sure I had no business to follow them; I then crossed over the way, and left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Bish's name made use of in that conversation? - A. Parsey said he had been in a good thing in Cornill, at Mr. Bish's house, he had got all the plate out of the house that he saw; he said he was in the house from half past four o'clock in the afternoon, till three in the morning: On the Monday following, I was at a house in Golden-lane; I saw Raymond, Holloway, and Gill, they were angry with each other, that they had not had more of the money that Parsey sold the plate for; Holloway said, if he had known he was to have no more, sooner than he would have taken that, he would have cut his throat; Raymond said, they should have had more, if there had been no noise about the plate that was stolen, and then it was mentioned that Parsey had hid these things in the cellar; then I went to Mr. Bish's, and gave him information of what I had heard.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>

               <p>Q. Has he any other name? - A. He has a bye-name; they call him Putty; he is a glazier.</p>

            Where did you live on the 6th of January? - A. At that time I kept the Black Horse, in Aldersgate-street; the prisoner frequented my house: On the 6th of January, about seven o'clock in the morning, he came to my house, and brought a wrapper under his arm; I said to him, Parsey, for God's sake, what have you got there? Parsey said, what I have got I deserve; I said, in the name of fortune, what is that; he said, it is plate; I said, for God's sake, where did you get it? Parsey replied, no person knows, nor ever shall know; I said to him, are they all spoons? he said, no, I have a salt; he shewed me the salt; it was an old-fashioned one, with three feet to it; to the best of my knowledge there was 
               <persName id="t18020217-52-person644">T.B. </persName>
            upon the feet; he told me he had got into the house about four o'clock in the afternoon; I never saw any other plate but the falt; he said, he had got in at the back door in Lombard-street, and from there he proceeded to a lower apartment, and got under some shavings; during the time he was there, the maid came into the place, and said, I have got some wood somewhere here, but I cannot find it; some man that was there, replied, perhaps it is among the shavings; and the maid said, I am sure it is not there; hesaid, he then concealed himself there till about half past three the next morning; that he then pulled a hinge off the door, by doing which it gave him liberty to go where the property was; that when he got to the plate, he thought he must have left it behind him, by reason he had so much trouble to get the lock off the door; he said, the door was double-locked, and he was obligated to take it off; he said, with a deal of difficulty he did do it, and got safe away with the plate; after he had been at my house some time, the prisoner Gill came in; they consulted together a little while, and then they went away with the property, under Parsey's arm; when they had been gone about an hour and a half, they returned without the property; then they had some sheep's hearts; they stopped about an hour, and then went out again together; I went out, and returned between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and, to my surprise, there were people fighting in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Who were they? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-52-person645">A. </persName>
            Parsey and Gill; I said to them, for God's sake, what is all this noise about? if you are not quiet, and disperse the house, I will send for an officer to take you all up; then Gill said, Parsey owes me a guinea; I said to Parsey, if you owe the man a guinea, give it him; upon that parsey went into my parlour, and pulled out of his pocket ten guineas and four half-guineas; then he put a guineas into my hand to give to Gill, which I did; then he took the remainder of the money, put it in his pocket, and left my house; Gill went away before him; Parsey said, he would give the rest of his money to John Horsley, the only friend he had; Horsley lives next door to my house; Horsley was not there at that time; I was sent for before the Lord-Mayor, and told him what I knew.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not go before the Lord-Mayor till you were sent for? - A. No, I did not.</p>

            Don't you think, as an honest man, it was your duty to have gone to the Lord-Mayor, without waiting to have been sent for? - A. The reason I did not go was, I did not understand it, I had not been long in London; I came from Essex.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not a crime to steal in Essex? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a reward of fifty pounds- you have seen the hand-bills? - A. I don't look forward for that.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not ask you that - I ask you if you have seen it? - A. Yes, I have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you a bosom-friend, to whom he communicated this secret? - A. No, he was only a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you would have us understand he told you this story about the plate? - A. Yes, by reason of my asking him what he had got there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he lives? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he left the house at half past three in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And thought four hours had elapsed from the time of the robbery till he came to your house, he came with the things in his hand, when he might have taken them home or elsewhere, if he had pleased? - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q. This man had the nick-name of Putty? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never know a glazier nick-named Putty before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you heard of Mr. Bish's robbery? - A. The next day.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not know that the back part of Mr. Bish's house came into Lombard-street? - A. No, I did not know what part of London it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Not know where Lombard-street is? - A. I had never been in that part of the town; if I had, I did not know it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the wife of the last witness? - A. I am.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes, both of them: On the 6th of January, I saw them both at our house, about eight o'clock in the morning; I did not hear any conversation between them; after they had been in some time, they went away together; I did not see them come in, nor I did not see any thing they had; they came in again in the forenoon, stopped a little while, and then went out again; in the afternoon they came in again, when my husband was not at home; they went out backwards to speak to each other; and, after they had spoke to each other, they began to fight, and I was very much frightened; I desired one or two persons that I knew, to prevent their fighting, as I was alone, and in a few minutes my husband came in; I thought they were picking a pocket, and I called to my husband to go and part them, and so he did, and they went out almost directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. That was a queer suspicion - you don't have pockets picked, I hope? - A. I should be very sorry if I had.</p>
               <p>Q. If they had a bundle, I take it you must have seen it? - A. I did not see it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ARMFIELD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know the prisoner, Gill? - A. Yes: On Wednesday, the 6th of January, in the evening, I was at the Black Horse, in Aldersgate-street; Gill asked me to pawn a great coat for him; he said, it had been given to him, and it was too little; I pawned it for four shillings in Aldersgate-street, and he gave me the duplicate for my trouble; after that I wore the coat near three weeks, and then gave it to a woman, of the name of Daly, to pawn it for me for four shillings; I should know it again by a particular mark in the right skirt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What was the coat worth? - A. It might be worth half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. And this gentleman was generous enough to give you a ticket worth six shillings and six-pence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

            You did not think fit to pawn the coat yourself, though you did for your friend? - A. I thought as I had worn it, Mrs. Daly might get as much for it as I did before.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not think if you pawned it your self, it might be the more easily traced to you? - A. No, if I had thought the coat had been stolen, I should not have worn it three weeks publicly in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you lived lately? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-52-person651">A. </persName>

In the shop there is but one drawer kept locked, in which I generally keep small valuable articles, and which had been wrenched from the bench; about this time they brought the prisoner to ask if I knew him; I found the watchman pushing up his face forcibly for me to see it; I called him inadvertently by a wrong name, but finding I knew him, he went down upon his knees, and begged I would forgive him; I would not hear him, but ordered them to carry him to the watch-house; he had been in my service five or six months, and had quitted it about a month or five weeks; he knew the house near as well as I did; I cannot swear positively he is the man that first passed me, but I believe he is; the boy, who slept there, will stare how the house was shut up; they must have got in at an aperture to the cellar, to which there is only a slap; we placed our confidence in a strong door at the top of the cellar stairs, which they had opened with a crow, of which I saw the marks; and the strong staples fixed in the wood were drawn out; that door gave them the power of the whole house; I searched the the prisoner's lodgings the next day, but found nothing of our's; his wife attended us, and shewed us every part of the rooms with the greatest readiness, and I believe knew nothing of the matter.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: About a quarter before one, a gentleman came to me with a drawn bayonet, and told me his house was broke open, and wished me to go along with him; we went up the court towards his cellar window, where there stood a lusty man in a light-coloured great coat; the gentleman stopped, and asked him where he had been; he said, up the court; he asked him what he had been doing; he said, it was nothing to him. Mr. Troughton desired him to stop, and was going to take hold of him, but he rushed from him, and struck him in the face; I made a blow at him, but missed him, and then I sprung my rattle; the prisoner is not the man who first came down the court; I pursued the first man, and as we went down to the gate, two other men came upon the back of us, but I did not see where they came from; they must have been in the court before us, as it is no thoroughfare; those men and Mr. Troughton had a sort of skirmish together by the gate, but they forced it open, and run away; I pursued them, and was told one of them had run up Wine-Office-court; we went up, and, after looking about some time, a gentleman got up, and looked over a gate into a garden or yard, and there was the prisoner stuck up in a corner close to the wall. I laid hold of him, but cannot say whether he is one of the three; I am sure he is not the first man; when we took him, he desired us to let him stop to look for one of his stockings that he had lost; I then observed he was without a shoe and stocking; I found one of his shoes in Wine-Office-court; we then took him to Mr. Troughton, who said, how came you to use me so? and the prisoner directly put his hands together, and asked for pardon, saying, he would never be guilty of the like again; then he was taken to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH GREGORY sworn. - I am a constable, and was at the Pantheon, on the 8th of February; I did not know the prisoner, but saw him getting behind a hackney-coach, and several people trying to get hold of him, saying, he was a pick pocket; I immediately catched hold of him, and pulled him down, upon which he struggled and fought very much: an officer belonging to Marlborough street came up; and as we were dragging him out of the kennel, we saw this pocket book drop from him, which the officer picked up; we then took him into the Pantheon, and searched his coat pocket; I took four handkerchiefs out, and some pieces of cotton; the officer took some out of another, and then we took him to the watch-house; going along the prisoner threw himself down, d - d his eyes, and said he would go no farther; we expected he would be rescued, his companions were so numerous; at last we charged a soldier to assist us, who fixed his bayonet, or else we should not have secured the prisoner; when we got him to the watch-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170063"/>house, the prosecutor said he had lost his book, which he described, and which was the same as dropped from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JACKSON sworn. - I belong to Marlborough-street: On the 8th of February, it being Masquerade night, I went to the Pantheon, about a quarter past eleven; I saw the prisoner endeavouring to escape, and helped to apprehend him, as Mr. Gregory has said.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where do you live? - A. I live in Long-lane, and am a steel-worker, and make fancy ornaments; Armfield and Harrison have worked for me, and Armfield often persuaded Harrison to go ut at nights with him, and leave his work; I suspected that Armfield had robbed me, which I told him, and he left his work in consequence of it, for fear I should prosecute him; he did not come for three months after; he sent persons to me to beg me to take him in again, as he was leading a bad course of life.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did you accuse him with taking of? - A. Combs, and different things; he came to me again, in consequence of his friends saying they would be bound for him, and was with me about three months, during which time I gave him some little gold to melt, but when it came to be worked, it turned black, as though he had put brass in it; and I had bought a handkerchief, which he wished to have, and said, he would pay me for it; I said, no, but he went down stairs, and told my wife that I said he might have it, and took it away; he worked for me sixteen months in the whole, but I never knew of his being examined<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170066"/>before a Magistrate; I have heard him talk about stealing dead bodies, and selling them for two guineas a-piece, and that it was better to do that than any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. From your knowledge of him, is he a man you would believe on his oath? - A. No, he is not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long did you say the prisoner had lived with you? - A. Ten years; he served seven years to us; if I had not thought him honest, I should not have kept him.</p>

            I believe you are clerk to Mr. Lee? - A. I am, and was on the 24th of February; this freightnote was brought to me but I cannot say what day; these sort of notes are generally left a week or two, to see whether the freight is correct; sometime after it was left, I made payment for it by a draft on Newnham, Everett, and Drummond, of 21l. 12s. 9d. (Produces the draft.)</p>
               <p>Q Do you know whether you paid it to the prisoner, or not? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q Did the person who come put his name on the back? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you remember the person who put his name on it? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-80-person816">A. </persName>
            No; and the reason why I am so certain the person put his name to it is, that I always draw up the drafts, and see the persons who take them put their names on the backs of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mr Peddr, shewing him the draft.)</p>

After he was committed at the Mansion-house, he said, if I would stop the prosecution, he and his brother would transport themselves to any part of the world we pleased, which I refused; we paid him forty-five pounds a year, and his board and lodging, but did not allow him any thing else; he entered, in his own hand-writing, "Received of Mr. Fraser, eighty pounds;" and, in another book, "By allowance for ornaments and abatements, 3l. 6s. 6d." We never gave leave to make abatements without a note from us.</p>

Yes: I had employed a person of the name of Mary Pettit, to few up publications for many years past; she has sewed many thousands of Dr. Wright's Family Bible, which were delivered to her in quires; but I never sold any in quires. In consequence of information I received, I went to Mr. Davis, a cheesemonger, on the 14th of last month, about nine o'clock in the evening, with Mr. Gill; we found, on examination, one hundred and twenty-four pounds weight of paper, which I got back again, and paid him at the rate of three-pence per pound Eighty-two pounds were mine, enough to render three or four hundred pounds worth of books imperfect; there were three numbers of the Bible also, and two numbers of the Lady's Magazine; I have no doubt they all belonged to me; I saw the prisoner the day after, about four o'clock in the afternoon; I made her no promise or threat, but I asked her several questions about the paper, and she told me she stole them by degrees from Mrs. Pettit's house, and tied them up in a parcel, which she took in her apron, and carried to some receptacle, where she kept them till they accumulated to a large quantity, and had done so for years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The prisoner was not employed by you? - A. No, by her sister, as a chair-woman.</p>

            Other persons serve in your shop? - A. Yes, Mr. Kelly, my clerk, is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, upon your oath, that they have not sold these articles? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-88-person872">A. </persName>
            Certainly it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a perquisite of waste paper in the trade, is not there? - A. No, I never heard of it; I know thee is no such custom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not make a promise, or tell her it would be better for her? - A. No, I never heard it said; I believe none was ever made.</p>
               <p>MARY PETTIT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. In Angel-street, Butcherhall-hall, St. Martin's-le-Grand, and was employed by Mr. Hogg to stitch books for him; the prisoner is my husband's sister, and has assisted me in the household work, but I had never missed any of the books he trusted to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know any thing of those numbers charged in the indictment, of how they came into possession of the prisoner? - A. Not at all; I know nothing about it; I gave her leave to take waste paper from my house, but, as to numbers, I cannot conceive how they could come among waste paper; neither numbers or quires are waste paper.</p>
               <p>RICHARD DAVIS sworn. - I am a cheesemonger, in Lincoln's-Inn-fields: I bought one hundred and seventy-four pounds weight of paper of the prisoner, for three-pence per pound, and delivered to Mr. Hogg one hundred and twenty-four pounds; I had used the other; that which Mr. Hogg received had remained on the shelf from the time I bought it; I did not notice that it was in quires; it was not in the same state that it is now, because it was tied up in a rough manner, with paper of different sorts, what I call waste.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You cannot venture to swear to it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you enquire who she was? - A. I understood, when I bought it, that she had sold to the man who kept the shop before me; she said, she had friends in that way; I bought it was waste paper.(

             and I were looking at some watches in a window, in the Minories, when the prisoner came up and asked me, if I wanted to buy a watch, I said, I did not; he said, he had got a very good one to sell, better than either of those in the window; I told him, I did not think so; he said, he was in distress, and had not a farthing to help himself with, and would sell it cheap; says he, look at it, there is no harm: I made answer, what do you ask for it? he said, two guineas and an half; I told him, I had only fourteen shillings? he asked me if I had two seven shilling-pieces; I said, yes; then, says he, I'll take your money; I told him, I would not give it him before I examined the watch; we then went up Hanover-court, in the Minories, I looked at the watch, and consented to give him the two seven-shilling-pieces for it, which I did, and put the watch into my waistcoat-pocket; he then wanted twenty-four shillings for it; I told him, I had not got so much, but that I had two shillings and sixpence in silver, which I would give him; he said, he would take no less, and began to make a bobbery about it, wanting the watch again; I said, you have no occasion to make any words, return me my money, and you may have your watch; one of the seven-shilling-pieces which I had given him was bent, and the other flat; I then gave him the watch again, and he gave me these two counterfeits which I have here, (produces them;) I put them in my left-hand pocket, and he and Sexton immediately left me; I had no suspicion that he had given me bad money, but when I got out of the court, I looked at them by a light in a window, and afterwards founded them on the stones; Sexton and he were gone on, and when I observed they were both flat, I went after him, and called out,

            , have you seen any thing of that man? he said, yes, here he is; says I, he has given me two bad seven-shilling-pieces, upon which the prisoner run off immediately; I pursued him, I suppose, for a quarter of a mile; when I came up with him, he asked me if I wanted his life; I said, no, I wanted my good money; he said, he did not know any thing about it; I said, I'll be upon my oath you offered to sell me the watch; he denied it, and said, I know nothing about it, I have not got a watch; then another man came up, and touched him on the elbow, upon which he resigned him a small purse, or bag, and something like a watch; I saw the chain, which was the same, I had had in my hand; Sexton said to me, hold him fast, that is the man who has got the watch, the man immediately set off, and Sexton after him, but came back without him; as I lost sight of him, the prisoner was given in charge of a constable, and searched; there was found on him, two guineas, four half-guineas, and four seven-shilling-pieces; before they searched him, I said, depend upon it, you will find a bent seven-shilling-piece in his pocket, which they did, and it is bent exactly like mine.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you try your seven-shilling-pieces on the stones in the course of the day before this happened? - A. Yes, when I went to find my ship agent, at the Bull-head in St. Catherine's, where I took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was this to Tower-hill? - A. Two hundred yards or more, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get your livelihood? - A. In the sea-faring line, which I have been in sixteen or seventeen years, and am master of a vessel, now called the Speedwell, which failed last Saturday week without me, on account of this business.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen a bent seven-shilling-piece before in your life? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no particular marks on that you gave him? - A. No, only bent.</p>
               <p>Q. The watch would have been a good purchase for two good seven-shilling-pieces? - A. I did not want it, only he told me he was in distress.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you show the money to any body in the public-house? - A. Yes, to as many as liked to see it, but it was never out of my sight, and I shewed it to Mr. Norman, at the Bull, and the ship agent, they both said they were bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all the people who saw them, say they were bad, or did some say they were bad, and some say they were good? - A. Yes, all of them said they were bad.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us how it happened? - A. Lucas and I stopped, as he has stated, and up came Michael Michael astern of us; the prisoner is the man; he said, he could sell a better watch than any there, and cheaper; but, says he, come a little lower down, for I dare not be seen selling a watch opposite a watchmaker's-shop; we went into a court, and shewed 
               <persName id="t18020217-89-person886">Lucas</persName>
             the watch, he said Lucas should have it for fourteen shillings; then, says Lucas, I cannot be cheated of above thirteen and sixpence, let it be as it will; another man was walking in our stern while Lucas and I were bargaining for the watch; Lucas pulled his purse out, and took out two seven shilling-pieces, and the prisoner kept looking into the purse to see what he had; Lucas took the two seven-shilling-pieces out, one of which was bent, and gave them to the Jew, and put the watch into his waistcoat-pocket; the Jew turned round to look at the two seven-shilling-pieces, and then turned about to Captain Lucas, and said, I made the agreement with you for twenty-four shillings; Lucas said, my friend, if you repent your bargain, return me my two seven shilling-pieces again, and you shall have your watch; which he did, and took the watch; the Jew then left us, and went down the Minories; Captain Lucas was desirous of purchasing the watch in about ten minutes after, and we went after the Jew, having no suspicion that he had cheated him; I was first, and overtook him at the top of the Minories, I tapped him on the shoulder, and said, my friend, I am come to purchase the watch you offered for sale in the court; he said, I never saw you before in my life; I looked at him very hard, and said, I'll lay you a guinea that you are the person that offered the watch in the court, for twenty-four shillings; I am sure he is the man; Lucas being a long way aftern, having his great coat on, I left the Jew, and met Lucas, who said, that refeal has done me of my two seven-shilling-pieces; upon which the prisoner turned round, and ran as hard as he could; I pursued him, and brought him up just athwart the Bull-Inn, Whitechapel; a man came and touched him on the elbow, and took something out of his hand like a purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed that man before? - A. It was the man that had been walking under out stern in the court; I said, Lucas, you stop the Jew, and I think I can catch the other; I ran after him, but lost him; when I came back, I found the prisoner at the Bull-Inn, where he was searched, but I cannot say what was found upon him.</p>

               <p>Q. If any body could have seen what it was, could you if the light would have permitted you? - A. Yes; but it was done in an instant.</p>
               <p>DANIEL KEMP sworn. - I am one of the City constables; Hanover-court, in the Minories, is in the City of London: I was sent for on the 14th of January, and took the prisoner into custody, Lucas charged him with giving him two bad seven-shilling-pieces; I don't exactly know how much gold there was found on him, because I gave it him back again; to the best of my knowledge there were four seven-shilling-pieces, and amongst them a crooked one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you find any watch on him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. My Lord, this is an indictment for an offence under the 15th George II, which says, That if any person whatsoever shall, after the said 29th day of September, offer, or tender in payment, any false or counterfeit money, knowing the same to be false and counterfeit, to any person or persons, and shall, either within the same day, or within the space of ten days then next, utter, or tender in payment, any more, or other false or counterfeit money, knowing the same to be false or counterfiet, to the same person or persons, or shall, at the time of uttering or tendering, have about him or her, or in his or her custody, one or more piece or pieces of counterfeit money beside what was so uttered, or tendered, then such person, so uttering and tendering the same, shall be deemed and taken to be a common utterer of false money, and being convicted thereof, shall suffer a year's imprisonment, and shall find sureties for his or her good behaviour for two years more, to be computed from the end of the said year; and if any person, having been once so convicted as a common utterer of false money, shall afterwards again utter, or tender in payment, any false or counterfeit money, to any person or persons, knowing the same to be false or counterfeit, then such person, being thereof convicted, shall, for such offence, be, an is hereby adjudged to be, guilty of felony with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170072"/>out benefit of clergy. My Lord, I apprehend, that this indictment does not sufficiently state that the prisoner has been found guilty, in the Court below, of that offence, which, in the terms of the Act of Parliament, are necessary to make him a common utterer; and for want of that statement, though he is represented to have received the punishment of a common utterer, I contend, that the indictment is not sufficient. In the Court below, there is no occasion to state more than they have, namely, that he did utter, and that he had about him other bad money, but that does not meet this objection, which is, that having been so convicted as a common utterer, (that is by inference), it should have stated he was found guilty of being a common utterer, and had the punishment of a common utterer; the original indictment, or the judgment proceeding on it, have neither stated that he was a common utterer; and, I submit, I have a right to argue, because it is stated as part of the record, that if it did not appear, the Court acted on the offence, and adjudged him to the punishment; it wanting that averment, it is bad; it appears to me, the averment should be found on the face of this record, that the Jury found him guilty of being a common utterer, the charge being that he was a common utterer. That is the form of the objection; and, I confess, I have very considerable doubts whether it ought not to be stated.</p>
               <p>Court. I wish you would advert to the first clause, which says, And whereas the uttering of false money knowing it to be false, is a crime frequently committed all over the kingdom, and the offenders therein are not deterred, by reason of it being only a misdemeanor, and the punishment very often but small, though there be great reason to believe, that the common utterers of such false money are either themselves the coiners, or in confederacy with the coiners thereof; for preventing whereof, be it hereby further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any person whatsoever, shall, after the 29th day of September, utter, or tender in payment, any false or counterfeit money, knowing the same to be false or counterfeit, to any person or persons, and shall be thereof convicted, such person, so offending, shall suffer six months imprisonment, and find sureties for his or her good behaviour for six months more, to be computed from the end of the said first six months; and if the same person shall afterwards be convicted a second time of the like offence of uttering, or tendering in payment, any false or counterfeit money, knowing the same to be so, such person shall, for such second offence, suffer two years imprisonment, and find sureties for his or her good behaviour for two years more, to be computed from the end of the said first two years; and if the same person shall afterwards offend a third time, in uttering, or tendering in payment, any false or counterfeit money, knowing the same to be so, and shall be convicted of such third offence, he or she shall be, and is hereby adjadged to be, guilty of felony without benefit of clergy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. My Lord, In addition to this, I will observe, the words are, that when such facts are proved, the person charged shall be taken to be a common utterer; I submit, that you cannot, in this case, where you are to collect the facts of what passed before another jurisdiction, from the record which brings them before you,(for you cannot get at the parole testimony) unless you can see on the face of the record that he was a common utterer; then I say it is not complied with, and, therefore, this indictment is not good. I don't say it would be necessary to be charged if we were sitting in Surry, but I contend, upon the face of the record sent here, supposed to contain every thing that it should be charged, and that you cannot say, proceeding on these facts, (for nothing is to be intended against a man's life) that he was convicted of being a common utterer, when only from the facts which are stated you can infer he was a common utterer. Your Lordship is called upon to say, that the Court below had deemed that man a common utterer, the consequence of which will be, that if he commits another offence he must answer it with his life. I say it does not appear, except by inference, from any thing the Court below has stated, and for want of that averment in this record, it appears to me, this indictment is bad in that particular; and, from the humanity you have already expressed to-day, I am sure you will not bereave the prisoner of the advantage arising from, or, if your Lordship thinks it is fit, for the opinion of the Judges. I will state the precise objection I take:</p>

               <p>My Lord, I have been submitting, that I consider it necessary for the Court to see, on the face of this record, that, by the judgment of the Court of Quarter-Sessions, they acted on the conviction that he was a common utterer, and therefore they punished him according to the Act of Parliament. I apprehend it should be, that he was considered and adjudged, by the Court of Sessions, to be a common utterer, and that therefore he be imprisoned one year, and at the end and expiration of that time, to find sureties for two years, to be computed from the end of the said year. In the case of the King and Smith, it was held, that it need not be because it was a conclusion of law; but here it is a conclusion of law and fact; the judgment of the Court acting on a question of law; therefore, I do apprehend there is a great distinction between the case of the King and Smith and this; and trust that my client at the bar will have the benefit of the objection.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not feel the force of the objection; the very argument is against itself; - you say, it is not necessary, in any other Court, to state that he is a common utterer, because that is a conclusion of law; if it is not necessary, it cannot be necessary in the judgment, because, when you look into the record, it states the fact of this man having been tried for uttering, and that at the time of so uttering, he had one other piece of counterfeit money. You say, here it is necessary to state he is an utterer, and so they should in their judgment; when I look to the judgment, I see it is as upon a common utterer; the record states this, whereupon it was considered by the Court - what was considered? - All these facts, and the conclusion of law is, he is a common utterer; and having considered this, that he should be imprisoned in the common goal of the county aforesaid; then the Court has taken into consideration the offence as proved from the conclusion of law, and they put the punishment on him as a common utterer; it cannot be necessary for the Justices to give reasons why they passed the sentence, they are, by the Act of Parliament, to see whether it is the case of a common utterer, and if once they establish that, it is not necessary to charge a man below with being a common utterer. If, after the Jury have given their verdict, you chose to have the case reserved, I will do it, as I will never stand between the prisoner and any advantage that may possibly be derived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170073"/>from it; sitting here singly, I confess I have not a shadow of a doubt that the indictment is well laid; if you think otherwise, I will respite the judgment.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM DRAKE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What are you? - A. I am a linen-draper, in Ratcliff-highway: On the 16th of December last, I lost several pieces of striped cotton out of my shop, which I had seen eight or nine minutes before. On the 2d of January, I discovered a part at the shop of Mr Curling, a stop-seller, in Old Gravel-lane, the pieces had my mark, which I put on myself; in consequence of what he told me, he and I went to the shop of Mr. Clarke, where the defendant was introduced to me as the master; Rodgers, the officer, was waiting over the way, I asked the defendant to let me look at some ready made shirts; I found fault with all I saw, and told him I wanted a very narrow stripe; I pressed very hard, and at last the man brought me out a piece of narrow striped cotton not made into shirts; I examined it, and saw my own private mark, the defendant was not then present, but I sent Curling out to bring Rodgers; when he came, I told the shopman I wanted to see Mr. Clarke; he said, my master is below; when I saw him, I said he had got some of my striped cotton, and hoped he would tell me how he came by it; he said he did not know; I asked him what he gave per yard; he hesitated a little while, and said, I believe sixteen-pence, or sixteen-pence halfpenny; I asked him to recollect who he bought them of; he smiled, and said, I must confess I bought them of a Jew; we found several quantities out; the little narrow-stripe cost me two shillings, the others cost me one-and-twenty-pence, or one and twenty-pence-halfpenny; I asked him how they came to be cut into remnants; he said, for the convenience of his customers.</p>

            Yes, and is dead since; during his illness, the defendant managed the business, it is a wholesale warehouse for all sorts of things in a a very large way; I did not know a shop of more respectability.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Drake asked for the cotton, did not the young man shew it him as ready as could be? - A. Yes.</p>

            Without nesitation? - A. He said, he could not tell exactly how he got it; he rather hesitated at first, but afterwards he said, he believed he bought them of a Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. Do shops of respectability buy pieces of striped cotton of people who go about the street? - A. A shop of this description, I believe, does not, they buy them wholesale, by pieces. I was rather surprised he bought them, and did not know who he bought them of.(

Yes; he was alive at the time of this transaction, but so ill that he could not attend the shop; we are in an extensive concern, and had four men besides my brother; these articles were brought by a man whom we knew to be a dealer, but did not know his name, or his place of abode; my brother bought them, but was not acquainted with the article, having never bought any before; they were not in such small remnants as they are now; we cut them for the convenience of the customers, and we do not pretend to deal in new articles; I do not recollect the piece given, but I measured them, and the shop-woman paid for them with the money which belonged to my husband; the defendant had no interest whatever in it; sometimes we buy of a hundred people in a day.</p>
