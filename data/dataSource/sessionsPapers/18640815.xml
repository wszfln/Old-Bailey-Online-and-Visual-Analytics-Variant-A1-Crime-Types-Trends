                  </hi>. I am a banker and general merchant at 11, Rue Bergere, Paris—I carry on business there with two partners, under the firm of Le Grand, Tanco &amp; Co.—we had also an office at 117, Cheapside—in May, 1863, the prisoner was introduced to us by one of the partners in Messrs. Candy's house, and very highly recommended to us—they are large silk merchants—we afterwards agreed that the prisoner should become the agent for our house in London; he was to receive 4000 francs, which is equivalent to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, and-one per cent, on sales—I have the letter of instructions here, which was given to the prisoner before he left Paris—my partner engaged him—I know exactly what he said to him—I was not present; I had left for London—I said nothing to the prisoner before I gave him this letter of instructions—I approved of the instructions in London when he came over—(<hi rend="italic">This letter contained instructions to the prisoner that he should, before he made any sales, be satisfied as to the solvency and respectability of the buyers, that the books should be kept in the usual way of business, and that an extract from them should be sent every month to Paris</hi>)—The prisoner came to London at the end of May, 1863—he did very little business between that time and the end of December—I communicated to him in reference to his sales and transactions, and about December he came over to Paris—he said that the business began to promise, that he had begun to make good connections, and the only thing that he required in order to carry on a good and important business, was to have a stock of goods, which he said would be necessary about the spring, when the London season began—he said he had brought two buyers with him; he did not tell me their names then, or in his correspondence afterwards—I told him to introduce them to me, but he said he could not present them then, because they were very busy—he said they were buyers for some large English houses—on that statement I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186408150004"/>
               <p>gave him some directions as to the purchase of silks—he proceeded to Lyons to buy the stock that he wanted, and he also went to Switzerland—the amount of his purchases at those two places were about 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the goods all went straight to London, and the prisoner went also, without writing us what amount he had bought, or anything about it—the goods consisted of silks to the value of 16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., plush 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leather about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and cotton and printed goods to the amount of 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was also 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth more, which he bought at the same time—the whole amount of goods transmitted to London at that time was about 32,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—the prisoner got back to London again about the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of February, 1864—I came from Paris to London on 6th or 7th of February—I saw the prisoner—he said, "All my stock is sold, the goods are in the hands of all the people who bought them"—I did not even know that the goods had arrived in London—I then asked him who the buyers were he had brought to Paris, and he told me they were Messrs. Lhemann and Arand—I heard of an alleged transaction with Bevington's, at the very beginning of February, before I came to London—we had a telegraphic despatch—I communicated to the prisoner with reference to it, and he gave me the same answer that he had given to the house—I cannot find the letter which we wrote to the prisoner about that, but I have the answer we received on the 7th. or 8th. o£ February the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">This letter, being in French, was interpreted; it was dated 8th of February</hi>, 1864, <hi rend="italic">and stated that he had been to Messrs. Bevington and Sons that morning, and that his client had offered them some goods for the purpose only of getting the value of them, and to assure himself that he had not paid too high a price for them, that there was nothing to be alarmed about, and that tive prosecutors might always rely on his (the 'prisoner s) help and assistance</hi>)—I have now found the other letter (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 6th of February, from the prosecutors to the prisoner, recommending him the greatest possible circumspection as to the people he did business with, and that he was always to try and get the best possible security</hi>)—I came to London immediately after that, and spoke to the prisoner about Bevington's transaction—I repeated to him what we had said in that letter—I told him that we had great fears that all the leathers were bought by some person who could not pay for them, and who had offered them for the purpose of raising money—the prisoner said, "Don't have the least fear about that client, he always pays me beforehand, that is the best answer I can give, the only reason they offered those leathers was to make themselves sure that they did not pay a high price for them"—he afterwards told me who that client was—I thought it useless to see Bevington upon that statement—the actual date upon which I came to London was the 7th—I did not wait for the answer to our letter—I asked the prisoner to give me a list of all his clients, so that I could take references of all of them—he gave me a list on a bit of paper—I have not got it—I kept it for some time, and then destroyed it—I showed the names <hi rend="italic">to</hi> several merchants, and within half an hour I found out all about them, and told the prisoner verbally that all those clients were good for nothing—they put opposite to the different names he gave me in pencil "very bad," "very bad"—the first name was Lhemann, the second Arand, and so forth—I said to the prisoner, "Nothing can he said about these houses; nobody knows them at all; people say they are good for nothing, that they cannot be trusted to any sum, and I forbid you to let them have any more goods whatever"—he said that the information was wrong, that he had known these people for many years, especially Lhemann, as a very high standing and respectable person; that we could rely upon them; we were sure to be paid our money</p>

               <p>introduced him—I presented him personally to four houses; Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the service of the last witness, and have been so for nearly thirteen years—I gave a reference to Werner on behalf of Lhemann—he came to our office, And wanted some information about Lhemann—I know Lhemann; I was a friend of his—I was the chief corre<lb/>spondence-clerk, and had charge of the information business in the house—I told Werner that I thought Lhemann was a respectable man, and good for a small amount—Werner said, "But in our articles accounts may be quickly run up, and I should like to have the sum"—I said, "What is the present transaction?"—he said, "About 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "He is good to that amount"</p>

Le Grand, and I heard that the amount of the transactions was certainly beyond the means—Mr. Le Grand knew I had given a reference—I don't know whether Mr. Tanco knew it—I have had transactions with Lhemann myself since giving the reference—my last transaction with him, I think, was on 8th January—some times he would call on me, and say," Can you lend me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I lent it him, and many times without any receipt—I lent him money on several occasions, and received it back; some times with interest, and some<lb/>times without—we were friends; he gave me what he liked, and I lent him what he liked, for interest—I had lent him money previous to December—once he owed me 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—that was owing four weeks perhaps—he paid that long before Werner came to me—I don't think he owed me anything then</p>

I live at the Clerkenwell Workhouse, and am nurse in the Lying-in Ward there—on 16th July the prisoner came there—she came in in labour between 8 and 9 in the evening—she was confined at a quarter post 10 that same night of a male child—it was born alive—the prisoner left the workhouse on Saturday, 30th July—the child remained with her all that time from its birth—she was a very good mother, very food of her baby—she left the workhouse about 10 o'clock on the 30th as near as I can guess; I do not know whether the clock bad struck 10 or not—the baby was in a healthy state when she took it away—I have since seen the body of a child at the inquest—I only recognized it as the prisoner's child by a little bit of hair at the top of the head, the nose was so much swollen—I have seen the clothing that was found—they were the clothes that I gave the prisoner to put on the baby when she left the workhouse with the child—these are the clothes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England—I was called to see the deceased child on Saturday, 30th July, at half-past 12 in the afternoon—it was a male child—I saw it at the police-station in Hunter-street—it was dead—the body was warm—I should say it had not been dead an hour—I made a post-mortem examination of the body on the following morning—the body was covered with soot—there were no marks of violence externally; but on removing the scalp I found extravasa<lb/>tion of blood beneath it—there was soot on the legs—from the external appearance of the body it was a well-nourished child—I found very great congestion of the brain—I could not form any notion as to how long that congestion had existed—there was a small quantity of serum in the ven<lb/>tricles of the brain, about a couple of tea-spoonfuls I think—there was con<lb/>gestion of the lungs—the right side of the heart was full of blood—the left side was empty, or nearly so—the stomach contained a small quantity of food, probably milk—there was no smell or appearance whatever of poison of any kind—the liver was also congested—the cause of death was congestion of blood in the heart, lungs, and brain, caused by suffocation, the want of fresh air being admitted into the lungs; asphyxia—when I went into the station-house the prisoner commenced to tear up and destroy everything, and I was obliged to take the things away from her to prevent her—I did not search her—she attempted to destroy all the papers and clothes that she had got about her—there was a whole set of baby's clothes sewn on the inside of her petticoat—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was a child's</p>

I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's hospital—the deceased was brought there late at night on 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> August—I attended upon him—he was quite insensible, and in convulsions—he re<lb/>mained insensible, with all the symptoms of inflammation of the brain until he died on the morning of the 5th; he was in convulsions the whole time—there were some large bruises upon his left cheek and round his left eye, and some bruises on the back of his head, and other bruises about various parts of his body—I examined his body after death—his brain, and the membranes of his brain, were very much inflamed, and the base of the skull on the right side was fractured—the inflammation was caused by that frac<lb/>ture—a severe fall on the back of the head would be the most likely thing to cause that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a labourer—I knew the deceased, John East—on 30th July I was waling with him down Richard's-place, Haggerstone; it is a court between six and seven feet wide, with houses on one side and a dead wall on the other—the prisoner was sitting on the pavement by the house No. 5, with a child in his lap, and his legs straight across the footway; there was room for one person to pass without touching his legs, but not for two—the deceased and I were going along side by side, and the deceased kicked against the prisoner's legs—the prisoner said something, but I don't know what—the deceased said, "Why don't you take your feet up out of the way; I did not see them"—we walked on three or four yards, I looked round and saw the prisoner coming behind East, with his right hand like this and he struck him at the side of the right ear—I am quite sure I saw that—it knocked him down; he fell with his knees and head into the wall, not flat down—the wall struck his right eye—I picked him up; he was bleeding very much from over the eye—he walked to Mr. Greenwood's with my assistance; he was not at home—I then took him to Mr. Sykes'; he was not at home and he was at last taken to St. Bartholomew's hospital—he was quite sober, and quite sensible when he was walking with me, and appeared in good health—he was about fifty years of age—he died on the Wednesday.</p>

I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's hospital—the deceased was brought there on 30th July; he walked in with the last witness—the was quite sensible—he was bleeding very much from some wound on the right side of his forehead—he was admitted into the hospital—he made a statement to me—erysipelas came on on the Monday, and he died on the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> August—he complained to me of the back of his head, just behind the right ear—when I made the post-mortem examination I looked at that part, but I discovered no marks of injury—his face and head were so swollen with the erysipelas that I could not have done so—there was nothing internally; there was no injury to the brain—there was a small wound just over the right eyebrow, and above it the skin of the forehead was torn away from the scalp, and hung down over his eye—I could not say from which the erysipelas sprang; they were both inflicted at the same time—I imagine that his head was struck with some blunt instrument, and then the skin of the forehead was torn down—the whole of the skin was torn—a blow or a fall against a wall would produce such injuries.</p>

I am a labourer at Back-road, St. George's-in-the<lb/>East—on 4th July my wife fetched me out of bed, and I went down, and saw the prosecutor and prisoner together—the prisoner said, "I have not insulted your wife"—I said, "Nobody said you had"—he struck me on the eye, and it bled—I went to Voller, and turned, and saw the prisoner struggling with Price, who fell down in the road, and said, "I am stabbed." <hi rend="smallCaps">ISAAC PAWSEY</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 485). I was on duty in Cross-street between 12 and 1 o'clock, heard a disturbance, went to the spot, and found the prisoner and Hamilton and another man scuffing together—I separated them, turned round, and saw the prisoner strike at Price, who fell to the ground—the prisoner then ran—I ran after him—he got over some palings at the bottom of Johnson-street, and tore half of his coat off by some spikes—I took him behind the palings—he was perfectly sober, and so was Hamilton; but Mrs. Hamilton was not.</p>

On 15th July, at a little after 10 o'clock, I was with Legg in New Bridge-street, Blackfriars, and saw the prisoner and another man and a woman go into a public-house in Bride-lane—they stayed there three-quarters of an hour, came out, and went to Shoe<lb/>maker-row, into a public-house at the corner of Cobb's-court—the prisoner end the female left there and went into Church Entry, the other man re<lb/>mained in the public-house—they returned to the same public-house, and stopped till 12 o'clock, when the house was closed, when they all three left and went down Church Entry and up Finnis-court to the rear of Mr. Brankston's premises—I spoke to Legg and followed them—I saw the prisoner standing about halfway up the court, and the female in front of him extending her dress with her hands—another female then went up the court, and the prisoner and the first female walked down to where Legg and I were standing followed by the other man—I was in plain clothes—I took the prisoner by the collar and said, "What have you been up the court for?"—he said, "I have not"—I said, "I am a police-officer, and shall take you in custody for being there for an unlawful purpose"—he was very violent and struggled very much—he put his hand to his coat pocket and I heard something drop almost close to my feet on the pavement—I said, "You have dropped something"—he said, "I have not"—he took this gimblet from his pocket and struck at me three or four times with it, but did not strike me—Legg came and assisted me, and the prisoner struck him with it—after going to the station I went back and found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, bent as it is now, it answers the purpose both of a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and a screw-driver—I have since been to Brankston's premises and seen an iron door about two feet square, in the wall, fastened on two binges; the top hinge had been wrenched off, and thrown up; you could lift it down and get into the premises—it could have been opened by this instrument; there was an exact impression of it on the brick-work—he refused his address.</p>

I was with Hann, and have heard his evidence; it is correct—the man who got away knocked me down, and the prisoner stabbed me in two places with the gimblet on my hand; he aimed at my eye—I took him to the station and found on him a clasp-knife, the handle of a keyhole saw, and some quiet matches—he was close against the iron-door, when I saw him; a man and a woman were with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The young man who is not in custody asked me to have some drink. I do not know his name; we went into the public-house. He said that he was going to the Blue Last as his wife was to be there. I waited till 11 o'clock, but could not see him—I went down Water-lane and saw the man not in custody, and I believe these two policemen were talking to him at the corner of Shoemaker-row. He came to me and I asked him who they were; he said, "Two friends of mine." We went to the Blue Last and stopped till it closed, and then the two detectives turned and laid hold of me; the other man just gave the officer a slight push, and he went backwards against the wall, and never called "Stop thief!" or "Run after him." I never struck him at all; what they say is an untruth. In the morning this man said, "I know you have been transported; you may as well tell us; it will put 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi> or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my way, and we will have a pint of beer." I said, "If you think I have been transported you must find that out."</p>

I keep the Grapes Public-house, Earl-street, Seven Dials—about 3 o'clock, on the afternoon of 6th of this month, the prisoner came into my house—there was a woman drinking in front of the bar, and he laid hold of her pot of beer and drank out of it—the woman came up to my wife and complained—the prisoner was about to spit in the woman's face, and struck her, and I turned him out—as I was turning him out he said to my wife," You b—b—h, I will do for you"—when I got him outside the door he pushed it a little way open and spat in my face, and said, "You b—I will do for you, and all the b—house"—about twenty minutes to 12 he came back again in front of the bar, and wanted to kick up a quarrel, which I prevented him doing by turning him out again—he then said, "You b——, I will do for you before long, and all the b—house"—he went away, returned in about ten minutes with a ginger-beer bottle, with which I received a blow on the nose—I did not see who threw it—I should have fallen, but I was caught by some one there—I was afterwards taken to the Charing Cross Hospital, where I have been attended by the doctor ever since—I lost very nearly three quarts of blood.</p>

I am house-surgeon at St. Luke's workhouse—I attended the deceased child, Rebecca Blake, on 25th June in the re<lb/>ceiving ward of the workhouse—she was a thin wasted child—she had thrush in the mouth, a large belly, and small limbs—I saw food given to it; milk and water—I attended it up to its death, which was, I think, on 12th July—it did not improve in health at all—I made a post mortem examination—the general appearance of the internal organs was that of great pallor—that was the most remarkable point—the lungs were pale, the heart and the brain flabby and pulpy—that indicates defective nutrition—the child died of mesenteric disease in an advancing state—it died from general feebleness and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Mesenteric disease proceeds very often from a scrofulous temperament, does it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very often—where there is that scrofulous tendency the disease develops itself earlier than at other times—a child may be born with it—mesenteric disease of itself prevents proper nourishment being taken into the system—it is a question of degree—it develops itself whether there be nourishment from the mother's milk or not—among the lower orders it is a complaint that a great number of children die of, even though they have nutriment from the mother—distress and misery on the part of the mother would injure that nutriment—it would hardly dry up the milk; it would impoverish it, and probably lead to that; but I must distinctly state that the mesenteric disease was not in that ad<lb/>vanced state that it would destroy this child—I know the child could not have received nutriment from its food—it had the thrush—that causes a little difficulty in a child taking the nipple at first, but it sucks readily enough after it has once got hold of it—if it is hungry it will suck—it would not be capable of knowing whether the milk was good or not.</p>

On Saturday night, 30th July, about 11 o'clock, I was passing Hyde-place, and heard the report of fire<lb/>arms—I saw the prisoner's wife running from the house—in consequence of what she said to me, I went into the front parlour—I found the room full of smoke—I found the prisoner in the back room, in bed—the moment I entered the room he said, "Don't come nigh me, or otherwise I will blow out your brains"—I asked him to get up and dress himself, and go quietly to the station with me—he said, "No, I sha'n't; it will take six policemen to take me there; it is not the first time I have been handled by the police"—I requested him to get up—he got up after a great deal of bother—I had to call in the assistance of two or three more constables—I told him he was charged with attempting to shoot his wife—he said on the way to the station," Never mind, I daresay my wife won't come up on Monday and prosecute me"—at the station, he paid," If I ever come out again, I intend murdering of her, having her life"—I found the pistol in the box at the time I took him into custody, also the shot and powder—the pistol was very warm—after taking him to the station, I returned and examined the walls of the room—I found several shots in the door, and the picture that hung at the side of the wall was smashed—the marks in the wall corresponded with tho shots.</p>

Nathan; I have come with the best feelings in the world to you"—I said that I did not know whether there was any quarrel between him and Nathan, but if there was I did not partake of it, and asked him to take down the placards—he said, "I will not"—I then said that I wished to speak to him inside—he allowed me to go in, and I said, "I do not want you to pull them down now; I do not want the people to see that there is any victory over you, but do not put them up to-morrow; it must be injuring your business"—he said, "There is the mistake; people come and read these placards, and come and deal with me through sympathy," and while I was speaking to him some people came in, one female, particularly, who bought some soap—she said that she did not want the soap, but wanted to know what I was saying to him—I said, "Excuse me; I suppose you think I am like the rest of the police, being bribed and purchased by Mr. Nathan, but I am not"—next morning I went again, but he was not there—I went again, and he was hanging them up—I said, "Do you remember my being here yesterday; I did not expect you would take them down yesterday, but I did not expect you would hang them up again; it is extremely obstinate of you; these crowds will be here again to-day"—he was then hanging up one about three feet square, stencilled out with large letters an inch deep—he said that he would not take them in—I persevered and went inside, and entreated him—he said that he supposed I felt sore about the allusion to the police—I said, "No"—he asked me if I had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket—I said,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Sutton, in Surrey—on 21st February, 1863, I let my furnished house there to the prisoner by this written agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is an inventory of the furniture, knives, forks, and glass—besides the articles contained in this inventory, there was a telescope, a pistol and case, a game-bag, a pair of boots, a shot<lb/>bag, an inkstand, a fishing-rod, a landing-net, and a walking-stick—they were Napoleon boots, which had belonged to my late husband, and were nearly new; they cost two guineas; they were riding-boots for the chaise, and came up above the knee—besides the knives in the inventory, there were some new ones which had not been used, and which I did not intend the prisoner to use unless he had company—I told the servant I should fetch them away, and if the prisoner had not enough she was to come to me for them, as I lived close by—I left the telescope, and pistol and case in the store-room—I told him there was a telescope, and he might have it to view the country with, but when I called once or twice he said he had not seen it; that was about a fortnight after he took possession, and by the date of the ticket it had been pawned then—he wanted to buy the pistol—I said that I would not sell it, but would leave it on the premises—the game-bag hung up in a closet, and I had no idea that it was taken, or the shot-bag either—he said that if I wanted to part with the boots he should like to purchase them, but he did not pay me for them—I said that if he liked to fish in the grounds he might use the fishing-rod—the rent was to be paid every three months from the day he commenced, and about a fortnight after, 21st May,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186408150059"/>
               <p>I heard that he had left—he gave me no notice, but under-let the house—I did not go into it then, but in September I found it shut up, and no one in it—I then went, and missed these things—the first quarters rent was paid—the tenant to whom the prisoner let it disappeared two days before the rent was due—I heard nothing of Keily till June this year, when I found he was living in John-street, Hercules-buildings—I went there with a police<lb/>man, and found the servant Harriett Wiltshire, whom I had discharged, but who Keily said might stay with him if she liked—I there found the articles I have mentioned—I did not see the prisoner after that day till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the things included in the inventory all in the house when you got possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he has taken many more besides these—there are a great many things missing from the house, and the garden utensils also—I did not say before the Magistrate," There is nothing miss<lb/>ing from the house that is in the inventory"—this is my signature to my depositions, but that is a mistake—none of the things I am complaining of were in the inventory, but they are not near what he has taken away—I did not leave these things in the care of my servant; I discharged her, and Mr. Keily took her—I had confidence in her, but I did not leave her in the house as my servant—I only left the knives with her—these things were not included in the inventory because I left them for his amusement, and I might want the telescope, and then I could go and take it away when I pleased—he was to be there two years, and I could take away anything that was not in the inventory—I left these things in the store-room; it was only the knives that I left in the servant's possession, but the servant knew that the other things were left there quite as well as myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the surgeons of the London Hospital—on the night of 12th July the man Leonard was brought into the hospital I dressed his wounds—there were three small punctured wounds on the scalp—they were not done with a pointed blade—the knife could not have had a point; they were jagged wounds—they could have been done with the broken end of a clasp knife—he had bruises on the hip and arm; they would be produced by stamping on him—he was not in the hospital at all—they were not dangerous wounds; they were not produced by a sharp-cutting edge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Vauxhall-terrace, Kennington-lane, and am bar<lb/>man at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern—last Wednesday week, 10th August, about 4 in the afternoon, I was passing along King-street, Soho, and saw the prisoner Seymour, the young one, going into a doorway with a can in her hand—she said, "Will you walk in;" and I walked into the front parlour on the ground floor—it was a decently-furnished room, but was rather in disorder—there were folding-doors leading into a room behind—Seymour said, "You will excuse the room being in disorder"—that was all that passed; and then the prisoner Beeho came in directly, and asked what business I had there with his wife—I told him that I was not aware she was his wife, or I should not have come in—he did not say anything to that, but directly after Dempsey came in, and said to Beeho, "What is this dis<lb/>turbance in my house? you had better leave; pay me my rent, which is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and go"—he then asked me if I would pay the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Beeho—I said I could not—he directly said, "You can; now, sir, I shall be desperate with you," and he seized me by the throat and held me very tight—I said to him," Don't hurt me, and I will give you what money I can"—I took my green purse from my pocket, and he snatched it out of my hand, and took out the contents, which were 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a few shillings—he then said, "You have got some more money about you," and he began to rifle me about—he felt something in my waistcoat pocket, and he took out a little tobacco-box, which contained nineteen sovereigns—he went to the window and counted them, and then gave me the empty box back again—Beeho then said, "Now I am not satisfied with you; I shall make you draw up a paper and sign for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—they sent out for a sheet of paper—I told them I could not write it myself, I was in such a trembling state—Beeho</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186408150068"/>
               <p>then wrote on a paper, and it was given to me to sign, but I could not hold the pen—all the prisoners were then in the room—Broughton came in soon after Dempsey—they asked me for an address, and I gave a false one; at Hampstead—afterwards, when I found it was assuming a terrible affair, I gave the right address of my employer, Mr. Garrard—Beeho then drew up another paper, a similar paper, placed it in an envelope, and made me direct it in the best way I could—it was done in such a manner that my employer could not understand it—I have not seen either of those papers since—I did not sign this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); I only directed the envelope—this paper is what Beeho drew up for me to sign—I think this was the first—after I had given the correct address the male prisoners went out, after locking me in, with the two women—they said they should not be gone above ten minutes—they returned in about an hour—the women sat still all that time—I don't believe I spoke to them all the time—I was equally in fear with them, as with the men—I don't think I asked them to let me out—I do not recollect doing so—I should think it was near 6 when the men came in again—Dempsey said, "You have told us the truth this time; but you are the landlord, and not that gentleman with the beard"—he then said, "Now, sir, you have got some more money about you;" and they began to rifle about my pockets again—Dempsey felt my watch and chain, which I had slipped down into my fob-pocket, and took it—Beeho was standing over me at the same time, and the women were in the same room—they were all four together—I then said, "Will you now let me go? you have got everything I have got"—they took a newspaper, and some spectacles, and an umbrella, which I had hung up on a shelf, and which was afterwards found in the bed—Dempsey then bundled Beeho and Seymour out into the street, and said, "Get out of my house"—I went too, and Dempsey, and Beeho, and, I think, Seymour, followed me—when we got out they got pushing me along, and asked me if I would have anything to drink—my mouth was so parched up I did not know what to do—they asked if I would have a bottle of lemonade, and I did—I went into a public-house with Dempsey—he had something at the same time; I don't know what—we came out, and Seymour, Dempsey, and Beeho walked with me—Dempsey and Beeho then said, "You had better get on home"—I said, "I will," and I bade them" Good-night," and got away—I should think it must have been near 11 then—I went directly to Vine-street station, and made a complaint there—I gave a description of the house, and I then went there with a policeman—I had no difficulty in finding the place—the policeman knocked at the door—some one tried not to let him in, but be put his toe between the door and went in—I went in after him, and saw Dempsey, Broughton, and Seymour—Beeho was not there—I said, "Those are the three prisoners that I give into custody"—I assisted the policeman in making a search—there was nothing found then of mine, except my umbrella, which was found tucked in the foot of the bed in the front room—there was an area in front of that room, between that and the pavement, and some iron railings—this umbrella, this watch and chain, this newspaper, tobacco-box, purse, and two pairs of spectacles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my property—I know nothing of this pocket-book—I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and a few shillings, in my purse—that is all I have recovered.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186408150069"/>
               <p>the landlady did not—I saw a person distinctly come to the window, previous to the door being opened, and that was Dempsey—that was before Bronghton or Dempsey came in—it was a very small house, I should say—it is not a crowded street—the blinds were up when I went in—I don't know who drew them down, they were drawn down by some one—the front parlour is a bed-room—the window is not two feet from the street—I did not hear persons going up and down the stairs while I was there—I saw some brass plates outside on the door—I did not ask the women to let me go, because I was equally afraid of them as I was of the men—I was afraid of my life—I did not send out for any brandy—I did not give half a crown, or any money to send for some—I think Seymour brought me some pale brandy to drink while I was there—I think it was two half-pints—no, it was only one half-pint—I did not give the money to buy it—I did not take any of the brandy, or brandy and water, I was afraid—I took some of the porter out of the can which Seymour had in her hand when I first came into the house—the other prisoners were not present then—I have a quarterly salary—I do not usually carry such a large sum of money about with me—I had some idea of putting it in the Post-office Saving's bank—I did not do so; I don't know why—I left home about half-past 10 in the morning—I had the money all day—I was out for my holiday—I first walked to Fulham, to a friend of mine, and had two glasses of porter there—I then walked to Mont<lb/>pelier-place, and had a pint of cooper, I dare say—I had nothing more than I took any other day—I was not three minutes in the room with Seymour before Beeho came in.</p>

               <p>might have been five minutes—she did not say anything during that time; she only apologised for the place being in such disorder—I drank the beer without saying a word—nothing was said about it—nothing passed in that room but what I have told you—I never touched her, or she me—I never spoke to her—I swear I did not pay for a pint of brandy—I swear I did not send the girl for some brandy—I did not say anything to Broughton when she came in—I know now that this house is occupied by several families besides the prisoners—I did not know it then—I did not attempt to cry out the slightest in the world—I stood as quiet as a lamb—I don't think either of the women left the room when I was alone with them—they did not, I will swear that—it was either Dempsey or Beeho pulled the blinds down—that was after they had taken my money—I will swear that I did not pull one of the blinds down myself, I did not touch them—the men must have left between 5 and 6—I don't know what time they returned—they were only gone an hour—I did not look at my watch—I did not wish them to see I had got one—the men left me with the two women about an hour and a half after I first entered the house, I should think—they were not gone much above an hour—they must have been back before 9—I should think they were back by 8—they were not back by 7—they were away between an hour and an hour and a half—I sat still in a chair during that time—I don't recollect whether I spoke to either of the women—I asked one of the male prisoners before they went if I could go into a back room, and I did so, and came back again.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, C</hi> 20). On the night of 10th August, the last witness came to the Vine-street Police-station, and gave me some informa<lb/>tion, in consequence of which I went with him to No. 30, King-street, Soho—I knocked at the door, it was opened by Seymour—when she saw me she tried to close it—the prosecutor was close beside me at the time—she could see him, I think—I put my foot between the door and the post, pushed the door open and entered the house—I called the prosecutor in after me—</p>

               <p>it was very dark in the passage—I said to the prosecutor, "Do you know anything of this female here," meaning Seymour—he said, "Yes; I think that is the female who took me in,"—I then took her into the parlour, where there was a light, and Broughton and Dempsey were there—the prosecutor said, "Those are the three persons who were in the room, and another man besides"—I then said to Broughton, "What is all this about?" and neither of them made any reply—the prosecutor pointed to Dempsey, and said, "That is the man who took me by the neck and robbed me"—I then sent the prosecutor out for assistance, and told them that they must consider themselves prisoners—I saw Dempsey stand up, put his hand into his breast<lb/>pocket, take this watch from it, and pass it to Broughton—he then walked round Seymour and passed something to her—I could not swear what it was—Dempsey then wanted to leave the room, and I said, "You must not leave this room at present, you must consider yourselves as prisoners," then Broughton wanted to go out, and I said, "No; neither of you must leave this room"—during that time I saw Dempsey take this pair of spec<lb/>tacles from his trouser's pocket and pass them to Broughton—they fell on the floor through the folds of her dress, and I picked them up—Broughton then took the watch from her dress and passed it back to Dempsey again, and he concealed it under the bed-clothes—I put my hand to take it, and he said, "I have the watch here, I will give it to you, it was left here for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." and I took the watch from his hand—Seymour went into the back room after Dempsey passed something to her—I could not keep them all three together all the time—when two other policeman came I made a search on the table—I found that paper, and in the bed, under the clothes, I found this umbrella concealed—the prosecutor returned with the other policeman and identified the umbrella—I then searched Dempsey and found a purse containing nineteen duplicates, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 41/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. some studs, and a ring for the handkerchief—this is the purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we took them to Vine-street station—the two females were searched by the female searcher—from certain information I received, at 4 o'clock that morning, I went to a coffee-shop in Castle-street, Leicester-square, where I found Beeho in bed, fast asleep, with a female—I woke him up and told him I wanted him on a charge of being concerned, with Dempsey and others in custody, in robbing a Mr. Smith, at 30, King-street, Soho, of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a watch and chain—he said he knew nothing of the robbery, he had sold a dog last night—I searched a coat that was there—the same he has on now, I believe, and found these spec<lb/>tacles and this newspaper, and on the table I found a purse containing nineteen duplicates—I took him to the station, made a further search, but found nothing more—at the police-court twelve sovereigns were produced by Sergeant Cole, and two by the female searcher—this small purse and tobacco box were given to me by the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, Vauxhall—Smith, the prosecutor, was and is my barman—on Wednesday, 10th August, he left my house for a holiday—on the evening of that day, about 8 or half-past, I saw the two male prisoners at my house—they brought me a letter—I had great difficulty in reading it—I had not the slightest idea whose writing it was—it was very badly written—I know Smith's handwriting—it was very different from his usual writing—the prisoners said that they had brought it from a man named Smith, and described him, so that I thought it was my barman—Beeho said it was about a bill of exchange for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I knew nothing at all about it—the letter</p>

About 12 o'clock, on Thursday, the 11th, I had charge of Broughton in the prisoners' waiting-room at the Mary<lb/>lebone Police-court—I noticed that she had something in her left hand, which appeared to be a dirty white pocket-handkerchief wrapped up very closely—I saw her put her hand towards her mouth—I said, "What have you got in your mouth? open it"—she did so, and I saw nothing in it—I then said, "Open your hand; what have you got there?"—she did, and I saw nothing in it—I kept her closely under observation, and followed her across the yard leading to the cells—when she got into the passage of the cells, Seymour was about being placed in one of the cells by the gaoler, and I saw Broughton put her left hand close to the right side of Seymour's dress, and I then heard something drop—on looking on the ground I saw this farthing—I then laid hold of her left hand, and said, "Hulloa, what's this?" and found the twelve sovereigns now produced, wrapped up in this old piece of rag—she said, "That is my money, sir; I received it of my lawyer about a week ago"—I had known Broughton many years before this—I know Seymour is not Dempsey's wife.</p>

I am a draper, carrying on an extensive business in Shoreditch—I have known the prisoner about fifteen years—he was formerly in my service as a shop-walker—he first entered my service about 1856, and remained in that capacity two or three years—he left about 1858 or 1859—after he left I took a person named Gadd in my employment—that was in 1863—the prisoner was in my service at the time Mr. Gadd came—accord<lb/>ing to my recollection, he applied to enter my service again about six or nine mouths ago—I then took him in as fancy-buyer—he left about April last—he wanted an advance of salary, and I told him I could not give him any more—he said he had an opportunity of bettering his position—I said I should be very glad to see it, as he had a large family, and it was his duty to himself and family to do so if he could—at the time he left my service he was indebted to me—I afterwards applied to him for payment—I received this letter from him—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "12th November, 1863.—Mr. Lloyd.—Sir—I apologize to you for many foolish things I have done, but let that pass, if you will, I have been a faithful servant to you for nearly fifteen years, and am now in want of employment. I will call on you to-morrow, Friday, at 6 in the afternoon. Please to grant me an interview, and I will tell you all my troubles. You can extricate me without injury to yourself; and I shall ever remain your grateful servant, Robert C. Ward.")—He came the follow<lb/>ing day—he made a certain apology, and was sorry for what had passed, and I took him back into my service—he told me that the broker was in the house, going to sell his furniture for rent; that he Was in very great distress and trouble, and he had been out of a situation for twelve months; and I was induced to take him back—he remained with me three or four months, and it was then that he left, as I have stated, as he wanted an advance of salary—he was several times in my employment altogether in the fifteen years I have known him—I received this letter in April—it is the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th April, and stated that the prosecutor's application for repayment he should treat with contempt, and entered into particulars to show that he was not in his debt</hi>)—I don't recollect whether I saw the prisoner</p>

I was so drunk that they led me towards Cubitt's-town. I got into the wrong road, and got into a ditch. I afterwards got out and laid down and went to sleep. Sometime after a man reached me, and asked me if I had any money in my pocket; I said, "Yes, a little;" he asked me if I would buy the things he had, a rabbit, two fowls, and a pair of trousers, and being quite intoxicated I gave him two shillings and half-a-crown. I did not know what I was about on account of the drink."</p>

I am the wife of Samuel Francis Sheppard a china dealer, of 95, Bartholomew-close—on Tuesday, 5th July, about 11 in the morning, the prisoner came to our shop—I had not seen her before—she asked me if I let things out on hire for weddings—I said, "Yes," and she selected a dozen cups and saucers, a glass butter dish, a glass sugar basin, two large meat dishes, and other things—she said that they were for a wed<lb/>ding, for Miss Collins, No. 1, Cloth-fair, and asked me if I could let her have them in the evening—I said, "Yes," and she went away—about an hour afterwards she come again, and asked me if I could let them have the things directly, as they wanted them before 2 o'clock—I said I could not, as Mr. Sheppard was out—when he came home he peaked up the things, and took them to 1, Cloth-fair, before 2 o'clock—I knew that a Miss Collins lived at that place—I thought the things were for her; if I had thought they were for the prisoner I should not have let her have them—she told me that if we rang the bell she would answer the door, which she did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant surgeon to Dr. Warsop—on Sunday, 31st July, I was called to see the prosecutrix, and found her suffering from two incised wounds, one over the back of the head an inch and a half long; it could not be very deep there; and the other over the left eyebrow about three<lb/>quarters of an inch long; it could not be very deep there—this was twenty minutes or half an hour after the stabbing; she had lost only about three ounces of blood—they were such wounds as might be produced by this knife, or some sharp instrument—she was ten days under my treatment, but is quite well now—they were dangerous wounds, from their situation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> After she took my cap and tore it, I got in a passion and gave her a blow. I had a glass in my hand, and gave her a knock with it, but did not do anything more.</p>

I got rather the worse; we went into this woman's public-house, and had three or four quarts of sixpenny ale. I got very drunk, and the window being up I jumped out, and was nearly drowned. These two men came, and hauled me in. Cohen was there with a chair in his band, which he put at the back of the bar. White was the first man that com<lb/>menced the row.</p>

I threw off my coat and waistcoat and jumped in, and caught him by the hand, and Conolly came to my assistance; we saved him, and took his clothes off, and rubbed him. One man was taken. I went to the station that I might tell his wife where he was taken to, and they took me. On the 27th the landlady came forward and swore that I struck the man with a pot On 4th August she swore I struck him with something else, and on 9th August she said it was with a ginger-beer bottle; afterwards she said that it was Lydon who struck him.</p>

I live at 4, Gloucester-place, King-street, Deptford, and am a brickmaker—on this evening, between 5 and 6, I was in the Crystal Palace beer-shop—the prisoner came in while I was there—he got in con<lb/>versation with me, and told me he had been drinking along with a man who had got plenty of money—the prosecutor came in with a coat and bottle—threw them down, and said to the prisoner, "Now, Southgate; I want my money; if you have not got it, you know them that has"—the prisoner did not say anything for a few minutes, and Mr. Gibbons came and turned the prisoner out—the prosecutor went out, and they had a bit of a light, and I saw no more of them—there was a mob outside—I never went out—I did not say anything to the prisoner before they went out, or afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon——on 27th June last I was house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—the prosecutor was brought there about a quarter past 8 that evening—he had a large incised wound on the fleshy part of the left arm about five inches long, and deep, but I can't say how deep—it was a cut, a clean incised wound—there were four incised wounds about the left wrist, none of which were very serious, but on further examination we found other wounds, which induced us to take him into the hospital—there were ten distinct wounds—the most serious was about an inch and a half long, and it was also deep—there was one wound just over the hip-joint, two on the head, one on the left side, and the other on the forehead,</p>

               <p>and one behind the left shoulder blade—they were severe wounds, but not dangerous—he is at present an in-patient, but he has recovered—he has been kept in till the trial should be over—this knife might have produced the incised wounds—I should hardly think it would produce the wounds on the head—I should imagine they had been done by some blunt instrument—a pair of tongs might have done it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a salesman in the employ of Messrs. Bransby, upholsterers, in the Old Kent road—on a Monday in July, Trevoy came there with Linsey and asked to see some carpets—I showed him some, and he selected one—he then selected a bedstead, mattrass, and palliasse, two chairs, and a looking-glass—he gave his name Edward Trevoy, 21, South-road, Rye-lane, Peckham, and told me to send the goods the same night as he wanted them for the servant to sleep on—I told him our terms were cash on delivery—I despatched the porter with the goods the same evening, and gave him directions not to leave them without the money, but he brought back neither goods or money—I went on the Wednesday to the address he gave, and met Trevoy in the street—I said, "Mr. Trevoy, I want our goods"—he Said, "I have no goods of yours"—I said, "That is false"—he said, "The house is locked up, and you shall not have them"—one of our men had got into the house while I was talking to him—we then went to the house—Trevoy went in, but would not let me in—a policeman was there, and Trevoy gave our man in custody—the man got over the gate, and the policeman as well as Trevoy would not unlock it, and would not let me in—I saw our porter come out in the policeman's custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I took these goods from Messrs. Bransby's to Rye-lane, Peckham—when I got near the house, I met the prisoners—Trevoy said, "You are very late; we have been waiting in the house ever since the time the goods were to have arrived"—I went to the house and put the goods in the back room top-floor—I then gave Trevoy the receipted bill, and asked him for the money—he began talking to Linsey, and said that it was very unusual for a man looking out other goods in the morning to send a receipted bill for the things which had to come home the same night—I said, "I know nothing about that; I have orders either to have the money or take the goods back"—he then said that I had not brought the blankets—I told him I had brought all that was ordered to come home that evening, and that blankets were not ordered—he said that he would see if he had got the money to pay me, and put his hand in his pocket and rattled some money about, as if he was going to pay me—we were in the front room down stairs—he spoke to Linsey, who walked outside the house—Trevoy then felt in his pocket, pulled a little money out, and said, "I have not sufficient money to pay you, but I will see if my friend has got the other"—I followed him outside, and was looking towards my horse, when the door was closed and locked by one of them—I asked him once or twice to give me the receipt back—he tore it off and gave it me, and kept the bill, saying, "I will keep the bill, and it can be written on when you get the money"—they both went back with me to my master—Linsey said, "I will call down this street to get the money to pay you," and went down a street—they both went to my master's in the van, but I was not present to hear what took place—I went to the house next day, but could not get the goods—I saw Linsey there—he said that it was only a County Court affair, and held out the bill in de<lb/>fiance of us—he said, "Trevoy owes me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for rent, and if you like to pay me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you can have the goods back."</p>

I am nine years old—my mother left me in the bar with my sister—the prisoners came in for a pint of stout, which came to fourpence—I served them—Eldridge gave me a shilling—I tried it in the detector—it broke in two, and I gave him the pieces back—he said, "Have you got any money to pay for this?" and McDonald put down sixpence, which my sister Louisa took up—I put one shilling into the till after my mother left.</p>
