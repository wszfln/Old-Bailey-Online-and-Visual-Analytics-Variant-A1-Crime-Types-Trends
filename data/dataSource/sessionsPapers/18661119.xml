I am a smith, and live at 17, Glasgow Terrace, Pimlico—about one o'clock on the morning of 28th October I was passing very close to Fox Court, Gray's Inn Lane—three men came up in front of me and stopped me by giving me blows—the prisoner is one of them; he struck me on the side of the nose, which is a broken nose now, and the one on the left side struck me in the upper lip, which knocked me down on the pavement and cut me on the back of my head—two of the men fell with me, and as they fell their hands were in my pockets directly—the third one laid on my feet, and as I tried to call "Police!" the one that laid on me bumped his head into my chest, so that every time I tried to hallo it stopped my breath and took my breath away—I have got the wounds now caused by the prisoner's fearful kicking in my trying to resist his hands from my pocket—he kicked me across the loins and across the back—I have twelve yards of bandage about me now—I had 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a purse, and the ticket of my watch, which was in pawn in Bishopsgate Street—I had been out of work eight weeks—after they had taken my money, when I was just calling "Police!" the prisoner called out "Finish," or some such word, and I received two kicks at the back of my head, which took all my senses away till I found myself in the hospital—I was there for a fortnight—I am not able to work now—I have not been free from head<lb/>ache since.</p>

               <p>which dropped on the floor, and some he threw out at the open window—he was seized and secured—he resisted very violently—John Barrett sat down on a chair by the window, and I then saw Elizabeth Barrett take from a table a black bag—it is a very small room—she took up a packet from the table wrapped up in a rag, and threw it out of the window—I had stationed Inspector Broad at the door outside in the street—I seized the female prisoner's hand, having seen her take a crown off the mantel-piece, and endeavoured to get it—she said, "May God strike me b—dead if it is not a good one, Mr. Brannan"—I said, "I quite imagine it is, and the pattern piece from which the mould is taken"—I got it from her hand with some difficulty, and soon afterwards Inspector Broad brought in a parcel with nine crowns in it, which she threw out, and two half-crowns which Cornelius threw out—I found that some of them corresponded in date and marks with the one I took from Elizabeth—she resisted very violently—I saw the officers pick up off the floor a quantity of coin which was strewed about—there was a clear bright fire in the fireplace, and I found this ladle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with a small portion of white metal in it, hot, but not melted—Inspector Broad found a file with white metal hang<lb/>ing to the teeth of it, as if it had been recently used—I recovered this packet, containing the fragments of a plaster of Paris mould for casting crowns, and which Broad said that he saw thrown out at the window—the prisoners heard that, but made no answer.</p>

I am a servant, and live at No. 56, Burlington Road, Paddington—on Sunday evening, 21st October, about a quarter-past seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another man walking up and down on each side of the way opposite Mr. Answorth's house—at about half-past seven o'clock I saw the prisoner come off Mr. Answorth's steps with something shining in his hand, like a basket—(he had nothing when I first saw him)—the other man crossed the road to him, they walked to the side of a lamp-post, covered the basket over, and then walked up to me—I men<lb/>tioned what I had seen to two policemen.</p>

I quarrelled with Taylor in the public-house about his bad work, and he caught me by the neck and knocked me against the door, when thirty or forty people came between us and stopped the fight. I never touched his watch-guard. I did not say that I threw the watch and chain over the bar. If so, how could he have his watch? I never saw Murphy in my life, and did not know he was in the house. Taylor and the bricklayer were the worse for drink. I did not say that I did it for a lark. I defy any person to say that I ever committed felony, or was at any police-court in the kingdom. Taylor says that I robbed him four years ago. If so, why was I not brought before a Magistrate the same as now? I am a working man, and no thief.</p>

I think—I gave money to Mr. Cohen—I sometimes paid the prisoner his commission—he did not deduct it out of the money he paid—it would be reckoned up a couple of hours before he came home—I used to put down what he brought home in this book, but I did not always put down the dates of the month—I know Mr. Swift's bill is not paid, because I have not got "Settled" here—Mr. Cohen used not some-times to send his father-in-law with the prisoner—when we came home from the theatre Mr. Cohen would fetch the book and pen and ink into the kitchen—the books were locked up, but the key was in the warehouse—we took it with us if we went out.</p>

The parcels contained four or five each, and he is correct in saying six parcels. I took about twenty umbrellas altogether. I totally deny steal<lb/>ing them or pawning them, but one or two friends asked me to get them umbrellas a little cheaper than they could get them at the retail place. I said, "Yes," and took out two or three for them to choose from. In doing so I have acted wrongly, but I paid the money I received for them to the managing clerk. If I charged them anything I took it for myself, as my salary was not enough to keep me. I have been guilty of a very silly action, but nothing for which he ought to have branded me with the name of felon. He does the second largest business in London, and it is only fea<lb/>sible that a few of his umbrellas should get into pawnshops by other means than mine, and neither of the pawnbrokers swear to me, whereas if I had taken as many as he says I should have been pretty well known. I had six years' good character when I went to him from Messrs. Ellis, Howell, and Co. <hi rend="smallCaps">

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whose handwriting is this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mine—I took the charge from Barry and Hayes. (<hi rend="italic">The charge was, "being found in the enclosed garden of No</hi>. 63, <hi rend="italic">Gloucester Crescent, St. Pancras, supposed for an unlawful purpose; further, with burglariously breaking and enter<lb/>ing the above house</hi>.")The words "burglariously," &amp;c., were not added till about nine o'clock in the morning, after the constables had been and professed to have found the state the house was in—the nature of the charge was altered from that information—it was twenty minutes to two o'clock when the young men were brought to the station—I have got the time accurately—it is part of my duty to book the time; I do not speak by guess, but positively—Barry and Hayes were in plain clothes as detectives—I had given them certain orders—I know what their line. of duty was; it would take them to Gloucester Crescent; that was where I ordered them to go, and patrol in that neighbourhood—I know Eversholt Street; they would not have the slightest business there, if they were there at all they would be entirely out of the line of their duty, they would be off the ground to which they were sent—Mr. Dollman's house is about a mile from the station—I know the Stationers' Arms public-house; that would be also out of their beat—supposing persons taken into custody at Gloucester Crescent, I should think the most direct way for the constables to take them to the station would be down Mornington Road, Stanhope Street, and across Cumberland Market into the station—I should think that would be the nearest road, that is the way I should have taken any one if I had taken them—that would be a route frequented by policemen, they would meet with about six or seven policemen that way I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean "meet" or "pass?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They would meet them, as they work that way, they all work to the right.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You would reckon on their meeting that number of policemen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should; supposing they came right down Albany Street, they would only pass two, even if they had the chance of meeting them—Albany Street is a straight beat, and there are only two policemen from the York and Albany to the station door—it would most decidedly be the proper course for them to take prisoners along a route</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186611190023"/>
               <p>where there might be assistance in the event of any attempt at rescue—there had been a good many burglaries in this neighbourhood, and it was in consequence of those burglaries that an extra number of policemen were stationed in plain clothes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When had Barry and Hayes gone on duty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see Hayes till he brought the prisoners in, but Barry at twelve o'clock at night was waiting at the station for Hayes to come—their duty was to go out at twelve o'clock—Hayes did not come to the station till twenty minutes to two o'clock, the time he brought the prisoners; but he sent a policeman in; that was Small, and in consequence of Small's message I sent Barry immediately to him—I saw nothing more of them till they brought the prisoners—after they had brought in the prisoners they went out again on duty—it would be the proper course of their duty to go up to the house where they said they had taken the prisoners, to see whether there were any appearances necessary to take notice of—I do not know that they went, only from what I was told.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing there were appearances about the house of an attempt to break into it, but no appearance to indicate that an entry had been made, would it be the duty of the constables to wake up the inmates, or to wait in the neighbourhood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To wait in the neighbourhood—in matters of this kind the possibility of accomplices is not lost sight of—if they waited watching the premises until daylight, and then woke up the inmates, that would be in the ordinary and proper course of their duty—the time at which they left the station after giving the parties in charge was from five to ten minutes before two o'clock—they brought them in at the back door, and placed them in the dock, I then pushed up the window of my office and took their names and addresses, and after I had done that I took the charge-sheet and walked round into the room where they were, and took the charge, and it was then twenty minutes to two o'clock, it very possibly might have been three minutes before that that they came in—both Hayes and Barry gave the charge—Hayes was the first that spoke; he said, "I charge these two young men with being found in the enclosed garden of No. 63, Gloucester Crescent"—I then said to him, "Are these the young men you were watching when you sent into the station at twelve o'clock?"—he said, "Yes"—he had not anything in his hand at that time that I saw—neither of the constables had that I saw—he made this statement in the hearing of the two young men—neither of them said anything then—I then took down the charge, and read it over to them, and one of them, I could not say which, said, "We were not there," and the other one said, "No, Eversholt Street"—a knife was afterwards produced by Hayes, and he told me he had found it in the garden; that was said in their presence, they must have heard him, because they were not standing two yards from him—neither of them made any remark, not in my hearing—I should have heard them if they had—I do not know how long Hayes has been in the force, I think not above three or four years—he has been under me, or rather I do duty in the station, he has a sergeant looking after him doing duty in the streets—he has borne a very good character indeed, steady, regular, and truthful; if he had not borne the character of a good con<lb/>stable he would not have been put in plain clothes—I saw the prisoners searched—this knife was not taken from them in my presence—I saw them searched—I saw everything that was taken—no knife was taken from them at the station—I think there were two or three matches, they were thrown into the grate; when persons are brought to the station with short pipes</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186611190024"/>
               <p>or matches we generally throw them away—supposing the young men were taken into custody in Eversholt Street, I should take them down Eversholt Street, up Seymour Street, Bedford Street, across Ampthill Square, Edward Street, across Cumberland Market, up Ernest Street into the station—I know the place where Small was on duty—they would be taken past there, coming from Eversholt Street; that would be a part of his beat.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> While Hayes has been in the force has he not been reported? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I believe he has; I can't say how often, perhaps two or three times—he would not have been reported if he had not neglected his duty.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the report made to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, to the Superintendent—I do not know anything of that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Within your knowledge, has he not been reported for not properly working on his beat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I can't say that he has—I cannot say he has not—if I was on day duty and he was on night duty I should not know anything about his duties—I know he has been reported, what for I don't know—I do not know that he was in the service of Mr. Curling, of Davies's Wharf, before he came into the police force—I do not know whether Mr. Curling is here—I do not know whether he was in the employ of Mr. Scovel, of Hibernia Wharf—I did not inquire into his character when he joined the police, so I do not know anything at all about it—I can't say what kind of plain clothes Hayes and Barry had on—I can't say that one of them had an umbrella in his hand—I cannot say that he had not—I don't believe that one of them had a light coat on—I don't re<lb/>member it—I could not swear that he had—I don't believe that either of them had a light coat on—I will not swear he had not, because I don't know whether he had or not—I would not swear to a thing I am not positive of—I don't believe Barry had an umbrella in his hand; I did not see one, not to notice it—if the constables saw persons of a suspicious character it would be their duty to follow them, up Eversholt Street, or any other street—it would not be their duty, upon seeing the window of a house lifted, immediately to alarm the people in the house, because they told me the shutters were not opened—it was their duty to wait till daylight and not to alarm the persons in the house—the shutters were closed, and there was no proof that any person had entered the house—I should think it would be folly on the part of the policemen to alarm the persons if they saw the shutters undisturbed—I have never heard of persons getting into a house and fastening the shutters after them when they were in the house committing their depredations—I don't say it would be more likely that they would leave the shutters open to be seen by anybody pass<lb/>ing by—it was no part of the officers' duty to alarm the persons till the proper time of waking from their rest, just before they came off duty—they would come off duty at six o'clock—if I had been on duty I should have awoke them, so as to have had time to search the house before I came off duty—I should not wait till the last moment before coming off duty, but so as to have time to get to the station at the proper time, six o'clock—if I was confident in my own mind that no person had entered the house, I should not think it right to ring the bell to ascertain whether I was right or wrong in that conjecture, I should use my own judgment upon that—it would be the duty of the constables to go back to the house immediately after leaving their prisoners at the station—the officers left before me, and I was away before two—when they brought the lads in I did not see any<lb/>thing</p>

               <p>in the hands of either of the constables—it was after they had been searched that I saw the knife—the charge was booked first, then they were searched, and then for the first time I saw the knife—when they came in with the lads I did not see a knife in the hand of either of them—I can't say that I must have seen it if that had been so, most likely I should not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you first saw the knife was it open or shut? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Open; I am positive it was not upon the person of either of the lads when they were searched—as to awaking the inmates of the house, a constable must exercise his own judgment under the emergency—if my judgment assured me there was nobody in the house I should wait until I had time to awake the inmates before going off my beat—that is the course I should pursue.</p>

Last night, about twelve o'clock, I was in Mornington Road with Barry, 99 S. I saw the two prisoners standing at the corner for about ten minutes; they then went up Mornington Road. About half-past one I saw them in the garden of No. 63, Gloucester Crescent. I leaped over the wall and caught the prisoner Dye, and Pearce was taken into custody by Barry in the garden. I found this knife. We took them to the station, and at the station the prisoner Dye said, 'That is my knife.' The other prisoner said, 'Yes, I sharpened it for you.' I and Barry went back to the house, and saw that the latch of the area window had been forced open, and some pieces of the sash lay on the window-ledge—the knife fitted the marks exactly. I found this chisel in the area. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The knife was not taken from the pocket of the prisoner.")</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 15, Johnson Street, Somer's Town, with my parents—I am in the employment of Mr. Ivory, a pianoforte manufacturer, at Brooks's factory, Cumberland Market—I had been in his employ about ten months previous to this transaction—I know Dye—he is a companion and friend of mine—I remember the night of the 30th August—on that night I met Dye in a place called the "Slips" in the Regent's Park—I should think it was a little before eight o'clock—I did not part company with him at all that night—I was with him during the whole night until we were taken into custody—I know Gloucester Crescent—I was not in Gloucester Crescent that night—I was not in the garden of the house No. 63—a chap of the name of Gregory was with me in the "Slips" besides Dye, another one of the name of Blackburn, and George Potts, and a young girl of the name of Phoebe Glue—I could not say for certain what time it was when we left the "Slips," but it was about a quarter past eight—we went to the Regalia public-house, in Augusta Street—Gregory, Blackburn, and Potts were with us there—Phoebe Glue had left us—we stayed at the Regalia until about twenty minutes past eleven, and then went to the York and Albany public-house—that was the nearest point that we were to Gloucester Crescent—I do not know the house that was supposed to have been broken—I should say Gloucester Crescent was about 150 yards from the York and Albany—we stayed at the York and Albany till they shut up, twelve o'clock—Gregory, Dye, Potts, and Blackburn were with me up to that time—when we left there we went down Park Street into Smith's, the one o'clock house, the Camden Stores, at the corner of Grove Street and Park Street—it was about ten minutes or a quarter past twelve when we got to Smith's—all the persons I have named were with me except Glue—she joined us again at the York and Albany before we got to the one o'clock house—we walked straight into Smith's and called for some ale—all of us went in—I believe Glue went in with us—we remained there till about five minutes to one—after we left there we walked down Park Street, turned down by the Britannia, down High Street, till we got to the corner of Warren Street, where we saw some young chaps standing outside the Stationers' Arms—from what I have learnt since, I wanted to fight some of them—a young chap told me I wanted to fight him—I had been drinking a good deal of beer that even<lb/>ing—I had known those young men by sight—I first saw the defendant Hayes when I got to the Stationers' Arms—Barry was with him—they</p>

               <p>were standing outside the Stationers' Arms—they were both dressed in private clothes—one of them, Barry, had an umbrella in his hand—I could not swear which one had a light coat, but I know one had a light overcoat—there was a little bit of a row with our party and the others outside the Stationers' Arms, and we walked down Cam<lb/>den Town—the constables followed us—when we got about a hundred yards down there was a man in a fit—we stopped to look at him, and one of the constables said, "Sling your dannel"—he said that to Blackburn, who was with us—we then walked across the road to the other side of High Street, and Barry poked Blackburn in the back with his umbrella—then we ran, and they ran a little way, and Black<lb/>burn and Dye turned round King Street—I and Gregory and Phoebe Glue ran straight down Camden Town—our party and Dye and Black<lb/>burn met again at the corner of High Street at the perambulator maker's—they would go down King Street, round Bayham Street, and round Earl's Terrace—we were all together at the bottom of High Street, except Potts—he left Smith's public-house two or three minutes before we did, and went home—that was before the poking in the back with the umbrella—when we were at the corner of High Street we stood bidding Blackburn good night, because he lives up Kentish Town—we bade him good night at the corner of Eversholt Street—that is just across the road—before Blackburn had left us we had crossed the road, and stood at the chemist's shop at the corner of Eversholt Street—it was there that Black<lb/>burn left us—we then went straight down Eversholt Street—we had gone half-way down Eversholt Street, and Dye ran on ahead—he did not run, he went a little quicker than we—I asked where he was going—he turned round and said he was going round the corner to make water—he went round Crawley Mews, and when he got round there Hayes and Barry were there, and knocked him down—I and Glue and Gregory were on the right side of the road coming from Camden Town—the constables and Dye were on the opposite side—they took Dye into custody, and they were bringing him across the road, and Gregory and Glue ran up, and I said, "What is the matter?" and Hayes said to Barry, "Collar him; we may as well have a couple"—they then took me into custody—Gregory was following behind, and they told him if he did not go back they would have him—Gregory then went home—he went away—we were taken from Eversholt Street; through Lidlington Place, across the road by some iron posts—they stopped there for a second or two, as though considering which way they should take us—we then went through the iron posts, and round Harrington Square, across the Hampstead road, round Mornington Crescent, up Stan-hope Place, along Stanhope Street, into Edward Street, up Edward Street into Cumberland Market, Munster Street, and Ernest Street, to the back door of the station—Phoebe Glue followed us to the station—we were put behind an iron bar and searched, and the sergeant began writing something down in a book—I do not know what he wrote down—I asked Barry what he took us up for, and he told me to hold my noise—I first heard what I was charged with next morning, when we were brought out of the cells to go to Marylebone—I heard it from one of the sergeants—I do not know his name—I saw Dye searched at the station—Hayes held up a knife when he was searched and said, "Here is a pretty thing"—Dye said, "That is my knife," and I said, "Yes, I sharpened it for you yester<lb/>day"—we had been in the station about five minutes before the knife was produced—I did not see Hayes or Barry in the Stationers' Arms—I never</p>

               <p>was in the house—I know Stanley, the officer of the police-court—I saw him here last session when the charge against Barry was being tried—I went out with him from the other court to a public-house—I said I wanted to go out and have something to drink, and he said he would go with me and another gentleman—we had some cooper and pork pie—I believe there was a few words between us while we were having it—I cannot exactly remember what it was—I know I said it was a scandalous affair to take us and charge us with burglary, and we knew nothing about it—Stanley merely said, "Yes" and "No"—I might have said a few more words, but I cannot remember them—I did not say I should be glad if the policemen got of—I said I should not care whether they got off or not, as long it was all dropped, as I was tired of it—nothing was said about "trick" and "tie" that I am aware of—I do not remember whether any<lb/>thing was said about Mr. Ivory.</p>

               <p>expect to see Dye again in Eversholt Street—I was not surprised to see him—it was nothing uncommon to see him—as far as I know, that was the first time a man was poked in the back with an umbrella by a policeman—I cannot answer for Blackburn, and I shall not—I have not often been to Dye's house—I know where it is—it is three or four hun<lb/>dred yards from the place where he was taken into custody, and where I was taken is about two hundred yards from my house—when I ran I meant to go home; I was prevented by being taken into custody—I was not run<lb/>ning at the time I was taken into custody—I stopped on seeing Dye taken into custody by two men—I had not been running up to that time—we had been stopping at the corner of Eversholt Street, bidding Blackburn good night—Blackburn did not come back again—he went home, he went down King Street with Dye—he lives up Kentish Town—Eversholt Street was not in his way to Kentish Town, nor King Street. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first see any of your friends after you had been taken into cus<lb/>tody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Next morning, at Marylebone Police-court, I saw my mother—I there heard the evidence of the officers, and heard for the first time that we were charged with attempting to commit a burglary in Gloucester Crescent—I first heard that we were charged with burglary at Albany Street Station—I heard next morning that we were charged with burglary at a house in Gloucester Crescent, at Albany Street Station—that was before I saw my mother—I heard the officers swear to having taken me into custody there—I did not say that I had plenty of witnesses to prove that I had never been there the whole evening, because I was so confused at being taken up for, burglary, never having been locked up before, and I thought it very hard, and I could not speak; I tried to and I could not, my mouth came regularly parched and I could not speak—I did say it was false—I should have said a little more, but I could not go on with it, being so confused, and my mouth was so parched—I stopped mid<lb/>way in my speech—Dye said nothing—he will be better able than I to tell you whether his mouth was parched—if I had not been prevented by my mouth being parched I should have told the story as I have to-day—I was simply prevented from doing so from that cause—I really mean to tell the jury so—I did not have time to tell my mother, I was drove in like a dog—we were handcuffed together—my mother was sitting as I went by the door, and she said something to me, but I did not understand her, I had not got time as I walked past her—she did not ask me for the key—I said, "I have done nothing"—that was all I said to my mother—that was all I had a chance to say—I was prevented continuing the conversa<lb/>tion by Hayes and Barry—they pushed me in like a dog—Mr. Ivory is my master—he does not keep an establishment himself—he is a piece<lb/>work master—he works in one of Mr. Brooks's shops—I call him my master, and Mr. Brooks's servant—I don't know whether he is paying the expenses of these proceedings—I am not paying them—I don't know who is, I have never asked—I should think the chief one would be Mr. Ivory, because he was the first party that took it up—I do not know how soon he took it up—it was in the House of Detention—a young chap, named George Scott, first saw me in the House of Detention—he has been a sailor—he is not here—he has nothing to do with defending me—my brother was the next person I saw, he is older than me—I saw my solicitor at Marylebone Police-court for the first time—I had seen Mr. Ivory, he came to me in the House of Detention—I told him the truth—I told him what I have told to-day—that was after my brother had been, the third or fourth day after</p>

               <p>I was taken, in the next week—I have got back the latchkey that I borrowed of my mother—it was in my pocket when I was at the station—it was taken from me, I am sure of that—the "Slips" is about three hun<lb/>dred or four hundred yards from the house in Gloucester Crescent—I used to be there twice or three times a week, but I have not been since the trial—they are green parts of the park that lead down to the canal—I don't believe that part of the park shuts all night, nor Gloucester Grate—there are young ladies as well as young gentlemen there—I don't know whether they are in equal numbers, they might be, I can't say—Dye used to go there—I did not make acquaintance with the young ladies—very little—I only knew one, a girl of the name of Rachel—that is not the person they call <hi rend="italic">Scotchy</hi>—I don't know who <hi rend="italic">Scotchy</hi> Is—I have heard the name, but I don't know the girl—I don't know the girl who was there with Blackburn—I don't associate with any of the girls—I knew Phoebe Glue by sight, seeing her with Dye, that's all—Dye associates with her—I went there with young chaps the same as myself—sometimes we practise running—I get off work at 7 o'clock—we go to the "Slips" to practise running from about eight till about nine o'clock or half-past—it is very seldom I am out as late as twelve o'clock—I am sometimes—the young ladies do not practise run<lb/>ning with me or the others—I never have them ruuning about after me—sometimes we have the boxing-gloves up there, only for amusement, and we practise running—I don't know what becomes of the girls—I have no notion, they are away from us—I can't tell what they are doing—I know they are there in the park—when we have finished the race we do not come back to the girls, we go and sit down on a seat—there is a seat there that we generally sit on—it is away from them, you can be—they come up and speak to young chaps that are there, that is about it—I suppose we get three or four runs of an evening—I have seen chaps go out with the girls, I mean go down the park and out of the gate, and I have seen them walk about up there—the light is the same as in all other parks—I have lost sight of them occasionally, and after a short time they have come back again—that has been while I have been on the seat—Phoebe Glue was the friend of Dye—when I have seen them walk together they have always gone towards the gate—they have not come back together—the girl has not come back at all—I do not make these girls presents—I never give anything to any of them—I have never had anything from them, not at any time, I swear that—I have never seen Dye have anything from them—I told you before I know one by name, and only one, that is Rachel—I don't know what has become of her, I have not heard—she was not my friend—I knew her by name, but not to walk with her—she walked with a young chap what goes up there, who works in the pianoforte line—I don't know his name—he does not work in the same place with me—I know what they call him, Long Charlie—I don't know where he is now—I saw him on Saturday night in Camden Town, and spoke to him—I have not heard that he has been out of the way at all—I don't know Exmouth Street—I have never slept out of my mother's house—I have been away of a Saturday night, that was when I was in a fishing club and went out fishing—the club was held at the Seymour Arms, Seymour Street—I was never at Exmouth Street—I went to fish at Elstree sometimes, and some-times at Watford—I never slept in any house with Dye and Glue and an<lb/>other girl—I am quite sure of that—I don't know a person named Apple<lb/>ton who used to work in the same place with me, and who used to go to the "Slips" regularly—I have no idea who you mean—I know that a man</p>

               <p>come—Constable Small, 80, came—he went and spoke to Sergeant Bendall and I was ordered to go and meet Hayes in the Mornington Road—I should think Mornington Road is about a quarter of a mile from the station—I should say rather more—that is the nearest point, the railway bridge—that is at the corner of Stanhope Place, in the Mornington Road—I went beyond Stanhope Place and met Hayes to the left of that, between the two bridges in the Mornington Road—that would be about twenty minutes to twenty-five minutes past twelve—Hayes pointed out two young men, Pearce and Dye, some little distance up the Mornington Road from where I met Hayes—they went in the direction of Gloucester Crescent—they were walking together—they were just moving away when Hayes pointed them out to me—I and Hayes watched them—they went up Mornington Road and afterwards into Park Street, and into Mornington Crescent after that—directly they got into Mornington Crescent I lost sight of them—we were in the Mornington Road when we lost sight of them—I do not mean Mornington Crescent, I mean Glou<lb/>cester Crescent—we watched them into Gloucester Crescent and then lost sight of them—we made an arrangement between as and I searched the right side of Gloucester Crescent, the gardens, and Hayes the left side, and when I had got about half-way round the Crescent I heard Hayes raise an alarm—I turned round and saw Hayes going over the wall and saw a man leaving a garden on the opposite side—that man was Pearce—he was running—I ran after him and took him about 150 yards from where I saw him leave the garden—I collared him and took him back and met Hayes coming out of the garden with Dye—I took Pearce to the station—I left Hayes coming behind with Dye—I saw an open knife in Hayes's hand—I am quite sure about that, Hayes called my attention to it at the time—he showed it to me in the presence of Dye and in the hearing of Dye—he told me that he found it at Dye's feet in the garden—Dye did not say anything to that—I arrived at the station I think at about half-past one as near as possible, it might be a little earlier—the police are not supplied with watches—I have a watch—there is a clock at the station—when we got to the station we charged the prisoners with being found in enclosed premises for an unlawful purpose—we were not aware at that time that any attempt had been made to break into the house—there was no other constable in Gloucester Crescent when we took the two young men—the route we took to the station from Gloucester Crescent was across Park Street, through Mornington Road, till we got to the railway bridge, and then turned to the right up Stanhope Street—Albany Street may be a shorter route—there is a reason why we went the particular route we did—if we went through Albany Street and required any assistance, we should meet but one or two constables: on the other route we would meet about seven, and if we required assistance we could get it more readily there—I saw some policemen going that way—I saw two or three persons not policemen also—I saw a person of the name of Davey just a few yards beyond-Park Street—I might have seen him before, I did not know him—going along the street I saw a policeman named King—after I had seen King I saw another person who turned out to be Davis—I had never spoken to Davis before—as far as I know I never saw him before—after seeing Davis I saw 66, Sinclair—these different people had an opportunity of seeing me and Hayes—after we had disposed of our prisoners at the station we went back to Gloucester Crescent—we arrived there, as near as I can recollect, at about three o'clock—some little time was occupied</p>

               <p>at the station in taking down the charge—when we got back to Glouces<lb/>ter Crescent we examined the premises No, 63—we found footmarks in the garden and traced them to the area—we then saw, by the lamp of the constable on the beat, that the window was open—he was present when we discovered this—there were marks of some sharp instrument having been used—we remained in the immediate neighbourhood, in a position that if any person came we must have seen them—from what we saw of the window we formed a judgment as to whether any person was inside—we saw the window open, but the shutters were fast: there were no marks of violence whatever on the shutters, and from that we con<lb/>cluded that no person had entered by that way—I consider my duty was, therefore, to remain in the immediate neighbourhood in the first place—I did not think I should be doing right in alarming the house, there might have been an invalid there—I did not think it right to alarm the house at that time, as I did not think any entry had been made—we waited about till rather before five, and then awoke the inmates—my proper beat is the second and third sections—that would not bring me to Eversholt Street under any circumstances—I was not near there—I could not be, in fact I had no right to be there—I did not take these men in custody in Eversholt Street, decidedly not—I was not that evening in the Stationers' Arms—I was there two or three nights previously, with Hayes—I am quite sure I was not in the public-house that night—I have never been in that public-house but once previously to this matter taking place—I was at the station-house, in fact, from ten minutes to twelve till some minutes after twelve—I was dressed as I am now, with a scarf round my neck—Hayes was dressed as he is now—neither of us had a light coat on—I had an umbrella—I always carry an umbrella while upon duty, in case of any change in the weather—I did not poke or strike any one with that umbrella that night—no complaint was made about it till very lately—the knife I saw was decidedly not taken out of the pocket at the station—it was found at the place—Hayes carried the knife in his hand all the way from the Crescent to the station.</p>

               <p>—I do not know whether he entered with me—I called for a glass of half and-half, and the man asked me to give him half a pint of porter—he was in a very distressed state, and I told the barmaid to draw a glass of porter, which I paid for with a sixpence I believe, but was not quite certain—I do not know the man—I had never seen him before—I was about two minutes in the public-house, and the man who I had given the glass of beer to came out with me, and further solicited me to give him some help, as he was so distressed—I was walking towards Cannon Street—I walked away from him; I wanted no further association with him—I crossed from St. Swithin's Lane, just by Bush Lane; I do not know whether I had passed Bush Lane, but it was near that part—I received a violent blow, which cut my eyebrow right across; the scar still remains—it deluged me with blood, and was so extensive that it reached down to my lip, and I have scarcely recovered the feeling of that side of my face up to the present time—I did not stagger or fall, but immediately seized the man, who struck me and received another blow on the other side of my face, which broke my jaw, and so far stunned me that I felt to lose all power, but was not quite deprived of my senses—I was flung immediately on the ground by the man who struck me—I had no power of seeing his face—it was all done very rapidly; it was three or four seconds from the time I received the blow till I was flung down—I felt my purse being removed from my pocket, but cannot say whether that was while I was on the ground—I recollect saying, "That man has robbed men," but whether it was when I was on the ground or when I was lifted up I do not know—I have no recollection for two hours afterwards—I cannot tell whether the blows were struck by a fist or by some weapon—I was laid up for three months from the injury to my jaw—I went next day, ill as I was, with one of the detectives to Drummond's bank—I have seen two notes since, but cannot recognise them, as I do not think there was any mark on them when they were in my possession.</p>

I am barmaid at the Bay Tree, St. Swithin's Lane—on the 24th April a policeman named Wines came to me to make in quiries—I had seen Mr. Caswell at the bar about an hour before that drinking with the prisoner—Mr. Caswell paid for two glasses of beer—I had seen the prisoner several times before, through his serving the house with lemons, and knew him perfectly well—Mr. Caswell was there about five minutes, and the prisoner was with him the whole time; they both went out together—Mr. Caswell was slightly under the influence of liquor—when Wines came to me an hour afterwards I gave him a description of the prisoner and the prosecutor—the prisoner never came with lemons after that night—I next saw him at the Mansion House on Monday, the 5th November—on the evening the prisoner was at the bar with the</p>

On the night of the 24th April I was on duty in plain clothes, and about half-past six or twenty minutes to seven I was about thirty yards from Cannon Street, in St. Swithin's Lane—I had not passed the Bay Tree—St. Swithin's Church was on my left, and the Bay Tree on my right—I met two men walking in the middle of the road, which is very narrow—they were about seventy yards from the Bay Tree when I first saw them, and about eighty yards from where Caswell was knocked down—they passed me and turned to the left—I turned to see in which direction they went, and when they got to the bottom of the lane they turned to the left, eastward—the prisoner had hold of the prosecutor's right arm—I know that it was the prisoner, I picked him out from a dozen others—I know his face and person—I had seen him before several times—he is a hawker—I have frequently seen him about the Mansion house and the Bank, hawking lemons and nuts this year—I saw nothing more of them, as the corner hid them from me—I received information about half an hour afterwards and went to the station and described the prisoner—I saw the last witness at the Bay Tree about eight o'clock and received a description from her of the prisoner and prosecutor—she said that she knew the prisoner well—on 6th November I went to Bow Lane Station and picked the prisoner out from a number of others—he was then in custody—I had not seen him since 24th April, though I had searched for him during the first fortnight in the neighbourhood of Petticoat Lane, where he lived, and near the Mansion House, where I had been accustomed to see him—he wore a round hat when I saw him in St. Swithin's Lane, what they call a deerstalker or a <hi rend="italic">Muller cut down</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a teadealer carrying on business in Newgate Street—on the 30th October, about half-past one o'clock in the night, I was passing through Fox Court, Holborn, with a woman—that is the last court at the top of Holborn Hill, on the right-hand side going towards Holborn—I saw five men there, the prisoners are three of them—one of them ran up against me and knocked me against a house, and before I could recover myself one of them seized me by the neck from, behind, and I was drawn over his knees, so that I was reclining across him—Wilson is the man who first attacked me—while I was in that position another man took what money I had from my pockets, and. tore my trousers very much, and tore the cloth away—I was thrown to the ground and one or two of them then kicked me about the face and head—I believe Everett is one who did so, but I cannot speak positively—the others wereby—I only had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was taken away—while I was on the ground the woman called out "Police" and "Murder," which attracted their attention, and they left me and went to her—I immediately went into Holborn, met two constables, went back to Fox Court, and met the woman with my hat—Wilson then came up with a policeman, and I gave him and Everett in charge—I have not the slightest doubt that they are two of the men—I saw Thompson a week afterwards at Bow Street—I am as confident about him as I am about the other two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Wilson. Q.</hi> Did not you say to the Magistrate that you believed me and this one were two of them, and at last, after a little hesitation, that you were positively sure we were the identical two? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I swore confidently that you were two out of the five—I said I had not the slightest doubt about it, but I could not swear whether you pulled me from behind, and whether Everett robbed me—I was with the woman for an hour, but not at any public-house—nobody else was with her while I was with her—I say that you and Everett are two of the parties who robbed me, I could see your features as distinctly as I do now—I believe you had hold of me behind—there was a gas<lb/>lamp there—I did not state at the Court that I was not sure whether you were two of the parties, or that I had been with the woman since half-past five in the evening, or that I had been over the water with her—I had had six or seven glasses of beer during the evening, but when I went to the station and charged you I was perfectly sober—there was nobody with the woman—I do not know who she is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Everett. Q.</hi> On Tuesday, the 30th, before the Magistrate, did you not state that you were not sure we were the persons who assaulted and robbed you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Mr. Barker did not say, "You must not come to this place unless you are sure," nor did I then say, "Well, I am sure"—Wilson is the first of the men who pushed against me, and I can swear to you being there, and I believe it was you who kicked me when on the ground, but I cannot state that positively—I saw you standing within a foot of me when I was on the ground—I saw your face, there was a lamp immediately over us—the place was broad enough for us all to be together—I told the policeman I had been robbed and garotted in the court, but did not describe the persons who had done it, as we ran down without further argument, but I could have done so—he did not point out anybody to me, but a constable brought you up two minutes afterwards—when Wilson was taken I swore to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Coburg Street, Drummond Street, and am a hammerman or smith's labourer—on 9th October last I was at Shaw's house—I first went to the Wrekin, in Broad Court, kept by Shaw's father, and from there to the prisoner Shaw's, in Windmill Street, Haymarket—the boy Wilmot asked me would I look after him; I refused at first, but at last he and I went together to the prisoner Shaw's about nine or half-past—we had a drop of something at the bar, and then went upstairs—I did not see Shaw there that I know of—I have often been there before <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi>, and Wilmot with me—there is always a ring formed in the room, it is never down, the wall of the room forms one side of it, and the rest is formed by stakes and a rope—Young came up into the room about a quarter of an hour after us, I had Donelly with me—Morris and Daw were there, they were on the other side—I know nothing about those that came up—I took my man into the ring and acted as his second, and Donelly also—Morris and Daw acted as seconds for Young—the men put gloves on; they were new gloves fastened with elastic; one of my elastics broke, and I tied it on with a piece of tape, so that it could not come off—they were stripped as usual to their buff—they had their shirts off, and were naked to the waist—I don't know whether there was a timekeeper—I did not see Flynn there—only what I have heard—I was so excited looking after my boy—it did not matter about having him up to time that is a matter of form—I did not hear any one call "Time"—there were 100 people there—I was in the ring looking after my boy, to see that he was not hurt—Flynn was not in the ring—I can't answer whether he was the referee, I never chose him—I saw Good there—the people occupied seats on both sides of the ring—they fought a succession of rounds, sparring—it continued about an hour, or over an hour I should think—they hit each other of course, I don't know whether as hard as they could, that they know better themselves—they hit as hard as they liked with the gloves—</p>

               <p>I have tutored gentlemen to spar, and when they have got. the gloves on they have got rather rash in their excitement, they can't help it—I don't know what they were fighting for, I never heard—at the last round Wilmot fell either by a shove or a blow from Young, he fell on his posterior and struck his head against a post that runs up in the centre of the ring—the hit was somewhere in the face—I picked him up, he felt rather queer and a little giddy—I gave in for him—I dressed him and gave him a drop of brandy and took him to the hospital in a cab—Good gave him a half-sovereign in his corner—I don't know what it was for, it was before the fight.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there not generally a timekeeper on these occasions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, this was not a prize<lb/>fight—there was no timekeeper that I am aware of—the thing comes to an end by giving in for them—my boy was winning fast, and I wanted the other lad's father to give in for him, but he would not, and the consequence was, my boy met with this misfortune—you would not allow a man to wait for a quarter of an hour before coming up; if your man was not fit to stand up and spar you would give in for him—they go on till one of them gives in, it don't want any timekeeping—they get bruised about the arms of course—if you keep tapping the head it will weaken and confuse them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>at Shaw's, in Windmill Street—I had been at the Wrekin first—I had a card, which I paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for—I bought it of one of my customers—it is a <hi rend="italic">facsimile</hi> to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when I got to the Wrekin I was given to understand that it would not take place there, and I was sent to Shaw's son's, in Windmill Street—I produced my ticket, and was admitted by a person standing in the passage, who took all the tickets—that was not Shaw himself—I saw him in the bar that night, and I saw him when he came up into the room and put an end to it by turning the gas off—I did not see him in the room during the sparring—the room was fitted up for sparring—I saw Young and Wilmot set to with the gloves—it continued little under an hour—at the end of that time they seemed to be so tired and fatigued that they could not strike many blows—they could not come up—I did not observe whether there was a time-keeper—I heard two or three people calling out "Time," half-a-dozen—I cannot say that I heard any of the prisoners—the men were tardy in coming up—I believe they should come up as soon as they got up again, but I am not acquainted with the <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> of these things—the seconds took them up and gave them a glass of water, and put them on their knees every time—at the last round they came up, and all in a stumble together, and had a hugging match—they were too exhausted to strike one another forcible blows—they were trying to throw each other, and the deceased slipped away, or was thrown away from the prisoner Young—he was not struck down by the blow—he got up, and wanted to come up again, but they would not allow him—the spectators kept on crying out "Time"—I do not know whether Evans gave in for him, but Shaw came in and put an end to it, and turned off the gas—I should say there, were about 100 persons there—there were seats—I do not know whether some were more expense than others—I was never there before—I saw Good there—I heard him tell the deceased not to wrestle, not to allow him to be hugged—that was at the beginning of the contest—when I left the deceased appeared to be in a fainting state—he was breathing heavily, as if he had fainted from exhaustion and fatigue.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon on the 9th October at Charing Cross Hospital, when the deceased Edward Wilmot was brought there, a little before twelve—he was quite insensible—we put him to bed, and did everything we could for him, but he died about half-past five the next morning—he was never sensible the whole time—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found the right arm, the chest, and the face very extensively bruised all over, and the head was extensively bruised—on taking off the scalp I found several bruises, one larger than the rest just over the right ear—there was a large collection of blood, and a rupture of one of the arteries that goes to the membrane of the brain—that rupture coincided exactly with the larger bruise that I found externally on the right side of the head, about two inches above the right ear—that would cause pressure of blood on the brain and consequent death—I think the external appearances were exactly such as I should expect to find from blows by the fist with gloves on—they were large bruises—if he had lived a little longer the arm and face would have been completely black—the flesh was cut from the lips by the teeth—the brain was very healthy, and there was nothing at all the matter with the man that I saw—the appearances before death and those afterwards perfectly coincided—I attribute the collection of blood to the bruises—a blow or fall would cause such injury—it must have been a severe one—I should think the blow with the gloves would do it—I have seen some of them very hard—I saw some produced at the inquest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sub<lb/>warder in the Middlesex House of Correction, Coldbath Fields—on 16th October last the prisoner was there, undergoing a sentence—some time that morning I reported him to the governor, in his presence, for talking on the day previous in the tailors' shop—the prisoner made some observation to the governor—the governor admonished him at first, and after he made the observation he ordered him a day's cell and bread and water—after making my report I returned back to the tailors' shop—a number of prisoners work there, and the prisoner had been em<lb/>ployed there; it was about a quarter to eleven when I got back—when the prisoner came into the shop he came up to me and made a spring on me, I turned round and caught hold of him by the collar—by that means he fell down or threw himself down—at the time he made the spring on me I was walking down the shop; he was in front of me—I did not see anything in his hand when he made the spring; he made a rush at me; he did not turn round; he was facing me, coming towards me—he had got his hands loose, he attempted to strike me; he struck at me with his clenched fist, and I caught him by the collar; he aimed at my face—he did not strike me, he struck at me—when he threw himself down I had got hold of him by the collar, leaning over him, and I found a stab in my chest with the scissors directly I was down leaning over him—it was under the fifth rib on the left side—I did not see where he got the scissors from—I saw them in his hand after I was wounded—he was making a second blow at me, and a prisoner named Driffield came up and prevented</p>

               <p>the second blow; in doing that he was wounded in the hand—I did not hear the prisoner say anything when he wounded me—an officer who is present was in the shop at the time, and he came up to my assistance—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the scissors used in the tailors' shop—they belong to the prisoner and bear his number—I did not see them taken from him—I have been off duty ever since—Driffield was the only prisoner that came to my assistance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a prisoner in the House of Correction under<lb/>going a sentence—on 16th October I was in the tailors' shop about eleven o'clock in the forenoon—I heard a noise, a scuffling in the middle of the shop—I looked round and saw the prisoner and the officer scuffling together—the prisoner was just falling on his back—the officer was forcing him down—he had him by the collar with his right hand, and the prisoner had the officer by the collar with his left hand—I then saw a pair of scissors in the prisoner's right hand—as he was falling he had them in his hand—he struck once or twice, but could not hit the officer—he struck short—he then rose himself as well as he could by the right shoulder and succeeded in hitting him a violent blow somewhere in the left breast—I then got up to them—as I went to the officer's assistance he was striking another blow—I put my hand between the officer's breast and the prisoner's hand as he was striking the blow, and he cut me with the point of the scissors on the left hand—I could not tell what was done afterwards, I was so severely wounded—in two or three minutes I knew what was going on again, and I was taken to the hospital in the prison and put to bed and had my wound dressed, and a doctor was there directly.</p>

               <p>from the report office, where he had been reported by Batten, and went to the tailors' shop—the prisoner had no business there then—he passed me—I called him by his number—he took no notice—I went up to see where he had got to, and he was then close on to the officer, about two yards from him—he drew a pair of scissors from out of his breast, went up to the officer, and aimed a blow at him from behind, but whether he struck him or not then I cannot say—the officer's back was towards him at the time—with that I called out, and the officer faced about—the prisoner had recovered his arm then—his arm drew back, and he made another thrust at the officer and struck him in the breast—I can't say whether it was right or left, but it was in front that he struck him; then the officer closed with him, got hold of him by the collar of his jacket, and tried to put him down to take the scissors from him—by that time I got up to them—the prisoner had the scissors in his right hand then; he had them in this fashion (<hi rend="italic">points downwards</hi>)—that was the way he took them out of his breast, and he was trying then to stab the officer as he was down—the prisoner was down on his back—the prisoner's number is 100, and that is the number of the scissors he had—these are the scissors he should have had at his employment in the shop—I did not take those scissors from his hand—I took another pair, No. 83—those were not his own—his scissors, No. 100, were brought down to me out of the shop afterwards—no doubt he had them about him all the time he was up at the office; I saw him take them out of his breast; that was not the pair I took from his hand—the pair I took from his hand was a pair he took from the board as we were bringing him from the shop to the report office—he <hi rend="italic">col<lb/>lared</hi> those, and I took them from him—I can't say how he came to have his own scissors upon his person—he ought to have put them on the board before he went to the report office; they were taken from him immediately after the blow was given—I did not take them from him—No. 83 scissors I took from his hand after the first pair had been taken from him—those were not the scissors he struck the officer with, those were No. 100; the others I saw him take off the board after the scuffle—he made no remark when he aimed the blow—I was present when he was reported to the Governor—he was admonished for talking—he told the Governor there was a higher one than him one day, then bread and water would be all over—then the Governor ordered him bread and water.</p>

I am surgeon to the House of Correction—I exa<lb/>mined Batten—I met them coming out of the room, and took him and Driffield up to the infirmary immediately—Batten was bleeding freely from two wounds on the left side of the chest, from the two points of the scissors, I believe—his nervous system seemed very much shaken—I put him to bed immediately—I dressed the wounds, which bled freely—all his under-clothing was saturated with blood—the wound was on the left side, just over the heart, over the fifth rib—the rib stopped the blow—if the blow had been between the ribs it would probably have proved fatal—he is a very fleshy man, which mitigated the danger—it was a deep wound, down to the rib; I probed it—he has remained off duty and under my care up to the present time—the wound in itself has not turned out to be dangerous—I examined the hand of Driffield; he had a deep cut in the palm, in the fleshy part, dividing the tendons—it bled very freely, and was a dangerous wound—it is now nearly healed, but I have no doubt the first two fingers will remain in some degree stiff for life in consequence of it—it was a wound that might have been inflicted with a pair of scissors.</p>

I have been in that pain and faint that I have not known how to walk round the yard, and it was all because I reported an officer. This is what they call worrying a poor man. I was told by a prisoner who had been in there before that they would worry me for it, and would not put my number down when I wanted to go to the closet, and they have kept their word. No man could suffer more than I have by these fiends, that call themselves men; I am ashamed of them. I would not use a poor dumb animal as they have treated me, as God is my witness. Not satisfied with sending me for two years unjustly, they must hunt me up like this. I have no witness. Where could I get a witness? I leave it in the Almighty's hands.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Hammersmith, and am surgeon to the union workhouse—on Friday morning, 14th September, I saw the deceased child in the nursery there between ten and half-past ten o'clock—I could not form a very correct opinion as to its age, because it was in such an emaciated condition—it was a few weeks old—it was in a very filthy condition—I examined it particularly—its head and ears were dirty—it had on a white frock, most filthy, saturated with vomit, and stank—the eyes were sunk in the sockets, the mouth half open, and it was con<lb/>tinually moaning—it had a napkin on with some fullers' earth, and the thighs were excoriated, ulcerated—it died on the evening of the 5th Sep<lb/>tember, about five o'clock—I had ordered it food at first—I ordered it half milk and half water as far as it could take it—it was too weak to suck or take the bottle, therefore food was given by a spoon—finding it did not rally, I ordered milk and brandy every hour; at the same time I requested a young woman who had been recently confined to suckle it—the child attempted to suck in my presence, but could not—the young woman then milked the milk out of her breast and gave it the child with a spoon—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the Monday by order of the coroner—I found no particular difference in its appearance at that time—there were no marks of violence at all—the child weighed 51bs. 14 oz.—a newly-born child in good condition generally weighs between 61bs. and 71bs. when born—this child ought to have weighed from 101bs. to 121bs.—I found the brain perfectly healthy, except that it was pale—there was very little blood in the vessels—I examined the mouth—there was no thrush—the lungs were perfectly healthy, only bloodless—the heart was healthy, and contained a very small quantity of coagulated blood on the right side—I think there was very little blood on the other side—the stomach was small and collapsed—it was perfectly healthy inside—it contained but a very small quantity of what I supposed to be coagu<lb/>lated milk, about a spoonful—the intestines and bowels were all collapsed and reduced in size—a portion of the large intestine on the left side was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186611190086"/>
               <p>distended with wind, and the lower part of the bowel at the end contained a small quantity offical matter—I examined the whole lining of the intestine—it was perfectly healthy—there was not a sign of disease about it—the mesenteric glands were healthy, and the liver, spleen, and kidneys—the skin was not shrivelled—it was not pinched up—when a child dies from want of food that is not necessarily the case, it would depend on the length of time—my conclusion was that the child died of inanition, which means emptiness, want of nutriment circulating of the system—I came to that conclusion because I found no internal disease whatever to account for death—it died because it had not been fed—if a child is too weak to draw milk it could have food administered to it—that was what was done at the workhouse—we attempted to make it swallow, but it did not—it was too weak to make any effort on its own part to swallow anything.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I had not sufficient milk to give the child, but I fed it well, and gave it food of a night—it was very ill with diarrhoea, and I took it to Dr. Spurgeon when it was about five weeks old—he was out of town, but a gentleman saw it and advised me to change the food, which I did, and gave it flour, arrowroot, and milk, but it was then very bad and continually fretting, and nothing came from it but blood and matter—Dr. Spurgeon afterwards saw the child, and he ordered me to give it milk and take beer myself, which I did—I was advised to use fullers' earth to the child, as it was so sore—I fed it as I would a bird, and never left it without food.</p>

I am a surgeon at Hammersmith—I know the the prisoner—she lived at 9, Paradise Cottages, Albion Road, Hammersmith—I believe she is a married woman—I attended her when she was delivered of this child, I believe on the 27th June—it was a nine months' child—she had a very good time—I attended her for the ordinary period, about nine days—I believe she was able to give the child the breast—it was not her first child—she had two or three living at that time—when I ceased to attend her the child was going on well—I believe I saw her husband, but I am not positive—my visits were in the day, and he would not return till night—I next saw the child on the 9th September—the prisoner sent to me and desired me to visit it, and I went to her house—she said the child did not seem to be getting on, and that it was suffering from diarrhoea—I saw that it was in a very emaciated condition, and I directed that it should be continued at the breast, and that it should have beef-tea and some drops of brandy occasionally, and a little arrowroot—I also prescribed some medicine to check the diarrhoea—she got the medicine—I saw the child the next day—it was then somewhat better—I did not not see it again till the 13th, the Thursday—then I examined the prisoner as to the nutriment the child had been receiving, my attention having been directed to that point by the neighbours—she told me she had given it the various things I had directed, arrowroot, beef-tea, and brandy—I</p>

               <p>asked her to show me the beef-tea, to convince me it really had had it, and a basin of beef-tea was produced, nearly full, and in a stinking state—she said the child would not take the breast—I said, "Let me see"—she then put the child to the breast, and it sucked—I could not swear that it got milk—I felt it my duty to have the child taken to the union the same day—I cannot say at what time it was taken there—that was the last time I saw it—I could not swear whether the diarrhoea had ceased then—the house was always wretched—I believe I have seen her the worse for liquor—I won't say positively drunk—I believe she was recovering from the effects of liquor when I saw her on the 18th, by her manner; her clothes and the room smelt so offensively of vomit that I was obliged to have the child brought into another room—I believe that was her vomit—she had every aspect of recovering from a drunken bout—drunkenness would have a very bad effect on the milk—it would impoverish the system, and deteriorate the quality as well as the quantity of milk.</p>

I am married, and live at 9, Paradise Cottages, Albion Road, the same house as the prisoner—I have known her just on three years—I nursed her in her confinement for a fortnight—the child was a nice little baby born, small, but rather fat—it was not ill while I was nursing her—she brought the child down to me one day after that—it was rather cross, but I did not see anything the matter with it—she told me it had diarrhea—it looked clean then—I did not examine it—I saw it take the breast—it did not appear to take it eagerly—it sucked very nicely—I remember the doctor being called in—he asked me to go upstairs with him to see the child—he asked to see the arrowroot and brandy which he had prescribed for it, and I showed him the beef-tea—that was bad, and that was all there was that I saw—it was stinking, and the spoon that was in it was all verdigris—I saw no brandy in the house—I have had the child for one week, and the prisoner brought me one or two pennyworths of brandy for it at that time—that was before it was ill—she was out drin<lb/>ing the whole of that week—the husband gave it to me to mind—he asked if I would look after it for him—I gave it arrowroot and brandy, and baked flour and milk—the husband provided the milk every night, or else left the money for it before he went out in the morning—the prisoner would be out four or five hours at a time drinking—she did not remain out the whole week—she came home at night, and sometimes in the course of the day—the child would hardly suckle then—she would go and lay down and go to sleep—she sometimes gave it the breast—she was not sober when she came home—I could not swear how often I have known her be away in that manner and come back in that state, but several times—her husband is a plasterer—I do not know what wages he gets—there are three boys now living at home.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. On Sunday evening, the 14th October, I was called to see Mr. Hoskins; he was suffering from great pain in his head; he had a severe bruise under the left eye, and there was extra<lb/>vasated blood in the surface of the eyeball itself—his pain was princi<lb/>pally in his forehead—he was somewhat rational in his conversation, and apparently attended to business—I continued to attend him until the time of his death, on the 2nd November—from the apparent weakness of his system, I considered it would be as well to see another medical man, and I called in Dr. George—during the last two or three days he was more or less unconscious—sleepy—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—externally there was a bruise under the left eye, with effusion of blood round the ball, a yellowish discolouration of the scalp on the right side on the skin of the head—internally the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> was very much thickened and adherent all over the inner surface of the bones of the skull, and underneath the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, on the entire surface of the right hemisphere, was a diffused coagulum of blood from the back to the front—the lungs were flaccid and loaded with mucus; the heart was flaccid and loaded with fat—the liver was large, indurated, and presented a nutmeg-like appear<lb/>ance on being cut into—the coats of the stomach were thickened and contained a brownish liquid like beef-tea; the kidneys were enlarged, somewhat soft, and enveloped in thick fat; the left kidney on the lower part contained two cists of serum, which burst—they contained about a tablespoonful of serum each; the spleen was healthy—the cause of death was the extravasation of blood on the brain, that might be caused by external violence—when I first examined him his head was sore on the right side, he could not bear any pressure, and there was great heat over the forehead, it was burning to the hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I live at No. 31, Leonard Square—my husband is a coal-heaver—I know Caroline Garrett by sight—I have spoken to her—I saw her three days after the coroner's inquest—I heard of what occurred at the public-house—I had not heard of the death of the old man before she told me—I and my sister, Mrs. Thomas, were going to Mr. Cook's, the butter-shop, and we met Miss Garrett—she said, "Do you know anything of Mr. Parry's affair?"—I said, "No, not much; did you see it?"—she said, "Yes, I was in there getting some ale"—I said, "Oh"—and she said, "Well, Mr. Parry jumped over the bar and struck at the old gentleman, and then went and bolted the door, and knocked the old gentle<lb/>man down and then kicked him"—I said, "Were you in there when he <hi rend="italic">done</hi> that?"—she said, "No, I was outside"—I said, "Then how did you see it?"—she said, "I only go by what the newspapers tell me and what I was told"—I said, "Then you will swear false"—she said, "Never mind; there's plenty of money, because I shall get my dollar a day."</p>

Q.</hi> What was the day this conversation took place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was the third day after the inquest—it took place close by Mr. Parry's public-house—I am really married—I do not go out to work—I am not very intimate with Miss Garrett—they have got a shop next door to Mr. Parry's, and whenever I go by she generally stops and speaks to me, and asks how the baby is—I did not mention this conversation before this morning; then I told it to Mr. Parry himself, in his own house, because I thought it was my place to do so—I did not hear of the inquest—I did not know that the gentleman was dead—I never knew anything about it before this young person told me—I did not mention it to Mr. Parry before, because I did not know there was any bother about it—I hardly ever go down there, except I go down to my husband, where he works—I live a goodish distance from there—I go down there about twice a week to see for my husband—they pay just outside Mr. Parry's house—my husband does not use the house, he is a teetotaller—Mr. Parry did not bring me here to-day, I came with Mrs. Rogers—I told Mr. Parry the same that I have told you, the truth, what Miss Garrett told me—she said she had heard that lots of money was flying about, and she did not care, for she should get her dollar a-day: those were the words she said to me.</p>

I stopped to look, and one of the policemen said, "Here is his companion." He was no companion of mine, I never saw him in my life. On going to the station I asked him whether he saw me speak to the other prisoner, and he said, "No." When we got to the station they said, "Of course, I suppose, you did see the prisoner speak to him?" and then he said, "Oh! yes, I saw them in company." I said, "What do you mean by telling such a falsehood? Not two minutes ago you said you didn't see us speak; I asked you that question just now, and what did you mean by saying 'Yes?'" He said, "Well, I do not exactly know, I didn't rightly understand you." I said, "I asked you distinctly about it." I said, "It's all very fine; didn't understand me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer and teadealer, of Market Terrace, Victoria Park—I have known the prisoner seven or eight years—he came into my service some years ago, which was the commencement of my knowing him—he set up in business for himself about two years since—he had had goods of me before the commencement of this year, and I continue to supply him—in January, February, and March I supplied him with goods to the amount of about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he paid some small sum, leaving an amount of 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on the 13th April—he obtained the last goods for me on March 26th or 27th—the date appears to have been</p>

               <p>the 26th, and I appear to have altered it to the 27th—on the 2nd May I received a letter from the prisoner, dated the 1st May; it is, I believe, attached to the depositions—at the time I supplied the last goods I was not aware that he was about to enter or had entered into a composition deed—I first heard of it through another creditor after the deed was registered, after the 13th April—my name is not in this account, which is signed in the prisoner's writing; he is still indebted to me in the amount of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's letter was dated May</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, 1866, <hi rend="italic">addressed to Mr. Seear, and stated</hi>:—"I was not aware that you intended to push me. I did not put you down in the list of creditors, as I meant to pay you in full as soon as I get my affairs settled")—I called on the prisoner after the last goods were supplied to him, and before I was aware of that deed—I found him in bed, and told him I was sorry to hear that he was in difficulties, and urged him, whatever he did, to act in a straightforward honourable way, or he would blast his reputation in the commercial world for ever, and that I was afraid he had got into bad hands, and had got bad advisers—he acknowledged that he was in difficulties, and I asked him if he was so far involved that he could not by perseverance and industry keep a good name, as few men were in business but who at some period of their lives had been sharply pinched, but by industry and perseverance had kept a good name, and asked him what he owed—he went through his debts from memory, and I reckoned them up, and made it 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that there were some smaller amounts, which he could not specify, which would bring it to about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—among others, he mentioned White Brothers, Revell, Philpott, and Luce Brothers as creditors—he did not mention a word to me about having debts to the amount of 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor did he mention his father-in-law, Mr. Fashion, as a creditor for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that he thought it was more than he could pull through—he did not ask my assent to a deed, or mention one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—on Saturday night, 13th October, there was a disturbance going on in the front of our house between Mrs. Cole and her son—I went out with my husband into the street—the deceased lived next door to us—he was upstairs at his bedroom window—when I went out he opened the window, when he heard Mrs. Cole crying, and he asked if he should come down—Mr. Cole came along, and he asked what was the matter—Cole said that they were going to run a knife through his guts—he said, "You should have your guts lined either with lead or with iron, then the knife would not pene<lb/>trate through"—with that Jones came out of his mother-in-law's house, and said to me, "It is the women's long tongues that causes all these dis<lb/>turbances"—Styles made some remark to me, but what it was I do not exactly know—the prisoner did not answer it—Mrs. Jones said if Styles came down she was up and dressed and ready for him, and would throw some water over him—the deceased told her that she wanted throwing into the river to wash the scabs off her arms—I did not hear her call him any name particularly—he said, "Do you want me to come down? if you do I will come"—the prisoner said, "No, not to-night; another night"—Mrs. Jones then called him a bald-headed old something, but I did not hear the word, and with that the deceased came downstairs—he was not dressed when he was up at the window; I could see that, because he put his legs out—when he came down he had his trousers on, but no hat or cap or jacket—he had a bald head—he no sooner came down than Mrs. Jones up with a pail of water and threw part over him and part over my husband—it was a large tin pail, that she brought out of her own house—as soon as the water was gone she seized the hair broom, and began to strike at him—she did not hit him—he took the broom away from her, and was in the act of breaking it and throwing it into the river when the blow was struck—the prisoner was standing outside his door, by his window, while this</p>

I am going to look for my broom"—I observed him go into his house after he came out of his mother-in-law's, just before the disturbance began, before Styles came down—he had nothing in his hand when he came out of his mother-in-law's I did not see the deceased do anything to him, the deceased was picked up and taken in, and he asked me whether I saw the blow struck—I said, "I did," and he said, "It was cruel of him to hit me with that hammer"—they were both under the influence of drink, but not as I had seen them before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at Guy's Hospital when Styles was brought there, on Sunday morning, the 14th October, about five o'clock, by one of the constables—I found a large cut in his forehead, at the top, on the left side, where the hair begins—he was bald there—it was about two inches long and gaping wide open, and a fracture of the bone—part of the bone was depressed, knocked into the brain, and fractured—Mr. Durham, the surgeon, was sent for at once, and took out a good deal of bone—he went on well till Tuesday morning, and on Wednesday morning, about ten o'clock, he died—there was a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found that the membranes of the brain were inflamed—that was the cause of death—the brain was bruised opposite the place of injury—the skull had a large hole in it where the bone had been taken out—it was an oval hole, about an inch wide by an inch and a half long—the injury to the brain was the cause of death—a blow with a hammer of this description would be calcu<lb/>lated to inflict such an injury, one blow—the pressure of the instrument would most likely prevent the blood from coming at first—I should say the skull might be fractured in that way, and yet the instrument not have blood upon it—it would be impossible for a fist to cause such an injury.</p>

I am a gasfitter, and live at 4, Pear Tree Cottages, Lewisham—I knew the deceased and the prisoner—somewhere between two and three months before this matter happened I was with the prisoner in his garden—I went to look at some iron that he had to sell—I said to him, "I hear you have had another row here the other Sunday week"—he said, "Yes; Styles has been on to my wife again; he is always on to her, calling her all sorts of names; if he gets on to her when I am at home I will smash his brains in with a b—hammer"—I said, "Don't talk like that, Jack; serve him like I did: he would not leave me alone when I lived up here, and I gave him a punch in the nose"—he said, "No; he called my wife a b—scabby old w—, and I mean doing it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, of 2, Union Terrace, Church Street—on Saturday night, 13th October, about twelve o'clock, I met the prisoner in Church Street—I saw he was very drunk; and went down home with him—we met some more, who began talking about ships—we got him as far as his aunt's, who came out and asked him to go in—they had two or three words, and he ran round the alley—we heard somebody halloo out or scream—the prisoner was not with me then—I took two or three steps and heard a halloo for "Col"—a man named Collas was there—I got up to the prisoner who was then in the alley, and saw him kick at the door—they came out and hallooed "Police," and "Murder," and that he had stabbed the woman, but I did not see it done.</p>

On 14th October, from information I received, I took the prisoner in bed, between a quarter and half past twelve at night—I told him that the charge was stabbing a female named Coppell—he said, "I was standing outside the house, and a man came out and gave me a smack in the mouth, and I did something, but what I did I do not know; I was tipsy at the time, but what I did was not intended for the female"—I spoke to him about the knife, and found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his trousers pocket—he went with me, and Mrs. Coppell identified him as the man who stabbed her—he said that that was the only knife he hadin his possession that day.</p>
