I am robbed"—the prisoners went away directly without purchasing the brocoli sprouts—I did not go with Mrs. Dooley the first time—she went by herself first—she came back and insisted on my going with her, which I did—we went to the bottom of Whitecross-street, and as we came back again we saw the two prisoners behind two women—I pointed them out to the officer—Nathan said, "See, I am <hi rend="italic">done,</hi>" and Norris said" Good G—d! my child."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lace and fringe manufacturer, and live in West-street, Long-acre. The prisoner was in my service nearly two years—it was his duty to collect money and pay it to me—he has not ac<lb/>counted to me for either of the sums mentioned by the two witnesses—he never gave any account of them till I found he had received them, which was in consequence of information I received by a letter in January.</p>

Jackson's was a running account—I had a conversation with the prisoner about that account.</p>

I have been married about nine months—I have known the prisoner about two years and a half—we lived together as man and wife, but had ceased to do so about twelve months before I was married—I had one child by her—it is dead now—it was alive at the time in question, and was at my house—I had taken it out of St. George's workhouse about nine weeks—the prisoner came to trouble me very often after we parted, and an<lb/>noyed me in the streets with all sorts of abuse, and throwing mud in my face. On the 30th of January, between eight and nine o'clock in the even<lb/>ing, I went to the Pewter-platter public-house—I had not been there above half-an-hour when she came into the tap-room, where I was standing, wait<lb/>ing for employment at coal work—it is the place where we go to get em<lb/>ployment in that line—I went to see if the landlord was in the bar to turn her out, because she had been a great annoyance there before—(she had not said or done any thing at that time,) she followed me, and drew her right hand from under her shawl with a cup in it, and threw this vitriol in my face saying, "You would not let me see my child, and take that for a</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pupil at the London Hospital. The pro<lb/>secutor was brought there on the 30th of January, about eight or nine o'clock in the evening—he was labouring under the effects of sulphuric acid having been thrown upon him—the skin was destroyed, and he was suffering violent pain—his face and neck were affected, the neck princi<lb/>pally—the collar of his coat was burnt—if he had not been attended to immediately it would have run to high inflammation; but in consequence of that he was greatly relieved—he was under my care fifteen or sixteen days—I am confident it was sulphuric acid, because the remedies I applied would not answer to any other—he told me it was vitriol, therefore I applied the remedies proper in vitriol, which is sulphuric acid, and they answered—it is of a very inflammatory nature—I should say, from the state his clothes were in, that an ounce and a half, or two ounces, had been thrown on him—if it had gone into his eyes it would most probably have destroyed the sight—we could not have applied the remedies in sufficient time to save it if he had not been brought when he was—his life was in no danger—if it had not been attended to it would have been much worse, but still it would not have killed him—at all events it would have taken some time to have done it—it would subject, him to very severe inflamma<lb/>tion, but I do not think it would have caused death.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner in her defence stated, that the prosecutor would not suffer her to see her child, which was in a dying state from his ill usage; that she took it some castor oil in a cap, when his wife abused her, and he dragged the child out of her arms, and turned her out of doors. She afterwards went with a friend to the Pewter Platter public-house to have something to drink, and finding him there, she said, "So, you want to hinder me from seeing my child, and it is dying: there is a God above who will reward you. "She further stated, that she had bought the vitriol to clean some copper, and by his knocking her about and ill-using her he knocked it over himself; that she was the fourth woman he had seduced, and turned his back upon, and he had shamefully treated and ill-used her.</hi>)</p>

About half-past two o'clock, on the 24th of February, I was in Leadenhall-street with a lady and the witness Larkin—there was a crowd round an omni<lb/>bus—I felt a hand in the right-hand pocket of my dress, which contained a green silk purse, with one half-crown, four shillings, and two fourpenny pieces—I endeavoured to lay hold of the hand, which belonged to the prisoner Hart—I am sure of that—she dragged her hand away with the purse—I turned round, and laid hold of her cloak; she thought I was alone, and began abusing me—when Larkin spoke to her, she turned round and walked away—I am quite sure it was her hand that was in my pocket.</p>

I live with my father, in Norway-place, I was with the prosecutrix—I heard her say to Hart, "You have picked my pocket, you have taken my purse," and Hart called her an impudent <hi rend="italic">hussy</hi> for saying so—Hart went way—I followed her, and told her the young lady accused her of taking her purse, and desired her to return—she refused to do so—Cooper came up, took his hand out of his pocket, and put his hand to Hart, and she passed the purse to him directly—I could not see the colour of the purse, it was passed so quickly—a gentleman took hold of Cooper—he knocked him away, and ran away directly.</p>

I have"—Tiplady, another fore-man, was coming up stairs—this tea was taken from tae prisoner—there was 4 lbs. 10 oz. of gunpowder tea—he was going off with it—a man took him to the Dock station, where I left him—I went to the pile of chests and found one open, and 12 lbs. short of the weight—I compared the tea with that in the chest.</p>

This acquaintance ori<lb/>ginated in consequence of my mother and myself residing very near to them in the same street; and having lent this young woman an apron during the week, I stood much in need of it. I had been on an er<lb/>rand for my mother into Bishopsgate-street, and on my returning home, having to pass by their door, I ran up stairs and inquired for her daughter, Mary Shannon, and was answered she was not within, but expected her home in a few minutes. I had my bonnet and shawl on me at the time; and as she was expected to return in a few minutes, I waited there. I most solemnly declare to you my Lord, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, I had not been in the room more than ten minutes when the officers came in and took me into custody, together with the other two female prisoners now at the bar with me. I humbly beg leave to state, that the officers who took me into custody, if required by your Lordship, can declare upon oath I had those articles upon me at the time they took me into custody. I therefore humbly hope this circumstance will convince you that I had not the smallest connexion, or was in any way interested in the business my fellow prisoners was then carrying on; and the circumstance that led me to their room was no other than what I have before described, to get an apron from her daughter that belonged to me."</p>

I sleep in No. 1. On the 5th of February I went to bed about eleven o'clock, every thing was safe then—MRS. Grove was up a quarter of an hour after me, but did not go into No. 2, at all—I had seen No. 2 quite safe—I was the last up, except my wife, and I did not go to sleep till she came to bed—I was called up between three and four o'clock in the morning, and went into the house No. 2—it appeared as it was left, except that a small portion of the parlour-window was open—the sash was lifted up a little—it was down the night before, but not fastened—a young man named David Bower slept in that room—I found him asleep still—he is not here—I missed two boxes from the back part of that room—the window had been closed the night before by a little servant-girl—she is not here, but I came home about eight or nine o'clock in the evening, and if that window had been up I must have perceived it—somebody must have lifted it much higher to get the boxes out—they contained a large quantity of linen, a variety of children's clothes, some printed books, and a tea-caddy—the boxes belong to my daughter—the value of all the property in the boxes is about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at a low calculation—when I was called up, I found the two prisoners and another man in custody, at the station-house, with all the property that was missed—I had seen it safe the afternoon before.</p>

On the morning of the 6th of February, just before three o'clock, I was on the stand at the Mad-house rank, in Old-street-road—Morris came up to me there and engaged my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not know him before—he told me he had fallen out with his landlady that night, and wanted my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to move his two boxes from the Curtain-road to Aldermanbury—he asked me what I would do it for, and before I could answer he said he would give me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I would take him—he afterwards said I need not be afraid of the money, and gave me 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. before I went—he got on the box, and a friend of his came up—he said his friend was going to the Curtain-road, and I let him into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I do not know that person—I was going to get on my box to drive away, and the prisoner Hull came up—he let himself into the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and said he was going down the Curtain-road—I got on my box and drove to the Cur<lb/>tain-road with the three—I asked Morris where I was to stop, and just opposite Horse-and-Groom-yard he told me to stop—just before I pulled up, the two got out, and went down the yard—Morris remained on the box with me—a policeman hunted the two out of the yard—they took one, and the other got away—the boxes were put into my <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and I drove to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I came down Horse-and-Groom-yard about a quarter before three o'clock—Masters told me he had found the boxes—while I was there with him, about five minutes before three o'clock, two men ran down the yard—Hull is one of them—they turned back directly they saw us, and ran away—we pursued them—Masters caught Hull—I ran out and stopped the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Morris was on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with the driver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I know the two prisoners—I saw them together about two o'clock in the morning of the 6th of February, coming from a public-house at the back of Shoreditch church, leading into Hackney-road, in company with three men and a female—they were in Castle-street, which is seven or eight minutes'walk from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time did you see them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Near two o'clock—it was not half-past two o'clock—I am the constable on the beat, and hare to report to the sergeant the time the public-houses close—I heard the clock strike shortly before, I have every reason to believe, but their disorderly conduct took my attention—I will say the clock had not struck half-an-hour—they were making a noise, and being disorderly—one in their company was very drunk, but the prisoners were not drunk—they were not a mile from the prosecutor's—I went before the Magistrate at the second examination—I was there on another charge, and was asked if I had seen them.</p>

On the 14th of February I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner in the street—he plunged his hand into the broken pane, and I saw him extract sundry articles from the window—I ran out, and saw him drop the cotton just by the window—I pursued him, and in about half a minute he was taken is Market-street—when I stopped him, he fell on his knees and said, "Pray let me go; I have taken nothing, but I will discover to you the other parties who have taken your goods away"—I took him back to my shop, and gave him in charge—I know this cotton which I picked up</p>

On the 27th of February I came to town on business, by the boat—I was in Edgware-road, about ten o'clock at night, with Smith, one of my boatmen—the prisoner came up to us as we were standing—she asked me where I was going—I said, where my mate was, as I was a stranger—she wanted us to go home with her and sit down by the fire, and be comfortable—I went—I spent sixpence, and had some beer, and then came out—I went to a beer-shop and had a pot of beer—Smith was with me, and a woman—we then went to another shop, and had two quarterns of rum—we then came out—the prisoner still kept pulling me, and persuading me to go home with her, and at last I went with her to an up-stairs room—I did not give her any money—I laid on the bed with her for a few minutes—I had at that time a canvas purse with seven sovereigns and four half-sove-in it, in my right-hand trowsers'-pocket—I felt the prisoner draw the purse out while I was on the bed-side—she had just got off the bed—I accused her of it, and tried to get it from her—there was no light in the room then—she had put out the candle—she had the purse in her hand, and she put it out of one hand into the other—I did not see it in her hand, as it was dark, but I felt it in her hand—I made a noise, and Smith and the other woman came up—the woman brought a light with her—the pri<lb/>soner was then standing by the fire, and my purse was at her feet—the woman picked up one sovereign and one half-sovereign—I picked up one sovereign—my purse was not tied, it was only twisted—I lost three sove<lb/>reign sand two half-sovereigns—I was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house-decorator. On the 1st of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the two prisoners together between Crown-street and Charles-street—I thought all was not right—I watched, and saw an old gentleman walking along—he stopped at one or two shops—the two prisoners passed on behind him—he stopped and they stopped—he went on, and they followed—the gentleman stopped at a tailor's shop, then went on again, and Dacey took the bottom of his coat pocket with his left hand, and put his other hand in, he pulled the handkerchief nearly out—Howe then went up and pulled it out, and passed it to Dacey, who put it into his pocket—Howe passed ahead of the gentleman, and Dacey kept behind—I then crossed, went up to Dacey, and caught him, and Howe crossed the road then—I said to Dacey, "What have you got?"—he said, "No<lb/>thing"—I said, "Yes, you have"—he then pulled out an old handker<lb/>chief—I said, "Not that; what have you else?"—he would not take his other hand out of his pocket—I took it out, and this handkerchief was in it—he said, "Don't, don't, you may have it"—I took him across the road, and missed the gentleman; and as I got near Meux's brewhouse I saw Howe coming, running very fast, to run to the <hi rend="italic">rookery</hi>—I called out, "Stop him"—I gave Dacey to an officer, and pursued Howe to Bedford-square, and on through Percy-street, where he was stopped—I said, "You have given me a pretty good run"—he looked up and said, "Should you have known me if I had not come after you?"—I said, "Yes"—I then went to see for the gentleman, but could not find him—I do not know his name.</p>

Stewart, the mate, was on board—Venables drank with him down in the cabin—I did not notice that any thing had happened to my meter's book while I was on board the brig—when I got home in the evening I found there were several sheets torn out—I can undertake to say that it was perfectly sound that morning—there appears to be nine certificates torn out—there is a margin to the certificates, to enable me to keep a check of the contents of the body of the certificate—the margins were torn away as well as the bodies—the book was lying on the locker when Venables was in the cabin.</p>

ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why do you call yourself an official coal-meter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am sure I do not know why the committee should call us official meters—we are weighers, or meters—I consider meter implies both weigher and measurer—we weigh the coals now—we are not appointed by the Lord Mayor, but by a committee of nine mer<lb/>chants and nine factors—we give these certificates gratuitously to the lightermen—we do not receive any thing for them—every paper in this book would be stamped, "No. 5"—the "1839"denotes the year—I am sure this is one of the nine certificates I lost, because I have lost no others but the nine—I have issued more, but I can account for every one—those I have given away I have filled up—the margins of these nine have been taken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you fill up all you give away with your hand-writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—the particulars of all the others are in the margins—I have not compared the particulars of this certificate with the margins, to see if it agrees with any of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who was on board the vessel besides Venables? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no lighterman on board—the captain, Mr. Stewart, and I, were down in the cabin, having some ale at the table, which is not more than a yard from the locker—I left the cabin for about ten minutes, while Venables was there—I will swear that—he was on board ten minutes or a quarter of an hour altogether—I drank one glass of ale—there was a bottle drunk—I left the Captain with Venables in the cabin—I met them on the deck coming out of the cabin, I think, about ten minutes after I had been on deck—I cannot say exactly—I will swear I was more than five minutes out of the cabin before Venables came up—you go up a few stairs from the cabin to the deck—MR. Stewart followed me out of the cabin—he left Venables in the cabin, perhaps a few minutes—I will not swear it was one minute—I did not meet them coming out of the cabin together—they followed one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure that Stewart ever left him in the cabin alone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He must have done, because he followed me out—I went on deck first—MR. Stewart followed me afterwards, and must have left Venables there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps five minutes—I do not swear he left Venables below five minutes—he came up about five minutes after me, alone—it was about five minutes after I had left the cabin that I saw Mr. Stewart and Venables, one following the other—MR. Stewart came up alone, and Venables followed him in a very little time—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020056"/>
               <p>might be about two or three yards behind him—they were never apart, except the time it would take Stewart to get on the deck before Venables.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any means or opportunity for Venables to take the papers without Mr. Stewart seeing him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell that—I only know that Venables was Mr. Morris's servant from his bringing barges from Mr. Morris's wharf, I considered him Mr. Morris's lighterman—I never saw him and Mr. Morris together—I had never seen Mr. Morris but once—I knew he was a coal-merchant and in a very large way of business—he has not got his name on the barges—Capel's and Slaughter's name is on them—the prisoner kept a wharf called Sun wharf—I never saw his name on a barge—Venables might be Capel and Slaughter's servant, but I considered him Mr. Morris's—I was subpoenaed as a witness here to-day—I have seen no one as the prosecutor, but the solicitor and his clerk—I believe Mr. Bentley is a factor—I do not know him—he has given me no orders to come here—no one has spoken to me upon it except the solicitor—I know Mr. Gammon, a merchant—he has not given me any instructions about this prosecution, or about my appearance at the police office—I was examined several times at the police-office on a charge against Mr. Morris of having forged this certificate, or uttering it knowing it to be forged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Not having stolen it, or received it, knowing it to be stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what the charge was—I told captain Stewart the next morn<lb/>ing, about a quarter-past seven o'clock, that I had the certificates—I did not sec Venables that day—I cannot say whether he was working on board the brig that day and the following day—he might be—he came there every day and brought barge to the ship—he brought barges while I was delivering the ship—I never charged Venables nor any body with having taken these papers—I merely mentioned to Mr. Stewart that I had lost them and to two of my brother meters, Yates and Rix—I mentioned it to them next morning—Yates is one—I forget the others name—(<hi rend="italic">looking in a book</hi>)—I was going to see if I could recollect the meters name—I thought I might have a list of the meters in my pocket—it appears by this book, which is in my writing, that Venables was on board working on the 21st of Novem<lb/>ber—I never mentioned to him about the loss of my certificates—I did not make it public—I only told two meters, Yates, and I think Rix is the name of the other—it begins with Ri—I take the certificate book on shore when I go at night—I went home on the night of the 19th of November—I am almost sure I did not go to any ale-house, or any place before I went home—I am quite sure I did not—I went home—it was quite dark—I have never, on any occasion, gone to any ale-house or other place and lost my book—I never lost it and had it returned by any body—I have not seen Mr. Gammon this morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked whether you ever charged Venables with having stolen the certificates; were you aware on the 19th, 20th, or 21st who had taken the certificates? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I was not—I had no suspicion that Mr. Morris had any of them in his possession—all the certificates in the book No. 5 are accounted for by the margins, except the nine which were torn out—I can account for every one, numbers and everything.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you supposed Venables to be Mr. Morris's agent, had you any order from Mr. Morris to deliver coals to him on Mr. Morris's account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—not on board the <hi rend="italic">Union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But at any former time have you had orders from Mr. Morris</p>

               <p>to deliver coats to Venables? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—MR. Morris is in the habit of drawing his coals by means of Capel and Slaughter, from the wharf—I have seen the wagons loaded with coals from Capel and Slaughter's barges, which have gone to Morris's wharf—I saw Venables at the police-office—the mate was on deck while Venables was in the cabin—when I first went on board, for two or three days I considered Stewart to be the mate, but afterwards he was appointed captain—the mate I speak of is another person—there was a mate on board besides Stewart, and another man and two boys.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a weaver, and live in Manchester-street, Beth<lb/>nal-green. I was secretary to a club held at the Greyhound public-house, for the purpose of purchasing coals—it is an association of working people to purchase large quantities of coals, and by that means getting them cheaper—on the 25th of November I received, as secretary to the club, a tender from Mr. Morris, to supply coal—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">The tender was here ready signed "Thomas Morris" proposing to supply the members of the coal-club with sundry coals, and amongst others with Belmont, at</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per ton</hi>)—the club agreed with Mr. Morris to supply some Belmont coals—this is the memorandum of the contract—(<hi rend="italic">"This being read, was an agreement to deliver to the members of the Greyhound coal-club,</hi> 45 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 60 <hi rend="italic">tons of Belmont coals, and for the merchant to produce the ship's certificate."</hi>) On the 11th of December I attended at the defendant's wharf to see the coals worked—my attention was directed to two barges, one, the Mouse, laid by the shore, and another laid off the shore—that was the <hi rend="italic">Edward,</hi> as Mr. Morris represented—I saw him there—he said those barges contained the coals we were to have—three rooms of the <hi rend="italic">Mouse</hi> had coals in them—MR. Chapman was with me—he was appointed by the club to go down with me to witness the delivery—MR. Morris said, "They are ready now for you to go to work"—I asked him for the ship's certificate—he said, "Come along with me"—I walked with him up the wharf to his counting-house, and went in with him—he handed a file to me, which I supposed to be certificates—I said, "This is it at the top"—I said so because he banded me the file—I did not know whether it might be the one at the top—I said, "This is it at the top," and Mr. Morris said, "Yes"—I saw the word <hi rend="italic">"Mouse"</hi> on it—he was standing alongside of me when he said yes—I do not know that he looked at it—alter I looked at it, I took it off the file myself in his presence—this is the certificate—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—my name is written on the back of it—it is in the same state now as when I received it, except having my name on the back—(<hi rend="italic">This was the certifi<lb/>cate identified by Johnson as having been taken from his book; it was headed, "Ship-meter's Certificate from the Coal-meter's Office" "I Robert Johnson certify that I have delivered from the</hi> Mary Anne, <hi rend="italic">Robert Jones, master, from the port of Sunder land, with Belmont coals,</hi> 21 <hi rend="italic">tons, delivered into the</hi> Mouse, No. 1055, <hi rend="italic">on account of Capel and Slaughter, for Mr. Morris.</hi>

Gammon made some observations on my producing it, in consequence of which, I thought it my duty to go to the coal-meter's office—Chapman called on me the same evening—on Saturday morning, the 14th of December, I went with the certificate to the coal-meter's office in Thames-street, and showed it to the parties in attendance—I was not well on that Saturday—James Macey, a member of the club, came to me in the evening, and I communicated to him what had transpired about the certificate, and on the Monday I gave him directions to go to Mr. Morris—I am not secretary to the club now—MR. Chapman is—I believe he is a friend of Mr. Morris—the Articles of the club say that a fresh se<lb/>cretary shall be appointed at the commencement of every club—while I was at the wharf on the 11th I saw a man, who I have since ascertained to be Venables—he was in the counting-house two or three times while I was there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic"> Q.</hi> You have mentioned Mr. Gammon—how came you to communicate with him on the subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was ill, and I sent 101 directions to Mr. Gammon, as I could not attend to the delivery myself—he could not find them out, and had to call on me in the evening to put them to rights—Mr. Gammon is a coal-merchant, and one of those who proposed for the contract when Mr. Morris got it—he had nothing to do with Mr. Morris's coals—he had the contract for another club—I was three times at the Thames police-office about this business—I attended there by desire of Mr. Ballard, one of Mr. Harmer's clerks, and a police-officer—I do not know who set the inquiry on foot—I do not know whether it was Mr. Gammon—some hand-bills and placards were published—one was sent to my house from the public-house directly opposite—I cannot call to mind who brought it—I do not know that Mr. Gammon caused them to be published, stating some<lb/>thing to the prejudice of the prisoner—I never distributed any of them—I have not spoken to Mr. Gammon since the second time I was at the police-office—I have spoken to him—I dare say I may have spoken to him about this in the course of business—nobody paid me for attending at the police-office—I received 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Gammon to pay for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a file</hi>) I cannot say whether it was such a file as this that the prisoner took the paper off of—it was taken off a file—I cannot swear whether it was round or straight at the top—I think it was straight—it was a wire like this—I cannot say whether it was thick or thin—the papers were stuck through—there was a gentleman on the other side Mr. Morris when it was produced—I do not know who he is—MR.

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Capel and Slaughter, coal-merchants, London—they lighter coals for Mr. Morris. On the 10th of December I superintended the lightering of some coals into the <hi rend="italic">Mouse</hi> barge—this is the book in which I make a memorandum of my daily transactions—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—the entry on the 10th of December is, <hi rend="italic">"Mouse,</hi> 21 tons, Even wood, Sun-wharf, from the Witham"—the number of the barge is not put—the meaning of that entry is, that the coals went to Sun<lb/>wharf that day by the <hi rend="italic">Mouse</hi>—there was, no doubt, a certificate given for them in the course of business—that certificate would be sent to Mr. Morris—I did not see the ship's certificate—I did not see any Belmont coals in the river on the 10th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lighterman to Mr. Morris, and was so in November last. On the 19th of November I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Union</hi> for the delivery of the coals, and for four days afterwards—I went down into the cabin with Johnson and Stewart to drink—I was never left alone in the cabin the whole of that day, not for one single moment—I did not see any thing of the certificate-book to my knowledge—there were plenty of books about, but I did not know one from the other—we drank two bottles of ale among three—to the best of my recollection, Stewart went out of the cabin first, and Johnson and I were left together—I recollect Stewart saying somebody hailed the ship—I said, "I dare say it is my apprentice"—Stewart went on deck to see what it was, and Johnson and I followed directly, one after the other, and met Stewart coming aft—I went on board next day, about seven or eight o'clock—I saw Johnson there that day—he did not say a word to me about the certificates being lost—he gave me a certificate for the barge called the <hi rend="italic">Wood</hi>—I brought the coals to the wharf on the night of the 11th of December—next morning I saw two secretaries belonging to the club—I believe one was M'Crea and the other Chapman—Chapman asked me what coals we had—I said, "We have several sorts"—he said, "Have you any Belmont?"—I said, "We have got loads of coals of all sorts except Belmont, and of them we have none"—M'Crea heard that—he was alongside of him—this certificate was not shown to me at that time—I never saw it before—I saw it at the Thames police-office—I went to the Thames police-office voluntarily—I do not recollect who called me as a witness, but I was examined by Mr. Phillips, and I stated then the same as I have now—I was only examined once at the office—I was not called the second time.</p>

Morris did not call me—T did not know his attorney from any body else—I know I was called and examined by you, and I was asked questions by a gentleman on this side—a gentleman on the bench spoke, but nobody examined me, to my recollection, but you—I swear that that gentleman (MR. Prendergast) examined me first, and you finished it—I was only asked a question or two by him—I do not call it being examined—ft was only three or four words—I do not know the use of this certificate-book—I know every lighterman has a ticket—I did not see that book in the cabin that day to my knowledge—I will swear that I did not see it that day—if I had, I should not have touched it—as an honest man, I do not think I ought to have touched it.</p>

               <p>worked for my living—I think Johnson and I were in the cabin two minutes after Stewart—we drank our glasses up and followed—I think Johnson went first, but I was on his heels—we were both up together—I never said to any body after my examination at the Thames Police Office, "What a d——d <hi rend="italic">row</hi> your people make about this b——certificate"—nor any thing to that effect.</p>

Morris draws for Capel and Slaughter—he draws his coals from San wharf—MR. Dyer is a gentleman coal-merchant, and ship owner—I believe a man named Fer<lb/>rington gave me the blank certificates—MR. Dyer gave them to Torrington to give to me to produce at the Thames Police Office, to show there were more certificates than one—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—this is the same sort of cer<lb/>tificate which I gave Mr. Morris—I do not know how many I got—they were wrapped in paper—I was told they were certificates—I did not know they were tickets when they were given to me—Torrington told me they were blank tickets from Mr. Dyer—I did not tell the solicitor and Mr. Morris that I had them—I delivered them to Mr. Morris—I did not see any produced before the Magistrate—there was a counsel attending for Mr. Morris—I am the man that lightered the Mouse from the <hi rend="italic">Witham</hi>—I got a meter's certificate—I put it on Mr. Morris's desk—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I put it on the desk about seven o'clock in the morning, on the 11th—MR. Morris is sometimes there earlier than that—sometimes at six, seven, eight, or nine o'clock—generally before nine o'clock—he has clerks—it Is my plan to put the certificates on his desk or the clerk's—MR. Morris lives at the wharf—I think I saw him about one or two o'clock that day—I had no conversation with him about the <hi rend="italic">Mouse</hi> to my recollection—I did not tell him about the certificate—I did not know he was going to supply the club—I do not know whether he knew I was coming with the <hi rend="italic">Mouse</hi>—I go away with one barge, and bring another at rimes—he never inquires till night what business I have been doing—I tell him at night—I go in and book my work in a small book, with my name on it—I keep the book—it was delivered here—I did not see Mr. Morris that night—I put the cer<lb/>tificate on the desk for him to examine, but I do not recollect speaking to him—I spoke to him in the middle of the day, about one o'clock—he asked me what I had been doing—I told him I had got a load of craft loaded and coming down—I did not tell him any thing about putting the certificate on his desk, because it was not in his business—I did not tell him I had lightered the <hi rend="italic">Mouse</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">Witham,</hi> and left the certificate on his desk—I do not recollect seeing him that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Greyhound coal club. On the evening of the 10th of December I was there—it was the evening before the delivery took place—the prisoner called there to make us acquainted that he could not serve the coals—I was there by myself—I take an active part in the club—I have filled the station of chairman occasionally—the defendant came and told me he could not deliver the coals he had contracted for, as there was no Belmont in the market—I told him if he could not supply the club with Belmont he must work some other coal as near the quality as he could, as the members would be all disappointed unless he supplied them the next day as it was appointed—I was in the house Before Mr. Morris came.</p>

Morris asked me first when the delivery took place—I told him the secretary and his attendant would be down there to work the coals to-morrow morning—he said it was a very unfortunate thing for him he had not got those coals, as he had no such in the market, the Belmont—he said he had another club to serve, and he must work the two clubs that day—he did not say he could not deliver the Belmont because he had another club to serve—he said it was an unfortunate thing he could not supply us with Belmont coals, and he had another club to supply at the same time—he said there was no Belmont in the market—I told him he must not disappoint us, if he had no Belmont to send some of as good quality—he said, "If so, I must go and arrange it as well as I can"—I went to M'Crea on the Monday evening before I went to the club—I did not say any thing to him about Mr. Morris having told me he could not get Belmont coals.</p>

Morris might have said at the meeting that he had practiced a little deception—I do not know that I heard him say so—I might not un-derstand what he said exactly—I will not swear he did not say so, because I might not recollect it—I heard somebody say that Mr. Morris did say so—I never thought of telling M'Crea of what passed between Mr. Morris and me—it must have slipped my memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it was not because you did not think it of any importance, but because it slipped your memory? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought, in the first instance, when Mr. Morris spoke to me about changing the coals, that it was of very little importance, if the members had good coals—I did not think of telling M'Crea about it—I never gave it a thought.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber and glazier. I am secretary to the Greyhound coal-club—I went with M'Crea, on the 11th of September, to Sun Wharf, Ratcliff, to see the coals supplied—I asked the lighterman whether he had got Belmont coals on board, and he said no, he thought there was everything else but Belmont—I cannot say that M'Crea heard it—he was standing close by, near enough to hear it, I should suppose—I turned round to him and said, "I think we have done for to-day," meaning the supply would not take place that morning—he made no remark—I cannot say that there was any further conversation either from Venables, M'Crea, or myself—we waited, expecting that the coals—at least, that we should commence operations.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If there were no coals to be delivered, how came you to wait after you said your business was over? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Really, if I was to say anything more about anything, I should be committing myself—I cannot say who gave the order for the coals to be worked, or any thing of the sort; it was not my business—I went to see the coals weighed, to see justice done between the merchant and the members—we were deputed by the club to be there in attendance—if we had had direct orders from the house that we should have no coals worked that day, I certainly should have left the wharf, but we were waiting of course expecting that Mr. Morris would commence supplying the members with coals.</p>

M'Crea was never a member of the club—I cannot say why he has ceased to be secretary—I believe one of the articles of the club is, that the secretary shall be chosen at the commencement of every club—that is the only reason that I know of—any member can be appointed secretary, and I was elected—MR.

Ballantine said, "Produce the do<lb/>cuments," and I did so—I said, "Am I to give them up?" and looked at Mr. Horry, to ask if I was to give them up, and he said, "Yes"—I have not the least recollection of refusing to produce them—the Magistrate de<lb/>sired me to give them up, and I left them there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the publisher of the prices of coals—(<hi rend="italic">producing a book</hi>)—this book contains from day to day the price of coals in the mar<lb/>ket—on the 1st of November, 1839, Belmont coals were 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a ton, and Evenwood 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the 9th of December there were Evenwood in the market, but no Belmont that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the usual difference between Evenwood and Bel<lb/>mont? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a question it is scarcely possible to answer, because the relative prices of coals depends so much upon circumstances; one day a demand may arise for one particular sort, and another day for another sort—Evenwood is a coal that has never been up—there were only two ships of Evenwood the whole of the year 1889—on the 9th of December Evenwood sold for 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton, and on the 11th Belmont was 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—there were no Evenwood on the 11th.</p>

               <p>---- <hi rend="smallCaps">BALDWIN</hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Morrs. I remember M'Crea coming to our wharf—I filled up the vendor's tickets—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—the coals are described as Belmont coals—I filled them up from M'Crea's instructions—he came to the wharf after the first wagon was loaded—I began to fill up the tickets, and did not know what the coals were, nor what quantity was to be delivered—I said, "I don't know what these coals are, I must see Mr. Morris, and hear what he says," and M'Crea said, "They are Belmont coals"—I said, "Oh, are they?"—I did not know even the barge they were in, or the quality—it was between six and seven o'clock in the morning, or from six to eight o'clock, about seven o'clock, I suppose—I generally fill up the tickets from the instructions I receive from the lighterman—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a file of papers</hi>)—this is the file we use in Mr. Morris's office—there is no other file for certificates but this—all that are filed are put on this file—there are sometimes a few lying about—I never saw the certificate in question till I saw it at the Thames Police Office—I have access to all the files and papers in Mr. Morris's office, and have an opportunity of seeing every thing there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Greyhound public-house, where this club is held. I remember Mr. Morris coming to present his bill on Monday evening, the 16th of December, about half-past six o'clock—it was club night—he presented two certificates with the bill, which were afterwards given to Mr. Banks, the chairman—MR. Morris declared they were Even<lb/>wood coals—I heard no complaint made about them before that—I had three tons of the coals, and they were very excellent—I made no complaint, nor did I hear any complaint from any member of the dub—I was in and out of the room that evening in my usual capacity—the club meet at seven o'clock—I heard something said about the payment of the bill.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you had not heard that there was any irregularity, or substi<lb/>tuting one coal for another? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard from Mr. Macey—in fact I have a note in ray pocket now—I did not hear it till after Mr. Morris was in the house—I received a note from M'Crea on Monday, after sit o'clock, just Before Mr. Morris arrived—MR. Morris was at my house twice that evening—he brought in the bill, and was obliged to go somewhere else afterwards—he came first about half-past sit o'clock, and saw me and Mr. Banks—we were then arranging the accounts—we did not talk about the change of coals—I did not know of it then—this is the note I received from M'Crea—I will read it, to convince you that it explains nothing—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Monday evening, December 16. Mr. Bullock—I shall be very glad to see you if you will call on me in the course of an hour or two at the latest, as I have something of importance to communicate to you. I remain, &amp;c., J. M'Crea."—I showed that note to Mr. Morris when he first came, and then he went away—he was gone about half-an-hour—I saw him when be returned—he did not bring the bill and certificate then—he brought them when he first came—I received them when he first came in—he left them with me, and I delivered them to Mr. Banks—MR. Banks did not go out of the house after Mr. Morris had been the first time—he remained there—I am sure Mr. Morris did not take the bill away with him, for I was with Mr. Banks arranging the accounts.</p>

On the evening of the 7th of February, at half-past Four o'clock, the two Keatons, and a younger one who is discharged, came to my shop, and asked for a halfpenny-worth of treacle—I gave the cup to a boy to get it, and give it to them—I had four or five customers in the shop at the time, and when the two Keatons were gone I missed a parcel of sugar, that I had done up on the counter—a witness came and said something, and my boy went and brought them back—I said I would give them in charge—the prisoner Ann cried, and said, if the officer would go with her, she would show him an apple-woman, to whom she gave it—the officer went and got it, and took them all to the station-house—I went and saw it, in the same paper that I had done it up in—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">examining it.</hi>)</p>

On the 25th of February I accused him of having a glass in his possession belonging to me, which he denied—I said if he would give it up, I would freely forgive him—he still persisted that he had not, and I gave him into custody—these two glasses here produced were found in the prisoner's box—one of them I am certain is ours—it has our name on it—the other I could not swear to, but I have every reason to believe it is ours.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother Edward Clifton Carne, as merchants at Falmouth; we are agents to the Brazilian Com<lb/>pany. On the 18th of March last year, the <hi rend="italic">Sea Gull</hi> packet arrived at Falmouth from the Brazils—two boxes of gold dust were consigned to us by that packet—I never saw the contents—I saw the boxes, they were marked B. C. 18, B. C. 19—they were seventeen or eighteen inches square, and made of wood, fastened together with nails—there was no cord round them—they were sealed with red wax—I observed that they were nailed, which is not a usual thing with the Brazil boxes—they were al<lb/>ways screwed previous to that—those two boxes were shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick</hi> steamer, for London, by my directions—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the paper marked</hi> No. 1)—this is the bill of lading, referring to them—they were consigned to the Brazilian Company, at the Bank of England—Messrs. Hartley and Co. are the agents for the steam packet company that the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick</hi> belongs to—we transmitted in the usual course of business a copy of the ship's manifest of the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick</hi> to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am captain of the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick</hi>—I was on board when she came from Falmouth on the 22nd of March—I remember receiving on board from Messrs.

Hartley and Co.'s office, on the wharf, as near as I can calculate about ten o'clock—the wharf is close to the Tower—between the Tower and St. Katherine's dock—I then went to the counting-house of Hartley and Co, in John-street, and saw the prisoner attending there as Mr. Hartley's clerk—I told him I had landed the boxes of specie at the wharf—he said he would go down and attend to it himself—the boxes were in the same state when I took them there as when I received them—they were marked "B C 18 and 19."</p>

               <p>Sunday, the 24th of March)—I told him I had business I Was obliged to transact that morning, and did not think it would be convenient for me to come—Ellis Caspar said it would be a very good excuse to me to be out, at I told him I had out-door business to do, and he said the business would not occupy many minutes—I agreed to meet them I think in Mark-lane—I was to meet both I supposed—I went to Mark-lane, about ten o'clock next morning, and met Ellis and Lewin Caspar together, I think in Fenchurch-street—as I was going along, Lewin Caspar left his father, and Ellis Caspar came up to me, and said something to me, and we went together into a house in Mark-lane I think—he gave me a letter there, and a blue bag at the same time—the letter was folded at that time, and the address was torn off as it is now—I went the same day with that letter in a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> to Mr. Hartley's office, in John-street, and delivered it to the prisoner there—this receipt, which is written across the letter, is my hand-writing—I wrote that on it at the wharf, when I went there for the boxes, after I had been in the City about my own business—I was asked to write a receipt on the letter—I had to deliver an order for my employer for twelve lever watches, and I received 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—this is the cheque I received that morning—(<hi rend="italic">looking at No.</hi> 9.)—I signed my name across it as an acknowledgment of it—when I received the letter from Ellis Caspar be told me what to do with it—I took it to Mr. Hartley's office in John-street, in consequence of what he told me, and inquired for Mr. Hartley—Lewin Caspar was sent out to me—I was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> then—I handed him the letter—he went into the office, leaving me in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he came out again with the letter I had given him, and another one which he compared together—he put his hand inside the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with the two letters, one in each band, and examined them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say any thing on comparing the two letters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said there was a mistake, and asked me to step out into his office, and he would correct it—I got out and went through the front office into the back office on the left hand side—there was nobody there besides me and him—I observed clerks in the outer office which I passed through—when we got into the inner-room, the prisoner made some alter<lb/>ation, in one of the letters—I cannot say which, nor what the alteration was—the words at the bottom of this letter, "Mr. Bristow, please deliver above. Messrs. Carne have advised me about them.—L. <hi rend="smallCaps">CASPAR</hi>," was written by the prisoner while I was in the room—this is the letter, part of which I had previously written at his request—he then gave me the letter to go to the wharf—he wrote the direction of the wharf I think on another part of the letter—here it is on the back, "Inquire for Mr. Bris<lb/>tow, Dublin Steam Wharf, Irongate"—he told me to go to the wharf, and get these things, and he should be there as soon as me—he told me I should have to give an acknowledgment on the letter, and told me not to write my own name, and told me some name that I was to write, but which I forgot in the interval while I had been about my own business—it was in Bread-street that I was to deliver my master's goods—I went there, and from there to the wharf—I got into another <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to go there—I discharged the first <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> somewhere by the Globe Insurance Office—I can<lb/>not precisely recollect where I took the other, but it was close on the same spot—I went to the wharf, and inquired for Mr. Hartley—I think one of the porters came to me, or somebody about the office—I afterwards saw Mr. Bristow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you inquire for Mr. Hartley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought probably he might be at that place, though not at the other, as the clerk who first came out at John-street, said, "Mr. Hartley is not here, but the agent is"—I was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> when Mr. Bristow came out to me—I gave him the order the prisoner had given me—MR. Bristow desired me to come into the office—I went in and saw two boxes there—MR. Bristow said, "These are the boxes, will you take them with you?"—the porter placed them in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> I came by, by Mr. Bristow's desire, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then wrote this receipt on the letter, and left the letter with Mr. Bristow—I put one of the boxes into the blue bag, which Ellis Caspar had given me—it was not large enough to hold both—I was desired to meet Ellis Caspar in Wood-street—I went there in the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> but he was not there when I got there—I went to the Cross Keys public-house, Wood-street—the boxes were taken out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> by one of the porters there, without being directed to do so, and put on the counter, supposing I was going by one of the coaches—not finding Ellis Caspar there, I wanted to get a cord to tie the boxes together to carry them, but could not get one—I got another <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> put them in, and drove to my own home near the London Hospital with them—I drove to the London Hospital, Mile End-road, near the corner of Turner-street—the man by mistake drove me past the turning at which I intended to get out, which was the corner of Turner-street, and took me to the next street, which is at the corner of the hospital—I then took out one of the boxes, and went home with it to No. 12, New-street, and left the other one in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I put it in my bed-room—I came out with intent to fetch the other, and met Ellis Caspar in the street—I told what I had done with one box, and where the other was—in consequence of what he said to me, I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> again, and was driven to the Commercial-road, merely to delay the time—that was in a direction from my house—it was to avoid my own house—the box was still in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> then—I ultimately took the second box to my house—I had at that time a servant named Jane Bradley—I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at the end of Commercial-road, discharged the man, and returned by the omnibus—I got home about eight or half-past eight o'clock—I had tea, and went to the Earl St. Vincent public-house, which is in the neighbourhood—Jane Bradley fetched me from there—on going home I found Ellis Caspar waiting in the front parlour for me—I had a conversation with Ellis Caspar about the boxes, and he then told me what they contained—the servant did not sleep at the house—she went home after some time—it was very late before Ellis Caspar went—I sent the girl home some hours before he went away, rather before the usual time, by Ellis Caspar's desire—I desired my wife to send her away—there was a fire in my back parlour—I went up into my bed-room with Ellis Caspar, and showed him the boxes—they were taken down stairs to the back par<lb/>lour—there were seals on all four sides of each of the boxes—Ellis Caspar put the lid of one box on the fire—I lent him a chisel to get the cover off, that was the wooden cover, they were secured by nails merely as a packing<lb/>case—after that box was opened there was a tin box enclosed—there was a quantity of hay between the wood and the tin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the box broken for at first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was by desire of Ellis Caspar to divide the contents into smaller portions—the tin box was consider<lb/>ably smaller than the wooden one—upon finding that, the contents were not divided—there seemed then to be no necessity for it—the other box was opened in the same way—the outside cases of both were burnt, every mor<lb/>sel,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020103"/>
               <p>and the hay Ellis Caspar took away in his handkerchief—he went away before the boxes were quite burnt, and after he was gone 1 took the tin boxes up into my bed-room again—as near as I can recollect, they were about as large as three of those octavo books, (<hi rend="italic">pointing to them</hi>) and about six' or eight inches long—I opened one of the tin boxes—it contained lumps of apparently ore of various colours—they had no appearance of gold—I had never seen gold in that state before—the sizes varied very much, some were larger than others—the largest was not larger than a child's fist, or a moderate sized orange—I placed the boxes in my bed-room that night, put them in brown paper, and tied them round with packthread, to make them appear as parcels—next morning I put them into separate trunks, one into a black leather trunk of my own, and the other into a wooden trunk of my daughter's which had no lock on it—I corded it—the following morning I seat my wife to hire apartments—that was in consequence of what passed between me and Ellis Caspar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well, where were the tin boxes with the ere in them afterwards taken to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To Mansel-street, by my directions, and from thence by my sister—they were afterwards taken, I believe, to Petticoat-lane, and from thence the ore was brought to me at Oxendon-street, where I was then concealed—I had not the boxes at Oxendon-street—the ore was taken out of the boxes before it was brought to me—the last time I saw the tin boxes was at my place in Mansel-street—it was to Davis's house in Oxendon-street that I went.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What became of you after this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went to Brentford for two days, and afterwards to Peckham, to Fishwick's—I never saw the prisoner after that—I remained at Fishwick's a fortnight, and then surrendered to the officer—I supplied myself with the lodging at Fishwick's—I saw no<lb/>thing of the prisoner at Davis's house—I did not take the ore to Davis's—it was brought to me out of the boxes—I desired Davis to go for it to my sister's, in Petticoat-lane—I told him they were there, and he said he should fetch them—I delivered up some money to the officers when I surrendered—I received that money from Davis—it was notes—I. think it was 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you worked for the prisoner's father in his house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not board there—I had ceased to work for him for some time before this subject was mentioned to me—I had done nothing for him for many years—when I used to meet any of the family we recognised each other—we were very seldom in the habit of visiting each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> For how long before the subject was mentioned had you visited at Caspar's house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—I sometimes called in at his shop, perhaps it might be a year before, I cannot exactly remember—I know at one time Mr. Caspar asked me to do a job for him, when I met him by accident.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> While you were in his service did you ever have to write? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had no occasion to write—I never had to make out invoices, or enter in any books, nothing of the kind.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to swear up to the time you mention, Lewin Caspar did not know what sort of hand you wrote? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think he possibly could have known—he might have seen me writing at his father's—I might have made some little marks—I cannot tell what he knew, I only know he asked me to show him what sort of hand I wrote—I am perfectly persuaded he could not know what sort of hand I wrote—he was very young when I was in his father's house, and might forget what hand I wrote, if I did write there—I will swear that I do not know he knew what hand I wrote—I might occasionally have sent in accounts to Ellis Caspar in my own hand-writing—I have no recollection of having written a letter to him since I left him, but I will not swear it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many different statements have you made as to the part you took in this transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never made but one myself—the statement made before was made for me, and not by me—the first statement, which was false, was suggested to me by Davis and Mrs. Abrahams, when they visited me at Peckham—that statement was taken down in writing—I wrote part of it myself, and gave it to Davis—I had some conversation with Davis while I was writing it—Davis dictated to me what I should write—Lewin Caspar's name must have been mentioned in the course of that conversation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020105"/>
               <p>that was a house of that sort—I went from Coventry-court to Oxendon-street, a house I had never been in before—I went to Coventry-court on Thursday morning, and left there the following Tuesday morning—I have not seen Davis since I saw him at the police-office—he has left the country—I believe he was afraid of being taken in custody for this—I was in custody myself for several months—I made a statement to Mr. De Mole when I surrendered myself, at the inn over the way—that Was the first statement I made myself—that was besides the one 1 wrote at Davis's dictation—I made a third statement while I was in prison—the second statement I made, as near as I can recollect, corresponded with the first, and was equally false—the third was truth, and nothing but the truth, that I know of—I believe it contained what I have sworn to-day—it was in Writing—I do not believe I read it over after I Wrote it—my sister, Mrs. Levy, and my wife, were also taken into custody on this charge—nobody else connected with me, I am quite certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, when the prisoner told you he wanted you to do him a favour, did you ask him what it was about, to know if it was right or wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You would not Have done what was wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I was to assert that I should not be believed, in my present situation—I thought I was not doing wrong, but I scarcely expect that to be believed—when I went to the office I did not think I was going to steal 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of gold-dust, or I certainly would not have done it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you have been very much surprised to find you committed a felony by it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a surprise at first—I have not got over it now, I shall never get over it, my feelings are too much hurt by it—I wore the same coat I Have on now when I went to the office—I was dressed very similar to what I am now—my whiskers were in just the same state—I never saw the prisoner after that day that I saw him at the office, except in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What have you been doing with yourself since the last trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Employed at my business—I live now at No. 126, Cornwall-road, Lam<lb/>beth—my business is carried on there—I work in the front room—it is a private house, with railings in front—I am a housekeeper there—I set up housekeeping the quarter before last—I had no communication with Mr. Hartley's solicitor, till after I heard the result of the investigation which took place after the last trial—I then read it in the newspaper—I have had a communication with Mr. Hartley's solicitor, since the last trial—I was desired to go to know if I should be wanted, and told them where to find me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at No.</hi> 3)—I do not know in whose hand-writing this "W. Marsh, Esq." is—it is not mine—all my family have been liberated as well as myself—my object in giving my last statement was certainly to effect that purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know Allen, a clerk at! Messrs. Hartley's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never saw him to my knowledge—I never had any acquaintance with any body of that name—I have no recollection of any such person living in my neighbourhood—I will swear I have no acquaintance of that name—I do not know a person named Mitchell—I have heard the name—I never had any acquaintance of that name—the hay that was found in the boxes was taken away by Ellis Caspar in his pocket-handkerchief, and the wooden boxes were burnt—he did not appear to take great care of the hay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not suggest to him it would be better to burn it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The</p>

               <p>blaze might have set the chimney on fire—I do not know that that reason was assigned, but it would have that effect—there was a good large pocket-handkerchief full—no means were attempted to burn it—it might have been burnt certainly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Hartley told me to call on Mr. De Mole, to see if he wanted me—he sent me to Mr. Hum<lb/>phreys, who said he would send me a subpoena when I was wanted—I have always been willing since the last trial to state what I knew of the transaction—I do not know whether Ellis Caspar took away all the hay which was in the boxes, some might have been left—I was never charged with any offence in my life until this circumstance—I conducted Mr. Hyam's whole business for more than ten years, and am in his service now—Davis is one of the persons indicted as Isaac Isaacs—he has run away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have made a statement respecting the ore at his house in Ox<lb/>enden-street, was that part of the statement you were prepared to make before Davis ran away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I was to have screened him—it was at his dictation I made the statement, to screen him, and when he found I made the statement before the magistrate which I did, he ran away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time on Sunday, the 24th of March, was it that the two Cas<lb/>pars came to your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt it was between one and two o'clock—that was the usual time I used to go home to dinner, and I met them in the street—none of my family were ever brought to trial—I remember Ellis Caspar being in difficulties—I proved under his bank<lb/>ruptcy as a creditor—I have the bill now in my pocket—I dare say I had a dozen meetings with the Caspars before the proposition to copy these forma was made to me—there were several meetings at different times—the original proposition was about another parcel called stones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you thought you were not doing wrong when you went to the office, when did you first have reason to know you were doing wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The same evening Ellis Caspar came to my house, and told me the nature of the business I had been engaged in—he then told me there was gold in it—I knew it was something intended to be kept secret, but I had no knowledge of it being a robbery—I knew false papers were made out, and that I obtained the articles' in a false name—it was given to me by the prisoner's direction—I knew I was lending myself to something not entirely correct, but supposing the prisoner to be a respectable young man, and knowing his father, I did not suppose a robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger at Mr. Hartley's office is John-street. On the 25th of March I saw the witness John Vince with the <hi rend="italic">city of Limerick's</hi> ship's box, containing the papers—I saw him lay it on the wash-band-stand—I saw the prisoner that morning about eight o'clock—he just walked through the warehouse into his own office as I supposed, and went out again, saying he would be in in a short time—I received the ship's box while he was out—he came back and opened the box as it stood there, and took papers out—he generally came to the office about nine o'clock, but this morning he came about eight—it might be a few minutes sooner or later—I went for the letters that morning to a receiving house in the Minorie s, and got the letters, which I brought to the office and delivered to the clerk, William Blundell, who took an account of them, about twenty minutes or a quarter to ten o'clock—he remained in the office, and took an account of the letters—the prisoner was standing at his desk at the same time, and took part of the letters out of Blundell's hands—I then went to breakfast—both the prisoner and Blundell stretched out their hands at the same time to receive the letters, but I gave then to Blundell, and he opened them—they were tied in a string—he was commencing to take the account, and while he was doing so, the prisoner took part of them—I went to breakfast, leaving Blundell taking the account—I returned at near ten o'clock, and met the prisoner coming down stairs—he sent me down to the wharf with a letter to give to Mr. Bristow, the wharfinger, and told me to tell Mr. Bristow, or any of the clerks there, not to let any of the specie off the wharf till he himself came down—I went to the wharf but did not see Mr. Bristow—I saw Feltham and the foreman of the wharf, and deli<lb/>vered the message—I then returned to the prisoner—I was sent down to the wharf again—I then saw Mr. Bristow at the wharf, and delivered the former message to him—I then returned to the prisoner, and found Moss—(<hi rend="italic">looking at him</hi>)—with him in the prisoner's office, which was the back room—they did not remain many minutes after I came in—they both walked out of the back office through the warehouse, and went out—Moss got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prisoner remained behind, shut the door, and went to his room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it not a common thing to send you down to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020108"/>
               <p>wharf with a message? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, every day—I am there for the purpose—I am not aware that he ever sent me with such a message before, not to let things go till he came—his orders were generally in writing, sometimes verbal—he has not sent me with such messages before to my knowledge—I will not swear he has not—he was there about eight o'clock that morning, a few minutes before or after—it was before I had any thing but the office open and the floor sprinkled to be swept—seven o'clock is the hour it opens—I will swear he was there before nine o'clock that morning—there is a time-piece in the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the earliest hour you have known him at the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen him between seven and eight o'clock when a vessel has been sailing at six o'clock, but that was very seldom—I believe he has sometimes slept on board a vessel on such occasions, as I have taken notes to his mother's house on those occasions—I cannot say he slept on board—I have heard so—he had his breakfast at the office those mornings—he might have had his breakfast at the office on other mornings besides those on which vessels sailed; but put it altogether I do not suppose I have brought him half a dozen breakfasts since I have been there—I cannot say whether they were all shipping mornings—I have been nearly eight years in the employ—I should say the prisoner has been in the office between two and three years, but at the time he joined the concern I belonged to the west-end office—I should say we have both been in the same office about two years—I am not aware that—he has breakfasted there with Mr. Hartley—he might—MR. Hartley did sleep there sometimes—I have not teen the pri<lb/>soner breakfast with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who else was at the office that morning at eight o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The next clerk that came was Allen—he came about half-past eight, as near as I can say—and another came, I should say, at nine o'clock—I believe that was Mr. Blundell, but I had gone for the letters about a quarter before nine, as there was a clerk in the place—it was a grocer's shop where I went to for the letters—the people generally meet there to get their letters—Moss is the person who came to the office that morning—I persist in swearing that—I gave a description of the person on the last trial—I dare say I stated-then that the man had sandy whiskers—I did—I said large bushy whiskers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you call Moss a person with large bushy sandy whiskers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Undoubtedly not at present—his whiskers are not in the same state as they were when he came to the office—I believe I described his whiskers as meeting close to the chin—to the best of my opinion they were false—they were never the natural growth of his face—they were sandy at that time, to the best of my opinion—I am not aware that I gave that description to Roe and Lea—when brought to Lambeth-street I described them as I have now—I do not call them sandy now—I am not aware that I gave a description of the man to Roe and Lea—I will not swear that I did—I did not, to my knowledge, swear on the last trial that I had given a description to one of the officers—to the best of my opinion, I did not—I am not aware that I gave that description to one of the officers, but I will not swear to any thing I am not conscious of—I did not, to my knowledge, give any such description either to Roe or Lea—I cannot answer in any other way—I cannot say what age the man who came to the office appeared to be—he seemed to me to be a middle-aged man, a man that had a halt in his walk—as he walked out of the warehouse he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020109"/>
               <p>appeared lame—he walked in that way—I might have said, he appeared to be a man about sixty years of age—I do not think I said sixty on the last trial—it is so long ago I might be wrong if I swore I did not—to the best of my opinion, I did not—I never, to my knowledge, described the man as appearing about sixty years of age—I only swear to the best of my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he appear about sixty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He walked with his bead down—it is hard to describe what age he might be—I took him to be in the middle age of life—I should say fifty was nearer the mark—when a man is sixty he is going down hill—I did not take notice whether Allen was in the office or not at the time the man came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after the robbery did Allen leave Mr. Hartley's office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my opinion, he left on Whit-Monday, seven weeks after the robbery—I might have said on the last trial that he left a fortnight or three weeks after the robbery, but I have found out since if I did say so I have said wrong—I remember seeing Moss in custody at Lambeth-street—I do not know when Moss was first taken, but I know Allen was in Mr. Hartley's employ, and left about Whit-Monday—I should say Moss had been examined before that—Allen did live in Commercial-road, but I ra<lb/>ther think, about the time of the robbery he lived in a street opposite the wharf, Burr-street or something—I cannot say when he moved there—I do not know what has become of him—I have not heard whether he is living or dead—I should say he left the office very suddenly—he was at business the Saturday before, and did not make his appearance on Monday—I have stated that he eloped—those were the words I made use of—I did not notice whether the man who came to the office had a velvet collar to his coat or not, at the time I saw Moss first he was leaning both his arms on the desk—I had only a side-glance at him—I have not described him as having a velvet collar, to my knowledge—the prisoner superintended the business when Mr. Hartley was out of town—as far as I have seen, he appeared very zealous and industrious—I de<lb/>scribed the man as between five feet eight and nine—I never described him as six feet high.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are not sure whether Allen was in the office when Most came; can you say whether you are sure that Most was with Allen or with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I swear the prisoner and Moss were both together, and Moss took the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and the prisoner waved, his hand to him—I am positive Moss is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 25th of March I was a clerk in Mr. Hartley's office—I was in the counting-house that morning, when the General Post letters were delivered—the prisoner was there—I received the letters a little before ten o'clock from Mitchell—I keep a book, in which I enter the account of postage—I have it with me now—I made an entry that morning in the book, and altered it after I made it—the first entry was one Falmouth, two Plymouth, and four Dublin letters, which, according to my reckoning, came to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner took part of the letters from me, opened them, and returned them to me, and when he returned them to me there were two Falmouth letters—the postage of a</p>

               <p>letter from Falmouth, at that time, was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was the custom of the postman to put the amount of the letters on the back of one of them, and he had done so that morning—there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. difference between his amount and mine—that would be the difference of one Falmouth letter—I put down the amount of the letters in my book, after I received them from Lewin Caspar, and my account was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more than the postman's—the postman's entry on the letters was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it if our custom to settle with the General postman once a week—when I paid him that week I paid him for one Falmouth letter—the letters were taken into the office that morning by Lewin Caspar—about eleven o'clock that morning I was called out to see somebody—I went out, and saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and a man in it—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb/>ing at the witness Moss</hi>)—that is the man—he asked for Mr. Hartley—I told him that Mr. Hartley was not in town, but that Mr. Caspar, his agent, would see him—I went in and called the prisoner—he went out to the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and they both came through the outer office, and went into the inner office—they remained there a few minutes—they both came out together, Caspar opening the door for Moss—but before they came out the prisoner came from the inner office to me, and asked me Whether there were two boxes of gold dust marked "B. C. 18 and 19," consigned to the Brazilian a Company—I told him there was—I looked into the book to examine be<lb/>fore I told him—Moss went away in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prisoner went out of the office into the street with him—I saw the prisoner again at two o'clock that day, and he told me that a robbery had been committed—he said nothing else that I am aware of, nothing about the letters that I am aware of—I cannot say that the word "forgery" was mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you received the letters back from Caspar, and saw two Fal<lb/>mouth letters instead of one, did you mention it to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told him there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. difference in the postage—I did not make any observation about the difference in the letters—I did not tell him there was one Fal<lb/>mouth letter more than I had given to him—I did not think it was requi<lb/>site—I immediately made the alteration—he did not say any thing parti<lb/>cular when I told him there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. difference in the letters—he had nothing to do with the payment of the pottage, any more than to see that it was correct—I went to the office at nine o'clock that morning—several of the clerks were there when I got there—I believe Francis Allen was there—Mitchell had gone for the letters—I paid the postman, at the end of the week, 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that morning.</p>

               <p>from what he appears now—I did not observe what age he appeared to be exactly—I am not aware that I have ever said he was a man of fifty or sixty years of age—I do not remember that I said on the last trial, he was a man between fifty and sixty years of age—I might have said so, but I cannot say, it is so long since—I think I heard Mitchell say he was about sixty—I cannot say whether I swore that at the last trial or not—I believe I did—the person stooped as he walked, I should say, from in<lb/>firmity or age—I think I said, last time, that he was from five to six feet high, leaving plenty of room for guessing—I did not say he was about five feet seven inches—Caspar was not at the office when I got there at nine o'clock—it was after nine o'clock when I first saw him that morning—I cannot say whether it was as late as half-past—I should say it was between nine and half-past nine o'clock—nine o'clock was my usual time for going to the office—I believe Caspar very often went earlier than that—it was neces<lb/>sary for business—I have seen nothing of Moss since' the last trial, only about here the last day or two—not at the office, or anywhere else—I am not aware of any mistakes in letters from correspondents at Falmouth with regard to goods consigned—mistakes have happened—goods have been entered on the manifest, and have not arrived, and letters hare occasionally been written to correct the errors—I have known letters from Messrs. Carne correcting errors made in previous communications—that has sometimes happened—I do not know that it has not frequently happened—I have not been in the habit of reading the letters—I have heard of such things in the office—I think Allen was in the office when I got there that morning—I cannot say positively—he remained in the office six or seven weeks I think afterwards—I do not exactly remember the time Moss was taken into custody—I do not know that Allen went off very suddenly—I know it was talked of that be ran away, that be went away—I think Moss was taken about four or five weeks afterwards—I do not remember whether it was about the same time that Allen left—I believe it was—I do not know that Allen has run away to America—I do not know whether he it living or dead—I have not heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the papers in the office open as much to Allen and the other clerks as they were to Caspar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not private letters—letters of any importance were not open to any one who liked to read them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But could not any other clerk in the office, if so disposed, read any of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because they were always looked up, I believe—I dare say I could have read them if they were lying about—I cannot say where the keys were kept, unless Caspar kept them—I am not aware that they hung up in the office—I never knew of their being kept in the office—Allen was collecting clerk—he was occasionally in the habit of going on board steam-vessels, and to the wharf—there are two cupboards in the office, in which boxes of letters were kept—letters received in the morning from correspondents would be put in the cupboard—it was not locked'—I believe any clerk in the office could have gone and looked at them—I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not matter of public talk and notoriety that Allen had run away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I am aware of—it was talked of in the office that he had gone away, and had not been seen since, but not that he had run away—I am not aware that any inquiries have been made about him—I have never seen him since.</p>

Came correcting communications of the delivery of goods—Cas<lb/>par would know that, and would know how the absence of goods might be accounted for—I did not get to the office till nine o'clock—whether Caspar was there before that, or what he had been doing between eight and nine o'clock, I do not know—at the time I spoke to Caspar about the postage, I had no idea that one of those letters was a forgery, nor that the post-mark had been forged, or that any fraud had been committed or contemplated—I supposed it was a mistake of my own, and altered it—Allen went away about six or seven weeks after this transaction—I do not know when Moss was taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the prisoner, in the absence of Mr. Hartley, generally very much engaged in business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not consider that he had any time to throw away—I did not consider it extraordinary that he should go away after waiting half-an-hour—he had the whole business to attend to in Mr. Hartley's absence—I first heard there had been a robbery about two o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner was not the first person to tell me—Kingston did—I saw the prisoner about three o'clock in the afternoon, he then told me of it—I was examined at Lambeth-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From first to last did not the prisoner evince every anxiety to exert himself to the utmost to discover the perpetrators of the robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He certainly appeared very much excited about it—he expressed himself anxious that the perpetrators should be brought to justice—he never ab<lb/>sented himself from the office to my knowledge—I have known him about four years—I never heard any thing but the highest character of him—he was always considered clever in business—I do not know that mistakes were occasionally made at the office—my duty is at the wharf—I have known some packages over, which were not in the manifest, and some packages in the manifest, not in the vessel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In different matters were there not mistakes occurring almost every day of some sort or other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There might be slight errors—I never heard of any serious ones—I was shown this letter (No. 4) by the prisoner, in Lea's presence, on the afternoon the robbery was committed—I be<lb/>lieved the signature of Messrs. Came to it, to be genuine—I have seen Messrs. Carne's signature occasionally, and believed it to be genuine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known the prisoner very often at the wharf early of a morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not very early—I have seen him there at eight o'clock when he had occasion to go on board a vessel that was going to sail, but not on other occasions—I never recollect it—I will undertake to say I never did see him unless a vessel was sailing—I have seen him at the office as early as eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the sort of direction the prisoner would write as an order to deliver goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when he had occasion to do so—I should have delivered a package without the order under it, but not such valuable property—if I saw the letter, believing it to be' signed by Messrs. Carne, I should have delivered it—believing it to be genuine, I should have delivered the goods—I knew Allen—I did not see him at the wharf that day, I am certain—he might be at the wharf once or twice a week—I remem<lb/>ber his leaving suddenly—I do not know why he left, nor whether he is living or dead—I have never seen him since—I have never had any doubt about Moss being the person who came to the wharf—I did not hear Mitchell describe him—I remember bills being put up advertising the rob<lb/>bery—communications from Falmouth of consignments would be by post advising of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did such advice generally arrive the day before the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depended on the passage the vessel had—this vessel left, I think, in time to be up on Sunday, but the letters could not be delivered until Monday—nobody in Mr. Hartley's establishment could know that the gold was com<lb/>ing—the writing of this letter, (No. 4,) is different to any writing I ever saw from Messrs. Carne's office, except the signature—it is very different to the prisoner's hand-writing—I should not consider any part of it like his, except the order and endorsement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am accountant to the Brazilian Company. I went to the office of the Company on the 25th of March, about ten o'clock—no boxes of gold dust marked B C 18 and 19 arrived at the office—we ex<lb/>pected such boxes—William March is our secretary—he came to the office about eleven o'clock—in consequence of a communication from him, I sent Carthew to the Dublin Steam-packet wharf—I was at the Bullion-office in the Bank about one o'clock, when the prisoner came there—I went to in<lb/>quire if the boxes had arrived, and saw the prisoner there—I asked him what had become of oar two boxes of gold dust, marked B C 18 and 19—he said, "They have been delivered at your house"—I said, "How is that, when they are consigned by the bill of lading to the Bank of Eng<lb/>land?"—he said, "We have this morning received a letter from Messrs. Carne, stating, that in consequence of an error in the manifest, they were not to be delivered at the Bank of England, but to the agent of the Bra<lb/>zilian Company"—I asked him the name of the agent—he said he could not recollect, but if I would go with him to the office, in Crutched-friars, he would tell me the name—I asked him if the name was March—he said, "That, I think, is the name"—I then left the Bank, and left him—I went to our office, and ascertained that the boxes were not delivered there—I then went to the office in Crutched-friars, and saw the prisoner in the outer office—I said, "These boxes have not been delivered at our office, where are they?"—he said, "If you will walk into the inner office, I will tell you what has become of them"—he produced two letters to me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at Nos.</hi> 3 and 4)—these are then—No. 4 was exactly in the same state then as it is now, with the address torn off—I asked him, "What has become of the outside of this letter, the address?"—he said, "I don't know whether it was torn off when it was first delivered into my hands, or whether it was torn off since"—he did not tell me whether he knew who it had been addressed to—he asked me if I thought the signatures of Messrs. Carne were genuine—I told him I thought not—he said, "Are they not like Messrs. Carnes' writing?"—I said, "Certainly, I think they are like it, but I think they are not genuine; I think they are forged"—I asked him if the body of the letter was written in a similar hand to any body in Messrs. Carnes' house that he was in the habit of seeing—if it was similar to any writing he had seen coming from Messrs. Carnes' house—he said, cer<lb/>tainly it was, he had seen such writing often—he did not tell me whose writing it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you ask him if the boxes had been delivered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told roe they had been delivered that morning to a gentlemanly looking man, either representing himself as coming from William March, or William March himself, he could not tell which—he said he thought the letters genuine, and he had seen similar writing from Carnes' house—I am ac<lb/>quainted with Messrs. Carnes' writing—it is in some degree similar—I mean the signature, but, in my opinion, easily detected to be a forgery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a person received it in the hurry of business, do not you think he might be deceived by it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is possible—(<hi rend="italic">looking at No.</hi> 3)—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020116"/>
               <p>there is nothing particularly extraordinary in this letter—I should say, on looking at it, it is not what I consider exactly a mercantile letter—in the first place, it is addressed at foot "W. Marsh, Esq., agent to the Brazil<lb/>ian Mining Company, or order;" now Mr. March's name is spelt wrong, and he is not agent, but secretary to the company—(<hi rend="italic">looking at No.</hi> 4)—this is decidedly much more unmercantile than the other, because it is ad<lb/>dressed "Messrs. W. Marsh, Esqr."—the signature is somewhat similar to Messrs. Carnes'—it is a signature I would not act on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But a person reading it over once may very likely not be able to distinguish it from a genuine signature? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is possible, I cannot say it is probable I confess—I am not at all acquainted with the hand-writing of the prisoner—I should say the note at the bottom of No. 8, is a differ<lb/>ent hand-writing from the body, and the date also, "23rd of March, 1839" I should say was different—all the rest appears to be one hand-writing, except the note at the bottom, and the signature—I do not think the date is a similar hand-writing to the body, generally—I think it is a different hand-writing—I think the date of No. 4, and "Messrs. W. Marsh, Esq., Secretary to the Brazilian Mining Company, or order," is different to the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, could such an error as that be made by a person competent to conduct Mr. Hartley's business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—nor any person in the habit of corresponding—"Messrs." is in the same line with the name, and appears in the same hand-writing as the rest of the address, and it appears to be squeezed into a place not large enough.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you perceive any difference in the writing and ink of the word "Messrs.," in the corner, and the name which follows? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appears to me it is all written with the same ink—the word "Messrs." is written rather larger than the rest of the name—it is the same as "W.

                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a wharfinger and proprietor of steam vessels, with others, under the firm of James Hartley and Co.; I am the prosecutor of this indictment. On the 25th of March I was in Dublin—I came to London on the night of the 28th—the prisoner was in my service, and had at the rate of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—in February, last year, he applied to me for an increase of salary, which I declined—on the 21st of March, last year, I had occasion to write to the prisoner—this is the letter I wrote to him (No. 7)—this letter of the 26th of March (No. 5) is in the prisoner's hand-writing—that letter was never sent—Allen was in my em<lb/>ploy—he quitted my employ on the 13th of May last—Moss was taken into custody about the middle of April—I have not the most remote rea<lb/>son to believe that Allen was concerned in this transaction.</p>

On the 25th of March, last year, I was sent to Mr. Hartley's office, in John-street, and saw a clerk there—I believe the prisoner to be the per<lb/>son, but I cannot swear to him—I inquired if two boxes of gold dust had arrived by their vessel, from Falmouth, on the Brazilian Company's ac<lb/>count—he answered, "Yes"—this was about eleven o'clock in the morning—MR. Peat had sent me—I should think it was rather after eleven o'clock than before—I think I might be certain it was before twelve o'clock—I asked if two boxes bad arrived marked "B. C," and I think the numbers were "18 and 19"—I mentioned that to him—he said they had arrived—I then asked him if he could inform me what time they would arrive as the Bank of England—he said, "They are about arriving there at this time"—I believe there was a second person there—the porter, who waited in the office when the clerks were not there—it was not Kingston—I have seen him here to-day—I think it was Mitchell.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 25th of March I remember the prisoner coming to the office and seeing Mr. Hardwicke, the Magistrate, about half-past two o'clock—he produced these two letters—(Nos. 3 and 4)—he said a serious robbery had taken place that morning, at Irongate Wharf, and that a person had come in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> from Mr. March—he gave me a description of the mode in which it had been effected, that he had given it to a person who came in the name of Mr. March—I afterwards went to Irongate Wharf—he staid some few minutes with me at the wharf—he then left me, and said he could be of no further use to me—I staid some time, and then went to the office in John-street, and saw the prisoner—he opened a drawer, and produced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020129"/>
               <p>three or four letters of Messrs. Carries', and asked my opinion as to the writing, whether it did not correspond with the two letters I had before seen—he said he considered himself they were one and the same writing—I said, "No, they appear to me quite a different writing"—he then particu<lb/>larly drew my attention to Messrs. Carne's signature—I said that appeared to correspond with the others very much—he said it was principally on the faith of the signature he had given the order to the person for the boxes—I asked him at that time the description of the person who had been to receive the order—he said he was a man shorter than himself, grey whiskers, it appeared as if he had been a traveller, that he had a weather-beaten countenance—if I recollect right, he said he appeared to be about sixty years of age, and had grey hair—he laid he did not know him—he said he supposed, from what he stated, that he had come from Mr. March, and he did not know whether it was Mr. March or not—about eight o'clock that night I was at the Swan-with-two-Necks, making in<lb/>quiry about the Falmouth coach, and while there, the prisoner and his father came in—he inquired about the Falmouth mail, and said he was going by the Falmouth mail—I made inquiry, and found the mail had been gone about a quarter of an hour before they came in—I told the prisoner I thought if he had a wish to go, be might overtake the mail at the South<lb/>ampton rail-road—I went with them in a coach, but the mail had been gone about ten minutes I think—the mail goes by the rail-road—I do not think he had stated to me before, any intention of going to Falmouth—I have no recollection of it—he called at two or three coach-offices coming back, and said he should go next morning—as we returned, Ellis Caspar left the coach—I am not quite positive where he left it—I thought it was at Charing-cross, but it was between Charing-cross and St. Paul's—the prisoner said there would be hand-bills out next day, and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward offered—he said Mr. Allen, and Mr. De Mole were to have them printed—I expressed a wish to see Mr. De Mole before they were printed, and the prisoner requested his father to go immediately to prevent their being printed—I had been to the St. Paul's Coffee-house in the morning, and found three persons were putting up there from the Falmouth mail that day, and I went to see them—I called there again in the evening with the prisoner, after his father left—I gave a description of the person as the prisoner had given me, grey hair, and whiskers, a person, shorter than him, and about sixty years of age—he never contradicted me, or said that was not the person—there was a description given then, that such a per<lb/>son had been there—one of the three who had come by the mail—I think the waiter gave me that description, and the prisoner said that appeared the sort of description of the person—that person was described as about sixty years of age, with grey hair and whiskers—the prisoner also said he thought I could not do better than to pursue the inquiry there, and stick to the person at that house—he also told me the same thing, two days afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long afterwards did you trace the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to New-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> I traced, when the prisoner was with me, in the Minories—I afterwards traced a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the neighbourhood of New-street, and went to a house in New-street, which had no tenant, and where a plate had been taken off the door—I have since ascertained that to be Moss's house—I found a quantity of nails in the grate, and some under the grate, and some in the dust-hole.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The first <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man was examined, and said he could not re<lb/>cognise Moss, and so his deposition was not taken. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I do not recollect any thing of that kind.</p>

Came,—Dear Sirs, A most diabolical robbery has been committed here through the means of forging your signatures to two letters. On the other side I send a copy of them, and I beg that you will use your utmost exer<lb/>tions towards discovering the perpetrator. The impression is that it must have been done by persons who have had access to your office or knew of all the particulars as early as yourselves. The letters were posted at Fal<lb/>mouth on the 23rd, and arrived with this morning's manifest. Shortly after a gentleman called, requesting the delivery of two boxes marked "B C 18 and 19;" he showed me a letter which purported to be Mr. March's, or from him, I had not the slightest suspicion, and referred him to the wharf, writing an order for their delivery; unfortunately they were handed to him, and it only remains to use every exertion to obtain a clue. Let me beg and entreat of you to show your usual zeal in this matter. Believe me, dear Sirs, I am almost heart-broken. Yours very truly, L. <hi rend="smallCaps">CASPER</hi>. The man who called at my office appeared about fifty or sixty years of age, grey whiskers, middling stature, very dark complexion, swarthy, or very sunburnt, as an old traveller would appear, has a country dialect, as if from your parts. I think he was lame, as he walked very slow, or perhaps limped."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 248.) I was at Lambeth-street office on the 14th of June I think—I do not exactly recollect the date—the prisoner, Ellis Caspar, Mrs. Abrahams, and Moses were all four in confine<lb/>ment in one cell in the office—I heard the prisoner conversing with Moses—they were talking loud—I was not in a situation to see as well as hear—I heard the prisoner say to Moses, "Do you intend to let me have any money, I want 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to prepare for my defence"—Moses answered, "No, I want four or five fifties to pay or prepare for my own"—the pri<lb/>soner said, "Had I have had the 1400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as you promised me, things might have been different"—Moses said "You are a b——rogue, you did not give him even what you had"—he did not mention who he meant by <hi rend="italic">him</hi>—there was something said then which I did not hear, and I heard Moses say, "Did you ever give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"</p>

               <p>not tell him formally all I bad to say, but I told him about the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I told him it was not Moss who came in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—that was before my father was tried—I did not see him take it down in writing—I went to Mr. Yates with my mother and sisters—my mother went to consult him and take him money for counsel—I was not brought here when my father was tried.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you willing to come forward as a witness on the last trial, to state this if asked to do it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A place like this I was almost afraid of coming to, but on it being represented it was useful to my brother, I could not refuse to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your solemn oath, is what you have said about your brother being at home, true or false? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most certainly it is true—I would not swear a falsity—my poor mother is not in a state to come forward—MR.

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's sister. I remember Sunday the 24th of March last—my brother was in the habit of getting up late on Sunday mornings, sometimes at ten, and sometimes ten or eleven o'clock—on Sunday, the 24th of March, he got up between eleven and twelve o'clock—I remember his coming down stairs that morning about that time—he breakfasted after he came down—I remember a man named Wilson, a clock-case maker, calling that day to see my brother—I think he called before twelve o'clock—it was after my brother came down—he had some conversation with my brother—I do not recollect upon what subject—he left about three o'clock—the dinner cloth was being laid while he staid there—dinner was brought up while he was there, I think—he did not dine with us—he went away before dinner—the servant I remember, in laying the cloth, had to ask him to move, in talking to my brother, to enable her to lay the cloth—my brother dined with the rest of the family that day—he went out in the evening, about five o'clock—I can undertake to say he did not leave the house earlier than between four and five o'clock, and that he was there from one to two or three o'clock—he was not out</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020141"/>
               <p>till between four and five o'clock in the evening—my brother Edward and he slept together—the prisoner had supper at home that Sunday night—we usually supped between eleven and twelve o'clock, about eleven—he came home early—I remarked his coming home particularly early that evening, but I do not know the hour—we went to bed at the usual hour that night—next morning, Monday, the 25th, he came down stairs a few minutes before nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember whether there was any thing particular to require his coining down stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, his boot-maker called that morning, and was waiting for him to have an answer about his boots, which he had brought home on Saturday night—when he came down he spoke to the boot-maker—he said he had not time to wait a moment—he came down with his coat over his arm, and his slippers on—he breakfasted at home that morning—he went out just about nine o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then he only came down a few minutes before nine o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He came down just before nine o'clock, but very often he used to take a cup of coffee and run away—he did so that morning—he went away in a great hurry—it might be a few minutes before nine o'clock when he left, but it was on the stroke of nine—my brother Edward was in the habit of taking him a lunch every morning—he generally took it about ten or eleven o'clock, but sometimes it was not so exact—I remember my father coming home on Monday evening perfectly well—he came home from eleven to half-past eleven o'clock, but not later—I am quite sure of that—he went to bed with the rest of the family—I was ready on the last trial to state what I have now—I had stated it to Mr. Yates, my brother's attorney.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why was it you did not come here to state it in the last case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because the counsellors did not think it necessary witnesses should be called, I understood—MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is his shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A clock and watch manufactory—my brother sometimes has a sandwich for his lunch, or sometimes bread and cheese, any thing there was—he did not take it with him—Edward used to take it to him—he very seldom took it himself—he used to say he would do without any, but we nearly always used to send him lunch, and we used to send it as early as we could to him—John-street is about twenty minutes or a quarter-of-an-hour's walk—we sent every day—he never took it himself—it was sent wrapped up in paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clock-case maker, and live at No. 19, King, street, Clerkenwell—I am not a housekeeper, but a lodger—I have lived there two years and better. I knew the elder and younger Mr. Caspar—I remember calling at Mr. Caspar's house on the 24th of March last—I was there about ten minutes after twelve o'clock—I saw the elder Caspar and the younger one, and the young son and the daughters—I had some conversation with them—I was there till after three o'clock, till their table was laid for dinner, and then I left.</p>

               <p>——<hi rend="smallCaps">RIDDINGTON</hi>. I am a bootmaker, and live at No. 15, Fins<lb/>bury-place North, very nearly opposite Mr. Caspar. I made the prisoner two pairs of boots—I remember Saturday, the 23rd of March last, I have it down in my book—I sent him some boots that day—I sent Allen to the prisoner about them on Monday morning, from half-past eight to nine o'clock—he returned to me with a message between half-past eight and nine o'clock—I am positive as to the time.</p>
               <p>---- <hi rend="smallCaps">ALLEN</hi>. In March last I was in the employ of Mr. Riddington. I remember taking a pair of boots home to the prisoner on Saturday, the 23rd of March—I went to him on Monday morning—it was within a few minutes of nine o'clock—I saw his two sisters, and afterwards saw the prisoner come down stairs—he had on a pair of dark trowsers, and was in his shirt sleeves, and a pair of morning slippers—I had a little conver<lb/>sation with him about the boots, for to the best of my recollection the boots did not fit him—to the best of my recollection I took them away, and returned to my master's shop—I suppose I remained in the house about five or six minutes—I was shown into the parlour at the back of the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mill-wright, and live in Craven-street, City-road—I am foreman to Mr. John Morant Hervey—he is an iron-founder and smith, and lives in Brick-lane, St. Luke's. The prisoner Watson has been in his employ about three years—we have a great number of files, which pass through my hands to examine them and see if they are correct—I have lately missed a great number of them—the room in which Watson worked joined to the office in which the files are kept, and he had access to them if he thought proper—on the 20th of February the policeman came with Kellett, and Watson, whom I had seen there not three minutes before, made his escape out of the premises over a wall, and through some adjoin<lb/>ing premises—I then went to a shop kept by Cowan, in Goswell-street, within five minutes' walk of the prosecutor's—Cowan calls himself a gen<lb/>eral dealer—he deals in files and all sorts of things—I found eighty-two files there—I looked at them, and these two I can identify—I know they</p>

               <p>are my master's, and I believe the whole of them are his, and in addition to these eighty-two, Bee produced three more files which I believe to be my master's—I cannot tell which of these the prisoner stole on the 20th of December—I knew the female prisoner by her bringing Watson's dinner every day in a basket.</p>

I remember the prisoner Watson coming to my house—I had some files exposed for sale at my door, and he came and said, "Are you in the habit of buying files?"—I said, "Yes, sometimes"—he said he was a file-cutter, and he was in the habit of having a great many at times—I said I would buy them if they suited me—about two days after, on the 3rd of December, he came, and brought two dozen of files with him—he asked 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen for them—I said I could not give that, as they were re-cut; I could not give more than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the two dozen—he gave me the name of "Cook, No. 12, Memel-street, St. Luke's"—I have no doubt the files now produced are part of what he brought—some time afterwards the female prisoner came, and brought two dozen of files of the same sort—she stated she came from her husband, and asked me to buy them, and I bought the two dozen of her for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I think that was about a fortnight after I had bought these of the male prisoner—she afterwards came again, and I bought two dozen more of her—she came again, and said she had some more, but I said I was full, and did not buy any more of her—I put them on the shelf, and on the 20th of Feb<lb/>ruary I was applied to—I gave up the files I received of the prisoners to the prosecutor and the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived in Jane Shore-court, Shoreditch, for some time, but on the 27th of December I lived in George-street, Spitalfields—I cannot say when I left Jane Shore-court, but I lived in George-street at the time of this accident happening. On the 26th of December, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was going from <hi rend="italic">Mike</hi> Collins's room in George-street, where the prisoner lived, to my own house—I had got to the foot of the stairs and was groping for the latch, to go out, when the prisoner came out of his own room, and said, "Who is this?"—I said, "A friend"—"What makes you here," says he, "so late?"—I said, "I have been up to <hi rend="italic">Mike</hi> Collins's room here"—he said, "Very well, I will open the door for you"—"Thank you," says I, "I am much obliged to you"—after I got into the street he said, "If I catch you here so late any more, you will get something for it"—I turned and said, "You may catch me here later or earlier, but no harm"—"Very well," says he, "I must know more about you"—so he ran out in the street after me—"You have no occasion," says I, "to come out"—I turned back—he went to <hi rend="italic">Mike</hi> Col<lb/>lins's room and called, and he made him an answer—he said, "What man is this I caught in your passage?"—Collins said, "No man, but one going home to his lodgings"—"Yes, <hi rend="italic">Mike"</hi> says I, "I am here"—with that the prisoner <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his left hand and took my collar—I, with my right hand, took his collar—I said, "What do you mean to do, what do you collar me for?"—with that he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his hand with a knife in it, and made a rush with the knife at my belly—it missed me—he said, "You wretch," or, "you vagabond, I will run this through your guts"—I took my hand out of his collar, and took hold of the knife, which was open—I called out to Collins, who was in bed, that he had got a knife and was going to murder me with it—so he got up and laid hold of Hayes, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Hayes, that is my cousin; don't strike him in my house, if you do I'll strike you"—I put myself away from him, and was going away, and he got the opportunity of striking me with the knife in the cheek—it went through on the right side, and the teeth on the other side stopped it—he dropped the knife then—<hi rend="italic">Mike</hi> Collins's wife was after lighting the candle, and she seeing him drop the knife, said, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Hayes, it is too late to drop the knife, now you have struck the man," and out Collins's wife went to fetch the policeman, and I kept the knife till the policeman came—the blow injured me—I have been ill a long time, and could do nothing for myself afterwards—I consider in my own mind the man must have made a mistake—I am informed since that he has got a drunken wife, and that might be the cause of his making a mistake in me, for they behaved very kind to me afterwards—they gave me some money during the time that I was ill—it was God's will that I got over it, and I would not like to hurt the man.</p>

I live in New-court, George-yard, Whitechapel—the prisoner lived in the same house—we have got no landlord—we pay no rent to any body—I remember, one night in December, hearing a cry out, it was between twelve and one o'clock in the night—Bryant had been visiting me that day—Hayes called out to me, "What man is this in my passage?"—I said my friend was going home to his lodging, and then they both came into my room—there was a good fire, but no candle—they were talking to one another, and then Bryant hallooed out to me, and I told Hayes to let that man alone, he was no harm to him—then directly Bryant hallooed out to me that he was going to murder him with a knife, I jumped out of bed, and caught hold of Hayes by the collar—I said, "Don't hit my cousin, else I will hit you"—before I had the word out of my mouth my mistress lighted the candle, and the prisoner <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his hand, and stabbed Bryant on the right cheek, and the blood flowed on my shoulder, just the same as you would let a water-cock go—the prisoner dropped the knife, my wife took it up, and said, "It is too late to drop it now"—I opened my door, and sent for the policeman—Bryan's cheek was cut right through.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Christian Hinrich Frucht<lb/>nicht—he lives at No. 2, Catherine-street, in the parish of St. Anne, it is our dwelling-house. On the night of the 11th of February, my little girl told me something and I went out into the street—I saw no one, but I saw that some of the things had been taken from the shop window, and that the whole of the pane of glass had been taken out—the window was all in confusion—I had seen the scarf and the other articles mentioned safe about a quarter of an hour before, and the window was then safe—I sent a person round the corner and she came running back and fetched me—I went out and went round to a cart, which was round the corner in James's-street, two doors from our house—I found in the cart this scarf, these four petticoats, five frocks, and six pairs of stockings—(<hi rend="italic">examining them</hi>)—they are all new, and are the property of my husband, they had been safe in the shop a quarter of an hour before the child came in—when I was in the street I saw the prisoner pass the turning, and Mr. Baker, who was with me, went up to him and said, "Is it you who can't keep your hands to yourself?"—the prisoner said, "I have not been doing any thing to-night"—MR. Baker brought him to the shop and sent for a policeman—while the pri<lb/>soner was in the shop he leaned up against the counter, and the next morning when I was patting the shop to rights I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) under the gowns on the counter where he had leaned—the knife does not belong to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Benjamin Nevill. On the 24th of February I got into a Holloway omnibus at Moorgate-street—about two minutes before I got in I took my purse out of my pocket to take out a sixpence to pay my fare—I put the sixpence into my glove, and put the purse into my pocket again on my right side—I had done that openly in the street, so that any one might see that I had a purse—when I got into the omnibus I saw the prisoner Brown sitting near the door on the left-hand side—I was wishing to sit between him and the door, but he put his knees towards the door, and that occasioned me to sit on the other side, about three from the door—that brought me to sit next the prisoner Stanley—I feel convinced it was him—he sat on my right-hand, where my pocket and money was—the omnibus started immediately, and Stanley annoyed me by looking under my bonnet very much—when we got to York-place, City-road, a lady got out who had sat between me and the door—I then moved towards the door, and Stanley followed me—when he looked under my bonnet I turned my head from him—I continued in the omnibus till we got just beyond Islington church, when Stanley got out—Brown was then sitting on the opposite side to me, and he said he would get out at the next turning, but he did not stop till he got to the turning—he said, set him down, any where would do—the omnibus did not stop much before it got to the turning—I went on beyond Highbury—I missed my purse before I got there, but I did not discover that my gown was cut till I got out—from the time I got in at Moorgate and my missing my purse, no one, except Stanley, had been sitting on that side of me near enough to get my purse—and after he left no one sat near me—a woman sat on that side, but she was quite up at the other corner—I lost between 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say to a few shillings—I know I had two sovereigns in my purse, and one was an extremely bright one, of the present reign.</p>

On the 29th of February I and my wife went out about seven o'clock in the evening, leaving M'Carthy in care of the house—she was the only person—as far as we know, we left all my property secure—I returned to the house first, in about two hours, and found two of the trades-people ringing at the bell—they could not get in—I rang once at the bell—it was not answered—I went into the next house, and got over the wall—I found no one in my house, M'Carthy was gone—I went to my cash-box, and found that was safe, and I did not search any further—my wife returned afterwards, and she missed the articles stated—the next day, which was Sunday, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was with a friend, and saw M'Carthy—I told her I was very glad to see her, and I should take her into custody—she said she would confess all she had done, and if I would go to No. 31, Rose-lane, she would give me up what she had stolen, as she had not parted with any—(I had not made her any promise, or threatened her)—I said I would not—I took her to Whitechapel-church, and gave her into custody—we then went to No. 31, Rose-lane, and found various things that are here, and are part of what I lost—the value of what I lost was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at least—Graham was taken afterwards—I know nothing of her, but she was with M'Carthy when I took her—she ran or walked away directly, and I had</p>

I was at the station-house when M'Carthy was brought in—I went to search the house, No. 31, Rose-lane, and there found the property here produced, with the exception of this gown and bonnet, which M'Carthy had on—I could not find Graham at that time, but I stopped at the house after the others were gone, and in a few minutes Graham came in at the back-door, and I took her—I asked where the shawl was that she had on when she was with M'Carthy—she said she did not know M'Carthy—I said she was with her when she was taken—she then said she was with her, and had borrowed M'Carthy's shawl, and lent her hers—M'Carthy was afterwards brought back to that house, and she asked Graham where the suit of clothes was that had been in the bundle—Graham denied that they had been in it.</p>

The pri<lb/>soner Haggett drove one of our teams for five or six weeks—I know Brett—we served him with coals for some considerable time—he lives in Cler<lb/>kenwell—I had frequent dealings with him, and always found him correct—he keeps a coal-shed—Haggett went out on the 22nd of January with coals—there was a nose-bag of beans, clover, and corn for the horses—the provender in the bag belonged to us, and if the horses did not eat it it ought to be returned to us—Brett had been in the habit of carting his own coals from our wharf—we very seldom sent our teams to his place—it is evident on this occasion the horses did go with the coals.</p>

                  </hi>. I go out with Mr. Burrows's teams, to unload coals. On the 22nd of January I went to deliver coals at a public-house near Brett's—I did not shoot any coals at Brett's—we shot them at a public-house three or four doors from Brett's—we had two nose-bags—we did not put them on the horses—they were filled with corn and beams, and a little chaff on the top—Haggett sold the contents to Brett for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a pot of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale, for both bags—they were full—there was more beans than corn or chaff among it—Haggett backed round the horses to Brett's back-way, and Haggett took the nose-bags, and gave them to Brett, who took them up into his loft—as he went up stairs he asked Haggett how much he was to give for them—he said a shilling—Brett said that was too much—he brought the nose-bags down again empty.</p>

I was at the William the Fourth public-house that day—I saw the two prisoners come in about three o'clock—they were three parts intoxicated—they had not sat long before Savage said, "We will have some more"—I did not know what he meant—I sat about three-quarters of an hour, and Savage again said, "We will have some more at all events; who has got a knife?"—I said I had one—he said, "Let me have it'—I said I would not—he said he would beat my brains out with a gridiron; and then an Irishman who was there went out and brought in a coal-chisel—they wrenched up the boards, and jumped upon them; then Savage went down and handed up two or three bottles—I went out into the grounds, and told what I had seen—I heard Savage say to a man that they had taken fifteen or eighteen at the first going off.</p>

I found this property in the prisoner's possession in his own house—he lives three doors from the sta<lb/>tion—the Creek is at the end of Woodford-lane, about three-quarters of a mile from the heart of the town; but the boat laid up in the mud, as I was given to understand—the prisoner had got the shirt on his back—the pro<lb/>secutor said he supposed it was his—the prisoner pulled it off, and gave it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Skilton's-lane, Green<lb/>wich. On Friday, the 28th of February, in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop with a silver tea-spoon—he laid it on the counter—I was busy at the time, having no one else in the shop—I suspected it was stolen—I took it up, looked at it, and was not able to make out the initials—the prisoner said, "It is old silver"—I said, "I suppose you want to sell it then?"—he said "Yes"—I asked his name—he said, "Smith, my mother sent me with the spoon, and the name of Smith is on it"—I put it on one side a little time, went to the door, and called an officer—I then told the prisoner I thought he had either found or stolen the spoon—he said he had found it on Deptford-bridge—I said the spoon appeared to have been used where there was a family—it seemed to have been bit—I asked him on which side the initials of "Smith" were—he said, "On the back"—it was "W. S." on it, which I believe are the initials of the person—I said it was Mr. Benjamin Smith's, the proprietor of the wharf—he said it was not, and I gave him in charge—he said afterwards his name was Robert Elliott.</p>

On the 24th of February, about a quarter to twelve o'clock, I was in St. George's-road, leading from the Elephant and Castle to New Bedlam—I had come from a public-house, where I had been to join a bene<lb/>fit society, and was going home—I was alone—I had been drinking a little, but was quite capable of taking care of myself, and knowing what I was about—I was walking on the edge of the foot-path—I did not observe or hear any person in the road near me, but I received a violent blow on the cheek—I turned round momentarily and perceived Tanner—I had scarcely time to make a slight grasp of him, when my heels were tripped up, and I was knocked down nearly on my back—my breath was almost knocked out of my body—the blow did not knock me down—it cut my cheek—I should suppose the blow was from a fist—I had a bundle in my hand, and the moment my heels were tripped up, a snatch was made at it, but I had it tied round my wrist, and they could not get it off—it was all done momentarily—what passed after I was down I cannot say—I know Tanner was one of the men, for I turned round instantly on receiving the blow, and saw he had very black eyes, as if from blows he had received—I never saw him before, to my knowledge—there was a light from a gas lamp—I cannot say how many there were, it was done in such a sudden manner—the policeman and Lee came to my assistance momentarily, or I should have been robbed—I did not miss any thing—I had some fifteen or sixteen shillings loose in my trowsers' pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a currier, and live in Bell's-rents, John-street, Southwark. On the 23rd of February I was coming through the Strand—we met the prisoner Page, and some more young women—we gave them something to drink, then we went to an eating-house, then went and had some more drink—after that, Page took me to Morte's-place, over Waterloo-bridge—when I was going over the bridge, I looked at my watch, and it was then safe—when I got to her house I separated my purse from my copper—my purse contained 15 sovereigns and eight shil<lb/>lings—I then went up stairs with her—I remained half-an-hour, or three quarters—I pulled off my clothes and went to bed, but as I did not find Page was coming, I jumped up—I took up my trowsers—I heard the coppers jingling, and I thought all as right—I then missed my watch, my purse, and money—Seymour then came in and collared me—he said, I did not take it there, and he turned me out of the house—I called the police—we went to the station-house, then went back to the house, and an old woman attacked me, and my nose bled—the officer took her, and she had three months' imprisonment—we could not get in, and the house was not searched.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a girl of the town. I was in company with Page and another girl on Sunday night, the 23rd of February—I saw the prosecutor first about half-past seven o'clock—he then had two gentlemen with him—I afterwards saw him in Villiers-street—he turned into an open house in Villiers-street—I did not see him come out, but I saw him and his two friends after they came out—they had not reached as far as the Cock-and-Bottle public-house when I met them—I went into the Cock-and-Bottle public-house with them—I did not notice whether the prosecutor was drunk before he went in, or not—I called for some wine—the prosecutor said gin was good enough for wh—s, and he called for gin, and several quarterns were given, I do not know how many—we were there nearly half-an-hour—we then left them, and in about two hours Page and I were coming down the Strand, and we met the prosecutor and one other gentleman—we asked the other gentleman to treat us—he said he would—they took us to an oyster-shop close against the Adelphi—we had half a pint or more of gin, and the Irish gentleman who was with the prose<lb/>cutor paid for it—we had three mutton chops and some bread and butter, but we had no beer or ale, I am quite certain, nothing but gin—I asked the prosecutor to give us some ale, which he refused to do—the other gentle<lb/>man paid for the gin that we had at the Cock-and-Bottle public-house—the prosecutor called for the chops at the oyster-shop, and when they came up the other gentleman said, "Now, you blackguard, pay for the chops," the prosecutor said, "I have no money, and that you know"—the gentleman paid for them—I did not see the prosecutor pay any thing that night, not a halfpenny—he did not produce any money—I did not see that he had a watch.</p>
