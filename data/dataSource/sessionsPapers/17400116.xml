Yes; and I had it of a Boy in Chick-Lane, said the Prisoner, who asked me 3 d. for it; but I snatch'd it from him, and ran away with it.

            . On Saturday December 15. I lost from my Door, a Copper-bottom of an Hundred and odd Pounds Weight in the Evening; and I sent among the Trade, to desire it might be stopp'd, if it should be offer'd to sale. On Monday the 17th of December, about 7 in the Evening a Messenger came from Houndsditch, to let me know he believ'd he could give me Information about my Goods. Upon this I went to Mr. Simms, a Founder, in Houndsditch, and found about a third Part of the Copper-bottom in the Scales, in Order to be weigh'd and sold. Mr. Simms's Servants imagin'd it was mine, so they delay'd paying for it, and sent for me. My Servants, as well as I, being positive to the Goods, Mr. Simms told me he had order'd Mr. Peartree (who brought it) to call again for the Money, and if we would go to a publick House, he would send for us when he came.

He said, he had them from the Prisoner Maxwell, and that Maxwell told him, he had stole it from a Brasier's Shop, in Woodstreet, and had brought it to him (Peartree) on Saturday in the Evening. I told Peartree, it was not in the same Shape, when it was stole. He said, no; it was a whole Bottom when he receiv'd it from Maxwell, but in Order to disguise it, he had cut it to Pieces, and had carried 2 thirds of it to one Trench, a Founder at the 5 Bells in Old-Bedlam, and had said them to him, for 10 Pence Half-penny a Pound. Upon this Information from Peartree , I got a Search-Warrant, and went next Morning to French, who deliver'd me 70 lb. and a half of my Copper. On Thursday Evening Maxwell (as I was inform'd) brought a Barrel of Raisins to Peartree's House, and he was then taken. I was not present at that Time, but I was with him the next Morning before the Lord-Mayor, and heard him desire to be made an Evidence, for others he said were concern'd with him. He (Maxwell) acknowledg'd that he stole the Goods, one Burton (not taken) lent him a Hand up with it, to carry it off. Peartree was present at the Time when Maxwell made this Confession before my Lord-Mayor.</p>

I can't tell the Day of the Month, nor how much Money was paid; but I heard Peartree tell them, he had but 8 Pence a Pound; and some Money (out of this) he allow'd for the Wast of the Copper. I remember this was the same Night that Peartree was stopp'd at Mr. Simm's Peartree is a Brass-Founder himself. - The common Price of Copper is about 10 d. 11 d. or 11 Pence Half-penny per Pound; according to it's Goodness. - The Value of this Copper (I believe) was about 10 Pence Half-penny, or 11 d. a Pound: But as there were some Nails in it. I reckon they made it a Half penny a Pound worse. I did not see the Goods brought in; but I saw the Money paid to Maxwell, by Peartree; and Maxwell told him, he brought it out of Woodstreet; I knew not whose the Goods were, at that Time; but I have since found, they were Mr. Weale's in Woodstreet.</p>

Peartree stood on my right Hand, and said he belong'd to it. Then, says I, I will take Care of you, and the Copper too. This is the Copper, and I swear 'tis Part of my Master's Bottom, which he lost.

The Prisoner was the Man, and no Man else; I am sure of it, for I took particular Notice of him. I fell down with the Blow, and the Prisoner fell upon me. We struggled together, and just as I got from him, he drew my Watch out of my Fob Pocket. I call'd out Thieves! but he ran away with the Watch into the Alley: I pursued him, and made two or three Strokes at him, but he got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160005"/> away, and ran into a House. As I ran down the Alley after him, I cry'd Thieves! Murder! I am robb'd of my Watch! But 2 Women held out their Arms and stopp'd me; I gave one of them a Blow on the Breast and knock'd her down; then I ran past them and followed the Prisoner into the House. As soon as I got in, the Prisoner turn'd himself round, look'd me in the Face, and then laid himself down on a Bed, in the Ground Room. I charged him with taking my Watch, and would have taken him off the Bed, but some Men and Woman (who were in the Room) would not suffer me to take him. The Landlady of the House said, d - mn you, you Son of a Bitch, bring a Guinea or 20 Shillings and you shall have your Watch again To-morrow Morning. Says the Prisoner, (who lay all this while on the Bed) if the poor Man will bring 10 Shillings he shall have it again. I insisted upon having my Watch, or the Prisoner off the Bed, upon which they all fell a thumping me, and knock'd me out of Doors. They would not let me have the Prisoner, but thump'd me and beat me upon the Breast and under the Ribs, and turn'd me out of the House. Then I call'd out for Assistance, and a Soldier coming by, I told him a Thief was gone in there, who had robb'd me of my Watch, and I would give him Half a Crown, if he would call a Constable. Another Soldier came up at the same Time, and bid me give 'em the Money first. I said, I would give them a Crown, as soon as they brought me an Officer, but I did not care to give 'em the Money before-hand. Upon this, they likewise began to thump me about: I told them I believ'd they were all alike, and ran Home to my Wife: She saw I was very much frighted, and upon my telling her what had happen'd, she advised me to go to Mr. Robinson, (my Neighbour) and by his Directions I got a Search-Warrant from Justice Wroth, and went with it that same Night to St.Sepulchre's, where I got a Constable who went with me to the House, and took the Prisoner. I shew'd him likewise, the Woman who bid me bring a Guinea or 20 s. if I would have my Watch again. I did not see the Prisoner when I first went in with the Constable; but upon taking a Candle, and looking round the Room, I found him creeping round a Table, to get to the Door. I am positive I had the Watch in my Fob, when the Prisoner and I struggled together, and I saw it in his Hand, when he ran from me into the Alley. To the best of my Knowledge he put it in his Coat Pocket.</p>

He did not own the Fact himself, but there was a Woman went with us to the Pump Alehouse (who pass'd for the Prisoner's Wife) and she told us, that in case her Husband should not be prosecuted, she would produce Mr. Brown's Watch.

He asked me and my Bedfellow to go with him, to the House, and assist him in taking the Man. We agreed to go with him; but we first went to Mr Robinson, (our Neighbour) and he sent us to Mr Justice Wroth, who order'd us to go that Night, to the Watch-house, and take the Constable with us. When we had got a Constable, Mr Brown carry'd us to the House where we found the Prisoner; and as soon as we got in, Brown said, - this is the Woman that told me I should have my Watch To-morrow Morning, if I would bring her a Guinea, or 20 s.

I made answer again, - what Business had you in Bitches Company? If you have been in Bitches Company, you must take Bitches doings. Then I knock'd at my Door; my Children open'd it, and I went in.

Presently after I heard a Man say, you Bitch where's my Watch? The Woman said, indeed Sir I have not got it; the other Woman has it.

            . I am 17 Years old, the 3d of June; I was at Harrison's House that Night, and heard a Bustling up the Alley, and heard a Man say, he would give half a Crown, and hold my Watch. I heard Women; and by and by I heard the Man say, where's my Watch? A Woman said, indeed I have it not; the other Woman has it. Then they cried out Murder, and the Neighbours came out to see what was the Matter. The Woman that got his Watch, ran away, and the Man ran up and down the Alley, - Where's my Watch! Where's my Watch! I'll give 4 Crown for my Watch! After Mr Harrison came home, I saw the Man; this is he, in his own Hair: He had a whitish caped Coat on.</p>

I and my Friend [Houghton] were drinking that Night at the Castle at Cow-Cross, and as we were coming home thro' Black Boy Alley, we saw this Mr Brown have hold of the Prisoner, between 7 and 8 o'Clock. He said to me, Brother Soldier assist me, I have lost my Watch with two Women, and I believe this is the Man that has got it, but my Comrade and I went home directly, we would not trouble our selves about it.</p>

            . I was with Blake at the same Time; as we were coming thro' Black Boy Alley, we heard a Noise: Blake asked what was the Matter? The Gentleman said, he had been robbed of his Watch by two Women, and he would give us half a Crown to get a Constable, for he believed that Man had got it, and belonged to them: but we went away, and I went to my Lodgings at Westminster. I saw no farther, upon my Word, - if you'll believe me. The Gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160007"/> was a tall Man, with a caped Coat tucked round his Ears, in his own Hair.

            . Between 7 and 8 that Night, I heard a Noise of Women crying out Murder. - I live in Thatched Alley, - I am a Shoemaker. - I heard the Gentleman say, he had been robbed by two Bitches, and two Women. Several Times he expressed himself in that Manner.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you live in the same House with the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Collins. Yes: and I am certain he was in the House, when the Man was robbed. There were several Men and Women too, in the Court, when the Noise of Murder was made. - The Prisoner was three Hours in the House before the Gentleman was robbed. I live one story higher than he. - I was sometimes above Stairs, and sometimes below. - I was in his Company just before the Man was robbed, and heard the Prisoner run out of the House, when he was complaining he had lost his Watch. I am sure the Prisoner was in the House from 4 to 8, when the Outcry was made. - I was below Stairs, and sometimes I was (perhaps) half a Minute, not more, above Stairs. - No: I know nothing of any Wife of the Prisoner's - I was not out of the House all Day, for I was ill of the Tiffick; I sat below at their Fire, because it was cold, and was not above Stairs for above half a Minute.</p>

            . On Sunday Night after Christmas-Day, about 7 or 8 o'Clock at Night, I was going to the Pump Alehouse, for a Pot of Purl. - I live next Door to the Prisoner, in the same Alley, - Thatched Alley. The Prisoner was sitting at the Fire, when I went out for the Purl. I am sure I had been there all the Afternoon, for Elizabeth Carter (the Landlady) and I had join'd for Tea. When I came back with the Purl, I heard Murder cry'd in the Alley, and a Woman ran past me, by the same Token, she dash'd the Pot of Purl out of my Hand. I asked what was the Matter? The Woman that ran past me said, she did not know, and while I was asking about it, the Prisoner came running out of the House. I saw one Woman upon the Ground, and the Prosecutor too, with his Breeches down. I bid him get up, and put up his Breeches, for 'twas very cold. Upon my Word 'tis true: I never took an Oath before, in my Life. The Woman was upon the Ground, and her Cloak, - a dark colour'd Cloak lay upon the Snow. The Prosecutor said, give me my Watch. The Woman upon the Ground said, the other Woman had got it. The Man's Cloaths were all open, &amp;c. and I bid him get up, the Weather was not so hot, that he should lie there in that Manner; and if he wanted a Whore, I bid him go Home to his Wife, for he told us he had a Wife and Children upon Windmill-Hill. I can't tell who the Woman was, who lay upon the Ground, for I did not see her. - No, she got away while the Prosecutor was putting up his Cloaths. - She was none of us, - not one of our Neighbours, as I know of: and I am sure the poor Man at the Bar ran out of the House when Murder was cried, and that the Robbery was committed before he went out to see what was the Matter: for the Prosecutor was at that Time pulling open the Woman's Breast, in a violent Manner; and calling out, - where's my Watch! Upon which I told him the Weather was so cold, that I wanted something warm, and I bid him get up, and not lie there in the Snow. - No; the Man was not quite down upon the Ground; he only had one Knee down, and the other up, and I found him pulling open the Woman's Breast, to see for his Watch.</p>

            , [The Landlady.] The Prisoner at the Bar lodged at my House: he has lived 2 Years with me. On Sunday Evening, before New-Tear's Day, he and I were sitting by my Fire, by ourselves; We sat together 2 Hours before the Outcry was made, and no one interrupted us. No Body came in, for 2 Hours before, - because 'twas very cold, and it snowed very hard. But presently after, I heard Murder cried, very terribly: upon that the Prisoner run out of Doors, and I followed him: and at the Bottom of 2 Steps under Harrison's Window, I saw the Gentleman that made the Noise, in his own Hair, and 2 Women with him. - Whether one of the Women was getting away, or not, I can't tell. But they struggled together; They cried Murder, and be cried, give me my Watch. After I had seen this, I went in again, and sat down by the Fire. I am sure there were 2 Women with him: but People might be passing and re-passing. He stood struggling with the two Women, and I believe he had one of them by the Breast. He was not undressed then, for the Gentlewoman (Oliphant) says, he put up his Breeches before I got out of Doors. I am sure I heard the Consequence of the Thing, and then I ran in Doors again directly, but the Prisoner staid out in the Alley longer. The 2 Women were upright upon their Legs; I did not see any of them on the Ground, for it snowed very hard. I am very sure the Prisoner and I had been together by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160008"/> ourselves, for 2 Hours before the Noise was made. I have Lodgers in the House indeed; there was a Woman suckling a Child, and 2 other Women; but they were all above, up one Pair of Stairs. Collins (a former Witness) lodges up 2 pair of Stairs, and he was above Stairs too. He (Collins) was but a very little Time with the Prisoner and me, below Stairs; he was in his own Apartment, and did not stay above a Minute below Stairs; he only came down, and took a Candle, and then he went up Stairs. He was not above a Minute with us. When the Prosecutor came afterwards with the Constable, he was asked [by the Constable] what he called him out of Bed for, to this poor Postman. - I believe the Prisoner has a Wife, - I do not know. - I do not know where she is.</p>
               <p>The Constable. When I apprehended the Prisoner there was not any Talk of this Kind: there was not one Word of a Squabble with Women. I asked Mr Brown if no Women had been concerned in the Robbery, and he said, no: he had not been in Company with any Women, but that it was the Prisoner alone, who knocked him down and robbed him: and when he charged me with the Prisoner, he (the Prisoner) never mentioned a Syllable of Brown's having complained of being robbed by 2 Women. There was not one Word of this Defence, set up then.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. As to these 2 Soldiers, I cannot say I remember them: but there was a Soldier came up to the Door of the Prisoner's House, and I offered him Money to get a Constable. Another Soldier came up afterwards, and I offered them a Crown, but they pushed me about, and beat me. Carter, the Landlady, (the former Witness) was the very Woman that punched me on the Breast, and said, d - mn you, you Son of a B - ch, bring me a Guinea, or 20 s. and you shall have your Watch, to-morrow Morning.</p>
               <p>Carter, [the Landlady.] Mine being the first Door which was opened in the Alley, the Prosecutor came in, and says he, God bless you, good People, can none of you tell me any Thing of these Women? I will give you 10 s. if you can. I ran to the Door, to the Prosecutor, and said if you would give 10 s. or a Guinea, or ever so much, no one here can tell you any Thing of your Watch. He might as well take away my Life; or any other poor Creature's, as the Prisoner's. He offered 10 s. for his Watch, and I said, if he would give 20 s. or a Guinea, or 10 Guineas, none there could help him to it. My Husband's a Shoemaker, and I have a Child to Nurse, and do what I can to keep the Wolf from the Door.</p>

               <p>Thomas Barnes. On Saturday the 15th of December, about 11 o'Clock at Night the Prisoner came into my House, and called for a Pint of Beer. He sat in the Fore-Room, but he came once or twice into the Kitchen, where Company were drinking out of this three pint Tankard. I saw the Prisoner in the Kitchen myself, but I was called up Stairs to take a Reckoning, and when I came down, the Company were all gone out of the Kitchen, except the Prisoner, and one other Person. The Prisoner threw down three Halfpence for his Pint of Beer; wished me a good Night, and went out. I am positive the Tankard was in the Kitchen when I went up Stairs; and after the Prisoner was gone, I miss'd it, and enquired after it; and suspecting him, I went to his Lodging, but could not find him: so I advertis'd it, and on the Tuesday following Mr Nichols near Aldgate, sent for me; I went to him, and found the Body of my Tankard; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160009"/> Prisoner was in Mr Nichols's Back-Parlour, and seeing the Tankard without the Handle, I asked him what was become of that? He pulled it our of his Pocket, and gave it to me directly. This is the Tankard, and this the Handle, and it has my Mark upon it. I told the Prisoner I was sorry he should be guilty of such an Action; and he fell down on his Knees and asked Forgiveness of me, before Mr Nichols.</p>
               <p>Mr Nichols. The Tankard having been advertised on Monday and Tuesday, and the Prisoner coming to my Shop on Tuesday to offer the Body of the Tankard to Sale, I asked him how he came by it? He bought it (he said) of one he knew very well. I told him, he had best find out the Person he bought it of, else he would come into Trouble. I asked him, what he gave for it? He said, it cost him 20 Shillings. That's worse and worse, said I; for if you buy Things, and don't give the full Value, you will suffer on that Account. He appeared at that Time very genteel; he was well dressed, in a powdered Wig, and white Stockings; but I kept him in my Back-Room, till I sent for Mr Barnes: he owned it, and the Prisoner was detained in the Counter that Night. The next Morning Mr Alderman Westley committed him. He told Mr Barnes he was sorry for what he had done; he hoped he would forgive him, and pulled the Handle of the Tankard out of his Pocket, and gave it to him.

            . I belong to the Cathedral Church of St Paul. I am Sub-Sachristan and Library-Keeper. On the 15th of December in the Morning, when I went to the Church, I missed the Nossels and the Brass Arms from the Branches. Eight Nossels, 8 Cups and Bosses, and a Brass Arm were gone. I asked our Watchman what was become of them? He could not tell; so I went away to Mr Giles, our Founder, and desired him to make Enquiry after them. About an Hour afterward, I heard some of the Things were found, and being produced before my Lord Mayor, I knew them and owned them; and as the Prisoner was carrying to Goal, I asked him for what was wanting? He told me he had sold some of the Brass at the Sign of the Bell in Long-Lane. I went thither, but the Man of the House denied he had bought any such Thing, upon which we carried the Prisoner to him, and then he owned he had bought the Brass of him, and gave us what was wanting.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not take them; they were given me to sell.</p>
               <p>Mr Rowden. He made no such Pretence when we took him; but he acknowledged he concealed himself in the Church all Night, and that he went to work in the Night, and took the Things, which he carried out in the Morning. The Cups screw very tight into the Arms; and one of the Arms he broke off. These are the Goods, and they belong to the Dean and Chapter. <rs id="t17400116-7-verdict42" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Mr Banks. On the 7th of this Instant January at Night, I was going to the upper Part of Moorfields. When I came to Fore-Street, in my way thither, I saw it was half an Hour past 8. When I had passed thro' <placeName id="t17400116-8-crimeloc46">Moor gate</placeName>

                        targets="t17400116-8-off44 t17400116-8-crimeloc46"/>, I stopped to make Water. While I stood against the Wall, the Prisoner came up, and accosted me with such obscene Language, as I believe will be improper to mention in this Place, the Substance of it was, to ask me whether I would lie with her; and at the same Instant, she put one Hand under my Cloaths, and pulled them up to my Stomach, and with the other Hand, she forcibly took my Watch out of my Fob. As soon as ever I had put my Cloaths in order, I pursued her, and took her by the Crown Alehouse; she was carried in there, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160010"/> was searched, but we could not find the Watch. 'Twas a Silver Watch, with a Coat of Arms, and a Motto on it; with a Key and Seal thereto. Mr Spearing assisted me, and the Prisoner was carried to the Counter, for I was positive she took it. I looked to see what a Clock it was, between the Castle Alehouse and the Globe Tavern, and when I stopped to make Water, and took up my Cloaths, the Chain of the Watch, struck against my Hand; after which there was neither Man, Woman, nor Child near me, 'till the Prisoner came up, and took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Time o'Night was it when you saw your Watch?</p>
               <p>Mr. Banks. It was half an Hour past 8.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was it not dark?</p>
               <p>Mr Banks. It was partly Moonlight, and something lighter, by Reason of the Snow, and there was the Light of the Lamps besides. I am positive the Prisoner is the Person who took my Watch. I felt her take it; she hurt me with one of her Hands in taking it; and I felt it slip away; but the Weather had made the Ground so slippery, that I could not run very fast after her; and when I pursued her, she walked faster than I could; else I had laid hold of her sooner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What was said to you by the Person that took your Watch, when she left you?</p>
               <p>Mr Banks. By the Prisoner's attempting to take my Watch, she made me drop one of my Gloves: So I bid her go along, and told her she had made me drop my Glove: upon which she very courteously stooped down to pick it up, and in so doing she took my Watch. I am subject to the Gravel, and could not make Water and lay hold of the Prisoner at the same Time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you tell me when I had given you your Glove, that you had lost your Watch?</p>
               <p>Mr Banks. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had I been in any Company after you lost your Watch?</p>
               <p>Mr Banks. No: She was never out of my Sight, 'till I took her. But I am informed that these Creatures have a very particular way of concealing such Things. She was searched by two Women, and it was not found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How far distant, was the Place where I was searched, from the Place where you lost your Watch?</p>
               <p>Mr Banks. The one was at <placeName id="t17400116-8-crimeloc47">Little Moorgate</placeName>

She did not stoop down till she saw me near her. When I charged her with the Fact, she called me base Man; but I am positive she took it out of my Fob-Pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Last Monday was se'en-night about 2 o'Clock, a Gentlewoman called upon me at my Lodgings in Upper Moorfields, and told me Mrs Bragg had got a Child's Coat for me to make. I cleaned myself, and went with her to Mrs Bragg's in St. Thomas Apostles, about 3. I staid and drank Tea, and after that I staid to Supper, and we had Mutton Chops. At 8 o'Clock I came out to go Home, and Mrs Bragg came with me to Little Moorgate, where I stopped to tie up my Garter, and then the Prosecutor came up and told me he had lost his Watch, and carried me into the Alehouse. There was a Woman in the Bar, and 2 Women were with her, who carried me into a Room and searched me, but found nothing upon me. The Woman of the House, asked him, why he brought me in there? He told them he did not bring me in, but seeing me go in, he followed me.</p>

               <p>Mr Gibbon. On Sunday the 16th of December I was robbed of every Thing mentioned in the Indictment, while I was at Church. I locked my Buroe in the Morning before I went out, and ordered my Servants to go to the Chapel before the Service began. The Prisoner had been my <rs id="t17400116-12-deflabel65" type="occupation">Servant</rs>

I lost 3 Five-Guinea Pieces, 4 Two Guinea Pieces, and above 20 Guineas. Some Pieces of Portugal Gold; a 3 Pound 12 Shilling-Piece in particular, some Crown-pieces and gilt Six-pences, and a Piece of Gold of King Charles the Second, and a Piece of Chrystal cut for a Seal; some Mourning Rings, one pretty remarkable, because it hath not the Age of the deceased. Four of them are in the Indictment, but I lost more. The Prisoner was taken up in Essex, and the Things (taken from him) were described to me by the Constable, and afterwards were shewn me in Chelmsford Goal; when I had seen them, they were sealed up again in my Presence, and are here in Court. Here is a Two-Guinea Piece, which has a Mark on it, whereby I am pretty sure I can distinguish it from another. This Piece of King Charles's I believe is mine; and I verily believe this Guinea is mine. Here is the Ring that wants the Age of the Deceased. This is the Seal, and here is the Impression which I took off about two Years ago. The Prisoner has confessed the Fact, and the next Witness will inform you, the Things were found upon him. They were taken out of my Scrutore in my Study; the Lock of the Scrutore I found broke, and the Spring likewise, (tho' very strong) and part of the Molding that went over the Lock.</p>

The Lock of the Desk had been very much strained; this is the Lock, and here is the Mark of the Instrument, with which it had been opened. Part of the Molding upon the Book-Case was tore off, to get at the Lock, and I reckon it must take up about a Quarter of an Hour, (not much less) in the breaking open.</p>

            . Styles, Pattison and I, on the 18th November, stole nine Pair of worsted Stockings; (some of them had red Clocks, and some of them white) we stole them out of Mr Ridler's Shop-window in Little Suffolk Street, near Great Suffolk Street, in the Haymarket. Styles (being the biggest Man) went into the Shop for a halfpenny worth of blue Thread, and stood before Mr Ridler. I stood at the outside of the Window to watch, and Pattison whipp'd in, and took the Stockings, while Mr Ridler reached down a Bundle of Thread. When Pattison was got out of the Shop with the Stockings, he gave them to me; I had Pattison's great Coat on at that Time, and I clapped them under the left Side of the Coat, and he and I went to the Corner of the next Street, and waited 'till Styles came up to us. Then we all three went to Margaret Ellis's, in Parker's Lane, and went up into her one Pair of Stairs Room: she came up to us there, and bid us 7 s. for them all. While we were talking to her, Styles snatched up four Pair out of the nine, and ran down Stairs with them. Out of what was left, I had three Pair, and Pattison had two. My three Pair I sold to Ellis for 3 s. but Pattison said, he would not sell his at any such Price, he would sooner pawn them. - We all went out with a Design to get what we could get, and seeing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160013"/> these Stockings lie in a Bundle in the Window ready at Hand, we agreed that Styles should go in for a halfpenny worth of Thread, and stand before Mr Ridler, while Pattison whipp'd away the Bundle. Ellis (the Prisoner) knew us before this Time; Pattison and I, lodged in her House, and we used to go out every Night, and what we got we used to carry to her. She knew how we came by the Goods we brought her, and that we had stole these Stockings in particular.</p>
               <p>Pattison. There was no Body in this Robbery but the Evidence (Weblin) and I. We were coming that Night thro' Leicester Fields, and meeting

            . About 10 or 12 Days ago, I bought 12 or 14 Iron Hoops of the Prisoner, and gave him 4 s. and 6 d. for them. I live in Turnmill Street, and Mr Trueman lives in Brick Lane, Spittlefields. I gave a Market Price for them, - a Penny a Pound.</p>
               <p>Mr Trueman. I will give 7 Farthings a Pound for 1000 of them.</p>
               <p>Trott. He brought them to me about 6 or 7 at Night, and they were old Iron Hoops. I have not had great Dealings with him, for I have not seen him above three Times these seven Years.</p>
               <p>Mr Trueman. The Prisoner confessed he took them. Here's his Confession.</p>

            . The Night the Hoops were taken, I saw the Prisoner watching about Mr Trueman's Gate. He looked out at the Wicket, and had the Hoops ready. I saw him, but he did not observe I watched him, so he took the Hoops upon his Shoulder and brought them thro' the Wicket. I followed him thro' the Fields to Shoreditch Church; from thence he went round Hoxton Fields, to the New-River Head, and from thence I followed him to Trott's House. He went in there about 7, and Trott and he came out together, and went to a publick House. I watched them there, and saw Trott take some Money out of his Pocket, and pay it to the Prisoner by the Fire-side. After this, Trott was sent for Home; I watched him thither, and saw another Parcel of Hoops had been brought, and were put in the Scales to be weighed. Then I went and told Mr Trueman, and the Prisoner was carried before Mr Justice Harwood, where he confessed he had taken a Parcel of Hoops, and had sold them for 3 s. and 11 d. He likewise informed us that one of his Fellow Servants stole another Parcel the same Time. Several Persons gave the Prisoner the Character of an industrious Man, and said they never had heard of his being charged with any Dishonesty before. <rs id="t17400116-19-verdict102" type="verdictDescription">

As we were going, the Prisoner met us, and asked the Deceased, if he was not a Rogue to go and work at another Place? The Deceased told the Prisoner he owed him Money, and the Prisoner said the Deceased had robbed him. What have I robbed you of, says the Deceased? I'll tell you said the Prisoner, and immediately he up with his Hand, and struck the Deceased a Blow, and he fell backward, with his Head against some Stone Steps, after which he never stirred. I told the Prisoner he had killed the Man; upon which he ran across the Road, but I followed him, and caught him by the Collar, telling him again, he had killed the Man. The Prisoner said, if I did not let him go, he would serve me in the same Manner: but I brought him back, and he took the Deceased by the Hand, and said he was alive. Upon the Mob's beginning to rise, the Prisoner got away again: I got one of our Men to assist me, and we pursued him to St Giles's. When we came up with the Prisoner, he struck at the Man, and told him he was not a proper Officer; so I ran to get a Constable, and after he had been to view the Deceased, he took charge of the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me knock him down?</p>
               <p>Cheatbam. Yes: He gave him such a Blow on the left Side of the Head, that it might have been heard the Length of this Court. After which he bled very much out of his Nose and Ears.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In what Manner did the Deceased fall?</p>
               <p>Cheatham. The Deceased stood with his Back against the Houses, and the Prisoner stood with his Face towards the Deceased, who fell with his Head upon the Stone Steps. - The Prisoner gave him but one Blow.</p>

            . I was at my Master White's when the Deceased and Cheatham went out together. In two Minutes Time he came back and said, Samuel (the Deceased) was killed, and the Man who killed him was gone down the Road. At Cheatham's Desire, I went down the Road, and passed the Place where the Deceased lay, without looking at him. When I came to the Sign of the Coach and Horses, I saw the Prisoner, and seized him. He made a Punch at me, and said I was not a proper Officer, - I should not hold him. But I held him, and told him he should find me Officer proper enough to do it.</p>

            , Surgeon. On the 21st of December, about two o'Clock, I was sent for to view the Deceased. I found a small Contusion on the left Temporal Muscle. In the Cranium, and between the Membranes of the Brain, and the Cerebellum, there was a large Quantity of coagulated Blood. Upon dividing the Membranes of the Brain, I found about two Ounces more, which I take to have been the immediate Cause of his Death. I am apt to think these Appearances were occasioned more by the Fall than by the Blow; and that the Blow could not have caused so violent a Concussion, as to have produced so much coagulated Blood.</p>

            , Constable. On Wednesday the 19th of December, Cheatham fetched me to the Coach and Horses, to take charge of a Man, who had killed another. I went thither and found the Prisoner; but before I would take charge of him, I went to see the deceased. I found him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160015"/> lying along, with his left Temple bloody. Then I went back to the Prisoner and said, - poor Man, I am sorry to take you into Custody, but I must bring you to Justice, - the Man is dead, - and so I carried him before Colonel De Veil.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The Deceased had robbed me of half a Guinea, and 3 s. and meeting him that Day in Tyburn Road, I told him it was very hard he should rob the Spittal, and use me ill; who had been so good a Friend to him. He said he would pay me at some Rate or other, and desired me not to hurt him. I told him I would not hurt him, but Justice should, and so I endeavoured to lay hold of him, we struggled together, and he struck me twice, and I believe I hit him a Blow in the Face; a Child of 2 Years old might have stood against it, but upon this Blow he slipped down, on the Paved-Stones, and fell with his Head against a Step. I thought the poor Man had been in a Fit; I am as innocent of designing to murder him, as the Child unborn.</p>

               <p>John Threlkeld. I suppose (Gentlemen) I may be admitted to give an Account in full, from the Beginning to the Conclusion of the Fact. It was the 2d of December last. I was in Company with my Spouse, and was returning Home from a Visit at a Relation's House, about 10 o'Clock in the Evening; and turning into <placeName id="t17400116-32-crimeloc155">Swan-Alley</placeName>

They hurried, and whispered, which made me imagine they had some evil Design. My Dame was about 20 or 30 Yards before me, and they passed her, and me too. When I had overtook her, I asked her, if they had offered any Violence to her. She told me, no. I dare say (said I) they are ill-designing Men, and just as I had changed the Words with her, the Prisoner came behind me, (I heard his Step) and he forcibly pulled off my Hat and Wig, and ran cross the Way, and pushed under a Gate-way. He was about 3 Score or a Hundred Yards from me, but 2 Men coming down the said Alley, Passage, or Lane, clapped upon him. It was a Moon-shine-Night, and I never lost Sight of him, from the Time he took my Goods, till he was taken. He had then the same Cloaths on, that he has now, and I am sure<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160016"/> he's the Man. One of the Witnesses took my Hat out of his Hand; the Wig he dropp'd near the Place where he made the Assault; I saw it, and passed it to follow him. But my Hat being taken upon him, I said it was mine, and it was return'd to me. Then we brought him down into a broader Place, and I found he had been bred up in the Neighbourhood, for the People came thronging out of their Houses, and said, - Ah! young Graves! you'll never leave off these Practices! When I heard he had been an old Offender, I was fearful of prosecuting him; some People bid me give him a Kick in the Arse, and let him go, but I could not tell what to do. I am positive he's the Man, I should know him, if it was 7 Years hence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What did I say to you when I was stopped?</p>
               <p>Threlkeld. He said, Indeed, Sir, I took you for one of my Acquaintance: Now this to be sure was very odd, because I cried out stop Thief, several Times, as he was running away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Time o'Night was it.</p>
               <p>Threlkeld. Rather before 10 than after. I was a-bed before 11, and I had near three Quarters of a Mile to go Home.</p>

             perswaded him to prosecute me.</p>
               <p>Threlkeld. As to the Nature of his being apprehended and taken, that may be farther declared, and that the Prisoner has been an Evidence already. I know it from his own Confession, before the Magistrate. He made a Declaration of many Things, which the Justice said he would not take Advantage of. He insisted on being made an Evidence.</p>
               <p>David Nix. I heard a Gentleman about 10 o'Clock at Night cry stop Thief! So I turned my self round, and saw the Prisoner run down the Passage, with a Hat in his Hand; upon which I laid hold of him, and said, Sirrah! I believe you have robbed the Gentleman! I took the Hat from him, and when the Gentleman came up, I asked him, if it was his Hat? He said yes, and he would swear to it. I told him, he might let the Fellow go, now he had got his Goods; but he bid me told him, and I did so, 'till the Mob rose and rescued him from me.</p>
               <p>- Nix. When my Brother Nix laid hold of the Prisoner, he had one Hat on his Head and another in his Hand. I said, Sirrah! this is the Man's Hat. The Prisoner immediately begged for God Almighty's Sake we would let him go, else he was a dead Man. He has been an Evidence before.</p>

I missed them when I came to lay the Cloth for Supper, and enquired if they had not been taken to some of the Gentlemens Chambers, but could not get any Intelligence of them. This Caster I brought up from College with me, to compare with what we had lost. I know it belonged to the College. Dr. Hodges is Provost.

            . On the 11th of December, about 11 at Noon, the Prisoner came to my Shop, in the Parish of Cree-Church, and offered this Caster to Sale; 'tis filed both above and below the Swage. I asked him how he came by it? He said he dealt about the Countries, in Silver and Hard-ware, and that he bought it in Oxfordshire, about 50 Miles off, - at a little Town in Banbury Parish. I asked him who he knew there? But when he found I knew the Country, he would say no more, only that he gave 40 s. for it, and paid a Crown an Ounce. I looked upon the Bottom, and saw the Weight engraved on it, 9 Oz. 3 qrs. Upon this I had him before Sir

            , who committed him, and bound me to prosecute. I intended to have advertised it, but the next Morning I put it in the Fire to try an Experiment, by which we often find out the Marks which have been filed out. When it was red hot, the Place where the Arms of the College had been, was as black as my Hat, and I could plainly perceive, 3 Lyons passant, and Orie-Col. I informed Mr. Robinson of this, and he advised me to write to Sir John<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160017"/> Boyce of Oxon; which I did, and described the Caster. On Saturday following, I received a Letter from Mr. Bentham of Oriel-College, and he wrote me Word, that the College and the World were obliged to me for my Information; that they had lost such a Thing, and that he had wrote to Mr. Noel, of St. Katherine Cree-Church, to wait on me, and take proper Measures for bringing the Criminal to Justice. This Caster which has been sent up, was made at the same Time with the other, and has the same Marks upon it. On my Oath, I believe the Marks, which have been taken out of this Caster, were the same which are upon this, which is produced from the College. The Piercing is the same, and the Date of the Year likewise. After the Prisoner was committed, Mr. Noel and I went to him in Prison, but he would give no Account how he came by it. He told us, he knew well enough what to say when he came on his Trial.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I go about the Countries, and sell Silver Buttons and Hard-ware with a Licence: I bought this Thing of a Man, who seeing I had Silver-Buttons and Tea-Spoons in my Box, he offered me this Caster, and I bought it of him for 50 Shillings.</p>
               <p>Peters. I know nothing of the Prisoner's Character myself; but before I came up, the Provost and Fellows ordered me, before I came up to London, to enquire into his Character of those who knew him; but I could not find any one who would give him a good one. He had left his Shop, and the Town, when I went to enquire after him. <rs id="t17400116-34-verdict165" type="verdictDescription">

            . On Sunday, December 2, about 11 o'Clock at Night, I went to Bed, and left my House safe: when I came down Stairs on Monday Morning about 8, I found the Sash up; the Window-Shutters open about a Nail of a Yard, and a Silver Watch, a Velvet Hood, 3 Shirts, a Cambrick Apron, and a Piece of Pork were gone. I am positive the Sash was down, and the Shutters were close when I went to Bed, but by Accident, the Pin was not put in the Shutters. When I went to Bed, I took the Piece of Pork out of the Cupboard, and put it upon a Corner Table, by Way of Security against the Mice; and the Pork was taken away, but a Silver Spoon, which was in the Dish with the Pork, was left. This made some of my Neighbours suspect the Lad, (the next Witness) because he is near-fighted, and they imagined he either did not see the Spoon, or that it was Silver. When the Boy was taken, he confess'd the Fact, and among the Things taken, he mentioned a Pair of Stockings, which I did not miss, till he told me of them.</p>

They both stood close to the Window to take the Goods in their Aprons. - I have been in Trouble five Weeks about this Affair. - After I was first taken, I made my Escape, and was concealed under the Prisoners Bed for several Days, and then I was retaken. - The Watch (which I took out of a Drawer) and three Shirts I gave Sargeway through the Window, into her Apron. Taverner took the Velvet Hood, and Stockings, and the Piece of Pork, into her Apron. Then I got out through the Window, and went Home with them, and we all went to Bed together, and eat the Pork in Bed, without any Bread. In the Morning Taverner was called up, by one Kelley, to go to BillingsGate, and when she came back, Sargeway tied up three Shirts, two Aprons, the black Velvet Hood, and the Pair of Stockings, in a Handkerchief, and carried them out. When she returned, she said she had pawned them for 6 s. and 6 d. but she would not tell me where she had pledged them. I was left a-Bed, while they went out to pawn these Things, and they gave me 3 s. out of the 6 s. and 6 d. As to the Watch, I told the Prisoners I believed I could sell it; and I carried it to one

               <p>Prisoners. Can you say we went with you to Mrs Backcomb's House?</p>

               <p>Prisoners. How came we to give you 3 s. when you say we had but 6 s. 6 d. among us all?</p>
               <p>Bentley. They told me they could get but 6 s. 6 d. upon the Things, but I believe they got more; for Taverner, when she carry'd them out, had an old dirty blue Cloak on, and in about 2 Hours after she had pawn'd them, she had got a good whitish Cloak, and new Stockings on.</p>
               <p>Taverner. I know nothing of the Robbery. I went to Bed that Night about 9 o'Clock, and got up about 5 in the Morning, to go to Billingsgate for Fish, as I used to do. When I came Home again, there was a Hubbub, about the Boy (Bentley's) being found in the Room. We had no Lock to our Door, and any Body might get into the Room.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bockcomb. She says there was no Lock to the Prisoner's Room: When I went thither, I desired the Prisoners to let me go in, and search the Room. Taverner gave me 2 Keys, but neither of them would open the Door, upon which, my Servant got a Story-Ladder, and went in at the Window; then he opened the Door, but they found nothing, except the Pork-bones, which I believe were mine, - they were like mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Was you in the Room yourself?</p>
               <p>Backcomb. No.</p>
               <p>Sargeway. Before we should have taken the 3 Shirts to have pawned, surely we should have pawned the Watch; - He is a Boy that has robb'd all the Neighbourhood. They gave him a little Victuals out of Charity, at Mr. Russel's where I wash, and he said there, he would hang his Father and Mother, before he would be hanged himself.

[The Witness recounted the Things in the Bundle, and named the Proprietors.] Mrs. Hibbin not knowing what was become of them, I advertised them, in the News-Papers; after which the 2 Prisoners were taken, and one of the Shirts which I had lost, [and was Mr. Cartwright's] was taken upon Eakins's Back; it was taken off, before the Justice, and Madam Cartwright own'd it, I knew it by the Mark I put on it before I put it into the Wash. Since this, we have found several other Things, which I know were in the Bundle, when it was taken away. Here's a Pair of Sheets, but I can't be so positive to them, as I am to this Table-Cloth.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cartwright. I can swear to the Sheets.</p>
               <p>Eakins. I would ask her, if she did not say she could not swear to the Shirt, that was found upon me?</p>
               <p>Harold. I said I could not swear to a Shirt upon a Man's Back; but when it was pulled off, I saw my red Mark on it, and was positive to it.</p>
               <p>Brown. I would ask her, whether she can swear to the Shirt which was taken off my Back?</p>

            . I was in Mrs. Hibbin's Shop when the Prisoner Brown came in and asked for a Pair of Garters; (she keeps a Haberdasher's Shop.) I shewed him some Garters, and asked him 6 d. for a Pair; He bid me 3 Pence for them, which I told him I could not take. Then, says he, give me a Penny-worth of black Worsted. I gave it him, and he threw the Penny behind the Counter, and I took the Candle and stooped down to look for the Money. When I got up, the Bundle was gone. I saw no Person in the Shop, but Brown, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160019"/> told me, while I was looking for the Money, that one of the Half-pence was this Way, and the other, was that Way; so while I was looking for them the Bundle was taken.</p>

            . One Harris, and Proctor being taken up, and sent to the New Goal, Harris informed us of this Robbery, and said he believed if we took the Prisoners soon, we should find two of the Shirts upon their Backs. We took them both, and the Shirt upon Eakins was own'd, but that upon Brown, was not sworn to. They each of them desired to be admitted an Evidence, and Brown said if the Favour was granted him, he would tell where all the rest of the Linnen was. Accordingly by his Directions, we found the Sheets, and the Table-cloth.</p>
               <p>Brown. He knew I was a misfortunate Man before, and so he asked me to turn Evidence, but I told him I knew nothing of the Matter. Pray was there any Evidence against us when we were taken?</p>

But when I came against my own Door, I saw it open, and upon that I went cross the Way, and upon going into my House, I found the Kitchen Door open, and I had not gone above two or three Steps into the Kitchen, before the Prisoner ran against me. I laid hold of him by the Collar, and asked him what he did there, but I was so surprized, that I can't tell what Answer he made. He struck me, and I struck him, and we were both down on the Ground together in the Kitchen. He pulled from me, to get out of Doors, and he got into the Entry; I cried out, and threw him down again: after which he got to the Street Door, and the Neighbours heard me make a Noise. I tore his Cloaths sadly, - that I did, and I threw him down in the Street, when the People came to assist me, and secured him. After he was in hold, I went Home to see what was missing, and I soon saw a Shirt of mine was gone, and some Pieces of Camblet belonging to

About Six, I met Mr. Curd in Bishopsgate-Street, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160020"/> told me he would meet me at Mr. Boocay's at the Two Fighting Cocks at Stepney. I went thither and heard, that Mr. Gates's Son had broke open a House. I did not know whose House had been broke, but I saw the Prisoner sitting in the House bald pated. I asked Mr. Boocay when he saw Mr. Curd? Why don't you go over the Way to him, says he, for 'tis his House that has been broke open, and his Wife is abroad? I ran over to him, and found a Hat upon the Table in the Kitchen: then I went to Mr. Boocay's again, and asked the Prisoner if he had no Accomplices with him? If no body stood at the Door, to watch, while he went into the Back-kitchen? He insisted upon it that no one was with him, and upon our asking him how he opened the Door, he said he opened it with one of the Keys which he had about him. I asked him, if he had any one to receive the Goods? He told us no, he intended to have carried them to pawn. As we were carrying him to the Watch-house, he desired me to speak to Mr. Curd to be easy with him, and he promised me, he would go aboard of a Ship the next Day.</p>

            . I live in Mr. Curd's House, and have a Key to the Door. I went out after Mr Curd's Man, and I am sure I locked the Door after me. When it was Candle-light, I came home to shut up my Windows. I found the Door locked, and I went out again and fastened it.</p>

I happened to be coming past Mr. Curd's Door that Night, and he jumped off the Threshold of the Door, and pulled me into his House, and said, - You Rogue, you have broke open my House. Master, says I, what's the Matter! So we struggled together, and tumbled about, 'till People came and carried me to Mr. Boocay's, where I was search'd, and nothing was found upon me, but my own Keys, which were to sit to the Street-Door, the Kitchen-Door, and the Garret-Door, in my own House.</p>

I stood still, and saw him pick out five or six. And in the Space of 10 Minutes, he had got out 17 Nails, and had taken off this Brass Top, from one of the Corners of the Coach. This Nail, and this Top, I found in his Pocket, and I am sure they are Mrs. Floyd's, and belong to her Coach; the rest he slung away when I laid hold of him, and at the same Time, he cut me across this Hand with his Knife, in such a Manner, that I thought I should never more have had the Use of it. <rs id="t17400116-42-verdict198" type="verdictDescription">

            . On the 24th of December last, between five and six at Night, my Master Williams went out to drink Tea with Mrs. Sumner, and he bid me take Care of the Shop: So as I was walking in the Shop, I saw a poor-looking Woman in the Back-Shop, and I heard the Prisoner (who was employed to mend up some of the Goods) say, - Stand back! here's my Master! Hearing those Words, I stopp'd to one of our Shop-Doors, next Monmouth-Street, to watch what they were doing, and I observed the Prisoner to slide something off to the Woman, and she took it under her Apron, and went away.

He followed me out into the Street, and four Doors beyond my Master's House, I saw the Woman (who came out of our Back-Shop) slip something from under her Apron, to another Woman. Upon this I bid Kit lay hold of one of them, and I seized the other. He turned his Woman's Riding-hood on one Side and I took a Scarlet Broad-Cloth Coat from her. Says I, this is the Coat I saw Jewster (the Prisoner) slide to the Woman in the Back-Shop, therefore carry the Women to the Alehouse, and keep them there, while I get a Constable, and call my Master. Mr. Williams (my Master) thought proper to go Home, and examine the Prisoner. He asked him, in my Presence, what he had done? He said, he had done nothing at all. I am perswaded you have, pray what Woman was that who was with you? He insisted upon it he had done nothing, and that he had not seen any Woman that Night. Upon this I went to the Porter, and brought him and the two Women to the Shop; and the Woman upon whom the Coat was found, proved to be one Catberine Sommers, the Prisoner's Landlady, and the other was his Wife. Sommers told us, the Prisoner owed her half a Year's Rent, and that his Wife had given her the Coat in Part of Payment. Upon this he was carried before Colonel De Veil, who committed him.</p>

At last they would go to half a Crown if they liked them. I reached down a Bundle, but they did not fancy the Colour; they must be lighter, and I must shew them some of 2 s. 3 d. While I turned my Head to look for another Bundle, they whipped 2 Stockings out of the Paper, and one off the Line in the Window. The odd Stocking I missed directly, and desired it might be found. O (they said), I should find it by and bye, and bid me look behind the Counter; but upon my making Words with them,

Fortune, (who was an Orphan, and under the Care of the City) he took a Lodging at the House of one Mrs. Immin's, in Winchester-street, where this young Gentlewoman lived with her Grand-mother, Mrs. Graves. When he had lodged here some Time, he took a Lodging in Throckmorton-Street, that when he had accomplished his Ends, he might have a Place to carry her to. That the Defendant in a little Time, by the Assistance of a Servant in the House, got the Lady away, marry'd her, and then carry'd her to Throckmorton Street, and has had the Custody of her ever since, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Couns. Pris. The Expression - [a second Marriage] is not so very proper, but we admit the Marriage with this young Lady, [ Mrs Keep]. It was likewise insisted upon, by the Counsel, in Behalf of the Defendant, that if they should produce a Fleet-Register, [with Relation to the first Woman] it would not be a legal Register, and so would be no Register at all. That Cohabitation was no Proof of a Marriage, not would a Fleet-Register, (if it should be brought) be sufficient to convict a Man of Felony, since even in a Civil Action it would not be allow'd without other Proof. And that, in case of a Felony, it has always been insisted upon, that positive Proof be given of the first Marriage.</p>
               <p>It was farther observed, that giving Evidence of a Cohabitation, before they had prov'd a first Marriage, is like felling a Tree at the Top. And tho' a Man's cohabiting with a Woman in an odd way, is a Crime not to be encouraged, yet it won't prove him guilty of Felony under this Act of Parliament. It was likewise urged, that the Register of a Parish is by Law an Authentick Register, and might be produced as legal Evidence, but where a Clergyman, un-authorized by Law, shall please to set up, in the Fleet, for himself, and who for Half-a-Crown will put any one's Name in his Register, it would be hard if such a Person or his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160024"/> Register, should have the Sanction of a Court of justice.</p>

             the Clergyman. He has been dead some Years.</p>
               <p>Couns. Produce the Register-Book he kept.</p>
               <p>Barret. I can produce some of the Books, but not all. The Book I am called here to produce, is not in my keeping, - 'tis not my Book, but another Person's; I never had it in my keeping. I live in Fleet-Lane, but the Book this Marriage is in, belongs to Mr Cox, at the Hand and Pen at the Ditch side. I saw this Book at his House about 2 Months ago, and never have seen it since.</p>
               <p>Couns. Do you know what's become of this Book ?</p>
               <p>Barret. No: I was at Mr Cox's (he is Clerk) at the Hand and Pen about 2 Months ago, and he told me he was going out, and expected some People to come to search that Book, so he left it upon the Table, and ordered me not to let them search, unless they paid me first. Accordingly 2 Gentlemen came to search, and after they had done, I put the Book into the Beauset, and have never seen at since.</p>
               <p>Couns. Don't you know where the Book is?</p>
               <p>Barret. No, I don't, upon my Word, - upon my Oath I do not.</p>
               <p>Couns. Has no Body apply'd to you about this Book?</p>
               <p>Barret. No.</p>
               <p>Couns. Recollect yourself, - has no Body apply'd to you, to have this Book from you?</p>
               <p>Barret. No, Sir, indeed: nor can I tell where the Book is.</p>
               <p>Couns. What Books are they which you have got with you?</p>
               <p>Barret. They are the Registers of my Husband's Marriages: I can't give any Account of the other Book.</p>
               <p>Couns. Who were the Gentlemen that came to search the Book which we want?</p>
               <p>Barret. I can't tell; but there was two Gentlemen came to me to enquire about the Book, in which was the Marriage with Mary Gardiner.</p>
               <p>Couns. You mention a particular Book; what Entry was it they came to see?</p>
               <p>Barret. They came to search for an Entry, on such a Day, and they were scrupulous about paying; at last one of them said he would pay; after which they search'd, and said they had found it.</p>
               <p>Couns. What did he say he had found?</p>
               <p>Barret. He said he had found the Name he wanted; but he did not mention what the Name was.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did not you tell the Gentlemen who came to search, that the Book was your's, and that you had bought it?</p>
               <p>Barret. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Couns. So, you say, you don't know what's become of that Book?</p>
               <p>Barret. No: I put it where I found it, and have never seen it since that Time. It was Mr Cox's Book at that Time; but he is dead, and it went to his Widow: She has since sold it to other Persons, and I know not who they are. When those Gentlemen came to look at it, it was left upon the Table at the Hand and Pen, and I was desired to stay by the Book, till the Gentlemen came. They came and search'd it, after which I put it into the Beaufet; since which it has never been seen at all.</p>

            . I am a House-keeper in St. Andrew's Parish: I live by the Fleet-Market now, but for two Years last past, I kept a House in St. Sepulchre's Parish.</p>
               <p>Couns. Do you know the Prisoner, Hurnell?</p>
               <p>Carrol. Yes. - About two Months before last Christmas was twelve Months, he came and looked at a Room, and said he would send a Gentlewoman, in a Day or two, to see it, and agree for it. The Gentlewoman came, and took the Room, and gave me Earnest for it.</p>
               <p>Couns. How long did he and she remain at your House?</p>
               <p>Carrol. 'Till about a Week before last Christmas.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did the Gentlewoman and he lie together at your House, during that Time; and did you imagine they were Man and Wife?</p>
               <p>Carrol. I gave Receipts for the Rent in his Name.</p>
               <p>Couns. Mind what you are ask'd. I ask you whether you have heard him call her his Wife, or make Use of such Expressions, as made you ima gine she was his Wife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You are upon your Oath.</p>
               <p>Carrol. He used her in a very handsome Manner.</p>
               <p>Couns. But when he has been speaking of her to you, or in your Family, in what Manner has it been? How has he spoke of her?</p>
               <p>Carrol. He and I never changed five Words together, all the Time he was in the House. He went up Stairs, and came down, that's all.</p>
               <p>Couns. Though you might not have exchanged many Words, yet I ask you, if you have not heard him declare any Thing about this Gentlewoman?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160025"/>Carrol. I never heard any Body come to ask for him; but People have ask'd for her.</p>
               <p>Couns. We are a little unfortunate, that we have not the most ready, willing Witnesses in the World. -</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They are your own Witnesses.</p>
               <p>Couns. But I wish some others have not had Dealings with them. I ask you whether they lay at your House?</p>
               <p>Carrol. It was backward and forward, - I can't be positive about it.</p>
               <p>Couns. Consider you are upon your Oath, and you must give fair Answers.</p>
               <p>Carrol. Why they pass'd for Man and Wife, and went in one another's Name. I know no otherwise.</p>
               <p>Couns. I ask you whether or no, during the Time they were at your House, you never heard him own her to be his Wife?</p>
               <p>Carrol. He has ask'd for her by the Name of Mrs Arnol.</p>
               <p>Couns. Speak distinctly.</p>
               <p>Carrol. He said Arnol, to the best of my Knowledge. I can say no more.</p>
               <p>Couns. But you can speak distinctly if you will.</p>
               <p>Carrol. He ask'd for her by the Way of Arnol.</p>
               <p>Couns. Why what's the Prisoner's Name.</p>
               <p>Carrol. Arnol.</p>
               <p>Couns. Well, I see here's a bad Pronunciation, as well as a bad Witness. - Has he ask'd for her by the same Name he himself went by?</p>
               <p>Carrol. I say he has not ask'd for her above once, to the best of my Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Couns. But I ask you, whether he has not ask'd for her by the same Name he went by?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Consider you're upon your Oath.</p>
               <p>Carrol. Why I have receiv'd Letters for Mr Arnol, I never had any Body to ask after him.</p>
               <p>Couns. You have heard him ask for her by the Name of Arnol, and you pronounce his Name in the same Manner. Was that the Name he went by?</p>
               <p>Carrol. She went by the same Name which he went by.</p>
               <p>Couns. And you say they lived at your House, 'till within two Months before last Christmas was Twelve-Months; now I ask you, whether she had not one or more Children at your House?</p>
               <p>Carrol. She had one: but I don't know whether it was a Boy or a Girl.</p>
               <p>Couns. I hope this Child was Christen'd.</p>
               <p>Carrol. But I did not see it christen'd, so I am not a Judge.</p>
               <p>Couns. I ask you upon your Oath, if you did not know the Child was christen'd?</p>
               <p>Carrol. I did not see it christened; I don't know any Thing of it.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did it die at your House?</p>
               <p>Carrol. Yes; to my Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Couns. Perhaps you might be at the I uner' tho' not at the Christening.</p>
               <p>Carrol. No, I was at neither.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did you see the Coffin?</p>
               <p>Carrol. I saw the Child.</p>
               <p>Couns. But I ask you if you saw the Coffin?</p>
               <p>Carrol. I can't say I did.</p>
               <p>Couns. Can you say, you did not?</p>
               <p>Carrol. I don't know, to the best of my Knowledge that I did.</p>
               <p>Couns. How long did it live?</p>
               <p>Carrol. Upon my Word I can't tell. I was not in the Room above half a dozen Times during their living at my House.</p>
               <p>Couns. Why Man, can't you tell whether it lived two or three Months, or but two or three Days?</p>
               <p>Carrol. I can't tell indeed.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did any Persons attend it, in its Illness, as an Apothecary, or a Physician?</p>
               <p>Carrol. Yes; there was an Apothecary, and a Physician came in his Chariot: but I don't know his Name.</p>
               <p>Couns. Do you know it if you hear it? Was the Apothecary's Name Avery?</p>
               <p>Carrol. I can't tell indeed; I did not hear it mentioned, nor the Doctor's Name neither. The Doctor came to Mrs Arnol, I see him come four or five Times.</p>
               <p>Couns. Do you know the Midwife's Name?</p>
               <p>Carrol. No, nor the Nurse's neither. I never asked them their Names, and how should I know their Names, when I never asked them.</p>

               <p>Couns. When they went from your House, do you know whether they went?</p>
               <p>Carrol. I can't tell. I know nothing at all of it, 'till the Day she paid me, and then she said, she was going to the other End of the Town, to live nearer at Hand with her Spouse: but he was not present at that Time.</p>
               <p>Couns. Had you no Conversation with him about leaving your House?</p>
               <p>Carrol. Not till afterwards. Mr Arnol came to our House afterwards, and we had two or three Words together; I told him Mrs Arnol had not given me proper Warning, and that I expected a Quarter's Rent, if I should not let the Room - I am very ingenuous, - he said, he had given her Money to pay for the Quarter that was passed. -</p>
               <p>Couns. Who did he say he had given the Money to?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160026"/>Carrol. ToMrs Arnol. He did not mention a Word more, but only that he had given her Money for the Quarter which was due, and which was to come. - Her Name was not then mentioned.</p>
               <p>Couns. Why who did you talk of?</p>
               <p>Carrol. I mentioned the Name [Mrs. Arnol] to him, and said I had given Mrs Arnol a Receipt for 1 l. 2 s. and 6 d. due at Christmas I gave the Receipts in the Name of

               <p>Couns. Did any Friends or Acquaintance come to her at your House?</p>
               <p>Carrol. When People came, they enquired for Mrs. Arnol.</p>
               <p>Couns. I ask you, whether during the whole Time they were at your House, she did not go by the Name of Hurnell?</p>
               <p>Carrol. She always went by that Name, and Letters were directed to her in that Name. I took them to be Man and Wife all the Time they were at our House. They had a two Pair of Stairs Floor: there was a Closet for a Bed, and a little Parlour: there was every Thing very handsome. There was but one Bed, and she used to lie there constantly.</p>
               <p>Couns. And did not the Prisoner lie there?</p>
               <p>Carrol. He came backward and forward; I can't say he lay there constantly; but I have seen him go out in the Morning, and come home o'Nights.</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery. I am an Apothecary, and knew the Woman that lived at this Carrol's House, when she went by the Name of Gardiner. I have known her seven Years. While she lived at Carrol's I visited her. She was ill, and had an Inflammation of the Bowels, and lay-in, in the Interim.</p>
               <p>Couns. Have you frequently visited her there?</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery. Never as an Apothecary before that Time. I have visited her since, and my Wife has likewise. I was Godfather to the last Child she had at Carrol's House, - it was a Girl.</p>
               <p>Couns. I ask you what Name the Prisoner at the Bar called her by? And what Declarations you have heard him make?</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery. I can say nothing to that. Mrs Hurnell requested of me to stand Godfather.</p>
               <p>Couns. Was not the Prisoner present?</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery. No; but he was there a little before.</p>
               <p>Couns. Was he present at the Christening?</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery. No; he was not; but it was with his Privity that I stood Godfather, because the Question was put to me, and she told him, I was to stand Godfather to the Child. I knew her when she went by the Name of Gardiner, and ever since I have known her, she has born the Character of a very vertuous, good Woman.</p>
               <p>Couns. Were there any Prescriptions wrote for her in her Illness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery. Yes, and Dr. Morley was the Physician: his Prescriptions were for her, in the Name of Mrs. Hurnell, with this only Difference, her Name with an E, instead of an U.</p>
               <p>Couns. Was you paid for these Prescriptions?</p>
               <p>Avery. Yes; Mrs. Hurnell paid me, and I gave a Receipt in his Name, to her.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did you and your Wife visit her?</p>
               <p>Avery. Yes, and she visited us; and since this Affair he has been at out House.</p>
               <p>Couns. On what Errand did he come?</p>
               <p>Avery. It was last Saturday was a Fortnight; he came and put the Question to me as thus. To ask me if I knew any Thing of Mrs. Gardiner? I told him, I did not. He said he had been at Mr. Elliot's, who is a Relation of Mrs Hurnell's, and had enquired after her, but could not hear any Thing of her; so he asked me, if I could tell any Thing of her? I said I could not.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did not the Prisoner, when you visited her, ask you how she did? By what Name did he mention her?</p>
               <p>Avery. He has asked me in what Manner I found her, - or how she was ill, but never by any Name: tho' I always took it, that he meaned his Wife. I have called her by the Name of Mrs. Hurnell, to him, and he has never contradicted it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Avery. I know the Prisoner, Thomas Hurnell, and have visited Mrs. Hurnell, his Wife (as I took her to be) when she lodged at Carrol's House.</p>
               <p>Couns. Give your Reasons why you took them to be Man and Wife?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Avery. Because they always seemed to live together as Man and Wife, and she said, he was her Husband.</p>

               <p>Couns. Have you ever heard him say any Thing like that?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Avery. I never heard him say any Thing at all. I never saw him in his Room, but twice in my Life.</p>
               <p>Couns. Was you at the Christening of any of their Children?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Avery. No: nor at any of her Children's Funerals.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did they ever visit you?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Avery. Mrs. Hurnell often did.</p>
               <p>Couns. How was their Way of Living understood in the Neighbourhood?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Avery. I never heard that any one took them for any other, but Man and Wife: and I knew a pretty many of their Acquaintance too.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160027"/>Couns. Has not the Prisoner applied to you lately? On what Occasion?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Avery. About a Fortnight or three Weeks ago, he came to our House, and asked if Mrs. Gardiner was there? I told him, I did not know who he meant: is she not your Wife? He said, No, and asked me if she had paid my Husband. I told him, I believed she had. Because, said he, if she has, I desire your Husband not to trust her any more, in my Name, but on her own Account, for she is not my Wife. I was but very little acquainted with him before this, but I was acquainted with Mrs. Hurnell some Years before, and since she was married. She went by the Name of Gardiner before, and was a very modest Woman, as any one would say that was to see her. She was a sober, modest, fedate Woman, and I never heard otherwise:</p>
               <p>Couns. Do you know of any Children being born?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Avery. Yes, two: and I took them to be Mr. Hurnell's, they are both dead. One of them I saw, and as sine a Boy it was, as ever I saw in my Life.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did you see the Coffin?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Avery. No, neither of them. It was the first Child which I saw; it was brought to my House by 2 Nurses and the Mother to shew me.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did you know any Thing of her after she left Carrol's House?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Avery. Yes, for in her deplorable Trouble, she came to give me an Account of it.</p>

               <p>Couns. You call her Mrs. Hurnell, how came you to call her by that Name?</p>
               <p>Newbury. She came to me by that Name, when she was with Child, and directed me to enquire for her by that Name.</p>

               <p>Newbury. Yes, several Times during her Indisposition, and he always treated her, in a very handsome, tender Manner, - as Gentlemen treat their Wives.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did he call her by any particular Name?</p>

            . I know the Person whom they formerly called Mary Gardiner, but I did not know her by that Name. I kept her when she lay-in by the Prisoner, at Carrol's House. I know the Prisoner (Hurnell) very well: he used to come sometimes three Times a Day to visit her.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did he call her by any particular Name?</p>
               <p>Ayres. I can't say that: but he would come and say, - how does she do now? He never called her by any Name, nor do I remember he ever called her his Wife; but he gave me a great Charge to take care of her, and one Night, he gave me a particular Charge about her. I know she went by his Name.</p>
               <p>Couns. Do you remember the Funeral of the Child?</p>
               <p>Ayres. Yes; I ordered the Coffin myself. It was a Girl, and I went to the Undertaker's and ordered the Name Anne Hurnell to be put upon it. This was the second Child: the first I know nothing of.</p>

            ; I know the Prisoner: he came himself to see a Room at our House: I had not Opportunity to shew him the Room he afterwards had, but my Husband shewed him a lower Room of the same fort. About three Days afterwards, Mrs Hurnell and a Relation of her's came and took it, I think it was the 3d of November. last was 12 Months. It was one Apartment, only there was a Place for a Bed in it.</p>
               <p>Couns. Who lay in it?</p>
               <p>Carrol. It was for two Persons, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did you ever see the Prisoner a-bed?</p>
               <p>Carrol. No: but he used to come in almost every Night, between 7 and 8.</p>
               <p>Couns. Have you seen him go away again o' Nights.</p>
               <p>Carrol. I can't say I ever saw him go away again o'Nights; but I think I saw him once go away in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Couns. By what Name did he call her? Or how did he address himself to her?</p>
               <p>Carrol. I can't say he ever asked for her as he went up, or down, our Apartment lies so, that we seldom saw one another.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did he come Home, and ask for her when she was abroad?</p>
               <p>Carrol No. The Morning she was brought to Bed, I met him coming up Stairs, and he said, - pray how does my Wife do! I told him, she was more likely to die than to live. This was when she lay in of the last Child, which was a Girl. I never heard him call her Wife, but that Time. Visitors indeed have asked for her by the Name<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160028"/> of Hurnell. and Letters out of the Country have been cirected to her, in that Name.</p>

            . I know the Prisoner; Mrs. Hurnell his Wife, is a Neice of mine: her Maiden Name was Mary Gardiner. Before the Prisoner and she were marry'd she lodged with me, and Mr. Hurnell visited her, every Night, with a great deal of Respect. Soon after they were marry'd, I was taken ill, so I sent for her to come and be with me. -</p>
               <p>Couns. Do you know that they were marry'd?</p>
               <p>Pitts. She declar'd they were marry'd, and I saw him soon after I understood they were marry'd, and I wish'd him Joy of his Wife; he accepted it, and bowed and thanked me. This was about last Michaelmas was 3 Years. I was telling you, she was with me, while I was ill, and the Nights she did not stay with me, he always came and fetch'd her Home.</p>
               <p>Couns. Well, pray what did he use to call her?</p>
               <p>Pitts. I can't say I ever heard him call her any Thing, but Polly and my Dear.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did you use to visit them?</p>
               <p>Pitts. Yes; I visited them as Man and Wife; they cohabited together, and I believed them to be Man and Wife. I judged so from his Behaviour, for he seemed to be very tender of her.</p>
               <p>Couns. You are related to her, pray has she any Sisters?</p>
               <p>Pitts. Yes, 2 or 3, but I never saw any of them in the Prisoner's Company: She has a Mother likewise, but she lives at Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Powel. I know the Prisoner, and likewise Mrs. Hurnell. I have known Him, ever since he was marry'd to Mrs. Hurnell, or Mrs. Gardiner. I always thought they were marry'd, and they always appeared as Man and Wife.</p>
               <p>Couns. Have you ever heard him call her his Wife?</p>
               <p>Powel. I never heard him call her Wife; he used to call her Polly, and My Dear. They always behaved well, and he always used her like a Gentleman. I visited them very often after the Marriage, and always took her to be his Wife.</p>
               <p>The Counsel for the Prosecution were about to prove, that this Mrs. Hurnell [or Gardiner] was now living, but the Counsel for the Prisoner admitted it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am innocent of the Fact they charge me with.</p>

            . I live in Greville-Street, Hatton-Garden, and am a Peruke-Maker, I know both the Prisoner, and Mary Gardiner; she lodg'd near two Years in my House, and during that Time, I did not take her to be any Man's Wife. She came to live at my House about October or November, in the Year 1736, and continued there about two Years; in all which Time I had no Reason to believe she was marry'd to the Prisoner, nor did he ever call her any Thing but Gardiner, nor did I ever hear any one in the House call her any Thing else. The Prisoner used to come after her, and ask for her by the Name of Gardiner, and by that Name he had Admittance to her. She never pretended to me, nor to any one in my Hearing, that she was marry'd.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did you never see any Letters, which were directed to her at your House, by the Name of Hurnell?</p>
               <p>Watts. I never saw any.</p>
               <p>Couns. And was she never call'd by the Name of Hurnell at your House?</p>
               <p>Watts. There was some few People came after her, and ask'd for one Mrs. Hurnell, who lodged up two Pair of Stairs, and I told them I knew no such Person, - but there was one Mrs. Gardiner, I told them. I afterward told the Prisoner of this, and he seemed surpriz'd, and charged me, if any People came to ask for her by that Name, to tell them there was no such Person liv'd there. He was surpriz'd when I told him People ask'd for her by the Name of Hurnell.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did none of their Relations come to visit them, as Man and Wife?</p>
               <p>Watts. Never as Man and Wife: they never kept a Table together as Man and Wife, nor did they ever talk of going to visit Relations.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did not the Prisoner lodge there too?</p>
               <p>Watts. No.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did he never lodge there?</p>
               <p>Watts. I don't know that he did. - I believe he may have lodg'd there all Night, but upon my Oath I never saw them together.</p>
               <p>Couns. Why did she not lie-in at your House?</p>
               <p>Watts. I believe she did; but I don't know who visited her: Mr. Hurnell visited her then, as he did at other Times, and ask'd for her by the Name of Gardiner.</p>
               <p>Couns. So tho' you did not take her for a marry'd Woman, yet you permitted her to stay at your House, and Hurnell to visit her.</p>
               <p>Watts. Why, indeed, I did not take her to be a marry'd Woman, for Mr Hurnell told me he had Lodgings at an Apothecary's behind the Change. He was my Customer, and I have sent my Man there for his Wig. 'Twas at one Mr Maddox's in Throgmorton-Street. I am far from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160029"/> thinking she was his Wife; if she had been so, I believe I should have known it.</p>

            . I was Mr Watt's Journeyman; and remember Mary Gardiner's lodging at our House. I liv'd with Watts above twenty Months; I came to him in April, - I can't tell the Year; and it is about a Twelve-month ago since I left his Service, in December. She had liv'd there before I came, and was in the House while I continued with Watts; but she went away about a Fortnight or three Weeks before me. During this Time, she went by the Name of Gardiner, and no other, as I know of. Mr Hurnell is a Customer of my Master's; I never took her to be his Wife; it was never suspected she was so, but always to the contrary. If she had been his Wife, I should have known it. - She was always enquired for by the Name of Gardiner.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Cooper. I had a Child to nurse, from Mrs Gardiner, in the Name of Mary Gardiner. I had it 8 Months, and it has been dead a Year, and as much as since last Hay-time. It was christened by the Name of William Gardiner.</p>
               <p>Mr Cooper. I knew Mrs. Gardiner when we took the Child to nurse. My Wife received it by the Name of William Gardiner. I was at the Christening, and stood Godfather; it was baptized by the Name of William Gardiner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ingram. This is the Register-Book of Aldersgate Parish. I believe there is an Entry made of the Christening of a Child of Mary Gardiner, on the 4th of January 1737. The Child was baptized at our Church, on Sunday after Afternoon Sermon. I could not tell whether the Name was Garner, or Gardiner, so I entered it into the Book by the Name of William Garner. The Entry was read. '' Register of all the Marriages, Christen. '' ings and Burials, in St Butolph Aldersgate. '' Christenings, January 1737. Jan. 4. William, '' Son of William and Mary Garner.</p>
               <p>Mr Cooper. The Child was brought from our House at Walthamslow, to their Lodging in Greville-street, and was christened in Aldersgate Church, by the Name of William.

They asked us for our Money, and took 7 Shillings from me. The Henley Stage-Coach was robbed just before us, but what they took from thence I can't tell. I can't swear to the Prisoners, because they had Paper-Masks on their Faces; but 2 Gentlemen's Servants being hunting on the Heath, I sent them after the Men who had robbed us, and the 2 Prisoners were taken, and they say, they are the same Men.</p>
               <p>Snowd. What Sort of Cloaths had the Men on who robbed you?</p>
               <p>Hull. One had a white Coat on, and the other a brown one. Snowd (I take it) was in the white Coat, and Wells in the brown. I kept them in Sight about 10 Minutes, and sent these Men after them; but I did not keep them in View till they were taken; most part of the Time I did, and saw that one of them was on a brown Horse, and the other on a grey Gelding. There were other Coaches behind us, 4 (I believe) in all, and I saw them go to them. The Reading and Henley Coaches were robbed at the same Time. - This is the first Time I have seen the Prisoners since the Robbery was committed, for after we were robbed, we went on, in the Coach; therefore I can't swear to them; and that's all I have to say.</p>
               <p>Snowd. Then I presume he knows neither of us, but by Hearsay. He knows not which is Snowd, nor which is Wells. In the next Place<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160030"/> he says, he saw us rob the first Coach. I would ask him if there were any others in the Coach with him, when he was robbed?</p>
               <p>Hull. Yes, 2 Gentlemen, and 2 Gentlewomen. They did not rob the 2 Women, but they robbed the other 2 Men.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Were the Men who robbed you, in Sight, when the Gentleman's Servants came up to you?</p>
               <p>Hull. Yes; they were then both in Sight, and I told them I had been robbed by those two Men.</p>
               <p>Snowd. Did you see the Huntsman when you was in the Coach?</p>
               <p>Hull. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. What Part of the Coach did you fit in?</p>
               <p>Hull. I sat on the Left-Hand Side; with my Back to the Horses: I was coming to Town, and there was one Coach before us, and another behind. I did not see them rob the first Coach, but I put myself out of the Coach, and saw them rob the other Coaches.</p>
               <p>Snowd. And were the 2 Persons, who robbed the other Coaches, pursued immediately?</p>
               <p>Hull. Yes, they were pursued directly. I only speak to the Gentleman's Servant who rode away for Arms, and then he pursued them directly: He was not gone above 10 Minutes for Arms.</p>
               <p>Wells. But in those 10 Minutes, did not you lose Sight of the Men?</p>
               <p>Hull. Yes, a little; but not much.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Did you describe the 2 Men to the Gentleman's Servants?</p>
               <p>Hull. They were in Sight of them, and saw 'em themselves.</p>

            . On Wednesday, December 19. I was going to my Master Bulstrode's, (I am his Servant) over Hounslow-Heath, - He lives at Hounslow, - and as I was going to his House, I saw 2 Men ride by me into Colibrook Road, and to a Place called Butcher's Grove. The one was on a grey horse, the other on a brown.</p>
               <p>Snowd. What Distance were the 2 Men from you, when you saw this?</p>
               <p>Harding. About 200 Yards from me, when I saw them first: after which they went into the Road, and stopped a Coach; I can't tell whether it was the Bath, Bristol, or the Reading Coach; but I knew the Man who drove it, his Name is

            . The second Coach they stopped, was the Heuley Coach. They stopped one Coach first, then they went to the second, which was the Henley Stage Coach, and stopped that. After this, they rode away from the Coaches, some Distance out of the Road, and went forwards. I went on likewise; but the Passengers in the Coaches halloo'd to me, and beckon'd to me, to come to them. When I came up,

             looked out of the Henley Coach, and said he had been robb'd of his Money, by two Men, and desired me to pursue them, and take them. I said, It signifies nothing to pursue Men, and have no Arms; but they told me, if I would ride away, and get Arms, they would stand still, and tell me when I came back which Way the Men went. While I was talking to them, I saw the 2 Men ride up to a third Coach, and stop it. Upon this I rode to my Master's House, (which was then within Sight) and a Servant being in the Yard, I desired him to bring me a Gun, which hung up loaded over the Kitchen-Chimney. The Man brought me the Gun, and took my Master's Mare, and a Blunderbufs, and came along with me. He was the first Man who came up with the Coaches, for I did not stop; I had so much Sight of the 2 Men when they did the Fact, that I thought I should know them and their Horses, when I saw them again. But the People in the Coach told my Fellow-Servant, they were gone round a Hedge call'd the Bavers, and that they were about a Quarter of a Mile before. There were at this Time four Stage-Coaches, and one of Mr Paris's together, but I went on, without asking any Questions, because I had seen the Men, and I knew the Horses so well, that I could be positive to them, (if I should see them again) without any Direction. So I rode round the Bavers, and a Shepherd told me, the Men were just gone before me. He thought (I suppose) they had done some Mischief by seeing us ride hard with Guns. When I was got out upon the Heath, beyond the Bavers, I found I was beyond the Prisoners, therefore I turn'd back again, and met some Servants of my Lord Berkeley's, who told me the Men were gone down a Nine-pin Alley, and over the Stile. When I came to the Stile, I could perceive the Track of their Horses over the Stile, into Harlendon Field; so I rode along the Outside of the Field, which joins to my Lord Berkeley's Park, and came to the Park, where there is a Pannel in the Pales, which may be listed up; but that being lock'd, and the Gate likewise, the Prisoners were obliged to take the Foot-path to Harlendon, and go over a Stile, by Mr Bright's Dog-kennel. When we came to Harlendon, we enquired if any Body had seen 2 Men ride that Way, one on a grey, the other on a brown Horse? and at Dawley Lodge a Man told us, they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160031"/> just before us, and were at Dawley Park, belonging to the

            : So we pursued them down the Lane, and were told by a Man, who was driving a Farmer's Cart, that they were just before us. We went on till we came to Hillendon; and at a Smith's Shop, we saw the 2 Prisoners stand at the Heads of their Horses, to have a Shoe put on, and Cloths were thrown over the Horses Backs. I got up first, and knowing the Men and Horses, I turned from the Shop into a hollow Way, 'till my Companion came up. Then we got off our Horses, and while we were dismounting, the Prisoners whipp'd out at the Smith's Back-door: I cry'd out, - '' Gentlemen, if you offer to go '' away, I'll shoot you: - You have robb'd '' such and such Coaches.'' Upon this they turn'd back, and came through the Smith's Shop again, and would have got into the Smith's House, but we went up to them with our Gun and Blunderbuss, and told them, If they did not surrender, or if they offer'd to shoot, we would let fly at them. Wells immediately surrender'd to my Fellow-Servant; but Snowd ran away, and got through a little Wicket, into a Garden: But as he was getting over the Garden-Pales, into a Field, I up with my long Gun, and said I would shoot him as he ran. He turn'd and begg'd I would not shoot him, and so he surrender'd. After which we had them both into the House, and carry'd them into the Kitchen, where great Numbers of People (near Fourscore) came into see them; so we had them into a private Room while their Horses were shod; and my Horse had likewife thrown off 2 Shoes in the Pursuit. While we were in this Room, I gave them the Liberty to go before what Magistrate they pleased: They chose to go before my Master ('Squire Bulstrode) at Hounslow, and Snowd said, he with'd he had thrown away his Pistol; for I had taken it from him. This is the Pistol, and this is the Ball that was in it; it was charged with Powder and Ball. My Fellow-Servant took a Pistol from Wells, and discharg'd it against a Brick-Wall, and the Impression the Ball made remains there now, if nobody has destroy'd it. As they chose to go before my Master, we put them on their own Horses, and carry'd them thither, and in my Master's Yard we charged a Constable with them, and they were examin'd by my Master; but as to any Confession they made, I know nothing of it. While we had them in the private Room, one of them said, in the Hearing of the other, - '' He wish'd we had shot them, for he was sure '' they should be hang'd.'' But I don't remember which of them it was said this, nor what Reply the other made to it. They both cry'd very much.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. From the Observation you made, can you take on you to swear we are the Men who robbed the Henley Coach?</p>
               <p>Harding. 'Tis hard swearing to their Faces, but I can swear to the Horses, and the Cloaths the Men had on. The Persons we took had the same Cloaths on, which the Men had who robbed the Coach: and I am positive to the Horses.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. At 200 Yards distance, can you take on you to swear to Horses, and Cloaths?</p>
               <p>Harding. Yes: for they did not ride fast, they walked their Horses, when they first went before me. And at the same Time when the third Coach was robbed, I was a great deal nearer them.</p>
               <p>Wills. Did not I live in the Neighbourhood, and did not you know it was me, when I rode by you?</p>
               <p>Harding. I believe he did live in the Neighbourhood; but I can't say, I knew it to be him, at that Time. These are the Cloaths they had on when they were taken. This is the Coat that Wells wore, and by the same Token here's the same Handkerchief in the Pocket, which I lent him at the Smith's House, to wipe his Eyes. This is the Coat which was upon Snowd.</p>
               <p>Hull. These are the same Cloaths the Men had on, who robbed me.</p>
               <p>Harding. I can't say the Men were in sight when I came up the second Time to the Coaches. I can't tell whether they were or not. The People said, - there go the Men, and they turned round an Elbow of a Hedge. I never stopped to ask the People in the Coach any Questions.</p>

            . On the 19th of December, John Harding came home to Mr Bulstrode's, and told me two Men were robbing the Coaches upon the Heath. He said, he had seen them rob two, and they were stopping another when he came away; so he desired me to get him a Gun, for they were but badly mounted, and he believed he could take them. A Servant in the Yard ran in, and brought him a Gun, and me a Blunderbuss, and we went on directly about one fourth of a Mile on the Heath to the Coaches which had been robbed, and which stood still waiting for us. The People (in the Coaches) called out to us, and said, - There are the Men, and they are going round the Bavers. The Coachman upon the Box could see them, but I could not, because of the Bushes upon the Heath. We followed them round the Bavers, and before we had gone a quarter of a Mile round the Hedge, a Man who was picking Turneps told us, the Men<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160032"/> were just gone before us. So we went on into Colebrook-Road, and some Drovers informed us, they had just then met them. Presently after this we met a Grasier, who was going after his Cattle, and he told us he met the Men, in the Water at Cranford-Bridge, and that we might overtake them before they got on the next Heath. But when we got upon the Heath we saw a Stage Coach, and the Coachman telling us he had not seen any such Persons in that Road, Harding was about to take one Way, and I another, to see if they had not taken to the Grounds, but meeting with my Lord Berkeley's Servants, they directed us after them, over a Nine Pin Ground, to a Foot-path, which goes to my Lord Berkeley's House. When we came to the common Field, we tracked them along the Path, but could not see them. A Woman being in the Field, we enquired of her, if she had not seen two such Men? She told us yes, and that they had been trying to get into my Lord's Park, but could not, so they were gone over the Field toward Harlendon. I followed them according to the Woman's Directions down the Field, and found the Gate fastened, and that they had jumped their Horses over a Stile. I jumped my Mare over, and as soon as I came to Harlendon, a Man told me, they were just gone before me. I rode on to Cranford Lane, and thence to Lord Bolingbroke's Lane; and at the Sign of the Woolpack in the Lane, Harding enquired after them again. The Man of the House said, he had not seen any such Persons, but another Man, who was looking out of a Window in the House, told us, he saw them go by about a quarter of an Hour before. Upon this we rode up the Lane as fast as we could, and in the middle of the Lane, a Man who was driving a Cart, told us, he had met them at the Top of the Lane: and before we got out of the Lane, another Man informed us he met them going upon Hillendon Heath. When we got out of the Lane upon the Common, Harding took the Uxbridge Road and I the London Road, but meeting a Coach with Attendants who told me there were no such Persons in that Road, I turned and rode for Hillendon; and by the Gravel-pits I was told the Men were just before me; so I went on, and at Hillendon, at a Smith's Shop, I saw the two Prisoners standing at their Horses Heads: Upon which I rode up to an open Place, and jumped off my Mare, and the two Prisoners ran away to a Gate that goes to an Orchard, but I cocked my Gun, and said, if they would not surrender, I would shoot them. Wells turned round and begged I would not shoot him, and he surrendered; but Snowd ran thro' the Gateway. After Wells had told me, he would surrender, while he was coming toward me, he put his Hand into his Pocket; I thought he might be feeling for a Pistol, so I told him, if he pulled out any Arms, I would shoot him; and he drawing nearer, with his Hand still in his Pocket, I clapped hold of his Wrist, and having pulled his Hand out, I felt in the Pocket myself, and there I found this Pistol; upon which I turned my Hand behind me, and discharged it against the Wall. This Paper of Gunpowder, I found in his other Pocket. I can't tell what the Pistol was charged with, but the People of the House said, I had beat a Piece of Brick out of the Wall. When Harding had took Snowd, we carried them both into the Kitchen, but such Numbers of People came in, that they desired they might be taken into a private Room, for they said, they were known there, and were not willing all the Country should see them. I think it was Snowd said this; he told us likewise that he went to School at Uxbridge. In the private Room, they both cried very much, and Snowd asked Wells for his Handkerchief, to wipe his Eyes, but Wells was using it himself, so Harding lent him one, and 'twas in the Coat Pocket now. Snowd wept, and and said, in the hearing of Wells, that he knew he must die. Wells answered, he did not value dying, for he had rather die, than live and starve, but for the Disgrace. We told them, we hoped they would not die; for as they were young Men, and this their first Fact, they might get off, and must not do so any more. They both said, they wished they had thrown their Pistols away. I have seen the Cloaths which have been produced in Court, and I am sure Snowd wore the white Coat, and Wells the brown.</p>
               <p>Snowd. I ask him whether he's sure it was I, who said, I am sure we shall die?</p>
               <p>Ball. Yes: he said so when he asked Wells to lend him his Handkerchief. I had some little Knowledge of Wells before, but not any Acquaintance with him; I never knew any Thing ill of him, before.</p>

            . I pursued them, for the Good of my King and Country, as well as Harding and Ball, and went after the Prisoners, when the 2 Witnesses went first on the Pursuit; but I was upon a Coach-Horse, so I could not follow them over Ditch, and over Hedge, as they did; therefore I quitted my Horse at Cranford-Bridge, and followed them to the Place where they were taken. I did not see them before they were taken, but I followed them by the People's Directions, and heard Snowd say, 'tis a very unfortunate Thing, that we are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160033"/> taken, and I with we had thrown away our Pistols. Yes, said Wells, so it is; and I wish we had. This was at the Blacksmith's Arms, a Smith's Shop at Hillendon.</p>
               <p>Snowd. I absolutely deny I was on the Heath that Day: and that's the first thing I have to say. In the next Place, I humbly presume none of them have sworn that we are the very Men who robbed the Coaches, and that they have spoken but circumstantially. There were no Masks found on us, and I absolutely deny the Fact. As to Harding's swearing I went over a Stile, - I had been very ill; and had not had a Stool for 5 Days before, and having taken something to open my Body, I went out of the Way to ease myself in a Hog-sty. Then as to the circumstance of the Pistols, I never rode without them. I had a 20 l. Bank Bill, and 3 l. in Money about me, and was then going to sup at Mr Sergeant's, at Uxbridge: and the Pistol Wells had, was a Pistol which has belonged to his Family several Years: and very good People travel the country with Pistols. And I might say I wished I had thrown my Pistol away, because of the Scandal; for to be sure it would put an innocent Man into an Agony, to have such a charge upon him. But then there is a great Variation in the Evidence: for Hull swears that 2 Men came up to the Coach, and that he sent 2 Men to pursue them directly. Ball was at Home; and Hull swears they were both there. Harding went Home to Mr. Bulstrode's for Arms, and brought Ball with him; how then could they pursue us directly.</p>
               <p>Harding. I was in Sight of my Master's House when the People in the coach told me they were robbed, and they stood still till Ball and I came back from thence.</p>

I told them, I thought it had been a Thorough-fair; No, said they, but we must have a Glass of Wine before we part. I refus'd to have any Wine, and said I would not drink any, for I had no Money to pay for Wine. Nan Hill said, she would find Money.

            , (the Woman who keeps the House) Nan Hill, and Nan Holloway were then present; and Hill fell immediately to rifle my Pockets, while Burges and Holloway held me down in a chair. This was done in a Back Room, the farthest from the Street: and they took from me the things mentioned in the Indictment. - 4 s. 6d. in Money, a Handkerchief, and a Bundle of Writings which were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160034"/> in my Pocket. After this I went into the Street, and enquired who kept that House, but no body would tell me, - I believe they were all of a Sort, and would not betray one another. Hill came after me into the Street, with the Writings in her Hand, and said, If I would come in again, I should have them. I follow'd her for my Writings, and I had no sooner got into the House, but she took the Hat off my Head, and gave it a Fellow to keep for the Recitcning; though I saw no Man in the House 'till I came back again.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. What did you drink in the House?</p>
               <p>Moody. Burges told me 4 Pints had been drank, but I don't know what became of them, I don't know that I saw any one of them. I believe I might drink one Glass, and I believe that was all, - I can't be positive. They left me 3 penny-worth of Halfpence in my Pocket, and that was all. With this Money I went over the Way to a publick House, and called for a Pint of Beer, and asked the Names of the People at the Globe over the Way, but they would not tell me, and made me pay the Three-Pence (the others had left me) for the Pint of Drink. The next Morning I went to Burges, to ask her for my Writings; but she call'd me old Rogue, and told me there were 3 Pints of Wine to be pay'd for. Why, says I, you serv'd your selves; what Money I had, you took from me; but I could not get my Writings, so I went and got a Warrant for them; and 2 or 3 Days afterwards I sent 3 Men to the House, and desired them to call for Wine, and Women, and I would come (I said) and surprise them with a Constable. The Men went thither, and had each of them a Woman, but when I came, I found they were not the Women who had robb'd me.</p>
               <p>Burges. How long after this was it, before you took us up?</p>
               <p>Moody. I went the next Day to enquire for my Things, and took out a Warrant for them the next Day, but I could not take them presently, for they all kept out of the Way; and I live in the Country, and could not stay in Town. Beside, Burges desired me to stay a Week, before I put the Warrant in Execution, that she might find out my Things, and accordingly I did.</p>
               <p>Burges. Did you pay no Money that Night towards the Reckoning?</p>
               <p>Moody. No; I had no Money to pay any Reckoning with.</p>

            . My Father call'd upon me when he came up out of the Country, and after he had stay'd about 2 Hours with me, he ask'd me which was his nearest Way to Lincoln's-Inn ? It might be then about 4 o'Clock, or a little before. I live in Belton-Street, so I directed him to Long-Acre, and a-cross Drury-Lane to Princes-Street. The next Morning he told me, he had been robb'd at the Globe in Drury-Lane, and desired me to go with him to the House. When I came there, Burges was in the Bar, and she abused us, and called him old Rogue, upon his asking her for the Things she had taken from him. She said he had taken his Things away himself; but I told her I would get a Warrant for her, and for the People who had been concerned in the Fact; and accordingly I went in order to get one, but not knowing all their Names, it was to no Purpose. So I went back again to Burges, and she sent for Hill and Holloway, and told me their Names, and then I got a Warrant: I had desired them to let me have the Writings, else they would all come into Trouble. Hill said, she had given my Father the Writings again; but Nan Holloway told me, before Burges's Face, that Burges kept them for a Halfcrown Reckoning: though Burges said she had them not, nor knew any Thing of them. When the Warrant was taken out, they sent for me to the Nag's-Head-Tavern, in Prince's-Street, where I found Burges, and she desired me to stop the Execution of the Warrant, and said, perhaps she might get the Writings again.</p>
               <p>Burges. When you came the next Morning, did not I tell you the other Womens Names?</p>
               <p>Moody, jun. I had some Words with her, and told her the Justice said, if she would not tell their Names, he would send for Her. I knew her Name; it is under the Sign of the Globe.</p>
               <p>Burges. Pray what were these Writings?</p>
               <p>Moody, sen. There was a Bill of Sale for 60 l. and a Note for 20 l.</p>
               <p>Burges. Moody came into the House, and asked for a Pint of Wine, I was very ill at the same Time. - He went into a Room behind the Bar, and said he wanted to drink with a Woman [Holloway] who was with me in the Bar. She went to him, and they had a Pint of White, and a Pint of Red, and after this they had 2 Pints more, and when he went away he paid me half a Crown, and told me, if he was alive and well, he would come again, and pay me the other Eighteen-Pence. As for my Name, it has been wrote under the Sign, ever since I left off keeping a Brandy-Shop. When he came to me, he desired me to advertise the Writings, and said I should be at the Expence of it; and accordingly his Writings were advertised three Weeks in the Papers; and when the Justice sent for me, I went to him, and came back again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160035"/> to my own House. This is the Paper which his Son wrote with his own Hand.</p>
               <p>Moody, jun. When they sent for me to Graham's, at the Nag's-Head in Prince's-Street, they desired me to advertise the Writings, and Graham desired me to write the Advertisement my self. While I was with them at this House, I sent a Letter to my Father, to know what I should do; but he did not come to me before next Morning, and then he said, he did not care what they did, so he had but his Papers again. They told me, if I would write the Advertisement, they would be at the Charge of publishing it. My Father knew nothing of my Writing the Advertisement, for he was out of Town.</p>

            . I am a Journeyman Bricklayer, and my Master's Name is Ridge. I was at work that Evening in Colson's Court, and my Master ordered me to wait for him when I had done Work, at the Bar of the Globe-Tavern. 'Twas on Monday the 10th or 11th of December, and I remember I went thither, and looked at the Clock, and saw it was between 5 and 6 o'Clock. Mrs Burges told me, I might as well sit down by the Bar-Fire; so I went in, and Hill and another Woman came in, and Moody followed them. Moody said, Pray don't let me disturb you; I said, No, you don't disturb me, and so I went and sat down in the Bar. Burges carry'd them in 3 Pints of Wine, and when she had carried in the third, she told me, she believed she should lose some part of her Reckoning, for the Man (said she) has but half a Crown in his Pockets. When he came out, he asked her her Name; she told him, her Name was at the Bottom of the Sign; so he went out, and said he would call again, and pay her what he had left to pay. He followed the Gentlewomen into the House voluntarily, and not as if he was enquiring his Way. He was in the House about an Hour with the Women, and seemed to be a little in Liquor, but did not say one Word, either pro or con, about being robb'd, when he went away. I stay'd in the House 'till within a Quarter of 12, and supp'd with Burges upon Sausages; and no Man came into the House, from the Time he went out, to my going Home.</p>

            . I have been a Servant to Burges upward of 7 Years. I remember the Time when Moody came into our House, Hill came in with him, and no body else*. They went into the Parlour, where Norman the Bricklayer was sitting, and drank 2 or 3 Pints of Wine, which Moody called for himself.</p>
               <p>* See Norman's (the Bricklayer's) Evidence.</p>
               <p>Burges. Was any Force made Use of toward him?</p>
               <p>Broderick. No, none at all. He came forcibly in, without asking any Questions, and Hill was with him. Our House is no Thorough-fair: but he did not pretend to want a Thorough-fair: he stay'd about an Hour, bid us good Night, as then went away very friendly and kindly  ask'd my Mistress her Name; telling her,  call again and pay her, the next Time he  Town. I did not see any Money pay'd,  be sure he pay'd half a Crown, for my M Burges would not say it, if he had not. I am  Servant there, - my Business is sometime above, and sometimes below, - well, I am Cook who and I am sure there was no other Woman made  Company that Night, but my Mistress, and the Prisoner Hill.

What's the Matter with you, Friend, says I? Why says he, I have been out late, and have lost some Papers of some Consequence to me. Where was it you lost them? I was over the Way at the Globe (says he) and at 2 or 3 more Places; but I don't know where I lost them. I asked him if he had left any Money? No, he said he had none to lose. Can you recollect, says I, whether the Woman of the House took any Money from you? No, said he, she did not. Well, says I, I'll go over the Way and ask her. I did so and she said she knew nothing of his Papers. When I came back, I saw this young Fellow (Moody, jun.) walking with him; and I told them the Woman of the House knew nothing of them, but she said he had left Eighteen-Pence to pay. Why, says the old Fellow all we want is to know her Name, then we shall do very well, for she has Money enough; and he told me likewise, that I was one of them, and that we were all alike. - I was an Upholsterer by Trade, but I am an Officer now.</p>

As I endeavoured to rise, I had a second Blow, which laid me flat upon the Ground. Upon attempting to rise again, I had 2 Blows more. I was very much stunned with the first Blow, but I endeavoured to ward off the other Blows, with my Cane, before I fell down. As I got up, I had a Blow or 2 more, and my Cane was forced out of my Hand: it had a gold Head of about 5 Guineas value.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was it a wrought Head, or a plain one?</p>
               <p>Mr Patten. A wrought Head. - I endeavoured to draw my Sword, but my Right-Hand was so disabled, by warding off the Blows, that I could not draw it. It was exceeding dark, and I could see but one Man, who appeared in a Sea-Man's Jacket and Trowsers. I got up to Bow-street, and called out Thieves! Murder! And several Chair-Men standing at a Coffee-House Door at the Bottom of Earl's-Court, went after them; they could find no-body, but they brought me my Hat, which they said was lying in a dark Place, and it seems was not carry'd off.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Was Brian before the Gentleman or behind him?</p>
               <p>Thompson. He was behind him when he gave him the first Blow, and then the Gentleman turned about, and defended himself with his cane, but Brian gave him several Blows after that, and at last he fell: whether it was by a Blow or a Slip, I can't tell. As soon as the Gentleman fell, Brian snatched his cane out of his Hand, and then he recovered himself a little, and drew his Sword; upon which Brian ran over to us, with the cane in his Hand. The Prisoner stood by Brian while he was attacking the Gentleman, with a Bludgeon in his Hand, to assist him in case any Body should come by. It was agreed we should all be ready in case of any Resistance. After this, we all went to Mrs Lambert's; and in the Fore-room we agreed, that the Prisoner and Smith should offer the cane to her. Accordingly they carried it to her, in the Backroom, while I, Teddy Brian, and John of Gaunt, waited in the Fore-room. We agreed they should ask her a Guinea for it, but they came and told us she offered no more than 7 s. for she said the Head was only washed over. At first they said, they would not take the Money she bid, but at length we took it, and 4 of us had Eighteen-pence a-piece, and John of Gaunt had a Shilling.</p>

               <p>Thompson. He stood for a Spy, at the End of the Street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he knows the Gentleman who was robbed?</p>

            . I happened to be drinking at Moll Lambert's in Parker's-Lane, one Sunday Night, about 2 Months ago, and about 8 o'Clock at Night, Lineham and Smith came into the Back-room, and called Moll Lambert out of the Fore-room to them there. I was in the Back-room at the same Time, and saw them offer to sell her a cane. They asked her a Guinea for it; she stood some Time, and then she said it was only gilt, and she would give but 7 s. for it. John of Gaunt, Brian, and Thompson were at the same Time in the Fore-room; they all came into the House together, but these 3 staid in the Fore-room, while the Prisoner and Smith went into the Back-room. After Lambert had bid them 7 s. they went into the Fore-room, to ask the other 3, if they should take the Money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How came you to know what passed in the Fore-room?</p>
               <p>Purvis. I was drinking in the Back-room; and when Lineham and Smith returned out of the Back-room to the rest, I was willing to know something of the Matter, and I went with them into the Fore-room, where they agreed to take the Money, and it was shared among them; it was Twenty-pence or Eighteen-pence. - I think it was Sixteen-pence a-piece. This John of Gaunt they did not use to give any thing to, except a little Victuals and Drink. After they had divided the Money among them, I went up 2 Pair of Stairs with them, and won 3 Shillings of them at All-fours.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. What coat had I on then?</p>
               <p>Purvis. At that Time he had a red rug coat on. He used to wear one coat one Night, and another, another Night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no Witnesses, but I am innocent of the thing. How can I have Witnesses to swear I know nothing of it: it is impossible I should have any Witnesses to that. <rs id="t17400116-48-verdict230" type="verdictDescription">

I had formerly lost a great many Goods, and hearing somebody in the Shop, I came up out of my Kitchen, which is under the Shop, and seeing a Woman there, with a young Infant in her Arms, I stood upon the Watch, because there was a pretty many Goods on the Counter. The Prisoner was buying some Cambrick, and a Box of Cambricks being by her, I saw her hustle toward it, and throw the child's cloaths over the Box. Then I saw her put her Hand under the child's cloaths, and draw up a Piece of Cambrick, which she kept for 10 Minutes, or a Quarter of an Hour, and then she made off from the counter with it, and asked my Brother Wiseham, who serves in the Shop, for some Nun's Holland. I gave him an Item, that she had stole some Cambrick out of the Box; he, being surpriz'd, told her he had none that would do for her. Upon this she made off with the Piece of Cambrick towards the Door, but seeing me surpriz'd, and that I whispered him, she came back, and dropped the Piece of Cambrick a-cross the Box, which stood 3 if not 4 Yards from the Street-Door. I saw her bring the child to the Box, and saw her drop it; after which she went away, and I was angry with my Brother for not laying hold of her in the Shop, but he went after her, and took her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought 2 Bits of Cambrick, and paid for them.</p>
               <p>Mrs Higgins. Yes, she bought 2 half-quarters, and paid Sixteen-Pence for them; but what she stole, was a whole Piece un-open'd; and she took it up under the child's cloaths, while she was buying the other.</p>

            . I serve in the Shop: on Friday se'ennight the Prisoner came in, and asked for some Packet-cambrick, of 5 s. a Yard, with a child in her Arms. I fetch'd a Box, and snewed her some; Sir, says she, be so good as to hold the child, while I look at it at the Door; I did so, and we agreed for 4 s. and 6 d. a Yard. I asked her how much she wanted? She told me half a quarter, and I said then she must give me Seven-pence for it. She had the child in her left Hand, and she shov'd some Goods, which were on the counter, farther from the Door, and said, May be, Sir, my child may piss upon them, and damage them. I guess'd what Sort of a Customer I had got, for just such a Woman as she came with a child, a little while ago, and stole 5 Yards of cambrick. I did not cut off the cambrick she had agreed for, for she said she would have finer, and would go to 6 s. a Yard. So I went to an opposite counter, and fetch'd another Box, which I plac'd about a Yard from the Prisoner, on her left-hand, in which were 12 Pieces, 10 within Papers,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160039"/> and 2 without Paper. And as I went toward the Door, to shew her the cambrick, I saw her hand toward the Box, and hearing the rustling of the cambrick under the child's cloaths, I was terrify'd. Then she pointed up to a strip'd Thing, and asked me what it was; and after this she asked for Nun's Holland; but I told her it would be too high for her; and expected her to go out of the Shop with what she had stole, because I thought the Law would have run more against her, if she had carry'd them out of the Shop*. So I waited for her going; but she returned from the Door, and said she would look on the Nun's Holland; and presently she hustled up to the Box, and I heard the rattling of the cambrick upon the Box. Then she went away and said, the Nun's Holland would not do for her. She did not take either of the 2 Pieces which lay uppermost in the Box, without Paper, but had the Art to take a Piece under them, which was paper'd. After she was gone, my Sister bid me go after her, and a Gentleman coming into the Shop, he said he would go too. So we watch'd her into an Alehouse, the Lion and Cat, and took her. I am sure she had the cambrick under the child's cloaths near a Quarter of an Hour, before she dropped it into the Box again.</p>

            . I went with the Prisoner before the Justice, where she did not deny she took the Goods, but only said, they had found nothing upon her. The Justice knew her, and told her so, and that she had been a Notorious Offender. When she was ordered to Newgate, I was forced to go and get a Party of Soldiers, before we could get her thither. I have heard of this very Woman's robbing with a Child, from Mrs Wright in Holborn and several other Shopkeepers, and gave my Brother and Sister a particular Caution about her.</p>

Home, says I, and what have you to say to that? Will you give me any Thing, quoth she? I have but a few Halfpence, said I, and I asked her a very impudent Question, that I believe I did; and told her I had got Two-pence, but she must be quick, for I was in a Hurry, and had not much Occasion for her Company neither. So I gave her the Two-pence, and then she pretended that Two-pence was too little. Well, says I, I'll see if I have any more Farthings, and so I gave her 2 Halfpence more. But while I was talking to her, she got her Hand into my Pocket, and took out a Guinea, 2 Shillings and a Farthing. After this, I told her directly she had picked my Pocket; she denyed it, but I took her to the next Alehouse, and called a Watchman. When the Watchman came, I told her she had picked my Pocket of a Guinea, 2 Shillings and a Farthing, and if she would give me the Money again, I would release her; if not, I would send for the Constable. Nay, I told her, if she would return me the Guinea, she should have the overplus for her self, but she would not own it; so the Constable was sent for, and I delivered her up to him. He carry'd her to the Watch-house, and there she was searched, but no Money was to be found. At last says the Beadle, these Creatures very often hide Things in their Stockings, and upon searching the Stocking on her right Leg, out came the Guinea, 2 Shillings and a Farthing, to be sure. Next Morning we had her before Sir

            . Last Sunday Night about a quarter before 11, a Watchman came to the Watch-house to fetch the Constable to the Barley-mow, in Knaves-Acre. I went with him, and there sat Blinkhorn and the Prisoner, and 2 other Men by them: And without Doors there was a couple of their Fosticates intending to get in, but we shut the Door against them. They told us they belonged to this very self same Creature at the Bar, and the Constable ordered me to disperse them, and I did so. Then Blinkhorn told the Creature, if she would give him the Guinea, she should have the 2 Shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160040"/> and the Farthing for her self; but it signified nothing, - she was cafe-hardened. So Mr Constable and I were both of one Opinion, and that was, that she should be taken proper care of. Accordingly I took hold of one of her Hands, and another Brother Watchman took hold of the other Hand, to guard her down to the Watch-house. But we had not gone far, before these 2 Fosticates came swearing upon us again: However we got the creature to the Watch-house, where we desired her to give the Man his Money: She said she had it not, so we examined her, and searched her modestly, but found no Money. Upon that says I, here's a proper Place to search, meaning her Shoes and Stockings. So with all the Pleasure in the World, Madam pulled off her 2 Shoes; and one Stocking as quick as her Shoes, and that was quick enough; and by the same Token she had large Buckles in them. But when she came to untye her Right Garter, or a Peice of White Tape, she was not so quick. I would not be obstinate, but said, Madam, if you please I'll help you; and so I turned down her Stocking, and out dropped a Guinea, 2 Shillings and a Farthing. The next Morning she was carried before his Worship, and there she begged the Coachman's Pardon, and said, she would never do so no more. <rs id="t17400116-51-verdict247" type="verdictDescription">
