On the morning of the 21st December, between twelve and one, I was on duty in Nelson Street, Commercial Road, within about sixty yards of the Clyde public-house—I heard a cry of "Police" and "Murder"—I ran up Nelson Street and saw the prosecutor lying on the pavement on his back—I saw the witness Moss running after the prisoner—I followed and took him back—I found the prosecutor in about the same spot where I had left him—he said the prisoner was one of the three that had robbed him—I took him to the Clyde, and asked the barman in his presence if the prisoner had been there with the prosecutor—he said yes, he had, and the pri<lb/>soner said, "I have been here these two or three hours"—the prose<lb/>cutor's pocket was hanging out, torn from his trousers—he had two half-sovereigns and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. about him, and a florin I found on the ground close to where he was lying.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I remember the morning of the 28th December—the prosecutor had a cup of coffee at my stall—I did not see anybody with him—I did not see the person Hill—I saw the prisoner, he came up about the same time as the prosecutor—the prisoner called for three cups of coffee—I only saw two persons—the prosecutor said he should not pay for them—I said I should look to the, prisoner for it, as he called for them—he said he would not pay, and he up with his fist and struck him in the face and knocked his hat off, and he fell—the prisoner followed him up and struck him again, and then he ran away and the policeman came up and ran after him—I did not see him take anything from him, I was busy attending to my stall at the time—I did not see the witness Hill there—I know him by sight—he was not there—I did not see him there—I did not see whether there were three cups of coffee drank, I was rather busy serving other persons—I hardly noticed who had the cups—I only saw two, the prosecutor and prisoner—I did not see whether the third cup was drank or not.</p>

Turnbull, for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him if he knew how many there were—he said he did not—I asked him who he bought them of; he said of a man he had seen two or three times in a public-house in Long Acre, and who he had known two or three months—I asked him if he knew his name or could find him—he said that he could find him another day—I believe he took this receipt off a file—I took it away—I went again next morning, and he asked me to look at the receipt to see if there were two signatures to it—I showed it to him, and he said that he bought them of a man named Duck, a carpenter, who he had known all his life and had done jobs for him, but did not know where he lived—we had an appointment at eight o'clock for him to produce Duck, and went but did not see him—I said to Taylor, "I thought Duck would be here"—he said, "I have not been able to find him, I have no doubt I shall find him—he went out to one or two public-houses and endeavoured to find him—I went again next day, the 5th, and Duck was sent for by Taylor—he came in about half an hour—that was the other prisoner—I told him we were two detective officers, and wished him to be candid in his answers—I asked him if he had sold a lot of gloves to Mr. Taylor—he said that he had—I asked him if the receipt was in his writing—he said that it was—I said, "Is your name Duck?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "How did you come to sign Turnbull?"—he said, "Well, I was to have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for selling the gloves; the man who I sold them for could not write, he said his name was Turnbull, and got me to sign 'Turnbull' for him"—I said, "Who is the man, what business is he, and where does he live?"—he said, "I do not know, I have met him two or three times at the Sun, in Gate Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields; he said that he had them from a party he did not intend to pay for them"—Duck told me he was a French polisher, and worked for Jackson and Graham, of Oxford Street, that he did not know the man's name, but that he was a young man about thirty-five, fair, with no whiskers—he wrote this description in my presence two or three days afterwards at the Sun public-house—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "A man about five feet nine high, slightly dark complexion, no whiskers, dressed in black, and rather stout")—on Thursday, the 6th, from instruc<lb/>tions</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many times did you see Taylor and Duck up to his apprehension? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five or six times—I think I saw Duck alone three times at the Sun, in Gate Street, up to 13th Sep<lb/>tember—it was on the 5th that I first saw him at Taylor's—I also saw them together at Messrs. Hutching's office—Duck was apprehended by Roskelly, on 5th October—he told me where he was employed, and I pointed him out to Roskelly as he left his work—I have no doubt that he remained at his work at Jackson and Graham's the whole time—I had about three interviews with him—I went there because he said he would endeavour to look for the man—I gave him my card and told him if he did not come quickly to give him in custody and bring him to the Old Jewry to me—the Sun is an ordinary-sized public-house, and is frequented by working men—I went there once or twice when I did not see him—I did not go to Jackson and Graham's to see him—I understand he went to the Old Jewry to see me—that is my police address, and is on my card—I have no doubt he called once—I do not know who he saw—there are something like twenty detective officers there, and perhaps 200 people call every day—there is a little brass box or pigeon-hole, and'if it is a matter of importance the clerk or messenger writes it down and puts it in my compartment—I have inquired since the last trial, of the two station sergeants and the messenger, but they have no recollection; perhaps twenty people call in a day for me—I believe, from what Duck has told me, that be called, and from what Tay<lb/>lor told me also—there is no question that they actually went to Dent's, I suppose that was to get an interview with Mr. Allcroft—Taylor said that he went there to produce Duck—I said, "It is no use; you should go to Messrs. Lawrence, the solicitors"—I believe the managing clerk would not receive Duck's statement—Taylor and Duck went to the solicitors for the prosecution, and wanted an interview with the managing clerk; that was between the 5th and the 12th, because on the 12th I went to Scotland, and it was before that—I was examined on the former trial and stated all that I have to-day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Camper, Escombe, and Lawson—we are stockbrokers, carrying on business at 4, Adam Street, Old Broad Street—I know the defendant; he was managing director of the Joint Stock Discount Company Limited—from time to time in the years 1864 and 1865 our firm was engaged in buying and selling shares on his behalf personally, at intervals throughout the years 1864 and 1865—he has from time to time made payments on those accounts—some time in August, 1865, we had purchased for him 520 shares in the Joint Stock Discount Company—they were purchased for the account on the 16th August—on that day we were only able to deliver 377 shares—including the price of the 520 shares, the balance owing by the defendant to us on the 16th August was 5016<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the price of the 520 shares taken together was 4257<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the rest of the 5016<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was made up of a sum of 705<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the balance of an old account; that balance included a sum of about 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on loans on Hudson's Bay shares; I don't know the exact figures; it was about that amount—on the 16th August, 1865, I sent our clerk, Mr. Ram<lb/>say, to the defendant, for the purpose of getting a cheque for 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—he returned without any cheque, and I went over to the com<lb/>pany's office in Nicholas Lane, and saw the defendant in his private room—I said I required a cheque, and I must have the money, because I had</p>

               <p>paid the money away, and I must have it that afternoon—I said I must have a cheque for 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I had not paid the whole away—he told me that he could not pay the money that afternoon, as he had to get the money from another person—I told him I must have it—he then said he would give me a cheque of the company for 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which cheque I consented to allow him to pass through our account—he said, "I will give you a cheque for 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the Joint Stock Discount Company, and repay it when I get the money from the third party"—I consented to that, on condition that he should repay the 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and no interest should be charged to us, and no security given—I told him I had 377 shares to deliver him that day—those were the ones I had paid for (I delivered the 143 on the 28th August)—I told him I would deliver them as soon as I got them—I then left, and said I would send my clerk over for the cheque—I did so, and he got it and paid it into our bankers, and we were credited with it—our bankers were the Agra and Masterman's—the defendant's company also banked there—on that day, the 16th August, I delivered the 377 shares—the transfers were made out in the ordinary way; they were transferred to Mr. Megaw—we had Mr. Wilkinson's order to that effect—on the 28th August we delivered the remaining 143 shares—the transfers of those shares were also made out to Mr. Megaw—when those remaining shares were delivered the balance to be paid to us was 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the remain<lb/>ing 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a dividend that had accrued on the 520 shares; we credited Mr. Wilkinson with that—I can't say whether I saw him with regard to the payment of the balance, 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the 28th August; I do not remember—I received this cheque for 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the afternoon of the 28th August—I cannot say from whom I received it; it passed through my hands—I re<lb/>ceived it as the balance of that account—I know Mr. Wilkinson's writing this is his signature (<hi rend="italic">this was dated the 28th August, 1865, for </hi>860<hi rend="italic">l., payable to 7660.

               <p>shares upon which that profit or loss accrued—those differences were from time to time settled between Mr. Wilkinson and us—money passed be<lb/>tween us on both sides—on 16th August we had 377 shares in our pos<lb/>session—they were delivered on that day—they had been bought for him at different times—I can't say whether the number of shares we were carrying over for him had remained at 200 for a considerable number of months—I don't remember, our bookkeeper can state that—upon my oath I do not remember—I can't say that they ever stood actually at 200, I know that the total number of shares was 520—I do not know whether they stood at 200 for many months—I won't say they did not—I won't say they did not stand at 200 from November till June, I don't know—whatever shares there were were carried over from time to time—I had 377 shares delivered to me on 16th August—none were actually bought that day, they were paid for on that day—up to 16th August 520 were bought—I don't know how many I had bought within a fortnight of 16th August—I cannot give you the least notion—I should think it would not be the difference between 200 and 520, but I am not certain—I think the price of the 520 shares was 4257<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—some of that was paid on 16th August, and some was paid before that, and the difference of the carrying over, and some of it was paid up to 28th August, as the shares were delivered—the shares may have been delivered in tens, twenties, fifties, or anyhow—it was all paid before 28th August—the 4257<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not paid on 26th July—I cannot tell what was owing from the defendant to us on 26th July—doubtless something was, I don't know what—I cannot say that I saw Mr. Wilkinson myself on the subject of these 520 shares before 16th August—the first time I saw him that day was after I had sent Ramsay for a cheque and he had come back without one—I think no one was present when I saw him, I am sure there was not—it was in his own private room at the company's office in Nicholas Lane, in the afternoon I think between twelve and four, I can't give you the time nearer than that—I made no note of it at the time, the interview did not last long—I don't think I ever spoke to Mr. Wilkinson again on the subject—we afterwards had a notice to the effect that the company claimed the sum of 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from us—I never communicated with Mr. Wilkinson on the subject, we simply sent the account back to the company when we received it—I can't give you the date, I have no idea of it, I only know we sent it back directly it was received—I did not send it back myself, Mr. Capper, my partner, did—I never communicated with Mr. Wilkinson about it after that—I was not examined before the Liqui<lb/>dator about this matter, Mr. Capper was—I did not then communicate with Mr. Wilkinson—we had had loans from the company from time to time—we always paid interest—I mean to swear that we never had a loan from the company that we did not pay interest for—we had frequent loans, considerable sums, 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., perhaps more, I dare say 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I dare say in the course of a year there have been loans to the amount of 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not in single loans—we might have had 7000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at one time—we never had a loan of any kind upon which we did not pay interest—I don't know that we ever had a loan that we repaid on the very day we got it—I should think that would be an exceptional case—I do not remember any such case—we have not had loans without giving security for them—we never had a loan but what we gave security for, stock or shares—I assert positively that on no occasion did we ever receive a loan, great or small, without giving some security besides our own personal security—I under<lb/>stood the business of the Discount Company to be immense, to the extent of</p>

               <p>these contract notes, or of our charging him for carrying over shares not actually in our hands—carrying over shares is a familiar practice on the Stock Exchange, without actually having the shares in your possession at the moment—we could tell by reference to our books when the 520 shares were paid for—it would take a very long time—they were all paid for before 28th August—we paid for the 377 when we got possession of them on 16th August—I do not know what the total amount of the 377 shares was—the demand for the 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was sent back the moment it was received—from that time until the official liquidator asked us for it again, we had no further demand for it, as far as I know—one of our clerks, the book-keeper, took back the notice—the claim was originally made in 1866—I don't know the date.</p>

(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">proposed to read this entry, con<lb/>tending that the defendant, as managing director of the company, was respon<lb/>sible criminally for everything that appeared on the books, and that as a director and shareholder, the books were his in point of law.</hi>

               <p>the loan-books and discount-books were always laid on the table every board day, to allow the directors to see what business had been done during the week—Mr. Wilkinson would have the management of the loan—the existence of the loan would first find its way into the banker's cheque-book—a cheque would be written for the amount, from that it would go into the cash-book; that would be done by the cashier, of course under the direction of Mr. Wilkinson—all loans ought to appear in this book—Mr. Wilkinson had the general superintendence of all the business; he used to receive bills from various customers of the company and discount them—I was present constantly when he received bills from different parties, and said that they would be discounted—he handed them to the clerk whose duty it was to receive them, and they were then entered into a book and passed through in the usual way—I can't say that I ever saw him over look that book—I have no recollection of ever having seen him with that book before him—this book was for the informa<lb/>tion of the directors on rota—the cheques when they were signed were entered here—this book had nothing to do with the managing director—I fancy it was simply for the information of the directors on rots (<hi rend="italic">the book was withdrawn</hi>)—This book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cash-book—I am not familiar with it—I have seen it in the office of the company, on one of the desks in the general office—I mean where the business with the public is carried on, in the lower room—I have seen Mr. Wilkinson there daily—his room is off the general office; it is a continuation of it—there is simply a glass screen between—he was generally there from ten or eleven till four, either in the office or in his own room—this book would contain an account of the receipts and disbursements of the company during the day—that would include loans—I don't remember ever seeing that book before Mr. Wilkin<lb/>son—it might be found necessary to refer to it—the business of the company could not go on without referring to it—the bookkeeper must refer to it to post into his ledger—unless there was any special matter he would not require any orders—he would do so in his capacity—if special orders were necessary, the managing director would be the person to give them, if not, he would post it up in the ordinary course of daily work—as an officer in the establishment he had his particular work to do, and he would do it without any special instructions—he would know which was a loan transaction from instructions from Mr. Wilkinson—if any special date was named for a loan I should look to this book to find it out—I do not remember a transaction of a loan of 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Messrs. Capper, Escombe, and Lawson being brought to my attention by Mr. Wilkinson, or of 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or any sum at all—this cheque for 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is signed by me—I have no recollection of the matter to which it refers—I was not at all aware that it was to pay a private debt of Mr. Wilkinson's—I also signed this cheque of 19th September—I know nothing of that transaction—I signed it in the ordinary course of business—it was some transaction entered into by Mr. Wilkinson, and the cheque was brought to me to sign—I was told what it was for and I signed it—I cannot remember it especially—I was not told it would be paid to the credit of our own company—when the clerk brought cheques for signature he always told me for what purpose they were drawn, for loans or repayment, or whatever it might be—I do not remember what I was told about these cheques—the cash-book was kept by one clerk and this by another—I have not the slightest idea of their names—I believe one clerk kept the whole of it—the entries were very numerous—it might require more than one clerk to</p>

               <p>about two years before the company stopped payment, in March, 1866—his duties were to keep the general accounts of the company—he did not keep all the books himself, he had to superintend it—I don't know whether he made any original entries—he had nothing to do with the entry of cash payments and receipts; that was done by a clerk in the lower office; he was in an upper room and had the books entirely under his control (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Brand called</hi>)—I recognise that gentleman as a clerk in the office—I do not refer to him especially—there was a bookkeeper, who he was I do not know—I don't know what his business was; he had to render a balance-sheet—I know that the duties of bookkeeper and accountant were per<lb/>formed, but I never was brought into immediate contact with the person and cannot tell which gentleman it was that did it—his duties as accountant and bookkeeper were the ordinary duties of that particular occupation—he rendered a general balance of account<lb/>ant the end of the year; that is all I know about it—so far as I know he had nothing to do with the entry of a particular item on a particular day—I think I said that the loans or discounts usually would appear on the counterfoils of the cheques—it does not appear upon any one of these on the first page; there are four cheques on each page—none appear on the second page; there are in some places; I was under the impression that they were always there.</p>

Capper's, never to my recollection certainly—if I required instructions in the course of my duty I referred to Mr. Hill and Mr. Sutton—I do not remember referring to either of them when Messrs.

I do not know anything of this transaction—I cannot tell whether Mr. Wilkinson was there that day—if money was required while Mr. Wilkinson was at the office I should go round to the banker's and negotiate loans with them—I should exercise my own discretion as to the rate of interest, and so on—that was my department, and I should repay loans made to the company—I should not make advances of any kind without consulting him, I might to a small amount on bills, but not on shares—I have done so—I remember a bill-broker having come in and wanted 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., late in the afternoon, on good bills, and I have advanced money upon them—that would be entered in a book of the transactions of the day—I should have spoken to Mr. Wilkinson had he been there, or I should tell him of it afterwards—I should always have it confirmed—</p>

               <p>the signatures to these depositions in Chancery are Mr. Wilkinson's (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>:) "In Chancery. In the matter of the Companies Act, 1862, and in the matter of the Joint Stock Discount Company Limited. Deposition of James Freeling Wilkinson, called on behalf of the liquidators; sworn the 17th October, 1866; filed 12th November, 1866: states:—I was the managing director of the Joint Stock Discount Company Limited in January, 1866. In the latter part of the month I resigned my office of managing director. In that month there had been rumours of the financial position of the company, and Messrs. Quilter, Ball, and Co. had been occupied in investigating the accounts of the company. The general meeting of the company was held on the 31st of January, 1866. I was present. A committee of investigation was appointed at that meeting, and after their appointment the committee had daily meetings, and so had the board I believe. Johann Gustaf Carl Pontus Kleman was a customer of the company, upon a loan and discount account, which account commenced soon after the company was formed. The nature of our dealings with him was that he would bring bills to us for discount like an ordinary merchant. The company debited him with the cash advanced by the company on bills or otherwise, and credited him with the bills when received, or any cash he might pay. On the 31st of December, 1865, the company was in advance to Eleman to the extent of 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. This was a balance unsecured and carried on to the next year. At the end of January, 1866, that balance had increased to the sum of 108,789<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was un<lb/>secured. None of the advances made to Kleman after the 3rd of February, 1866, were, I believe, brought specifically to the notice of the directors. The advances appear iu the loan ledger, marked T4, and in the advance ledger, marked T5. The advances which had been made to Kleman between the 1st of January and the 1st of February, 1866, which increased the balance to his debit to the sum of 108,789<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., were not specifi<lb/>cally brought before the board of directors, nor were any advances gene<lb/>rally speaking brought before the board, but there was a book which contained every cheque which was drawn, and for whom it was drawn, always upon the board table; in other words, every director who signed a cheque could know for whom it was signed. The directors were in the habit of leaving-cheques signed in blank, that is to say, without any num<lb/>ber or amount being filled in, and without the name of any payee being put on the counterfoil. Ordinarily the director who was in the weekly rota for signing cheques when he came to the office would go upstairs and sign a lot of cheques, and then go away. I believe that the cheques for the advances which appear to Kleman's debit in the loan ledger were signed in the above manuer. I refer to the account of Messrs. Capper, Escombe, and Lawson, at page 226 of the loan ledger, and as to the item on the debit side under date 28th August, 1865, I say that sum must have been advanced to them with my knowledge and authority, but I do not recollect for what purpose the advance was made. I had no account with them personally, but I had done business with them as brokers. I can't recollect that I was personally indebted to them in the year 1865. The loan ledger was not nor were any books kept under my superintendence. On the 28th August, 1865, a cheque for 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid by the company's bankers out of its funds. Looking at the counterfoil of the cheque No. 7660 at the bankers' pass book, marked 5 L, and the account of Capper, Escombe, and Lawson in the loan ledger, I have no doubt the sum of 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to Messrs. Capper, Escombe, and Co. by the company on the 28th August,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701070039"/>
               <p>1865, as a loan. I should say, generally speaking, that persons applying to the company for a loan would see me before the loan was made. Capper, Escombe, and Co. have applied to me for loans. I have no doubt that Capper, Escombe, and Co. were debtors to the company on the 7th March, 1866, in the balance which appears to their debit in the loan ledger, being 959<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in respect of the before-mentioned loan of 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and interest from the time of the advance." <hi rend="italic">Further examined on the</hi> 31<hi rend="italic">st of October</hi>:—"I do not know what the company got from Mr. Kleman for the 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced to him on 3rd February, 1866. I cannot tell whether he could have received the money without its passing through my hands, until I see the cheque. No one ought to draw a cheque on the company's funds without authority. I should certainly say that all the cheques drawn in behalf of the company while I was managing director were not drawn by my authority. In practice all the proposals for loans or advances to customers of the company or discount of bills were submitted to me, and were not entertained without my approval. I cannot recollect any single instance of an advance or loan or discount of bills being made by the company to a customer which had not been approved by me. While I was in the office I believe that every advance made to Mr. Kleman by the company was made with my authority. I was away from the office a week in the month of September, and a week or ten days in January, 1866. During my absence I think Mr. Hill performed my duties, but I should not like to say. I believe that advances and discounts were made just the same in my absence as while I was there. During my absence I do not remember that I had correspondence on the affairs of the company. I was at the office in the first week of February, 1866. I have no doubt thai the advance to Kleman of 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 3rd February, 1866, was made with my authority. The security which the company would get for the 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be bills or cheques. It was perfectly well known to the directors that advances were being made to Kleman, and that there was a large balance due from him on the 31st December, 1865, amounting to over 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I was not aware that the balance due from Kleman had increased between the 31st December, 1865, and the 31st January, 1866, to over 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so I never commun<lb/>icated to the directors. I do not know whether the company had any security for the balance of 108,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due from Kleman, nor do I know of any book of the company from which that information can be derived. Kleman was a large commission agent. I had an account with him per<lb/>sonally. He does not owe me anything. There is an open account between us. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you received any money from Kleman? (<hi rend="italic">The witness objected to answer this and other questions, as relating to private trans<lb/>actions between himself and Mr. Kleman.</hi>) I have not kept any books since January, 1866. I can't recollect where I recorded my private transactions with Mr. Kleman. They amounted to 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I can't say from what materials I could make out an account between myself and Mr. Kleman or check his account. I have not in my possession any materials, memoranda, or papers from which I could make out an account with Mr. Kleman of any transactions. I have no letters in my possession from Mr. Kleman, and I think I never had to the best of my recollection. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you keep a banking account at the present time? (<hi rend="italic">The witness declined to answer.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you kept a banking account since the 1st of January, 1866? (<hi rend="italic">The witness declined to answer.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has Kleman made advances to you from time to time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has rendered an account. I do not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701070040"/>
               <p>know where Kleman is now. I saw him about two or three months ago in London. I do not know whether any portion of the balance of 108,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due from Kleman on the 31st January, 1866, has been paid. I look at the advance ledger, marked T6. I do not know what was the balance due from Kleman on the 3rd March, 1866. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any reason to doubt that the entry to the debit of Kleman at page 12 of Exhibit T6 of 184,838<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is correct, and that that sum was on that day due from him to the company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing about it. It formed no part of my duty as managing director of the company to receive moneys on account of the company, and I have received no moneys from Mr. Kleman on account of the company since the 31st January, 1866. I decline to answer the question so far as it relates to private transactions between me and Mr. Kleman, inasmuch as there are important questions pending between us relative thereto. I protest against your right to ask a question as to my banking account, but I state that I have had no private banking account since the stoppage of the company. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What date do you refer to when you speak of the stoppage of the company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can give on other answer. I look at the minute book of the company, market T I was present at the meeting of the 1st March, 1866. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the company then stopped payment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you a banking account on that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By that answer do you mean that you don't know or that you decline to say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't recollect. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who were your private bankers before that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Bar-nett, Hoare, and Co. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you drawn out all the money that stood to your credit with them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I decline to answer. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where are your old pass books with Barnett, Hoare, and Co. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have them in my possession. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And the counterfoils of the cheques you drew upon them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I may or may not have them. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you, to your knowledge or belief, destroyed any counterfoils of cheques drawn by you on Barnett, Hoare, and Co. since the 1st June, 1866? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my knowledge or belief. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, if not destroyed, they would necessarily be in your possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I have no doubt they are."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector K</hi>). On the night of the 5th De<lb/>cember, a few minutes after twelve o'clock, I went to the prisoner's house, 3, Queen's Terrace, Commercial Road, Rotherhithe—I had been to a large fire at Bow Common, and was called from there by Smith, and rode with the salvage corps men on their waggon—when I arrived I found Sherman in the shop—there is a window in the shop door, the shutter of which was driven in, so that there was a large aperture in the door, and the door was found partly open—there were bolts on both sides, and it was still bolted on the back or hinge side, and the socket of the bolt was strained or bent—the shop was full of smoke, and there was a little fire flickering round the gas pendant at the ceiling—some crinolines were hung about the shop suspended to strings—the firemen were at that moment extinguishing a fire under the counter the further end from the shop door, trampling and kicking it—it consisted of paper, a portion of an umbrella, burnt, and the remains of some children's stays, and rags—the fire under the counter was nine feet distant from the fire round the pendant, taking a vertical line, and the face of the counter would prevent any fire falling under it; you have to go round it or over it to look under—there was no fire between the two I have described—I then went upstairs and found a fire on the floor in the front room and firemen extinguishing it—it corresponded with the fire about the pendant downstairs, only that it was larger on the upper side; it was about fifteen inches square, while that underneath was about nine inches by five—the gas pendant was fixed to the rafters of the ceiling—the burner was three feet four inches from the ceiling—the hole imme<lb/>diately over the gas pendant was about fifteen inches square and was com<lb/>pletely destroyed—the whole of that room was on fire; it was charred all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701070042"/>
               <p>round—there were two beds in that room about two feet from the square hole and within reach of the flames—I then went to the back room and found the paper all stripped down, from the ceiling downwards, and hang<lb/>ing in festoons across the door about breast high; it had come clean away from the wall, and the part which had been pasted over the door hung across it; it was as if the paste had been damp, it had come away so easily—before I could get into the room I had to divide the paper by a stroke of my hand, as I could not get in walking upright—I then looked under the bed—there was no fire in that room that I observed, but one of the flooring boards was raised about three-eighths of an inch above the level of the others—this is the board (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I examined it again next day, and found it charred on the under side; it smelt strongly of paraffin, which was on the under side, and the edges of the boards on each side were saturated with paraffin—I saw this rubbish (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) taken from immediately under the board; it was tried there and then, and it burnt as an inflammable oil would burn, though it is ordinary plaster—it still smells strongly—a piece of shaving was also lighted and it burnt—I found the ceiling underneath that place stained with oil to the extent of thirty inches by eighteen—I got a fireman to push a long screwdriver through at that spot, and had a portion of the ceiling cut away with an axe, and have a portion of it here—it smells strongly of paraffin—a piece of it was ignited at the police-court by the Magistrate's order, and it burnt with a clear flame, as gas or oil would burn—I examined the plaister round the gas pendant in front of the shop, and it was in a similar state for about forty-one inches by fifteen (the first place was where the gas pipe goes through to the back of the shop)—I found that that burnt clearly also—the fanlight was obscured by a large piece of board, fastened by two screws at either end, which would prevent the flare of the flame being seen from the street—on the floor of the front kitchen I found some sawdust and small chips of wood, showing that somebody had been at work—I have applied them to the board which was taken down from the fanlight and they correspond—a door was missing from the coal cellar, and I found that it was part of it which was over the fanlight—I found the whole of the door—it had been recently sawn, and I found a saw and sawdust on the cloth of the kitchen table—the fireman handed me, in the parlour on the night of the fire, a bottle of paraffin containing nearly a pint, and I found a paper in a box on the sideboard. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHARLES YOUNG</hi>, <hi rend="italic">solicitor, here proved the service of a notice upon the prisoner, and also upon his solicitort to produce his policy of insurance.</hi>) I read the paper to the inspector of the fire brigade, and the superinten-deut of the salvage corps, and then put it back into the same box—I made a search for it afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a member of the salvage corps which is attached to the insurance office—I saw Inspector Griffin take a paper from a box on the premises and return it to the box—a few hours after that I saw it in the prisoner's hands, he read some portion of it to me, and I never saw it afterwards—I was left in possession.</p>

It was headed "Liverpool, London, and Globe Insurance," and purported to be the insurance of Frederick Bicknell, on his furniture and effects and cooper's tools; but there was a clause that they were not to be used on the premises—the house was stated to be 3, Queen's Terrace, and that it was in trust for his wife, a stay and crinoline manufacturer—the policy was stamped—there was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the furniture and effects, and I think 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the stock in trade, 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the shop fittings and fixtures, and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on cooper's tools, the whole making 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 23rd October was one date, and another was 9th November—I produce a list of the effects in the various rooms, made by a constable and myself, he wrote it while I called them over—those are all the goods which were on the premises—on the night of the fire I saw the prisoner at his house about twenty minutes past one o'clock with his wife, two children, a little servant girl, and two men—he gained access to-the house by the back door—I know that, because I was at the front door, and he did not pass in that way—the salvage corps man called me, and I found the prisoner in the back parlour—I said to him, "Are you the proprietor of this place?"—he said, "I am; this is a mysterious matter; can you account for it? it is a bad job"—I said, "It is to be hoped you are insured?"—he said, "I have been to an office, but it is so recently that I am not sure they will pay me"—I said, "If you have paid your premium and got your receipt and policy they will pay you"—he said, "If they do not I am a ruined man"—we walked about the premises, and there was a good deal of conversation as to where his family should sleep that night—next day I went to the docks with Mr. Rees, who began to ask the prisoner questions—I said, "You had better stop, I am going to apprehend him; I am not allowed to ask him questions, and you cannot do it"—Mr. Rees said, "You are insured in our office; do you mean to make any claim?"—he said, "Of course I must be recompensed" or "compensated for my loss"—I then took him in a cab to Arbour Square Sta<lb/>tion and charged him—I found a paraffin lamp, on the night of the fire, stand<lb/>ing on the mantelpiece, the chimney was unattached and lay behind the lamp; the fireman raised it and said, "This lamp is empty"—the brass part of the burner was hanging aside loose—these are termed crinolines (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but they are not; the waist is sewn together—these three are entirely saturated.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>had been thrown before I arrived—I do not know how many, but only on the first floor rooms, which were a little wet—the shop was perfectly dry—they had broken two bars from the landing window where there is a cistern, and they had two buckets—these crinolines are <hi rend="italic">dummies</hi>, such as tradesmen hang about—the gas meter is under a framework for goods to be exposed upon, in front of the shop under the window, and the pipe is laid from that—it ascends and runs between the ceiling and the flooring to where the pendant is, and afterwards to where the second batch of paraffin was—the gas pipe was melted—there had been a good deal of fire in the front room when I arrived—the flame had spread through the whole of that room—the fire under the counter was nineteen or twenty feet from the meter—ten persons may have arrived before me—I mean to say that I read the paper so carefully as to tell you the contents—the fire was wholly extinguished then, but I stopped to see the proprietor come home, to judge what I should do—I have used the words "a paper which appeared to be a policy of insurance," because I was not allowed to say that it was a policy, but I know what a policy of insurance is, because I am insured myself—the prisoner came home at twenty minutes to one, and remained about half an hour—he sent his wife away first, and there was a tall gentleman named Strannick; he left the house I think before me—there was a great deal of conversation, and he said he was determined on going to the inspectors of the fire brigade, and they should find him a lodging—I had not drawn his attention to the policy, but I asked him if he was insured—he left saying that he would see the super-intendant, and I left just afterwards—Mr. East came down in the morn<lb/>ing, and after a conversation with him I determined to apprehend the prisoner—I found him at his work—he is a foreman cooper at St. Katherine's Docks—his family had gone to 101, East Street, their servant's house—I had a constable to watch them there—I do not know what became of the prisoner—I had a constable to watch him also—he told me that he should go to the fire brigade station, Wellclose Square, and I found that he did so—I have been close upon twenty-one years in the police, and have been to every fire in the district—flame will not often go round corners, but it will follow a gas escape—I have had my attention drawn to many fires, the cause of which was never discovered, and some were very suspicious ones—fires frequently arise from trifling matters—the paraffin lamp on the back parlour mantelpiece, did not appear to have been overturned, there was no paraffin about, nor was the lamp or the glass broken—the shop goes into both rooms, and there is a room built out beyond, which is used as a sitting-room—there were no candles or matches in the shop, they could not have been burnt there unless they were under the counter—this fanlight would shut the view of the flames out from the street, but that would not apply to the fire on the first floor—I saw that on my arrival, and the windows were cracking and flying—the fire originated in two places, lighted within a minute of each other—I should imagine that the fire upstairs was lighted first, a person would not light the downstairs first and go up afterwards, for fear he should not escape.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the salvage corps, and have been attached to the fire brigade nearly nine years—on the 5th of December I was at the fire on Row Common, and from information I re<lb/>ceived I went to the prisoner's house about twenty minutes to twelve—the first floor was burning fiercely about the ceiling of the shop, and the floo<lb/>ring of the room over it—I managed to put it out, and then returned to the shop and saw a second fire under the counter, twelve or fourteen feet from the level of where the fire was burning on the ceiling—it was a quantity of rubbish and waste paper, and some cuttings like these, used in their busi<lb/>ness—I saw some crinolines hanging up, to which paraffin or something of that description had been applied—as no water was to be had, I stamped out the fire under the counter, and kicked it about the place—next morning I saw that the ceiling not only in the front but in the back room was stained, showing that oil or grease of some kind had been used, and a board in the back room was half an inch above the level of the ordinary flooring, showing that it had been lifted up and not properly placed back again—I saw that something had been thrown under it, and each side of the board was marked with oil; if the oil had been placed in while the board laid there the board would have been smothered with it as well—I took out some rubbish, applied a light to it, and it burnt as brightly as a candle, or more so, and so did the plaster ceiling underneath, which I tried a piece of—a piece of paper steeped in paraffin could not burn much fiercer—the fanlight over the door was blocked up—I saw some wood and sawdust in the kitchen corresponding with the wood over the fanlight—there is no doubt that the fire in the ceiling originated in the flooring over the ceiling, but not from the gas, and my impression is that it began between the flooring and the ceiling of the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant warehousckeeper in St. Katherine's Docks, and have been in their employ eleven or twelve years—I am twenty-seven years old—I have known the prisoner almost the whole time, but was not in the habit of going to his house till seven months ago</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701070051"/>
               <p>—I called there on the night of the fire about twenty minutes to seven to pay a bill for a pair of stays made by his wife, which the girl Margaret had brought to my house a few days previously—his family had left, the girl Lizzy was there, and the prisoner was asleep in the back parlour—I knew he was not well and did not wake him, but sat in the parlour till he awoke—I then offered him the money for the stays, but he said that he would not take it, he never interfered in the business—he was going upstairs to change his clothes, and said, "Do not remain there by yourself, come up with me," and he went into a bedroom over the shop—I went into the room with him and remained while he changed a portion of his clothes, we went down together; he had a lamp which he had taken up with him, but I cannot say whether it was brought down—we went into the back parlour, and he finished dressing himself there—the shop was not closed then, he did not shut up till about nine—he shut it up himself—I saw the girl Stevens there, she brought some ale and steak, I ate a portion of it, he was too ill to eat any, and the girl Stevens ate some—she loft at about half-past nine, and we left about ten—the prisoner shut the shop up—the house was closed, he put up the shutters about nine, but did not close up then, he closed up directly the girl left—when he bolted the door he said, "I do not think it is safe to leave the house like that, it is not secure," and that he had got a board which he had prepared some time before, which was too long, and he would go down in the kitchen and saw an inch off—I did not see him saw it, I did not go down with him, but he brought it up and I held it while he fastened it up over the fanlight—it was done that night because he said that he did not think it was safe to leave the fanlight, as there were many bad characters in front of the house, and the house had not been left empty before—we went out at the back entrance—he was perfectly sober—I saw no ladder, nor any paraffin oil on the floor—the shop seemed secure—he left one gas burner burning in the shop, I cannot say how many burners were alight, but all the burners were not alight, he turned down some, but not all—those which were not turned out were full on I think—I did not see the time, but I should think it was ten or a quarter past, I am sure it was not later—we went into the Commercial Road near Whitechapel Church, and through Aldgate, Leadenhall Street, Cheapside, and Holborn, to Weston's—they had left Weston's, and the prisoner asked a gentleman if they were all out; he said that there might be a few gentlemen left—the prisoner said that most likely he should see his wife at the Exchange waiting for a bus—we went to the Exchange and saw them there at a few minutes after twelve o'clock; I returned with them and went into the house, which was in the possession of the police and the firemen, but the fire was out—from the time I left the house with the prisoner, between ten and a quarter past, till we returned with his wife neither he or I went back to the house.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701070052"/>
               <p>—there was a pair of steps in the shop—I did not know that he cut up a door—I had not been down in the kitchen—he did not go upstairs again after the girl left—I remained in the back parlour—I could not see the staircase from there, but I could hear if he went upstairs ordi<lb/>narily—when we went out at the back door he locked it after us and took the key with him—I did not notice anybody as we went out—we did not go into the York Road, but into the Commercial Road—the back door is about ten yards from the Commercial Road—it opens into the York Road, or else we could not leave the house—you get from York Road into the Commercial Road—I saw some crinolines hanging about the shop—I did not notice the ceiling—I went upstairs, because the prisoner said, "Do not stop there by yourself, come up with me"—he changed his clothes soon after I went there—I noticed nothing about the flooring at that time, and I think I should have noticed if it had been raised, because I walked to the window and looked out into the street—I think I can say that the floor was not damaged—he only went up once—I should not like to swear that he did not bring the lamp down with him and blow it out—I am almost positive he blew it out, but I do not remember it—he did not continue to burn it, because there was gas—I do not know where I saw it last, but I think it very probable he brought it down and blew it out—I do not remember whether he took any light when he went down to saw the wood; he must have had the lamp—I cannot remember whether he brought the lamp back when we were screwing the wood up—I have been joint security for him, and a borrower as well, at Aldgate—he was joint security for me when I bor<lb/>rowed 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there about three months ago—it is nearly two years ago that I was joint security for him—he renewed it again—it was for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was lent to me when he was security—after the fire I went to business and remained there all day—I did not hear of the prisoner being taken till after four o'clock that day—all the next day I remained at business, and on Friday I went to business in the morning and was taken ill at two o'clock, and obliged to go into one of the waterclosets—I remained there till about half-past three or four o'clock—my illness was the rupture of a blood vessel—I remained in the watercloset on the premises an hour and a half—I vomited blood before I got to the closet—no one came while I was there—besides the vomiting, there were some sores on my arm—I did not show the inspector and the doctor marks and cuts on my arm; I have-a sore place here, and another here—one is a chilblain and the other a boil—I did not afterwards show a wound on my upper arm—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my knife, I have never seen it before—I did not notice it in the closet—on my oath I had not this knife in the closet at the time I was there—I do not see an S on it—I had a doctor previous to seeing the police inspector—I did not write and tell the doctor I had cut my arm by a tin case, I said by a box of fruit—I showed him the sore and told him about my vomiting blood—I did not cut my arm in two or three places in the closet, and it was not from that that the blood came in the closet—I went home after I got out of the closet, and remained at home all day and the next day, but I went up to Mr. Lewis's, at Ely Pluce, the prisoner's attorney, on Monday—I was well enough to do that—I was very bad, but it was necessary, and I went—after that I went back home—I went back to work last Monday week—I did not give Mr. Lewis an <hi rend="italic">anecdote</hi> of what took place—I did not go to the police-court.</p>

               <p>unfortunately the whole family suffer from the complaint—I lost a sister six months ago from decline—the doctor's name is Clark—I actually vomited blood that day—there is no truth in the suggestion of my cutting my arm—on the Thursday, the day after the fire, I went to work as usual, and the prisoner was there—I heard after business that he was apprehended—I was going to leave, with the intention of going to the police-court, and had got as far as I could get, when I was taken with that feeling in my throat, and was so ill in the closet that I was obliged to remain—the doctor saw me next day—I have lived at 2, Wellesley Street, Stepney, four years—I heard of the prisoner's remand and went to Mr. Lewis on Monday, and what was done was under his directions—the prisoner's brother was with Mrs. Bickneli when we met her at the Royal Exchange—the prisoner's house is in Ratcliff, it is a long way from there to Weston's—he and I walked to Weston's—I can say that from the time he and I came down stairs together, before the girl left, he never went up stairs again.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hartland Road, Kentish Town—on 15th December, about half-past eleven, I was in the Hampstead Road, going towards home—Cooper accosted me and induced me to go to a public-house—it was late and the bar was being turned out, so the landlord would not draw anything to drink there—she appeared to be known to him and he drew her a gallon of beer in a jar, which I paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for—I afterwards went home with her—another woman was there—I was there for about half an hour—when I wanted to go away she took my hat—some one I supposed to be the landlord, demanded 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of me—I said I would not pay—a little time after that Connor came in and demanded 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said Cooper was his wife and that he should have 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when he found I would not give it he knocked me against the wall, hitting me at the same time—Cooper struck me, too, seven or eight times—then Connor put his right arm round my neck, and with his left extracted 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a latch-key from my pocket—he then said I had more money than that—I told him I had not—he tried to get my coat off—by this time I was beginning to get half stupefied, and, believing their meaning was that I should not get out of the house alive, I got out of the room on to the landing and rushed to the staircase window—the prisoners ran after me and tried to keep me back—I broke the window in trying to get out, and sang out "Police! murder!"—I then rushed over the stairs, holding my head, half insensible, and a policeman was outside the door when I got there—I asked where the beer was when I was there, and Cooper gave me three parts of a cup full—I saw nothing of the jar of beer—I was not drinking with the woman when Connor came in—I never said I would give them a song.</p>

               <p>on my property—on 13th December, as I was in Ludgate Hill, my atten<lb/>tion was called to some auction rooms at No. 43, Ludgate Hill—I went in—Levine, Wood, two females, and another man were there—Levine was in the rostrum and Wood was on his right—a man came round and showed the goods on a waiter—they were put up by Levine for sale, and Wood generally made the first bid—I saw about half a dozen lots knocked down to Wood, but did not see any money pass—they appeared to be electro<lb/>plated goods—saltsellers were put up which were bought by Miss Levine I believe, a lady with frizzly hair—a tea and coffee service was put up and Wood bid for it—it was started at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it was knocked down for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not bid for it—before it was knocked down Levine said he would warrant them the best silver, genuine electro plate, and lined with gold, and the cost price would be 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when it was knocked down Wood said it was worth more than 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Levine called me up and asked me for my ad<lb/>dress—I told him my name was Baron—he said, "The lot was knocked down to you"—I said it was not—before that Wood wanted to know if it was knocked down to him, and Levine said, "No, it was knocked down to that gentleman," pointing to me—he said, "You need only pay a depositn—I said, "No, I will pay the full amount"—I told him more than once that I did not bid and that they were no use to me, and he said they were worth more money, and he would warrant them—I said if they were knocked down to me I would pay for them, and I did pay for them—it was the representa<lb/>tion of Levine, warranting them the best silver plate, lined with gold, that induced me to part with my money—some other things were put up, which I did not bid for, but they were knocked down to me five or six different times—Wood caused a dispute about them—he said he bid 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and asked me if I bid—I said "No," and he went to the auctioneer, who said they were not his, but they were mine—the first time he put them up he said he knocked them down to himself, and Wood said that an auctioneer could not have the first bid, and that he could not have them himself—the second time Wood said he would stand 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—they were knocked down to me—they were put up again—a gentleman asked me if I bid, and I said no, and he went to the auctioneer and said he bid 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and they were his, and they were put up a third time, and the same happened again—I did not bid on that occasion—they were put; up again after that—Wood wanted me to pay a deposit, and said they were his, and he said, "You are standing out for a shilling, and if you want another shilling I will give it to you"—that was the end of it—they were knocked down to Wood, who said he had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to spend there, and he might as well make a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note as anybody else—after that a liqueur stand was put up, which I bid for—Wood bid for it first, while my back was turned—I heard his voice distinctly—he said that he would warrant it the best electro plate and the best cut glass—that was before the goods were knocked down—he called me up again and said, "That was knocked down to you at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said it was not and that I did not bid—I said I would pay the money down, because he warranted it the best silver electro plate and the best cut glass, and I paid the money as before—after I said I did not bid for it, and I would not take it, Wood kept on taunting me and said that I had no money—Levine wanted me to leave the goods behind, and he would send them after me, and I said I would take them with me—during the time I was in the auction room I saw no money paid except what I paid—I took the goods away with me—about an hour after that I went to Messrs. Benson's, in Ludgate Hill, with the</p>

Such a count in Syders</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">the Queen had been held good on a writ of error, but it had never been held good before judgment. Another objection was that there was no evidence of conspiracy, and, lastly, that if there was any question of conspiracy, it could only to be to obtain the prosecutor's money by repre<lb/>sentations which were perfectly lawful, on the authority of the Queen</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Bryan.</hi>

Those Counts, therefore, fail, and it is only neces<lb/>sary to determine whether this case is governed by the Queen</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Bryan, for the purpose of seeing whether the Count for conspiracy can be maintained. It is most important not to bring within the criminal law the ordinary enhancing of value and quality, by the seller of goods. There is always a conflict of knowledge and skill between a buyer and seller, the one wishing to buy as advantageously and the other wishing to sell as advantageously as he possibly can, and it would be very dangerous to extend the criminal law to such cases. At present the line is fixed, and there must be a false representation of an existing fact, operat<lb/>ing upon the mind of the buyer, and deceiving him in such a manner that he cannot protect himself against it. The only means suggested upon this evidence as the means by which the defendants agreed to obtain the prosecutor's money are means which, upon the authority of the Queen</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Bryan, are not unlawful. There is therefore no conspiracy, and no case for the Jury to consider.</hi>

I was on duty on Tuesday night in High Street, Fulham—the prisoner is a boot and shoe maker at No. 63—the house next to his was occupied by an oil and colourman—at twelve o'clock my attention was called to the prisoner's house—he was at his passage door—there are two doors, one into the shop and one into the private part of the house—he said, "Some one has been throwing fire-works into my passage, and likewise placing squibs under my shop door"—he also said, "I shall go to a Magistrate"—I said that would be useless, he had only to refer to the police, and they would make every investigation, and that I would do all in my power to investigate and find out who had done it—he said one of the squibs in the shop had exploded, and the other two he put his foot on and trod them out—he produced the remains of one—I was standing at the passage door—I went into the shop—he gave me these two squibs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I took away with me—he said it was a very bad job, and that it was a very dangerous practice to throw them in—I said it was, and I would do all in my power to try and find them out—then the sergeant came, and we went and examined the place with the prisoner, to see if anything was set on fire, and we found no fire, either in the shop, passage, or parlour—the prisoner said he was satisfied there was nothing on fire, and I then went away—at the time the prisoner called me I did not see any person near him in the street—about a quarter to one, being still on the same beat, I heard a cry of "Fire!" and "Police!"—I was then about 150 yards from the prisoner's house—I went there and found the shop window, shop boards, and counter in flames—I did not see anything of the prisoner then—I went to get the water turned on, and with the assistance of others the fire was put out—the children were escaping from the house at the time—I did not go away from the house when I went to get the water turned on—it might have been ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after I went to the house and saw the flames that I saw the prisoner—he was in the passage—I fancied I could smell more fire about the place somewhere, and said, "What is that door leading from the shop?"—he said, "That is my little back parlour"—I said, "Will you open the door?"—he said, "Yes," and opened it—as soon as the door was opened I said, "I believe the fire is in here"—he said, "I think it is"—the door was closed, not locked—he went across to the farther end of the parlour, opened a little cupboard, and said, "Here it is"—there are two folding doors to the cupboard—I found a bundle of papers tied up in the cupboard on fire—they were at the bottom of the cupboard, level with the floor—it was a side cupboard with a shelf at the top—this is a portion of the papers—it was smouldering—they were about nine inches high—it was a square bundle, tied up tight round the middle—they were pieces of <hi rend="italic">Bow Bells</hi> and pieces of music—all the woodwork of the cupboard was scorched inside by the fire—the cupboard doors were shut when I went in—the upper portion of the cupboard had no appearance of fire whatever—there was no fire in any other part of the parlour—I examined it carefully—there were no means, as far as I could observe, by which the contents of the cupboard could be set on fire by anything outside it—I felt it to be my duty to detain the prisoner, and communicated with Inspector Prescott, who came there that night and went partly through the premises with me—on detaining the prisoner I asked him how he could account for the fire in his cupboard—he said he could account for it in no other way but the fireworks coming from the door across the parlour into the cupboard—this</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have been living in the house nine months. I never went to a public-house. I was sitting in my parlour reading, and, my child having the whooping-cough, and my wife also having a cough, I went upstairs with them and came down again. I was going upstairs to tell my wife what a noise there was, when I heard another explosion. I said I would go the next day to a Magistrate, but my lodger told me to go to a policeman that night. I told the policeman I should go to a Magis<lb/>trate the next day, and showed him the two squibs not exploded. I never thought of looking in the cupboard. I went to bed till about ten minutes or a quarter past twelve, when Simpson said the house was on fire. I ran down, I thought with the key of my shop, but when Simpson asked for it I could not find it. There being a good supply of water, I worked with the rest and put the fire out. I went over the house with the police, and found fifty-two <hi rend="italic">Bow Bells</hi>, which were smouldering. There were two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in the cupboard, and in the excitement I did not think of them; but I thought of them when I was in prison, and the name on one of them was Williams and Sanders. I was about to fill the lamp, and the top of it came off, and the oil ran into the cupboard. I stated at the police-court where I bought the oil. On the first examination the inspector said the bottle was dry, which I deny. The carpet did not reach the door by two inches. Simpson said there was not a person in the street. On the second exam<lb/>ination he was not present, and Mitchell gave evidence that a person went out of my house. Simpson said on his first examination that he left the house and went to the pump. I have lived for forty years without a stain on my character, and I should not endanger my wife and child in that manner.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner in his defence stated that he had been clerk to Mr. Brutton, a solicitor, having offices in Regent Street, who had given him his confidence; that he then learned that the prosecutrix, with whom Mr. Brutton lived at Foxcrofl Villa, Brompton, was not his wife, although the ceremony of a mock marriage had been gone through between them, for he was in fact married to another lady, who was still alive; that he kneivfrom the prosecutrix's own lips that she was well aware at the time of the ceremony that Mr. Brutton was a married man; that a great quarrel took place between Mr. Brutton and the prosecutrix, and that they then separated and proceedings were commenced against Mr. Brutton for bigamy. They, however, became again reconciled, and immediately began blackguarding him, although he had acted faithfully and kindly towards both, and had spent a great deal of his money in the pro<lb/>secutrix's service, and commenced an action against her to recover it, but, these proceedings being brought against him, he was obliged to countermand the action, and urged that they were brought for no other purpose than to compel him to do so. He admitted writing the letter to Captain Oldham, but stated that he could prove that the allegations in it were true. The prosecutrix had committed perjury in swearing, as he would show she had, that none of the furniture at Foxcroft Villa had ever been Mr. Brutton's property. He was aware that she had not committed bigamy in the legal sense, but would show that she had done so in the popular sense. As regarded the charge of murder, he had her confession of it from her own lips, and would call a witness to whom she had also admitted it.</hi>

               <p>Miss Trimble pat in a claim to the goods—they were levied upon as the property of Mr. Brut ton—there is an interpleader pending in the case between Mr. Pike and Miss Trimble, the money having been paid into Court—I recollect the prisoner coming to the office on that matter, but I had no conversation with him—it was discussed in the office whether a summons should be taken out against Miss Trimble for perjury—notice of the trial of the interpleader has been given for the first sitting of next term—it has been made a special jury cause—the effect of that will no doubt be to throw it over—it is in the Common Pleas, and I do not suppose it can be tried till next Trinity Term—the act of throwing it over by appointing a special jury was that of the plaintiff's attorney.</p>

                  </hi>. I am twenty-two years of age—about four years ago, I suppose, I became acquainted with Mr. Brutton—I was staying with some friends in London backwards and forwards—when I became acquainted with him I certainly did not know he was married—of course I understood he was not—he promised to marry me when he hould be a little more successful, in a few years' time—he seduced me—up to that time I was a virtuous girl, Mr. Brutton has never contra<lb/>dicted that—I had heard for a long time that he had a mistress, I met her on several occasions, and she always abused me—I did not know that that lady was his wife—I had spoken to Mr. Brutton about it—I ulti<lb/>mately married Mr. Brutton—most certainly I believed him to be a bachelor when I married him—during the time I was living with Mr. Brutton I became in the family way twice—I miscarried on the first occasion—I think it was about five months that I had been in the family way at the time—the child was most certainly dead—I became in the family way again—that continued about two months—then I miscarried again—I think it was about three months after the first miscarriage that I miscar<lb/>ried again—a doctor attended me oa both occasions—I never had a child born alive—I have never gone to so long as seven months—I have never told the cook or any one else that my last child was a seven months' child, and that it had been put into a bowl and smothered—I could not—Fox<lb/>croft Villa is my property—quite 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of the furniture was pur<lb/>chased since I went into the house—I had some goods in the house that had been in the house at South Bank, but they were my goods from the time they were purchased—when the execution was put in, I consulted an attorney on the subject, and made an affidavit that the goods were mine, and had never been Mr. Brutton's—that is according to my construction—Mr. Brutton and I several times quarrelled—he promised to leave some times, but did not—I think it was about last May when I first saw the prisoner—I understood he was in Mr. Brutton's employment—soon after that time I had a quarrel with Mr. Brutton, and we separated—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in the prisoner's writing—I received it soon after the separation—Mr. Brutton always told me that the prisoner's name was Barnard; that he had taken the name of Banyard; that he was a preacher or something—I received this letter from Mr. Brutton after he came back to me—(<hi rend="italic">The letter was signed by the prisoner and addressed to Mr. Brutton, advising him, now that he had got the prosecutrix back through the writer's instrumentality, not to leave her till he got the money</hi>)—this other letter is also in his writing—I should say I received it about two months ago—(<hi rend="italic">This was from the prisoner to the prosecutrix, apologising for his rudeness in persisting in endeavouring to see her, and asking to be reitistated in the position he had before held in her esteem</hi>)—I don't owe the prisoner anything—he</p>

Barnetts are out"—I did not unload the goods, but sent the van to deliver goods elsewhere, with instructions to come back—while the cart was away the prisoner came in—he seemed rather annoyed, and said, "Why were the goods not un loaded?" or something to that effect—he came straight in to me—I said, "Because I had instructions not to leave them without the money," and presented the invoice to him and left it with him—this is a copy of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not put that two and a half per cent on in the invoice—I also delivered this delivery order (<hi rend="italic">produced—Invoice read</hi>:—"London, November 8th, 1866, Messrs.

I am a labourer, of Stratford, West Ham—on the 14th December, about twenty minutes to five, I was talking to the pro<lb/>secutor in Maryland Road, Stratford New Town—the prisoner came past—as he passed the prosecutor said to me, "Is that that painter that struck you at Forest Grate?"—I said, "Yes"—the prisoner turned round and said, "What have you got to say about the painter?"—he hauled some<lb/>thing oui of his pocket and said, "I'll strike a knife into the first b----I come near"—he then rushed at the prosecutor and struck him in the hip—directly he had done it I heard something click, and he ran away as fast as he could—the prosecutor fell against the fence sideways—I set him on a large stone—he put his hand in his trousers and said, "I am stabbed"—I saw some blood, and took him to the dispensary—I knew the prisoner before—I am sure he is the man.</p>

I live at Stratford New Town, West Ham—on Friday, the 14th December, I was standing in Maryland Road with James Ainsworth and the prosecutor, between half-past four and twenty minutes to five in the afternoon—I saw the prisoner come past—the prosecutor said to Ains worth, "Is that the painter who struck you at Forest Gate?"—the prisoner turned round and said, "What have you got to say about the painter? I will stick a knife through the first one I come near"—he then rushed at the prosecutor and struck a knife into hia left hip—I did not see the knife, but I heard it shut—the prisoner ran away—the prosecutor fell against the fence—I helped to put him on some stones.</p>

Mr. Hocking, don't take me; I was only going to mix it"—I saw the sack at the station—it contained bruised barley and pollard, which was mixed—I was in the marsh at the other side of the road at the time the light was turned on.</p>

I am a farmer, living with my father at Green Lanes, Barking—Jones was his carman—on the 29th December I went to the police-station, and saw one of my sacks, a sack containing barley and pol<lb/>lard mixed, which I cannot swear to, but it corresponds with what was on my premises—the value of the whole may be three or four shillings—Jones had no right to take pollard and barley away—he had no occasion to stop at the Coach and Horses to bait, but he could stop to get beer if he liked.</p>

Q.</hi> Would he have to pass the Coach and Horses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there were, I think, sacks like this in my stable—pollard and barley is given to horses, and he might mix it with chaff—it is usual to put chaff with it—I do not give bran and barley to horses without mixing it with chaff—we prefer barley to oats for horses—Jones came with an excellent character, and I am very sorry to be here to prosecute him—he has been in our service a year and a half, and the character we had with him was from a boy, for he had only worked at one place before.</p>

Webb"—I have not got any of those billheads that I am aware of, I have looked for them and cannot find them—I did not give any directions as to how they should be sent Out—I think I have seen some of those billheads since this prosecution commenced, but I am not certain—I did not find any in a box of the prisoner's—I have had a notice to produce them, I do not produce any; I cannot find any—none were returned to me when I came back to London—the prisoner had an account at the London and Westminster Bank while I was away—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a book</hi>) this was the account kept by him, in the name of J. W. and E. Webb, for the purpose of carrying on my business, but not by my direction, I knew nothing about it—it was money that came out of the business, and money advanced by my friends; most, if not all, the money advanced by my friends was used in paying out an execution in Oakley Street and Camberwell—I believe the income received during my absence was placed to this account, and it was as mueh my property then as when I was at home—the money that was at the bank was most assuredly mine, and the bank-book shows it—he handed me the balance when I returned—when I left home in 1857 three friends advanced me three sums, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have here the notes upon which those sums were advanced (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), these were given by the prisoner and signed by him—those sums were advanced, I think I may venture to say, on the security of my good name, no other security was given except these notes—Mr. Patteson, my solicitor, who is deceased, received the money; a friend of mine repaid it for me on my return with my money; every shilling of it was mine—daring my absence "J. W. and E. Webb, late Beattie," was put over the facia of my places of business—upon my return the prisoner received 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that book shows it—I re<lb/>turned before March, 1858—I returned at the end of the former year, but, not having received my protection from Vice-Chancellor Kindersley, and not having settled with the liquidators of the bank, I could not then hold property safely; when I got that protection, and had settled with the bank all demands upon me, then we settled up the affair of the balance, the prisoner received 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and paid over to me 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—since then he has received nothing from me but the wages recorded in this book, except what I gave him in the shape of gratuity—this book commences in 1862—he has stolen the whole of my old books and sold them for waste paper last Christ<lb/>mas twelve months to my stationer. Mr. Paradise, in Queen Street, Cheap-side—after my return I made him presents of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and all that sort of thing—perhaps I did not always enter those advances in the books as gratuities, sometimes they came out of my pocket, and I believe were not entered at all—some were entered as grutuities—here are</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701070098"/>
               <p>two sums of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. entered in the cash-book as gratuities; they are entered in the prisoner's writing—I think they are not entered as gratuities, but they were so—altogether I should say those advances amounted to about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as I never expected any return, I did not keep any particular account of them—about two years before he left I called his attention to some accounts that had been left unpaid—he said they had been overlooked—I said, "Well, you are a very pretty bookkeeper to look after my interests," and three days afterwards those accounts were paid in—that was not a dispute exactly, but I felt annoyed certainly—it was last Christmas twelve months that he gave me this bill—I then charged him with robbery—he did not deny it: he said at first, "I have not taken anything"—I swear that he made out a list of moneys he had received amounting to 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he said that was the amount he had plundered me of; he did not use those words—I do not remember his ever asking me for an increase of wages since my return—he did not ask me for advances or want money from me—I gave him money once when he told me he was pressed upon for rent—I mean to swear that from 1858 up to the time he left he never asked me for anything more than his 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—it was for that alone that he was managing my business, except what I gave him in the shape of gratuities—one night he sent his wife to say he should give me warning, and leave at the end of two weeks, but thereby hangs a tale; he never told me so himself—I never heard that he was about leaving me to become the manager of a dyeing company limited—after the 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. affair I was constantly suspecting him—I think it is very likely I had some conversations or discussions with him, but I cannot charge my memory with any one in particular—very likely I had several—on the morning he absconded I went to his house—I was sent for—he was not there—I broke open his desk by his wife's direction—she was very ill, I sent a message up to her, and asked her if she wished me to do it, and she sent me down word that she wished me to do it—it was a bureau desk—I found nothing in it but dirt and filth, private correspondence, bills for gin and beer, and all that sort of thing, and I think some cheques—I also found some savings bank books—I don't know what I did with them; I have looked about for them repeatedly since and cannot find them—I have every bit of the papers I found, but they relate to his private matters, and I don't think you would like to have them read—I very seldom omitted settling the weekly accounts with him, perhaps I might do so twelve or fourteen times in the course of a year, or it might reach twenty—I can swear that when he omitted to pass an account one week he did not do it in the subsequent week, because I went over the accounts with him, when I came up and ascertained for a certainty what all the money was for, and how applied, and all about it—I have been through all the accounts since 1862.</p>

British Bank, and we advised him to pay them out, not in his own but in the name of somebody else, and it was ultimately agreed that they should be paid out in the name of the prisoner and his sister, and they were to receive the money for the purpose—the leases were to be assigned, some to the pri<lb/>soner and some to his sister, and some to them jointly—I received from Messrs.

I am a shoemaker, and live in Baal Zephon Street, Bermondsey—on the morning of 18th December I was in the Lambeth Road and saw the prosecutor walking along the pavement—I saw a woman go up to him, and there were four men standing pretty close—as he was walking "along he slipped from the kerb and said, "I was nearly down"—the woman came up to him and said, "Did you speak to me?"—he said, "No, I said I was nearly down"—as soon as he said that Henry Perram came up and struck him and knocked him down insensible, and as soon as he got up William Perram caught hold of him and held him across his knee, while Henry hit him as hard as he could and knocked him down again—the prosecutor might have had a drop to drink, but he was none the worse for liquor—I went to look for a constable, I could not find one, and as I returned I met the prosecutor talking to L 116 at the corner—I told him I had seen the prisoners go into the Three Stags with the female—we went there, and the two Peirams were taken into custody—I saw Crane walking to and fro, he offered me a quart pot to drink as we came out of the house, he was talking to the Perrams—I saw the woman go up to Crane and they walked together—I saw her go to her husband (<hi rend="italic">William Per<lb/>ram</hi>), and he gave her a purse—I don't know what she did with it—I saw her give Crane a half-crown—I am not able to say whether there was more or not, I saw one half-crown distinctly—Crane then went away for about seven or eight minutes, and then came back and joined the others; that was after the Perrams were in custody.</p>

I am a labourer, of 2, Chapel Court, Norfolk Street, Southwark Bridge Road—on 3rd December I was walking on the river bank between Blackfriars adn Southwark Bridges, on the upper shore, the part nearest the houses, and saw Timothy Spelling walking on the shore near the water—he called to me, and I went down and saw a bundle in the mud—I assisted him to get it out—it was a three-cornered shawl—the pin came out, and I saw the head of a child—I got a basket out of a barge, because the bundle was too muddy, put the child in it, took it to Emmerson Street steps, and sent for a constable—Bergin came, and I afterwards went with Hewitt to the vault of St. Saviour's Church, and saw the bundle there—I undressed the child, and took off it a three-cornered shawl, a little blue frock, a flannel frock, and two linen rollers marked "St. Saviour's Union"—it was a male child—I was present at the inquest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 13, Bridge Street, South-wark Bridge—on 4th December I was called by Drewitt and made an examination of the body of a male child—the whole surface was covered with livid patches, livid discolourations, but there were no marks of violence—the livid discolourations extended to the face—I then opened the head, and found the brain and its membranes perfectly healthy—I opened the chest and found the lungs pale and collapsed, and the right side of the heart full of clotted blood—the stomach contained a little milk, and the intestines a little foecal matter—every organ was perfectly healthy—the bladder was empty and the kidneys somewhat congested—my opinion is that the child died from <hi rend="italic">asphyxia</hi>, that is suffocation—there was nothing whatever to indicate disease—the appearances I describe were consistent with the cause I assign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is suffocation the absence of air from the lungs from whatever cause? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was nothing to indicate what caused the <hi rend="italic">asphyxia</hi>—I have no doubt that in children death sometimes occurs where a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination shows no assignable cause for death—I should think that spasm of the glottis might cause a child's death, and leave no morbid appearance.</p>

I am surgeon to the Royal Free Hospital, and pathological anatomist there—I have had great experience for many years in the examination of the bodies of dead persons, and have often been examined on the part of the Crown in this Court—I have listened very attentively to-day to the evidence on the part of the prosecution, and especially to the evidence of Mr. Thorpe—the discolourations described by him on the post-mortem examination are not consistent with death within twenty-four hours; I speak of the discolourations all over the surface—you generally get discolourations on the back of a body, from the gravitation of the blood—the appearances described by Mr. Thorpe are consistent with ordinary appearances, but how soon you might expect to see them would depend in the first place on the cause of death, and also on the temperature and moisture of the atmosphere—I should say that some days at all events had elapsed since death—I mean that it is very highly improbable that there should be these patches of discolouration all over the body within so recent a period as twenty-four hours after death—the appearances of the viscera described by Mr. Thorpe are not consistent with death by drowning—the lungs were pale and collapsed, which is not the case in death by drowning, the lungs, are very seldom collapsed, and never entirely so—there is congestion of the brain in drowning, an accumulation of black blood in the brain—in cases where death has been caused by the forcible clasping of the throat, or strangling, you do not usually find the lungs in a collapsed state, you would find them dark red from sudden pressure—the pale colour of the lungs described by Mr. Thorpe is in my judgment inconsistent with sudden or forcible pressure on the luags from any cause, and inconsistent with any kind of suffocation, and as regards the membranes of the brain, I should expect to find them congested from violent suffocation—I should not expect to find the lungs collapsed if the air had been excluded from them by forcible means, or by forcible pressure bemade on the windpipe in any way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Irrespective of drowning, in any external violence whatever by which the air is excluded suddenly from the lungs, would you expect to find the lungs in the pale and collapsed state described to-day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—the death of infants is caused somethings by natural causes suddenly, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701070108"/>
               <p>without any premonitory symptoms—I had a child of my own die in my arms from spasm of the glottis—death is immediate in such cases unless the spasm yields, and I should be unable on a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination to discover any diseased organ—I should see signs of asphyxia, but not of the spasm—the appearances described to-day are, in my judgment, quite consistent with death from natural causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean spasms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would be a natural cause—I entirely concur with Mr. Thorpe that the child died from asphyxia, but we cannot ascribe the asphyxia to any particular cause—we may say that it is not asphyxia from drowning or from any violent cause, but beyond that all is dark—the appearances Mr. Thorpe has described are absolutely inconsistent with death by drowning—I speak of the state of the lungs and brain—I entirely concur with him that death arose from asphyxia, but what produced the asphyxia he is unable to say, and I think that is a very scientific and proper view of the case—the asphyxia is consistent with natural causes—I do not speak of any external cause except spasms—I do not call pressure on the mother's breast a natural cause, or overlaying—I think the better way would be to limit the answer to spasm of the glottis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Besides spasm of the glottis, are there other natural causes which might cause the death of a child presenting the same <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> appearances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not like to give my adhesion to that without some qualification, and would rather waive the question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is what we understand by asphyxia in plain English suffocation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; suffocation produces asphyxia, which is a negative condition, the absence of breath, and many cases may produce it—I have more than once made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinationof a child which died from asphyxia produced by spasm—the child drank out of a tea-kettle which produced spasm of the glottis, and if it had lived long enough there would have been inflammation of the glottis—I cannot call to mind a single instance of death from natural spasm producing asphyxia, but I have certainly seen it occur—if death was caused by imperfect respiration caused by the shawl fitting over the child's mouth, and it sometimes being able to breathe a little and sometimes respiration being entirely stopped, I should expect to find the lungs in a different condition—it is a matter high improbability that the death was occasioned in that way, but I would not say that it was impossible—I should have had a great advantage if I had made the examination myself—I did not see the marks of dis<lb/>colouration, and therefore cannot say whether they might have been caused by the child having been fastened in the bundle and thrown from a height—my answer has reference to the question of putrefaction.</p>
