On Tuesday the 6th Instant, I was going to carry home a pair of pumps to a gentleman, and in the afternoon I missed them; I had seen them in the morning; on the Saturday following, when I went down into my shop, about seven in the morning, my servant informed me another pair of shoes were stolen; they were all bespoke shoes, and had names in them; I supposed they were taken while my servant was sweeping the shop; accordingly on the Monday morning following I went down with him, and while he swept the shop I went on the stairs to watch; I saw the prisoner come into the shop, and take a pair of shoes from the window, and put them under his great coat; he turned and went out of the shop; I followed him and took him about 25 yards from my shop, with these shoes on him. I took him before the Justice; he confessed taking the pumps on the Saturday and the shoes on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the shoes worth 5 s?</p>

            . The prisoner lodged with me. Last Saturday se'ennight at night, he asked me to change a piece of foreign silver money for him; I offered him 4 s. 6 d. for it; he did not chuse to let me have it for that, so he had it again in a few minutes. I have seen the piece since at Justice Welch's.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say it was?</p>
               <p>Hart. He did not call it by any name; when I said it was a foreign piece, he said, yes. (The French crown produced.)</p>

            . I keep a public house in West-Harding-street, Fetter-lane. Three women and two men came into my house the Sunday after the robbery, and called for a pot of purl. I took this piece of silver from the table; they said if I could not change it I must go without the money. I gave them change for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner among the five?</p>

               <p>Q. Where had you been to?</p>
               <p>Hinchcliffe. I had been to a house of my father's at Epping, and I was returning home. I was stopt by three persons, one was shorter a good deal than the other two *; I could not tell whether he was a short man or a boy; one held the horse's head, and the others came one on each of me.</p>
               <p>* Earle is but about fourteen years old.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it was Murphy?</p>
               <p>Hinchcliffe. I remember his person; I am very clear he is the man. I told him I had none, but I would give him my watch if he would not use me ill, I gave it him. It was a silver watch. Murphy held a pistol to my head, and said, might that be my destruction if I prosecuted them. I told them I would not, and then they all three made off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of Earle?</p>
               <p>Hinchcliffe. I think he was one, but I can't be positive of him; if he was he was on the other side of the chaise. I went home, and then I went to a public house where my father's men were drinking; I told them of it. Two of them got into the chaise and went back with an intent to be stopt, and if they were to take them.

            . I keep the Duke of Grafton's Head, a public house in Tottenham-court Road; when this happened, Count and Steadman came into my house; Count told me their master's son had been robbed, and asked me to go with them; I did; they were in a one horse chaise; I ordered my man to bring my horse out; I took a pair of pistols with me; and I went before them through the Turnpike. As I came up by Battle-bridge, near Grays-Inn-lane-road, I saw three men peeping through the rails; I went past them a good way; when I supposed I was out of their sight, I dismounted, pulled out a handkerchief, and tied it to my bridle, and led my horse, so that he was my screen. I saw Murphy, Earle, and Lewis together. I heard them talk how they would attack the chaise, which was then in sight; I was then about as near to them as the length of the Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they see your horse?</p>
               <p>Plenius. Yes, they might, I suppose; they took it to be a stray horse. I accompanied them in this manner thirty or forty roods; the chaise was in the new road, a good way off towards Paddington; one of them swore a bitter oath; he said d - n your eyes, there is a carriage comming, mind how you come on, the first that resists shoot him; they were on foot; they panted; Lewis went in the middle of the road, Earle went outside of the rails in the foot path, and Murphy about three or four yards before him; there is a Turnpike facing Grays-Inn-lane-road. I pulled off my handkerchief and mounted; I turned round the corner at the Turnpike house; the chaise was then about twice the length of this court distant; then Lewis laid hold of the bridle; Murphy went on the left side of the chaise, and Earle on the right side, and demanded their money or their life; I saw Steadman, who sat in the chaise, give Murphy a cut; Earle received a cut from Count, by which, he fell to the ground; he then said D - n you, why don't you fire? upon that, Lewis fired; they were all three in a heap upon the ground; I fired at Lewis immediately; when they found we had fire arms, they began to run; I bid Steadman take care of Earle, and I said I would pursue the others; I did: Murphy got under the rails into the field, so I followed Lewis; I threw him down with my horse; I kept him there till some of our people came up, and secured him; as soon as Lewis fired, he threw his pistol into the field; it was found there two or three days after; I took Lewis and Earle to my house, which is about a quarter of a mile off. I found some powder upon Earle; I asked Earle about the robbery that had been committed about an hour before; Earle said that he knew about it, but the man who had the watch was gone; that was what he said. This was Saturday night; it was about eight days after, when I saw Murphy; he passed the street at their examination; Hinchcliffe said, there is the man that robbed me; I told Mr. Welch what he said; I went out and brought him in; that was Murphy; I am positive he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177210210010"/> is the man I saw attack the chaise; I charged him with the robbery; he said he knew nothing about it; I told the justice, if he was the person, he had a cut upon the shoulder; the Justice bid him pull off his great coat; he was very loth to do it; the Justice made him pull it off, and there was a cut through his coat and waistcoat, and also in his flesh.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Earle say any thing before the Justice about this robbery?</p>
               <p>Plenius. No: he said he had been at Bartholomew-fair, and the powder was to blow the sausage womens pans up.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing said by Earle or Lewis about the robbery?</p>
               <p>Steadman. No; Earle was that night; at the Middlesex Hospital (he was cut in his head so we took him to the Hospital) I said to him, you young dog where is the watch? he said the person that we did not take, had got it; I talked to him all the way to the hospital; he would not tell me any thing, till he came to the hospital; he bled pretty much, and was very sore; he thought he was dying I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing about the robbery?</p>
               <p>Steadman. No; I believe Murphy is one that attacked us, I can't be certain of it, only that mark upon his shoulder, I am sensible I cut the man upon the shoulder; Count was with me when Earle spoke.</p>

               <p>Steadman. Yes, very well; Murphy came on my left side; I was driving the chaise; I took notice of them as they came up; Earle came on the right side. I was at the Justice's when Murphy was charged with having a cut upon his shoulder; his cloaths were taken off and I saw the cut; there was a cut in his coat and waistcoat which was sewed up.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say this at the Justice's the first examination?</p>
               <p>Steadman. No; we thought he had be. taken up for other affairs then, so we said nothing about ours; he was not brought to the bar in account of our affair; I did not see him till the second examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he charged with your affair then?</p>
               <p>Steadman. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing about him then?</p>
               <p>Steadman. No; the Justice did not ask us any question about him?</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him in custody of the constable?</p>
               <p>Steadman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the constable that he was one of them?</p>
               <p>Steadman. No; if I had known they had intended to set him at liberty, I should have spoke; I did not think that he was taken up on our affair.</p>
               <p>Murphy's Defence.</p>
               <p>It is very odd they should swear to me, when at the Justice's they said it was so dark they could not distinguish one man from another.</p>
               <p>Earle's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was going to my brother's in Bowling-green lane, Marybone; I heard the cry of stop thief! I ran along the road to see what was the matter; one of these men ran across the road, and cut me down; I asked him what that was for; he said I was thief; then he tied my hands behind me, and said I was going to rob a chaise; then they took me to the house, and from thence to the hospital; I never spoke a word, good, bad, nor indifferent, till I went before the Justice.</p>

On the 28th of September, about half after ten at night, as I was going down the street to the wharf, I saw two or three people coming up the street with some sacks on their backs; I suspected them, and I dogged them; I saw Collings go with one sack of coals down into a milk cellar in Essex-street; accordingly I stepped over the way, and by that time the prisoner Haslet, and another with him, came with another sack; as soon as I began to challenge them what they had got, and how they came by it, they threw the sack down, and run away. Then the master and mistress of the milk cellar came to me, and asked what I did there; I said I believed they had something in their cellar they should not have there; they would not let me go down at first, but presently they did, and there I saw Collings, and the sack of coals tied round with a garter; I looked at Collings knees, and saw he had but one garter on: Collings said he picked the coals out of the Thames; I opened the sack and looked at the coals; they were large coals, and as clean as when they came out of the pit; then Haslet was brought down; I charged Haslet, but he denied knowing any thing of it; then Collings said he had been with him that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Haslet when you saw him in the street?</p>

               <p>Haslet's Defence.</p>
               <p>He never saw me with any coals on my back: as I was going along the street, a boy came to me, and said some gentlemen wanted to see me at the Crown, in Essex-street; I went, and when I came there he said it was over the way in a milk cellar; I went to the milk cellar, and May charged me with stealing some coals.</p>

            . I am a journeyman taylor, I have often seen the prisoner; I was never in his company before Tuesday the 8th of September; I was in company with him then at Mr. Dobson's, the three Castles, at Puddle dock, in the forenoon; Mr. Dobson keeps a house of call for taylors; we both resorted to that house being out of work; Maurice and I went to take a walk together; we went to Charing-cross and St. James's Square, having nothing else to do. I dined before I went to the house of call; at four o'clock Mr. Maurice asked me to go into Mrs. Johnson's, the Cock and Magpye, Drury-lane; I objected to go in because I had no money; he said he had money, and desired me to go in, I did: we sat down and drank a pint of beer; he desired me to walk out into the yard; I did; there he desired me to take notice, as he had some business with Mrs. Johnson; we sat down in the kitchen; he wrote something down upon a piece of paper about three inches square; Mrs. Johnson was in the bar: he went into the bar to Mrs. Johnson with it. He had before desired me to take notice, so I went to the bar, and saw Mrs. Johnson sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation between them?</p>
               <p>Moore. No, I saw no more pass; then we came into the room, he desired me to look at the receipt and see if I could be sure that was Mrs. Johnson's hand writing; I made use of an oath that he should desire me to take notice of so trifling a thing as a receipt for three shillings, for I did not know of any deception then; I read the receipt, it was for three shillings then: it was dated 8th of Sept. He bid me put it in my pocket; I did: he asked me immediately for it, and I gave it him, then he desired me to go up stairs with him into his room; I did not know he lodged there before. When I went into the room he took up a box, from whence he took a smaller box, out of which he took some promissory notes for small sums, one of which was I think for five pounds or five guineas; I did not observe whose note that was; he said I will show you the deception; he took the receipt that Mrs. Johnson had signed; he took off the the written receipt from the rest of the paper; it had been slightly gumed on the other paper; he separated it, and so made it into two; there stood on one paper the bare receipt without any name, on the other was a blank piece of paper, excepting only an L, a figure of three, and two scratches above and below the figure of three, and

            ; then he laid the promissory note of five pounds before him, and wrote from it a promissory note, upon the blank paper over Mrs. Johnson's name; he made it payable to himself; the date was the 8th of September; he then altered the figures; he put a 1 and an 0 before the figure of 3 which made 103 and added a 1 to the 0 which made 10, which made it 103 l. 10 s. I asked him what was his intention; he said he had no intention of hurting her, he meant only to marry her; he said he would call Mrs. Johnson aside into a room, and he intended to present that note to her for payment, if she refused to marry him: I told him I thought no man could have the face to do so; he said he did not intend to injure Mrs. Johnson, but he imagined she could not procure bail, and said she would consent to marry him. We drank I believe a pint of beer in this room; then we went down stairs again, and I went home. I frequented Mr. Dobson's house, where I casually met with him several days, and we occasionally drank together. About a week or a fortnight after this, Mrs. Johnson, and some gentlemen of her acquaintance, came to Mr. Dobson's; I was there; Maurice came in a few minutes after them; Mr. Dobson called me up; when they informed me of the affair I was struck with great surprise; told them that I knew something of it, but I did not tell them what then; on the next morning I went and acquainted my friend (one Mr. Day) of it, and asked his advice, the next morning I sent to Mrs. Johnson to come to me; when they came, I gave to Mr. Skinner, her attorney, the same information concerning it, as I have done now; we then went to Sir

            . I keep the Three Castles, in Black-friars; both the prisoner and Moore used my house, which is a house of call for journeymen taylors; they were often together at my house. On Tuesday the 15th of September, in the morning, Mr. Maurice desired me to go a little way; I asked him what it was about; I said I could not go then; I would go after ten o'clock; going down Ludgate Hill, I asked him what the business was; he said it was not much further; he went to a chamber in the Temple; there were two gentlemen and a lady there; he said good morrow to you gentlemen; Mr. Mayhew said good morrow to you Mr. Maurice; Mr. Mayhew said to him, is this your friend? he said no, it is a gentleman that is come along with me, Mayhew asked whether he should proceed upon it; Maurice said, yes; I looked at the note; the attorney said it will not be so well for one to be plantiff and attorney, and he said to his clerk, Mr. Andrews I will get you to be plantiff.</p>

It was then mentioned that the action should be brought in Underwood's name; Underwood agreed to it; Mayhew asked the prisoner where she lived; he wrote it down upon a slip of paper, the Cock and Magpye, Drury-lane; Mayhew said, does she keep the house? he said, yes; then they wrote it down, and he said Maurice must indorse it, which he did; then Mr. Mayhew said he would give him a note for security, or a receipt for the note; he gave it Maurice, and Maurice gave it me to look at; the sum was in figures, and Mayhew had signed it only with his name, not mentioning where he lived, and the back was full of writing; I said I thought the sum should be specified in letters, and he should put his place of abode upon it. Mr. Mayhew said he would write a letter; Maurice put the receipt in his pocket book, and we came away; coming out at the door, I said, how was this contracted? he gave me no answer; then I said I supposed it was something of his late wife's affair; he said it was right enough, and Moore saw her sign it. I had no farther conversation with him; he asked me every day if any body had enquired for him.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner to Moore. Whether he has not received a certain sum of money for swearing against me?</p>
               <p>Moore. When Mrs. Johnson's friends came to me, I expressed to them the nature of my situation, I was turned out of Mrs. Dobson's house; turned down stairs, and used in a most desperate manner, and ever since they have not admitted me any where for subsistence. I said to Mrs. Johnson's friends, in what manner am I to be supported: I have a wife and two children, that cannot live on the air. They voluntarily<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177210210015"/> agreed that they would support me; they only allow me a subsistence.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Upon your oath did not you receive five guineas from Mrs. Johnson or her friends?</p>
               <p>Moore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you a security for five guineas more upon conviction?</p>
               <p>Moore. I have for five guineas more, as Maurice says, in order to defray my expences.</p>

On the 18th, when we went to Mr. Dobson's, after waiting a little while, Mr. Maurice came in; we asked him to go up stairs; he did; we talked to him about this note; he seemed vastly confused, did not know what to do; we asked him how he could be so cruel; he said he never meant to hurt Mrs. Johnson, he had a very great respect for her; we said, did she ever owe you a farthing in her life? he would not answer any such question; we asked him how he could be so cruel as to arrest her, what a base man he must be; as we then supposed the matter was, before we discovered Moore's account, that as she did not look at the receipt when she signed it, we supposed that she had signed the note of hand, and did not look at the contents. He said if Mrs. Johnson, or her friends, knew his heart, they would be happy, and make themselves easy; I called him into a room by himself, where I discoursed an hour with him about the matter; he would not answer any thing material. Moore (after Mr. Dobson informed us he knew more about the matter) said he believed Mr. Maurice was a very honest man; we sent for Moore up stairs; he said, I think, he knew nothing about it. Moore sent for us next day; he said it was in his own breast to discover this affair; that he was a poor man, and that it would be attended with loss of time, and he expected to be satisfied for it; we asked him his sum; he said ten guineas; we proposed five guineas; he said if it was put in any other man's hands, it would be the same to him; it was not our offer but his request.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the note run?</p>
               <p>Asto. It ran, we promise to pay five guineas for trouble or loss of time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said in it on conviction?</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>The note was wrote first before she signed it; I had no intention in the world to deceive Mrs. Johnson; I had it in my pocket a few days after; going along Fleet-street, I shewed it to an acquaintance; I met at the end of Fleet-market, one Mr. Keyland, who lives at Islington; I told him I asked Mrs. Johnson to sign it; he told me I had not best shew it to Mrs. Johnson; he asked me if I was acquainted with any attorney; he told me of one Mr. Mayhew, he was acquainted with; he recommended me to give it to him; we drank a pint of beer together; he went into a public house; I went to the chambers to Mr. Mayhew; I told him a gentleman wanted him at the Cock; he came there; I shewed him the note. Keyland bid me tell him it was a good note. I did not know any body could be taken out of their house and be imprisoned without a warrant.</p>

               <p>Q. So they did not stay to assist in robbing the woman?</p>
               <p>Evans. No; I did not stay five minutes, because I heard a coach or something. They ran away directly as I fired the pistol, before I jumped up into the chaise; the gentlewoman gave me the purse, and I took out 2 s. I believe there was more money; if I had had a knife, I should have cut her pocket off; after I had robbed her I came away. I overtook the prisoners in Gray's-inn-lane by chance.</p>

            ; I had been at Bagnigge-Wells on Sunday the 27th of September; I returned from there to the office, about six in the evening; my brother who had just returned from Southampton, informed me, that he had seen Wiggins in Gunnersbury Lane; I got some men together, and I stationed four of them at Buckingham Gate Turnpike, two and myself at Hyde Park Corner, and two others at Tyburn Turnpike; the turnpike men informed me, that two gentlemen that had just passed by in a post chaise, had informed them they had been robbed; after staying near an hour, I saw three men on the left, coming from Paddington Turnpike, and going towards Park-lane; I and the two men that were with me followed them for about a hundred yards; when I was within about five yards of them, I knew Wiggins to be one of the three, by his back; I seized him by the right hand; the two men that were with me attempted to seize the others, but they got off; Wiggins sprung out of my hand about five yards; he then turned round, and said, stand! upon which I struck him on the shoulder with a cane; he then ran as fast as he could to the corner of Park-lane; I pursued him; he ran about twenty yards; he turned and threw something at me, which struck against the wall; I still pursued him, and cried out stop thief! he was knocked down in a street near Grosvenor Square, and we carried him to the round house that night; the next morning I took the other prisoners, Savage, Birks and Macdonald, at a house in St. Giles's; they were all a-bed together; I found this watch (producing it) folded in a handkerchief; it lay under Savage's pillow; Savage lay on the outside, Birks in the middle, and Macdonald on the other side; I took them all three to Sir

            . The two prisoners and I set out together from St. Giles's on a Sunday; I don't know the day of the month, about nine in the morning; we lay together in Westminster; the night before we agreed to go to Richmond, in order to rob; we met Mr. Heley in the way, near Hammersmith; we dined at Brentford; about four o'clock, after dinner, we crossed in the ferry to Richmond; we walked round the Green, but there were so many watch boxes and lamps, we thought that place would not do for us; we crossed Kew Bridge: we drank at an alehouse or two, in order to make us almost drunk to raise our spirits; then we went to a place which I have since heard is called Shepherd's Bush. A post chaise came up; it was not quite dark but I thought it was dark enough that we could not be seen; we could hardly see one another; we all cried out to the driver of the chaise, stop! There were two Gentlemen in the chaise; I took a watch and some money from one gentleman, and some money from the other, and both their hats; after I got their money, I demanded their watches; the gentlemen said they had but one, and one of them gave me a watch; there was a person behind the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Forbes. Was there any person be-behind the chaise?</p>
               <p>Forbes. Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Evans. After I had got the watch and the money, Wiggins said give me me your hats; we took them, and went away across the fields, we went, I believe, two miles out of the way; we cut the hats to pieces in the first field, because they were fantail hats; that was not the sort we wanted. I was with the two prisoners when Mr. Bond came up; I made off; Wiggins had the watch from me, what he did with it I can't say; I had the silver to divide when we came to town.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Forbes. Do you know who demanded your hat?</p>
               <p>Forbes. I remember that after the money was given, a different voice from that which demanded our money, said give me your hats.</p>

He said before the Justice, that he received this 10 l. note with a 70 l. draught and 10 l. in cash in change for a 100 l. bank note; he had found in a pocket book of a man at the Rose at Maidstone.</p>

I was a little in liquor when I sold the boat; I staid drinking at the house two or three hours after I sold it; I went from thence with the prisoner to the Rose and Crown in Lambert-court. I was very fuddled; I do not know what passed; about day break next day, (Sunday morning) I found myself lying in the street upon the ground, in Monmonth-street. All my money was gone.</p>

He having mentioned the prisoner being in company, we took him up; we met him in James-street, Covent Garden; Griffin went up to him, and said, Smith, where are you going? Smith answered, I am going to the house; Griffin said, what house? he said to the house where we were on Saturday night; so are we, said Griffin; the prisoner said I am going to clear up my point, for I am accused of taking your money: we all went to the house; a constable was in the house at the time; we gave charge of the prisoner; Griffin would have persuaded him to have acknowledged the fact, and to induce him to it, said he would not stand for a guinea or two if he had spent it, if he might have the rest; he denied it till he went before the Justice; there it was said he had made a confession, and had directed them to search for six guineas at his lodging, near the Old Barge house; accordingly I went, and in a shed where he had directed, I found eight guineas wrapped up in paper.</p>

On Sunday the 6th of October, 1771, I had the stock looked over, to see if he had done me justice; he was trusted in my business; I found there was a deficiency in the stock and suspected him; a gentleman wanted to see a diamond ring he had pledged for twenty guineas; the prisoner pretended he could not see it because he had lost the key of the small till where it lay; I accused him for what we call the backsides of the trade, that is the profits, and he said he would make me full satisfaction on Monday morning; he came home about half after eleven, or a quarter before twelve o'clock; I was gone to bed; Greenwood let him in; I heard his voice, then I fell asleep; he went out again, and I did not hear of him for a twelvemonth; the next morning I ordered a smith to come and pick the lock of the till, and I missed a stop silver watch that was my own, a gold medal, twenty gold rings and a silver tea pot, that were pledged the latter end of August; I saw an advertisement from Southampton, with an information of a suspicious person that had a gold medal there. I got a warrant and went to Southampton; I found him there in gaol for debt; the sheriff would not let him be taken away that time, so I came up, and went down again for him, and brought him up, and he was committed at Hithe; I enquired after my property, and at Mrs. Rawlins's, a public house, I saw this gold medal; the last time I went down, I got intelligence that my stop watch was with one Mr. Everidge, at Hawley, near Southampton; I charged the prisoner with stealing the things; he said he was sorry for it, he could not help it, the Devil possessed him. (The medal produced.)</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear this is my watch; the watch was put in the window for a show four or five months before he absconded.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination, he said,</p>
               <p>"that</p>
               <p>"there was a kind of an agreement between</p>
               <p>"them in 1770 to come into partnership; that</p>
               <p>"they were to have a partnership if the prisoner</p>
               <p>"could raise money; that he took the house,</p>
               <p>"and that the prisoner carried on the business</p>
               <p>"for him during his confinement; that he was</p>
               <p>"to give him fifty guineas for the first year,</p>
               <p>"and if it answered, he was to give him a</p>
               <p>"hundred guineas afterwards; that the articles</p>
               <p>"of agreement for the partnership, did not</p>
               <p>"say the prisoner was to find judgment only,</p>
               <p>"but money too; that the articles were not</p>
               <p>"signed; that he did not choose to enter into</p>
               <p>"a partnership; that they opened a shop in</p>
               <p>"November 1770, and the prisoner was to be</p>
               <p>"his servant; that the prisoner took money</p>
               <p>"out of the till to pay himself; that he told</p>
               <p>"him he had taken out five guineas; that he</p>
               <p>"did not mean he should have a share in the</p>
               <p>"profit of the business; that he does not know</p>
               <p>"that the house was advertised, but believes it</p>
               <p>"was; that he does not know whether or no it</p>
               <p>"was advertised in the prisoner's name; that</p>

            . I am landlord of the house; Roberts and the prisoner came together, and took the house to carry on the pawnbroking business. I understood that Roberts was to find money, and Curd the judgment. I heard there was an agreement when I had let them this house; I did not know but what they were to be half and half of the business, but some altercations arose about paying the rent, the housekeeping, expences, &amp;c. and they desired my advice; I advised them to keep an account of the outgoings, for Curd to have his board out of the profits of the business, and then the profits to be reckoned, and Curd to have a third; that they both agreed to, and I never looked upon it but he was a partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the business carried on?</p>
               <p>Webster. Yes; I have asked him if he had got the articles signed; he said, no, he could not do it till Roberts was out of prison.</p>

I got clear of the other that had my arm; I stept two or three steps back again, and called the watchman; then they run off; I pursued them and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he got before you took him?</p>

               <p>Spence. About twenty; they dropped the cane in Queen-street as they run along, my hat was picked up where the prisoner was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not stopped the prisoner should you have known him to be one of them?</p>
               <p>Spence. I believe not; I could not take notice of him while he was robbing me, because they were not long about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the faces of the people that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Spence. Yes, this is the tallest of the three; it was a short man that had the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is one of the three that attacked you?</p>
               <p>Spence. Yes, they never were out of sight before the prisoner was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of his face when he robbed you?</p>
               <p>Spence. No; he had blackish coloured cloaths.</p>

            . The two prisoners and I met together, at the White Horse, the corner of St. Ann's-lane, Westminster, and then we came to a further determination to go a robbing; we staid in the house about an hour, and then went out; I and Kennedy had each a pistol, and Devett had a cutlass: the pistols were Kennedy's, the cutlass was mine: I bought it before of a man the corner of Fleet prison. When we got out of the house, we went first into the fields; there we loaded the pistols, staid in the fields till dark, and from thence went into the King's road, towards Bloody-bridge; we got clear of the houses: we heard somebody cough in the road before us, therefore Kennedy and I ran forwards as fast as we could; Divett followed us at a little distance; when we came up, it was Mr. Morse, and he had a lady with him: I presented a pistol to him, and stopt him; he pulled out his watch directly: Kennedy presented a pistol to the lady; she said she had but sixpence; he said he would not take that, and we made off immediately a-cross the field; Divett came up before we had done; he drew his cutlass and put it between the man and woman; we went first towards Hammersmith; then we came through Kensington to Westminster; Kennedy took the cutlass and pistols and carried them to his lodgings; then Kennedy and I agreed to go together directly to sell the watch; I had the watch in my pocket all this time; Kennedy said at the top of West-street, that he had no seal to his watch, and he wished to have the seal from the gentleman's watch; I took out the watch and delivered it into his hand: immediately as he got the watch, he and Divett crossed the street; I remained on the side I was on, and I saw a man come up and take Kennedy and Divett, upon which I made off directly. Our intention was to have sold the watch in Monmouth-street; we were in our way there when they were taken up. I was informed by my brother, that Kennedy had told my name, and where I lived; therefore I thought it would be the safest way to surrender myself; accordingly I went next day to Sir

I am a turnkey at Tothil-fields Bridewell; the two prisoners were brought to our prison; I lay in the next room to the prisoners; after they were gone to bed, I heard Divett say to the people in the room (for I knew his voice) that it was very lucky for him that he had just delivered the watch to Kennedy. The next day one of the prisoners in that room came and told me, that the arms were locked up in Kennedy's house, and he informed me where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177210210034"/> Kennedy lodged; before I went to search for these arms, a man came to the prisoner, who said he was Kennedy's father; I told him what had happened, and that I had an intention to search the box; (Kennedy had given me a key, which he said was the key of his box;) I went home with the father; he brought a box which he said was his son's; I opened the box with the key I had of Kennedy, and I found in it these two pistols, the cutlass, some cartridges, and leaden slugs, ( producing them.)

            . On Thursday night the 15th of this month, as I was going down the Strand, towards Charing Cross, on the left side of the way, I saw Lever sitting against a post, close by the oil shop, at the corner of Hungerford-market; when I came up to him, he gave a loud cough; the street was very clear at that time, and I was apprehensive they were going to do something to me; I immediately looked round and saw the other two lads cross from the silver-smith's shop which is opposite; I made a little stop, Lever passed me, and then the other two prisoners came and gave something to him; then they went all together under a gateway. I went over the way to watch them; I waited a little while, and the two boys returned to the shop window; I then crossed over towards the of shop, and I saw Burks go to the corner of the window; Rimer continued standing in the middle, looking very hard into the shop; I was very confident I saw the least boy's hand through the glass; somebody coming past they were interrupted, and walked on towards the city; then I crossed over, and walked gently by the shop to see if the glass was broke; I perceived a hole in the corner pane that appeared to be broke or cut out; there was just room to put a hand in; then I went into the oil shop and told them what had happened, and said I would wait till they returned; I waited about a quarter of an hour; they did not come; then I went and alarmed the prosecutor; he went with me to Charing-Cross; we parted at Northumberland house; just after parting with Mr. Stears, I saw the three prisoners coming together, as from White-hall; I was on the opposite side of the way; I returned and kept opposite to them; when I came to Mr. Stear's shop, I informed him the boys were on the other side the way; we pursued them, and took Burk and Rymer.</p>
               <p>James Mathews deposed, that he joined in persuit of the prisoners; that he apprehended Rimer, who at first pretended to be exceeding drunk; that he took him to the prosecutor's where he appeared to be very sober, and was very abusive, and that he, after Lever was in custody, went to see him in the Round-house, and was certain he was one of the three persons they pursued.</p>

               <p>Burks said his sister sent him to Charing-cross to enquire if the Greenwich stage was came in, and that in his return home, he was charged with this fact.</p>

I would run you through the body if you served me so; he said he would serve me to-morrow with a King's Beach writ; well said I, but have you my plate, or will you pay for it? he said, no; I then took the prisoner before Justice Welch; there he said he had sent the plate into Dorsetshire, to one Capt. Robinson. The Justice said to Holloway; I know you, give the candlesticks back; and the Justice desired we would go to the door, and see if we could settle matters; at the door he said, what must we do? I said I must have my money of my candlesticks: says Holloway, I never will propose a thing but I will stick to, and upon my honour you shall have the plate on Saturday; I said I will not take your word for two pence, so Holloway asked Leo to produce the note; Holloway looked at it and said it was not worth two-pence, and the prisoner was committed; the next morning Nicolls came to my house, about half an hour after seven, and said it is a sad affair, I can tell you where Ward lodges, and he pawned the candlesticks; we went to Ward's lodgings, and his wife said her husband had pawned some candlesticks for Mr. Leo, at Mr. Trip's, in St. Martin's-lane. we went there, and Trip said they were pawned there the day before.

I was in the house when Touling brought the candlesticks, on the 28th of September, about eleven or twelve o'clock; I shewed him into the parlour to Leo, and shut the door, and went to writing again in the room adjoining; he staid about a quarter of an hour, and then came out again another way into the parlour where I was writing, and was let<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177210210042"/> out by a footman of Mr. Holloway's; he had a green back under his arm when he came in, which seemed to have goods in it; he returned with it under his arm, but it appeared to be empty. In about five or six minutes Leo called me into the parlour, and told me he had bought a pair of candlesticks of a silversmith, for which he had credit two or three months; but mentioned no bill; he asked me if I could borrow fourteen guineas upon them; he said they were to go into the country, for a friend of Mr. Holloway's, and therefore could not lie long at the pawnbroker's; if I could not get fourteen guineas, he bid me get as much as I could; he bid me carry them to Mr. Tripp's, the pawnbroker's, and he gave me a tavern bill which amounted to 2 l. 14 s. to pay as I came back; I went to Mr. Trip's and asked him to lend me fourteen guineas upon them; he said what are they a compliment to Mr. Holloway; I said they might come by that channel; he lent me ten guineas upon them; I asked for a duplicate; he said he would not give me one as they were above 10 l. but I must sign a note of my leaving them there; I did in my own name, and as I came back, called at the Adelphi tavern, and paid the bill, and I ordered a dinner for that day as Leo had directed me. The waiter went to change a guinea; I met him; he said I must go back as fast I could; that my master wanted me; when I came, Leo came into the entry, and said I must fetch the candlesticks again instantly; I told him that was impossible, for that I had paid away part of the money at the Adelphi tavern; said he you must go instantly, and urged me to go. I went out of the house, and went to one Mr. Herring, a friend, in the Strand, to advise what was to be done; he said if I went to the pawnbroker's again, he would not let me have the plate without making up the money. I did not know what to do; he said I had better go to Mr. Holloway, I went to see for him, and found him at a coffee house; he had heard the story, and said give me the 14 guineas.</p>

               <p>"a servant to Leo, and Holloway jointly, that</p>
               <p>"he took a receipt at the tavern, but had lost</p>
               <p>"it since, with a pocket-book; that he paid</p>

            . I am in the Prussian army; I have known Touling four years past; I don't know Leo: I never saw him before: I never heard his name mentioned before in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Ward robbed me of the candlesticks, they were not pawned by my desire as he asserted just now.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner to Ward. What time did I give you orders to pledge the candlesticks?</p>
               <p>Ward. About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you pledge them at Mr. Trip's?</p>
               <p>Ward. Directly.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner to Trip. When did he pledge them with you?</p>
               <p>Trip. Between two and three I had just dined.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner to Ward. As you acknowledge yourself my servant, do you not know the duty of a servant, if you was my servant, why did not you obey my orders directly?</p>
               <p>Ward. I was detained at the pawnbroker's, and at the Tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you pawn them in my name?</p>
               <p>Ward. Because I looked upon it you had a joint property: after that Holloway demanded<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177210210043"/> the fourteen guineas, which was the very sum Leo ordered me to get.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of your not coming back to me, but running away with the money, and hiding yourself in the country?</p>
               <p>Ward. I came back to you directly, and you bid me go and get them instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go into the country?</p>
               <p>Ward. There was an attachment of privilege against a person, and Jacobs desired me to go and see the person arrested directly, so on that account I went to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Touling has said several things that are false: first place when I ordered the things, Touling delivered them on the table; I said, are they the same I looked out. When he had delivered them to me, he pulled out his pocket book, and delivered the bill to me; I tendered that draught to him; he asked if it was a good draught; I said it was, and would be paid when it became due. When we were before the justice, the accepter said he would pay it when it was become due, and he went away very satisfied. Ward came into the room, and said they looked pretty; I said they were to go into the country; I went up stairs, and when I came down, he was gone with the goods; when he was gone Touling came in and demanded the goods; he questioned me about it: I said if he would go, I would see if I could find Ward, but he would not go, nor let me go, so I could not find Ward nor the goods.</p>

               <p>Trueby. I said in this gentleman's house, if they had done such roguish things, they were great rogues.</p>

               <p>Dr. Wilson. Trueby said he knew him from a child; that he used to be an honest man, but since he had been with Holloway, he was as great a rogue as he. He said he left a tea-chest in his custody to dispose of for him, and it would be hard if he could not get it again.</p>
