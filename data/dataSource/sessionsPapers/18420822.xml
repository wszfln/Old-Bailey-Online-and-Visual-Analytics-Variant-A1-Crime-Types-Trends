                  </hi>. I am shopman to Henry Drew May, a hosier, in Moorgate-street. About eight o'clock in the morning of the 16th of July the prisoners came into the shop, and asked for stockings, and afterwards for a silk cravat—I showed them some—Johnson had a coat hanging on his left arm, and while holding up a cravat to examine, he drew some others from the pile, and concealed them under the coat—they bought one cravat, and left a deposit on it—they left together—I went after them, and pointed them out to a policeman—they were together—Johnson was taken by the Bank—he had the coat, and under it were the silk handkerchief I had missed—these now produced are them—they are Mr. May's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to my father, John Dale, carman, of Stoney-lane, Tooley-street, Borough. On the 10th of January, 1838, the prisoner was in our employ as carman, and was sent to the sugar-house, Lambeth-street, for two hogsheads of sugar, one to be taken to Mr. Sayers, St. Dunstan's-hill, and the other to Mr. Davis, in Cullum-street—as he was gone longer than proper, I went to the corner of Cullum-street, and found the cart standing there—a man named Garrett got out of it, and ran away—he was afterwards tried here—the prisoner was standing by the side of the cart, and as soon as Garrett ran away the prisoner ran away also—there was a tilt over the cart, but Garrett could not get up without the prisoner knowing it, as he must get in at the front—the prisoner stood on the pavement, about two feet from the cart—I have not seen him since till within the last three months—when I saw him I gave information—I drove the cart to Mr. Davis's warehouse, Cullum-street, and found the two hogsheads in the cart, the tin off one hole in the hogshead, and a bag on one side, containing 83lbs. of sugar, of the same quality as that in the hogshead, which we found 831bs. deficient.</p>

I know George Fuller, who became a bankrupt—he is a connexion of my wife's—I advanced about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him, for which I received a warrant of attorney—I employed one Hoad to go into the premises—Fuller became a bankrupt about the latter end of April I believe—Had was put in two or three days after that to take charge of the property in the house—I know the prisoner—I had seen him frequently during these proceedings—I do not know of the snuffers and tray being at the house—I did not give authority to Hoad to deliver any thing of that kind to the prisoner, nor authorize the prisoner to take articles of that kind from the house—I did not order him to bring any thing to me—I or<lb/>dered him to send some articles I had there belonging to me for the use of the man I had in possession—it was not anything belonging to the bank<lb/>rupt—I have not received any snuffers or tray from the prisoner belonging to the bankrupt.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you married a lady who has daughters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—one of the daughters married Fuller—I know one Lawrence, of Hammersmith—he is not an old acquaintance—I became acquainted with him in May or the latter end of April, about eighteen months ago—Jones introduced me to him—I believe the prisoner is articled clerk to a solicitor—he offered his advice to me gratuitously, being a barrister—I believed that—I am ignorant of the ways of the world—he acted in the course of this affair—I believe Fuller was seven or eight months in business before he became embarrassed—my money was gone, and he was in difficulties—it was my wife's property—about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and odd of it was my own—I had a warrant of attorney to secure 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I entered up judgment, and took possession <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the property under that—an assign<lb/>ment of the property was made by a bill of sale from the Sheriff—a fiat of bankruptcy was afterwards issued, at the instance of Fuller's father, I believe—a second fiat was issued at the instance of Mr. Saunders—after the sale from the Sheriff I believe the assignees withdrew their claim, but I do not understand it—I am totally ignorant of business—I employed Messrs. Capes and Steward—I was in London—I did not go backward and forward to the premises—I directed the sale to take place—it took place under Mr. Bingham—the messenger under the fiat came in on the day of sale, and the delivery of the goods was stopped—this (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) is the bill of sale I believe—it is dated the 29th of April, 1841—under this I became the purchaser of all the property of Fuller which could be found <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the premises—I authorised Mr. Bingham to sell them by auction—the fiat issued by Fuller's father stopped the delivery of the goods—after an interval I proceeded to sell, the claim of each fiat being withdrawn</p>

               <p>—Bingham sold on the second occasion about June—I directed the pri<lb/>soner to give instructions to Bingham with respect to the tale—I did not tell him he might buy any lots he thought fit for himself—I did not know be wanted any—I have heard since that he did—the goods were sold, ex<lb/>cept the shop furniture—I advised with the prisoner to have the shop fur<lb/>niture kept there till I could get a customer for the lease—it was by his advice; I instructed him to tell Bingham so—the lease was put up for sale—there were no bidders, and then there was a tale of the shop furniture—that was done through the instrumentality of the prisoner—I authorised him to receive the amount, and I believe he did—after the tale there was a clearance of things left, things the man had to sleep on, and so on—I de<lb/>sired the prisoner to go and have the articles belonging to me packed up and sent away—at the latter end of September, after the tale of the lease, he said I should have to pay a quarter's rent if I remained longer in possession—I authorised him to pay the rent which was due before that—I generally gave him money to pay Hoad's wages—the snuffers are worth about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you see the snuffers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Fuller's house, before the bankruptcy—I had brought them to him—I taw them some weeks or perhaps a month, before the bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first know these snuffers bad got into the prisoner's possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the Court, at Kensington, for the first time—I can<lb/>not remember that I heard of them before—I should not like to swear it—I was not at the Bankruptcy Court when he pas examined—I did not see Hoad after he left possession, not for weeks—some months—not for a quarter of a year, I should think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask him what had become of the things in the place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had received a mattress—I was not aware of anything being there—he said nothing to me about the snuffers, nor I to him—to the best of my belief, it was at the Court, at Kensington, I first heard of them—I was asked if I had received them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you go to the Court for the purpose of charging him, among other things, with having obtained a pair of snuffers and tray from the house in Regent-street by false pretences? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yet—I had heard from the bankrupt that he had had them—I have no idea How long before—I charged him with obtaining a pair of snuffers and tray, a piece of marble, and blacking-brushes, by false pretences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you indicted him for obtaining the marble and blacking-brushes and things by false pretences? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suppose so, by the indictment—Jones has taken proceedings against me—he brought an action against me in December—I owe him nothing—the trial was fixed to come on on the 23rd of June last, by a Special Jury—he was before the Magistrate the day before that action was to be tried—I had no warrant to search hit house——I heard it had been searched—I did not ask for another search-warrant on the 22nd—I believe it was asked for in my presence—I cannot say whether the Magistrate refused it, and do not know whether he granted it—I had nothing to do with searching his house—I know Fuller has been indicted for perjury, at the instance of Jones, before this charge was pre<lb/>ferred—Fuller was out of the country before this—he came back just</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the action was pending, I believe Fuller and you became very friendly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We became friendly the week before Christmas—I believe that was soon after the action was brought—I swear I never saw the snuffers after that time—I was in the habit of being at Lawrence's house, at Hammersmith, about the time the snuffers were stolen—I swear Jones did not come there one evening when I was drinking tea, and pro<lb/>duce the snuffers in my presence, and give them to me—(he was always there when I have been there)—I did not thank him for doing 30—I never saw them—he did not produce them from his pocket, wrapped in a brown paper—I never had such a thing in my possession, nor any brown paper parcel, at that time—I was not pursuing any business before I married—I was a gentleman—I was not in any business at any time—I lived with my mother, at Lincoln—she was not in business—I had no property of my own when I married—I lent about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of this money—I acquired money after my marriage—I followed no business when I was married—I never followed any business or employment—I have not been employed at a linen-draper's shop—I have been in a linendraper's shop—I was an as<lb/>sistant, at Spalding, for about twelve months.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a banker at Paris. I transacted business for the late Marquis of Hertford—in October, 1836, our firm purchased some certificates to bearer in the French Five per Cent. Rentes for him—I did not purchase them myself—I have here the leaves from the books of the house—the entries are not in my handwriting—I had daily access to them—on the 16th of October, 1836, we bought five Inscriptions, of 1000 francs each, which were delivered to Lord Hertford on the 23rd of April, 1838—I did not myself deliver them to him, but a person of the same name as myself, who is not here—these papers were given by that person, and brought back to us—Lord Hertford was in Paris at the time—they are signed by the Marquis—I know they are his handwriting—in January, 1837, he bought three certificates, of 1000</p>

               <p>francs each—they were bought by our firm, I believe—I did not deliver them myself to the Marquis—I have a receipt for them—in April, 1838, ten, of 1000 francs each, in the Five per Cents., were purchased for the Marquis—I did not deliver them—in May, 1838, there were ten more, of 1000 francs, bought—I delivered them, and received a receipt for them from him, and compared the numbers on the certificates with the receipt—this is the receipt—they were 1711, 1712, 1713, 1714, and 1715, and 1789, 1790, 1791, 1792, and 1793—there was a further purchase in October, 1838—I delivered those to the Marquis, and took his receipt, which I compared with the numbers on the certificates—they were 1828 to 1832, inclusive; 1866 to 1870, inclusive; and 1920 to 1924, inclu<lb/>sive; all for 1000 francs each—they were all delivered on the 3rd of April, 1839, by myself—there were some Three per Cents, certificates purchased in August, 1836—four were purchased—I did not deliver them to the Marquis—in June, 1838, we purchased seven certificates, which were de<lb/>livered by myself to the Marquis, and I took his receipt—I compared the numbers on the receipt with the certificate—they were 1663, 1664, and 1665, for 1000 francs; 791, 792, 793, and 794, for 500 francs each, in the Three per Cents.—I was in the habit of receiving from the Marquis coupons to place to his credit at different times—the numbers of these were kept in some instances, but this part of the book does not show it—two of the same number and date are never issued—a person in pos<lb/>session of a certificate would obtain the money without any transfer, on production of the inscription—the production of the coupon would entitle the party to receive the dividends—the production of the inscription itself would entitle the bearer to have the inscription transferred in his own name—to convert it into an inscription nominative, it would be necessary to produce all the coupons not then due.</p>

Hopkinson's—Suisse acquiesced in the observa<lb/>tion, that Lord Hertford's mind was not so collected as it ought to be—I think he said something to this effect, that if he found money, or anything, lying on the table, he paid it into Coutts's himself—I do not exactly remem<lb/>ber the observation he made use of.</p>

My dear—, I have just received your kind letter, by which I perceive that I can reckon on your friendship, which I cannot too much appreciate, and of which I am proud to make myself worthy. Here is the plan which I had formed—to send, by Brussels, two fine horses, with their coachman and their harness. I intend buying from you one of those Brussels carriages, the same as that in which I have seen you drive so often with all your family, a kind of covered <hi rend="italic">char-a-banc</hi>. As to my plate, far from selling it here, I am having a service made here, for which I expect to pay the duty; but I shall draw back here the duty on re-exportation, which will cover that which I shall have to pay abroad. As to the stamp, I had no idea of it, as new plate; and I am ignorant whether, by Calais, it would be the same thing. My first idea is, that from Calais to Nancy the distance is double that from Brussels to Nancy. If, nevertheless, the same formalities do not exist by the way of France, I will send plate by Calais. In any case, that will not prevent my passing through Brussels; that is to say, from Calais I shall go to you. That cannot in any case be before the month of June next. I shall not be ready before that time. I reckon on your kindness until then. If you can give me other information, have that kindness. Pray present my re<lb/>spectful duty to Madame, and dispose of him who will be all his life, with high consideration, your sincere and very devoted friend, <hi rend="smallCaps">SUISSE</hi>.—A mil<lb/>lion of thanks to M. Felice for the good opinion he has of me, and of the preference he gives me. I am sincerely grateful for it; but at my age, and with sufficient for me and mine, one must be more than mad to go into business, and spoil so fine an independence.

               <p>"My dear friend,—I answer your amiable letter, the contents of which make me more and more regret not being able to depart so soon as I had hoped. These gentlemen do not allow me, seeing that my presence is too useful to them for some time longer—at all events, at least, I see that if we lose three quarters, we shall only lose that. I say 'we,' because those that I intend for you are in the same predicament as those that you have—they are all quite naked. Perhaps among those that you have been repaid one might find the means of dressing them; perhaps among those which re<lb/>main with me—if that, it would be necessary that I should depart imme<lb/>diately, which is impossible.

               <p>latter part of his life it was his practice to ring in the middle of the night for Suisse, more frequently than before—Suisse was himself taken very dangerously ill about three weeks or a month before his lordship's death—he was ill almost all the time his lordship was—he did not get up the last fourteen days—the duty principally devolved on me then—Suisse was totally unable to help him for the last fourteen days; he was confined to his bed.</p>

I left Paris with her and the Mar<lb/>quis of Hertford in that month—at that time I had known the Marquis seven years—I travelled during a year with the Marquis and Miss Borel, to London and to Italy—after we left Paris in the carriage I heard Miss Borel ask the Marquis what was the amount of the coupons which be had given to Suisse—the Marquis's answer was that it was above 100,000 francs, and that he had given them to Suisse—I had not myself had any conversation with Suisse about them—I had not the same acquaintance with Suisse as Miss Borel had.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and apothecary, and reside in Piccadilly. I attended the Marquis of Hertford as his medical attendant—I had been in the habit of attending him altogether about twenty-three years—prior to that, it was only occasionally, when my father was living—I saw him constantly, from the early part of October, 1841, to the time of his death—I was in Court when Foote stated the nature of the Marquis's</p>

               <p>bodily infirmities—he has stated them slightly—the Marquis's ordinary state of constitutional health was a semi-paralytic state of certain organs—it was that which led to the trouble that Suisse and Foote had with him, but that was not the cause of the illness under which his lordship died—he did not die from the paralytic seizure—I know nothing of his visit to Rich<lb/>mond except having heard of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About what period was he taken ill with that illness which led to his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not correctly the beginning of an illness—it was a relapse—he had had <hi rend="italic">bronchitis</hi> for many weeks, and he was beginning to rally on the 4th of February; indeed, so much so, that he began to con<lb/>sider of going abroad again—I was in the habit of making up things for him when he went abroad, which he told me to prepare for him about the 4th of February—I cannot exactly tell the day of his going to Richmond, but I remember so far, that he was then getting so far better that I asked him to begin to think of getting into the library, that we might get him out if there was any fine weather—I was at that time seeing him daily, and it was after that return, he had a relapse of the <hi rend="italic">bronchitis</hi> from which he never recovered—I think it was about the 18th of February that he was seized with the relapse—Suisse was taken ill about the 14th of Feb<lb/>ruary I think, but not so as to be confined for some few days—it was an attack of erysipelas of the neck and external part of the chest, terminating in abscesses, that confined him to his bed for a considerable period—he was confined to his bed at the time of the Marquis's death, and I should think about twelve days before, but I cannot speak positively at this moment, but I think it was twelve days within a day or two—I saw the Marquis almost constantly from October to the end of March.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So far as his mind was concerned, was he, in your judgment, capable of attending to his affairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I considered him sane, certainly—it never entered into my mind to doubt that he was competent to attend to his affairs—on the last trial I was examined as a witness for the prosecution.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the police on the Croydon-railway. I saw the prisoner there on Friday, the 8th of July—she asked for a ticket to go by the rail-road, and paid for it with half-a-sovereign—she afterwards came into the room where I was, and sat down for a few minutes—she then got up, and said she could stand it no longer, she must give herself up to justice—I looked at her—she said, she and her fellow-servant had been implicated in a robbery, that her fellow-servant had broken open a desk, and taken a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and given her half, that be had also taken a green purse from the lady's-maid's bag, which contained ten sovereigns, that he had given her a part of it to take care of, and then burnt the purse—she also said that she had had connexion with him, and likewise that he had had connexion with the cook—she spoke so quick, that, from her manner, I rather suspected she was insane, and, from her persisting in this robbery, I took down two or three of her words, such as the address of Miss Brodie, "19, Somerset-street"—also the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and the ten sovereigns—I told her to wait a little while, intending to put on my coat to hand her over to the police—she then resisted very much, and persisted in not going—I got a fly, and took her to the station—she was exceedingly excited and violent—she said she had been in the family way by her fellow-servant, that he had given her pennyroyal to destroy the child, and the phial would be found in the water-closet.</p>

I was in plain clothes in St. James's-park on the 10th of July—there were a great many persons assembled, and a person addressing them—the prisoner came up and joined the crowd, then took this handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket, and put it into his own—he went about a yard off—I touched the gentleman, and told him he had lost his handkerchief—he found he had—I told him to come with me, which he did—I went to the prisoner, and said, "Give this gentleman his handkerchief"—he said he had not got it—I put my hand on his trowsers' pocket, and said, "Take it out here"—he did so—the gentleman said it was his—I said, "Accompany me to the station"—</p>

               <p>he said, "No," and refused to give his card—I took the prisoner to the station—I found in his hat two other handkerchiefs, one was marked "E. R."—the mark of the other has been taken out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas John Turnbull, of Whitecross-place, Shoreditch. Porter lodged with his mother at my house for six weeks. On Saturday, the 2nd of July, I had a silver and a metal watch, hanging in the kitchen, against the wainscot—I saw them safe at one o'clock—the silver watch had a gold seal and a steel chain—the metal watch had only a ribbon—at six o'clock I missed them both, also a tea<lb/>spoon, a pencil-case, and a knife—I had some suspicion—I went up imme<lb/>diately to Porter, and found he was in bed alone—I looked at him, and saw he was not asleep, though his eyes were shut—I said, "George, what have you done with the things you have taken out of the kitchen?"—he said, "I have not been down stairs since I came up last night"—I sent for his mother, who was nursing a friend of mine, and she gave him in charge—he cried very much—when he was at the office, he said he brought some little boy in the house to take them away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil and colourman. On Sunday, the 3rd of July, about a quarter to twelve o'clock, I went into St. James's-park, and saw the Royal carriages and the Queen and Prince Albert coming from Buckingham Palace to go to the Chapel Royal, St. James's—I was standing about half way down the Mall, near the watering-place, which is a kind of pump—I did not distinctly see the Queen—She was in the last car<lb/>riage—there were three carriages, and she was in the last—I did not distinctly see her, but I have heard she was in the last—I have seen her a great number of times—She was always in the last carriage—when the last carriage was passing I observed just before it passed the prisoner come in front' of the crowd, and present a pistol at the last carriage of the three—he seemed to come from the back of the crowd—he elbowed his way to the front—I saw him present a pistol at the last carriage—I heard the click of the hammer striking against the pan, but there was no explosion—I heard that as the last carriage was passing—the pistol was full cocked when he presented it, and he was holding it out at arm's length towards the carriage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it while the pistol was elevated towards the carriage that you heard that click? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I immediately seized him by the right arm, which had the pistol in it—I forget my exact words, but I said, How dare he shoot at the Queen? or something of that sort—I took the pistol from him—but before that I turned round to my brother, who stood on the right-hand side (the prisoner was on my left,) and mentioned to my bro<lb/>ther what had happened—I held the prisoner by the arm at the time, and after I had told my brother, I took the pistol from him—he made very little resistance—he did not say anything that I remember—He took the pistol from under his coat—I saw him draw it out—I cannot say whether it was in a pocket, or what.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220073"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How high towards the carriage was the pistol directed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The action was so quick I hardly noticed it—he held it at arm's length, and immediately drew his arm back when he found it missed fire—the carriage was passing at the time—I was about two and a half or from that to three yards from the carriage, standing on the edge of the footpath—there was an immense number of persons there—it was on the right-hand side, as the carriages were going down towards the gardens of St. James's-park—my face was towards St. James's Palace—after taking the pistol from him, I and my brother took him across the Mall, and offered him to the policeman A 56, who was standing across the Mall—a great number of persons followed us, and asked me to give the boy back his pistol, saying they believed it was a hoax, they did not believe it was loaded—the policeman refused to take him into custody—I offered him the pistol—he returned it to me, and said he thought it did not amount to a charge—I had hold of the prisoner all the time—I offered him to Claxton, A 134, who likewise refused to take the charge—the pressure of the crowd became so great, and most of them sided with the prisoner—he was forced from me, and escaped—I still had the pistol, and went down the Mall with it in my hand—I myself was soon after taken into custody by policeman A 136, who stood lower down the Mall—I had the pistol at that time in my hand, and the people were at that time charging me with attempting to shoot the Queen—the con<lb/>stable took the pistol from me—I was taken to Gardiner's-lane station—I saw, when the prisoner pulled the pan up, that it was full of coarse gun<lb/>powder; and when I took it from him I put the pan down, and half-cocked the hammer, to save what gunpowder remained, but a portion of it had got out—when I gave it to the policeman I had put the pan down—in other respects it was just the same as when I took it from the prisoner—I do not remember the prisoner saying anything to me—I think he asked me for his pistol again—that was while I had him in custody—I saw him afterwards, when he was taken into custody—I have not the least doubt of his being the person.</p>

               <p>there was a great noise after it happened—while I had hold of the prisoner they kept shouting at me to let him go—they cried out that the pistol was not loaded—I do not think there was a great deal of laughing—I will not swear there was not—I spoke to my brother and uncle—I do not recollect what I said to my uncle—I crossed the Mall towards the Green-park be<lb/>fore I met policeman A 56—the people were about me all this time—my brother was helping me to take the prisoner—I do not remember whether he had hold of him—he was walking by the side—I think he had hold of him—I kept hold of him—he made a little resistance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live at No. 21, Brunswick-place, City-road. I was in St. James's-park, on the 3rd of July, and saw Bean there and Charles Dassett—I saw the Royal carriages pass—at the time they were opposite me I did not see the prisoner nor Dassett—I first saw them immediately after the third carriage had passed—I saw the elder Dassett in the act of taking the prisoner into the middle of the road, stating at the same time that he had taken a pistol, which he held in his right hand, from the prisoner—I do not exactly recollect his words—it was to that effect—I did not see him take the pistol from him—the first time I saw Dassett, was when he had the pistol in his hand.</p>

On the 15th of August, a little before two o'clock in the morning, I was passing New Broad-street, and heard a noise like a lock being forced inside No. 19, which is the Peace Society's Office—I stopped listening a little time—I then called for Thomas, another policeman, and sent for the sergeant—we continued listening about twenty minutes—I went round to the back of the building, in Bell-square, and in about five or ten minutes heard a noise as though some one was coming over the roofs of the out-buildings—I stood at the corner of the square, and distinctly saw the two prisoners drop into the square—I immediately took Palmer into custody—the place where they</p>

               <p>came off leads to the Peace Society's Office—they came the way they would most naturally have come if they came from the back—Thomas and the ser<lb/>geant ran after Brown, I got some ladders, and went into the office—I got in by the front way—in the back office I found a writing-table with the lock forced, and the articles mentioned on the table—there is a partition between the back-office and the warehouse, a door communicates between the two—a large hole was cut in the panel of that door, apparently by a knife—nobody could get through the panel of the door—there is a skylight above, which I examined—it might be reached from the outside by climbing up—there was a pane of glass broken out of it sufficient for a person to get through, on doing which they would arrive at the office.</p>

I was with Blay on the night of the 15th of August—I heard very distinctly the forcing of locks, while listening at the door, I fetched the sergeant, and then we all three listened—Blay then went round the square, by order of the sergeant, and I placed another policeman in Broad-street—I and the sergeant remained at the door, we knocked and all was then quiet—we then heard a jumbling noise, like getting on the roof of the premises—I ran round directly to the London Missionary Society house, thinking they might go through their pre<lb/>mises, because they are unoccupied at night—I heard Blay call for assist<lb/>ance, in Bell-square—I ran to his assistance, and Brown, who is a most no<lb/>torious thief, ran away from me—I attempted to seize him by the chest—</p>

               <p>he got away from me—I followed him through Finsbury-circus, and took him in Little Moorfields, about a quarter of a mile from Bell-square—I did not lose sight of him at all—a private watchman tried to stop him, but he knocked him down, and ran away—I laid hold of him, and took him into custody—I afterwards went back to the house—I found no person inside who could have made the noise—I, the sergeant, and the other policeman got in by means of the lamplighter's ladder, at the time he was putting the gas out—a ladder was afterwards found inside.</p>

On the night of the 15th I was at these premises, in company with the two other officers—after the prisoners were in custody I got into the premises, by borrowing two short ladders of Mr. Jay, the builder—we joined them together by our belts, and got on the roof of the premises, and into the inner office—I found the place in confusion—the lock of the door had been broken open, and the door which leads from the back-warehouse to the front was partly broken from the panel—the lock had been forced, but being a mortice lock, they could not open it—I found a rope lying on the floor, directly under the skylight—it had a large weight attached to it, but they had taken that off—I have not got the weight here, I have only brought the rope—it is evi<lb/>dently what the parties were let down by to cut the cornice of the skylight, and it fits—I showed the inspector that it was possible for a man to get through, by getting through myself—I did not get in by the rope—by one person getting down, and putting the ladder on the table, the other could easily get down—he could assist the other down—these are the articles I found.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 30.) On Saturday, the 2nd of July, I took the prisoner in Quebec-street, where she was lodging—I asked her name—She said, "Cameron"—I said I wanted to speak to her, I thought I had something that would suit her—I was in plain clothes—we walked round into Berkeley-street—I then told her I was a constable, and must take her into custody—She said, "Oh dear, what for?"—I said, "For robbing Mrs. Smith"—She said, "Of what?"—I said, "Articles of wearing-apparel"—She then wanted to go to Mrs. Mellon's—I said I could not allow her—after that it came on to rain—She wanted to go into a public-house to have some beer—I said I could not allow her—I took her to the station—I asked if she had got the keys of her box—She said, "Yes"—after hesitating a moment, she gave them to me—She told mo correctly where her boxes were—She said there was an old flannel dressing-gown in the box, I was to bring it with me—I went to her lodgings, and in the back room, first-floor, I found a box—I opened it with one of the keys, brought the whole of the contents to the station, and put them on the table in her presence—I told her where I got them from—she said some of the articles were hers, and did not belong to Mrs. Smith—She selected one towel that she said was hers—I stopped her with that, and said, "No, there is Mrs. Smith's mark on it"—She selected a good many things—she said she took the dressing-gown by mistake—I released her from custody till the Monday morning, when she appeared, and was committed—these are the articles—here are some pieces of ribbon.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 12th of June, I received information, and went to Anthony Cunningham's, in George-street, Lisson-grove—I found the prisoner there, and said I was an officer, come to take her in custody, on suspicion of stealing a cash-box, from Mr. Stroud, of Edgeware-road—she denied it—she was taken and had three hearings, and then was discharged—I took her again on the 6th of July, with four others, to the station—when we got to the station Creen was charged by Cunningham, and then the prisoner said, "As it has gone so far, I will tell all. I did take the cash-box; Mrs. Cunning<lb/>ham broke it open, and took the contents out"—she said Mr. Cunning<lb/>ham had persuaded her to take it, and told her to bring it there; nobody would ever hear of it—she said the situation was hard, and the children were cross—I found the box in a water-closet, where the prisoner told me it was thrown—there was nothing in it—I have not traced any of the notes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live in Copthall-buildings, Throgmorton-street. I was concerned last year for a gentleman named Pinner, who had proceedings against one Charbean—Pinner re<lb/>quested me to pay some money for him, and he was indebted to me for some costs in the action, and he deposited with me a bill of exchange, which I produce—it was afterwards dishonoured—proceedings were taken on it, and the plaintiff was nonsuited—Mr. Pinner brought the prisoner to me, to prove the handwriting of the acceptor—I asked him if that was the writing of John Monday, the acceptor—he said it was, and that he saw him write it—he said he took the bill to him, and saw him accept it, in White<lb/>cross-street prison.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 12, Brook's-market, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. On the 6th of July I left my wife in the house, and went out a little after nine o'clock in the morning—I occupy two rooms on the ground-floor, which open on to the landing—the land-lord does not live in the house—it is let out in lodgings—I returned about five minutes after four, and found the room-door on the right-hand wide open, and the padlock and hasp, which I had left on in the morning taken away—my wife had been out, and returned about two minutes before me—I missed a coat, two gowns, two frocks, a blanket, a sheet, a shift, and a band—the street-door ought always to be shut, but most likely it was left open.</p>

On the 6th of July, I was Jiving at No. 19, Peter-street, and Bird lodged with me—the other two prisoners are acquaintances of hers—she went out that morning—about one o'clock Sullivan came to my room, and asked for Bird—I said she was not at home—she had a bundle with her—she went away again, and then they all three came in together each with a bundle—Sulli<lb/>van had the same bundle that she had brought before—they opened the bundles in my room, and sorted the things—I saw two frocks, two gowns, a coat, and a band, which I thought was a pillow-case—one gown was a mourning one, and the other a light one—they each took some things, and Bird left behind her the padlock and two sleeves belonging to a gown, which I gave to the policeman next morning.</p>

On the 25th of July, I came up to Lon<lb/>don by the barge, and saw the prisoner in Ratcliffe-highway, by Tower<lb/>hill—I went with her to a house, and staid with her—I gave her 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I</p>

On the 16th of July, about four o'clock, I saw her in School-house-lane, and finding she had quarrelled with her husband, I allowed her to sleep at my place, because she was afraid to go home—I said I would speak to her husband in the morning and make up matters—in the morning I went out to work, and left her in the kitchen with my children—I came back between four and five, and she was gone—I missed from the clothes'-basket, a frock which I had taken in to wash, and an apron and handkerchief next morning—they were safe in the kitchen before I took her in—I suspected her, as there had been nobody else there—I found her about half-past ten that night, rather tipsy—I asked her if she had got the ticket of the frock—she said she had not—I said, "It is no use denying it, you certainly have, there was no one else in the place"—she said, "No, I have not got the frock, it is safe for you"—I said, "You will get yourself into trouble, come with me, and get it"—when I got as far as Whitecross-street, she said, "Mrs. smith, I have lost the ticket"—I said, "Then come with me to the pawnbroker's, and give me satisfaction about the ticket"—I went with her, and she asked the pawnbroker if she had pawned it there—he said, "No"—I brought her home—she would not confess it then, but she afterwards said she had taken it, but not pawned it—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—and this handkerchief also—I have not got the apron.</p>

On the afternoon of the 5th of August, I was in the parlour behind my shop, and saw the prisoner come in and take 1lb. weight of tobacco which was lying on the counter, and place it under his frock-coat—I went in to serve him, and he asked for a quarter of an ounce of Irish twist—I took no notice then, as I was serving—my husband came up into the shop—I asked him in the pri<lb/>soner's hearing, where he had placed the tobacco that he was going to take out with him—he looked on the counter and found it was gone—I collared the prisoner across the counter, and said, "This is the thief, he has got it"—my husband went to call a policeman—the prisoner offered to pay for it—we would not take it—he struck me on my hand to leave go—I let him go when the shop-door was shut, and the policeman came—this tobacco is my husband's.</p>

On the morning of the 27th of July, I was standing looking towards the shop, and saw the prisoner bringing some caps out of the shop, in his hand—I believe he observed me, for he' went back again to the back part of the shop, and returned without any thing—I followed him up Queen-street, and told him he had got some caps belonging to us—he said he had not—I felt the pocket of his coat behind—it appeared to contain something heavy, and it was found to contain a metal collet, which is a thing that goes on the axletree—it is Mr. Hay's property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the night of the 31st of July, between ten and eleven o'clock, I saw the two prisoners and another boy in King-street, St. George's, opposite the prosecutor's shop—Bryant went into the shop, and brought the bacon out—Lay waited outside, close to the door—Bryant ran down the court with the bacon in his hand, and I after him—he ran into another court, and into a privy, about a hundred yards from the shop—I found him there, and never lost sight of him—the other two boys separated from him—I asked Bryant what he had done with the bacon—he said he never had it—I told him I had seen him come out with it—I went to Mr. Hay's and acquainted him of it—I got the bacon after<lb/>wards out of the privy into which I had pursued Bryant—he had thrown it down—I took it to Mr. Hay's—Lay was taken by a brother-constable—I am sure he is one of the boys who were with Bryant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer and cheesemonger, in King-street. This is my piece of bacon—I did not miss it till the officer brought Bryant to the shop—it had been lying between the counter and the door, on a machine—there were three pieces—when I came back there was but two—I do not know any thing of the prisoners.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Bryant's Defence</hi>. As I came down the court I met this boy coming with a bundle of clothes on his arm, from his ship; the policeman took me to the station, then went and fetched two more boys up, and the bacon in his band; he let one boy go, and locked me up.</p>

I came from my ship with dirty clothes; going across the road, I saw the policeman running the opposite way; I ran after him, to see what was the matter; I saw him coming along with this, boy; I followed him to Mr. Hay's house, and heard him making a complaint about the bacon—I stopped, speaking to Mr. Hayes, and he came back and took me.</p>

I am clerk at the Pimlico Slate Works—I have for the last four years resided at Alchin's wharf—I married the prisoner's daughter about two years ago—I have seen William Walker at Alchin's wharf during the last three or four years—I remember about 1839 hearing him ask the prisoner why he had not taken up a bill which had become due and was not paid—it was a bill for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I never saw it to my knowledge—the prisoner answered that he had taken it up in the course of the day—I remember some time in 1840 William Walker coming about a bill that had been presented at his private house—be asked the prisoner why he had not taken it up—the amount of that was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he stated it had been accepted at his private house—the prisoner made answer that he should take it up in the course of the day—I most likely saw these two bills afterwards—I was frequently sent to pay bills—I have taken up bills on two or three occasions by the prisoner's desire—I kept the bills generally after they were taken up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live next door to the prisoner. I heard a great noise in the room up stairs when I was in bed—it was between seven and eight on the day the blow on the nose was given, I saw the blood running down the deceased's nose, and side of the face—I heard the cry of, "Murder," and went to the window, and she was sitting by the side of the window, with the baby in her arms—the little girl opened the door—I said to the prisoner, "You good-for-nothing rascal, what have you been doing?"—he shut the door, and told roe to mind my own business—he was using harsh words at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer, and five in Wellington-street, Waterloo-town. On Saturday morning, the 20th of August, just about one o'clock, I was coming home from Ratcliff-highway, where I had been to order some coals, at Smith and Sharp's wharf, which is about a mile from my own house—when I got to the corner of Osborne-street, Brick-lane, not a quarter of a mile from my house, the prisoner Watson came up to me and hustled me—She caught hold of me to rifle my pockets—Sheen and Ragan came round me directly, both together—they were all round me, hustling and feeling about my pockets, and a man crossed the road and knocked me down directly with his fist—I was senseless for a moment—when I came to myself, Sheen had got hold of my throat, so that I could not make any noise or get assistance—I found them with their hands in my pocket, trying to cut my pocket out—I had hold of my watch-pocket to save it, and they cut my hand—they got my watch-chain, but not my watch—they were all three round me—Watson got ray property from me—She had my pocket in her hand—I held her fast, with her hand in my pocket—I lost two sovereigns, five half-sovereigns, and from 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, my silver watch, the chain, seals, and key—as soon as they heard the policeman coming, the man ran off with Sheen and Ragan—I held Watson fast, and the policeman came up and took her—the watch, chain, seals, and silver, were found on her—Sheen and Ragan were taken next morning, at Worship-street, while Watson was being examined—I could not make any outcry because I was throttled—I called out "Police" very faintly, just as the policeman was close to me—I had seen my money just before in High-street, Whitechapel—I was feeling in my pocket, to feel if it was all right, as I knew a very bad set walk there—I never saw the prisoners before—I am certain they are the women—I did not purpose speaking to either of them—I had had a share of two pots of half-and-half with two shipmates—that was all I took after dinner—I dined about half-past one—I cannot exactly say I was sober, nor was I intoxicated—it was between eight and nine that I fell in with my ship<lb/>mates—I had finished drinking a little after twelve.</p>

About one o'clock, on Satur<lb/>day morning, the 20th of August, as I was going along Osborne-street, I saw Watson go towards the prosecutor, and directly saw two other females come up—I saw a wrestling between them all—there was a man crossing the road—I ran up that instant, and directly I got up the prosecutor <hi rend="italic">sungout</hi> "Police"—I saw them all three down on the ground—I did not see what the man who crossed the road did—they seemed to be all confused, as if they were all wrestling down on the ground—the prosecutor was standing up—directly I ran up, the women and the man ran away—the prosecutor was down—when the man crossed I saw the prosecutor fall down, and the women were down upon him—I did not say that the prose<lb/>cutor was standing up—when the man crossed the road I saw them all five fall down, the prosecutor, the three females, and the other man—I had heard the prosecutor call "Police" in a very low voice just before I got up—two of the females and the man then ran away, leaving Watson be<lb/>hind—I asked the prosecutor if he had lost any thing—he said he was robbed of his watch—I asked where it was—he said, "Here is the watch, which she has just put into my hand"—I asked if he had lost any thing—he said he had lost a chain, but never mind that, and be gave her into custody—I took her to the station—She was searched, and she gave me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I could not tell, from their manner, whether they were tumbling all to<lb/>gether in fun, or whether one party was robbing the other, for it was so very quiet till I happened to come up—I thought they were fighting—the prosecutor had been drinking a little, but was collected, and knew what he was doing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Ebenezer Cherry, as linen-drapers, in Goswell-road. The prisoner bad been our shopman about twelve months—he first had 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and afterwards 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and his board—on Friday evening, the 19th of August, he had permission to go out, and was to return at eleven o'clock—he did not return that night or the next—in consequence of suspicions, while he was absent I examined some clothes of his in his bed-room, and in the coat pocket I found a letter, a duplicate, and these two pairs of gloves—one pair is ours—the prisoner purchased things in the shop, and bad an account kept—I found two pairs of socks in a closet in his room, one pair of which I believe to be ours—I have the prisoner's account here—neither the gloves or socks appear in that—he came home about nine o'clock on Sun<lb/>day morning, but I did not see him till between twelve and one on Mon<lb/>day—he then presented his account—I said, "Did not you have a pair of drab silk gloves on Saturday night week?"—he said, "No, they were la<lb/>vender," that the drab pair he had of his friend, who was waiting outside—these are the drab pair—he went to speak to the person at the door, who afterwards came in—I do not remember that he mentioned his name—I re<lb/>quested him to leave the shop, which he ultimately did—I went with the prisoner to the station, and gave him in charge, and this person followed us there—he was also waiting at the police-office when we went in, but when I came out he was gone—the Magistrate inquired in the prisoner's presence who that person was—the prisoner did not say what his name was—I afterwards went with the prisoner to his father's house, in Collier-street, Pentonville, and asked the father to show us the prisoner's box, which he did, and in it we found thirteen collars, a shirt front, and a pair of trowsers—he said the collars were his before he came into our service—there is nothing in his account for collars—some of the collars had been washed, but there was one which had not been washed—it had been worn—this is it—I have not the least doubt it is my property—here is our pri<lb/>vate mark on it "D V" and two strokes, which signify a halfpenny—there are two other collars of the same pattern—I purchased a dozen of these collars of Brettel and Co., in Wood-street, last week—I have exa<lb/>mined my stock, and find three of those collars gone—the three found in the prisoner's box account for the dozen.</p>

I saw a description in the "Hue and Cry," and went to Cartham, four miles from Skipton—I there saw the two prisoners in bed together—I told Wildman he was charged with stealing seventy-five sovereigns—he made no answer—I told him to get up and let me look at his clothes—I found in them twenty-five sovereigns, a comb, and a knife—I took to a Public-house, and the landlord gave me five sovereigns, which Wildman had paid for a dog—I took them to Skipton, made inquiry, and found he had left a watch at a watchmaker's—I also went to a tailor's at Cartharm, and found a quantity of clothes, which he had ordered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Sunday even<lb/>ing, the 17th of July, I went with Mr. Onion to Watson's house—I asked if she would allow me to search the house—she said she had no objection—after introducing her to Mr. Onion, she said she suspected what I came about, it was respecting pledging some things of a Miss Osborn, of No. 3, Warwick-row, Pimlico—she produced fifty-six duplicates, six of which she said related to property which Miss Onion employed her to pledge—I afterwards went to Onion's room, but found nothing but this shawl and these drawers.</p>

The prisoner lived in the same house, in the back attic, at the time of this robbery—I remember his coming into the house at seven o'clock in the morning, on the 14th of July—I was going out to sweep the stairs, and met him coming up stairs with several rolls of linen on his arm—when I got down to the passage, which is on the ground-floor, I saw two boxes in the passage, and two men with them—I went out, and fetched my husband, and told him I thought there was a case of bankruptcy, or robbery, coming into the house—my husband came, and spoke to the two men who were in the passage—the prisoner was at that time up stairs—one of the men fetched him down, and the prisoner told my husband that it was his property, and it was all right—my husband wanted a policeman, but we could not find one—the prisoner and the other two men then emptied the boxes, which con<lb/>tained Irish linens—the linens were put into the prisoner's room—the pri<lb/>soner and one of the other men then went away with the empty boxes, and my husband followed, and gave them in charge.</p>

I am the witness's husband—I am a butcher—I re<lb/>collect my wife calling me that morning, while I was in the slaughter-house adjoining my premises—I came into the passage where this pro<lb/>perty was standing—I saw two men there, and the prisoner was fetched down—I had seen a cart at half-past six o'clock that morning draw up to the door, and saw a man undo the tail-board of the cart, and drag out a large wrapper, which appeared to have something very weighty in it, and also a small wrapper, and there were then two boxes left in the cart—after the prisoner had been brought down, I questioned him as to what property that was—he said, "It is all right; it is mine"—I said, "Take it out of the way, I rather doubt about its being all right," and I told my wife to get a policeman—she could not get one—I then went out myself, and was gone nearly half-an-hour, but I could not get one—when I came back one of the other men was gone—the prisoner and the other ran who remained then went off with the two empty boxes—I followed till I got across the Seven Dials—I then saw a policeman—the prisoner and the other man then went to a house, and put down the boxes—the other man got away, but the prisoner was taken—we questioned him about the goods—he said two men had come to him the night before, and asked him if he would take in some goods, and he said yes.</p>

On the morning of the 14th of July Bradley spoke to me—I followed the prisoner and another man, who were carrying the boxes to Bond's house, in St. Andrew's-street—the other man ran off—I took the prisoner, and asked him where the property was that had been in the boxes—he said in his room—I took him back to his room, and found there sixty-one pieces of Irish linen and twenty pieces of diaper—he said two men had brought them to him—he said he knew one of the men, which was the man who had carried one of the boxes with him—that he had asked him the night before if he might bring some pro<lb/>perty there—he told him he might, and the two men had brought it in the morning—I then asked him How he came to move the boxes—he said the other man, Coppen, had told him he must remove the two boxes and the wrapper, as it was not safe to leave them there—I then took the goods and the boxes to the station—I found, in the prisoner's lodging, a large skeleton' key, a screw-driver, and some tobacco and cheroots—I have com<lb/>pared pared this screw-driver with the marks on the desk, which had been broken open in the warehouse of Mr. Crawford, and it corresponds.</p>

The prisoner came home in the same ship—he slept by himself, in a room where all our boxes were, at a lodging-house—I had a watch-guard, with a silver cross to it—I took it off on Monday night, the 25th of July, and put it into my box, which I locked, but the staple was not down into the Jock—the next morning I observed my chest—I then locked it—I returned in the evening, and my chest was apparently as I had left it—I missed my chain on the Saturday following—this is my chain—I have not seen the crucifix since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Ellis and Ever<lb/>ington, of St. Paul's Church-yard. On Saturday, the 18th of June, a per<lb/>son named Bull came to our house (he had been in our employ from eight to ten years before), he produced 4 dressed and 4 undressed skins as a sample, and asked if we bought such things—he said he had about 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. timber of them—he wanted 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the dressed and 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the undressed—I said I must see the bulk—he said he would show me timber dressed, and asked if I would purchase them first, he would show me the others afterwards—having heard of Mr. Scratch's robbery, I made a communica<lb/>tion to them, and an appointment was made for Bull to come again, which he did in half an hour, accompanied by the prisoner—they brought these 6) timber of ermine skins—Bull introduced the prisoner to me as the owner of the skins—he told me he was a Sir John Winning ton, who bad made a purchase of them—in consequence of something which had passed between me and Mr. Charles, I went on to buy these timbers for 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this invoice was made out—the prisoner wrote it—<hi rend="italic">I</hi> asked for some reference to be given, and a Mr. Bartholomew, of New Inn, was given—the prisoner</p>

               <p>and Bull then went away. On Monday the 20th, the prisoner brought a timber of undressed skins—he said that was a sample of 31 timbers, and 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was mentioned as the price—I told him I could not buy them unless I saw the whole of them—he went to fetch them immediately—he returned without them, and said he was too late, he could not see the party and be could not bring them that day—an appointment was made that he was to bring them on the 24th of June—in the mean time I received a letter from Bull—after the receipt of it I went to a public-house—I found no one there.—On the 24th of June the prisoner brought 30 timbers of un<lb/>dressed—22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was bargained for as the price of the whole of them—I made him that offer and he accepted it—I proceeded to count the skim, and while they were being counted I sent to Mr. Schacht's place, and Mr. Charles came to the place—he stated in the prisoner's hearing that he be<lb/>lieved they were his property and that they were stolen from their pre<lb/>mises—the prisoner said they were his property and he would not give account of them—he was then taken into custody—Messrs. Ellis and Everington use these skins in their business—about three persons in London import these skins.</p>

On Monday evening, the 25th of April, I was at the corner of Southampton-street, Strand, about five or six minutes to nine o'clock I had on a <hi rend="italic">blouse</hi>, and was dressed much the same as I am now—I was looking at some prints in a window—I saw the prisoner there—he was a stranger to me—there were several persons round the window—I was looking at a print, and the prisoner observed to me that that was a well done thing—I did not make him any answer at first, but, after a second or two, to the best of my recollection, I said, J thought it was—I then moved a little further to another part of the window, and the prisoner came again by the side of me—he said, "You appear to understand these things, Sir"—I was still looking at the prints—I replied, "Not much"—he then, after a second or two, said, "I beg your pardon, Sir, I have been out of employ some time; I have a few relics at home which I wish to dispose of, I do not think they are of much value; I should be glad to dispose of them if I could find a purchaser"—I said, "I am no buyer, as I do not under<lb/>stand such things, but what do they consist of?"—he mentioned the names of a few prints and books, but I cannot recollect them—I then asked where he lived—he said, "Oh, not above a minute or two's walk," mentioning a street in the neighbourhood of Drury-lane, which I do not remember—I said, "As I am going that way, I have no objection to look at them, although I may not become a purchaser"—I then went with him—we crossed the road, and, to the best of my recollection, the clock struck nine as we crossed Southampton-street—we went straight down to Stanhope-street, near Clare-market and Drury-lane—the prisoner crossed the road to a chandler's-shop at the corner of Stanhope-street, and there purchased a candle—I did not <hi rend="italic">go</hi> in with him—he came out of the shop with a candle in his hand—it was not alight—he was about turning into, as I thought, a side-door of the chandler's-shop, but it afterwards appears it was the next door, and I said to the prisoner, had he not better get a light—he said, "Oh no, Sir, never mind a light; if you will allow me to lay hold of your hand, I will lead you to the foot of the banisters, and I will soon get a light"—I went into the passage—the street-door was open—he did not get a light—he led me to the banisters—he went on first—I felt my way up by the banisters till we arrived at the third story—I then found that the prisoner had got a light—he had got up a little before me, and had got a light by the time I had got up—I was on the landing—there was a box of Lucifer's on a table before the door—be</p>

               <p>was in the back-room, and I stepped in after him—I noticed a print hang<lb/>ing on the left hand side against the wall in the room—I asked the prisoner whether that was one of the prints that he wished to dispose of—he made reply—my back was towards him—I was about to repeat the question, when he said, "B—your eyes, I have neither prints or books either; what do you mean <hi rend="italic">to</hi> give me?"—"Give you!" I replied, "I have nothing <hi rend="italic">to</hi> give you: what do you mean? and for what purpose have you brought me here?"—upon that he seized hold of me by my trousers, outside, under the flap, and said, "I will shoot your b—head through your shoulders if you don't give me all the money you have got about you"—I said I had none—he said I was a b—liar—he still held me in the same manner—for fear he should rob me I said I had only got a shilling and a few halfpence—be said, "Give me that"—I had 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in one trousers' pocket, and some halfpence in the other—I took out some silver from my right hand breeches pocket, and in doing so, I pulled out 18(2.—upon that he said, "You have got more; give me that, give me the 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I gave him the shilling—I gave it him for fear he should rob me—I was then about to leave, when he said, Give me the 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "No, I will not; that is all I have got"—he then relinquished his hold of me, and I at<lb/>tempted to get out of the room—he then seized hold of me again, and said, "Now you b—I will nail you; I will tear your b—linen; I will tear your shirt, and then I will give you in charge if you don't give me the whole pf the money you have got"—I endeavoured to extricate myself from him, but did not succeed in getting out of the room—the prisoner rent the flap of my trowsers down, and pulled out my shirt—I was strug<lb/>gling with him as well as I could—to the best of my recollection, I had lost all command of myself—he first rent on. corner of my shirt—he could not tear it with his nails, and he picked up something off the floor, either a piece of china or a piece of slate, or some hard substance, and tore a hole in it—he did not tear a piece off—I then adjusted my things as well is I could, got <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the door of the room, and made the best of my way down stairs—he followed me—I do not know How I got down stairs—I got out of the house—I do not think we had been out of the house a minute and a half before I saw a policeman—the prisoner reached the policeman first, and was about saying something to him when I stepped across the way, and gave him in charge—he was taken to Bow-street—I was examined he fore the Magistrate, and he was committed for trial—ten or twelve days afterwards I was taken ill, and was taken to St. Bartholomew's hospi<lb/>tal, where I was confined till after the next Sessions were over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not swear at Bow-street that you would not be answerable for anything you had done since you had been taken ill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I stated that after I came out of the hospital, I could not hold myself responsible for what I did or said, because I came out against the wishes of my friends, and likewise of the medical advisers of the establish<lb/>ment—I said I would not be answerable for what I said for a certain period, till I came back from the country—I was deranged—I do not know How long I was ill, neither do I recollect when I came out of the hospital—you were committed before I went into the hospital—I went into the country after coming out of the hospital—I have since understood that I remained at home a week or so, but I was not competent to take any part in any business—that is why I stated at Bow-street, that I could not be res<lb/>ponsible for what I did or said, before I went into the country.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it your embarrassments of life that affected your mind, or this charge? have not your family been in a state of pauperism in St, Sepul<lb/>chre's parish; and have you not been set up in business several times? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some three years ago I was attacked with fever, and was then taken <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the parish in which I now reside, and in which I have been brought up, and there I was supported by the parish authorities; my affairs became embarrassed; that certainly did not affect my mind—I saw some lights as we went up the stairs of the house you took me to, on the first floor in particular—it was candle-light, which shone under the door of the room I cannot say whether there was any light in the room on the second floor in all probability there was—I do not swear there was not—I did not see any light as I came down—I have hardly any recollection of How I did come down—had I called out I doubt very much whether any person could have heard me, for your door was closed—I said at Bow-street, that you took something off the ground towards the fire-place, and tore my shirt with it—when you got down stairs you appeared to wish to avoid the policeman, but seeing that I was determined on crossing the way, you came to the policeman first—you made no charge against me—you said that we never went into any house—you did not speak to any person while you were in my company—I did not pay much attention—you might have spoken to one or two as you passed—I cannot recollect whether you did or not—I swear on my solemn oath that I gave you a shilling—what you did with it I do not know—you had plenty of opportunity of disposing of it, because as I went out at the door you blew the light out—you did not object to go to the station, it was no use your objecting—the Magistrate did not ask me whether I had ever been there myself in trouble, on such a charge, before—on my oath I never had been there on any such charge before, either as the accused or as an accuser—I do not recollect the Magistrate asking me any such question—I did not produce the shirt and trousers which you tore—I have the shirt on now with the tear in it—you were committed to New gate—application was made for you to be remanded till next Session, on a certificate being produced from the medical gen<lb/>tleman of the hospital—I was made acquainted that you were still in prison after I came out of the hospital, when my mind was in a sufficient state for it—I am not aware that any application was made on my part for an<lb/>other remand—it could have been done—I do not know that my wife was aware of where I was—you had no pistol or any weapon in your hand, when you said you would shoot my head off my shoulders, but I apprehend you meant with your fist—you held me in the manner I have described—you might have struck me—you might have killed me—on being sent next day to identify the house, I found it was respectable to all appearance outside—I know nothing of the inmates—I went out of the room first—the door was not locked or fastened, neither did it appear <hi rend="italic">to</hi> me when you went up stairs that the door was locked—any person might have had access to your room apparently.</p>

                  </hi>. I have an employment in the house of Messrs. Ellis and Everington, in St. Paul's Churchyard—I am nephew to Mr. Wynne Ellis, the Member for Leicester—I lodge at No. 44, Great Marlborough-street, near Oxford-street. On Thursday evening, the 11th of August, about five minutes before nine, I went out to take a walk—I proceeded through Grosvenor-gate into Hyde-park—I am in the habit of frequently walking in the Park after coming home from busi<lb/>ness of an evening—I generally leave the City about seven o'clock—on that evening it was past seven—I proceeded straight across the Park, towards Kensington-gardens—after proceeding about three hundred yards into the center of the Park, I found the grass damp, and turned into the path, which cuts obliquely from the Serpentine to Oxford-street—I turned to my right, and was then in a direction towards Oxford-street, about three hundred yards from the gate—the prisoner New stead then approached me from behind, and, touching his hat politely, asked the nearest road to the City—he had on a black coat, buttoned, and presented a respectable ap<lb/>pearance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220215"/>
               <p>—he stated that he had been spending the day at Kensington, and was going to some lane in the City, but what lane it was I do not recollect—I told him the road that I was going was his most direct way—we walked on together as this conversation was going on, about twenty or thirty yards—I then heard some one coming behind me, and, on looking round, I saw the other prisoner, Stringer, coming towards me—he seized me by the collar, called me a d——beast, and said I had been guilty of indecently exposing my person—I raised my stick with a view to knock him down, when New stead seized my arm, and said, "You had better go quietly to the station-house"—I remarked, that if there were two of them it was useless my resisting—I proceeded at a prisoner with Stringer towards the gate, to Oxford-street—New stead fol<lb/>lowed behind us—we went down Par Wane, and down one of the streets lead<lb/>ing into Grosvenor-square—Stringer observed that he had been watching me for the last three-quarters of an hour, and added, that my friend (meaning New stead) kept close behind me—he was behind—I requested Stringer, if he felt disposed to take me to the station, to go to my house, that I might take some friend with me—I did not say where it was—I said it was in the neighbourhood—we then proceeded down Lower Brook-street, in a contrary direction to the station, I presume, in order to go to my house—he asked me what security I would give him if he allowed me to go into my house—I said, "What security can you require if you see me to my door?"—when we <hi rend="italic">got</hi> opposite Mivart's Hotel, I saw a policeman about forty yards off—I said, "Here is a policeman, it will soon be set<lb/>tled"—Stringer immediately said, "You shall not go to your lodging, you shall go to the station"—I said I did not care where I went—we imme<lb/>diately turned back down Davis-street, for the purpose, as it struck me, of avoiding the policeman—we went towards Berkeley-square, and met a body of the police—I remarked, that the police were coming towards us, and Stringer immediately stopped—(New stead had gone away on my re<lb/>marking that I had seen the policeman at the bottom of Brook-street—I then looked behind, and saw that he had gone)—as the police approached us Stringer halted with me—I said, "Here are the police, we will go to<lb/>wards them"—we crossed the road, he in the mean time seizing my collar, and dragging me towards them, as though I were a prisoner—he seized me by the collar at the corner of Davis-street, when we first saw them—on our coming up to the police, he said, "I give this man in charge to you for an indecent assault," adding, that if the sergeant went back a little way, he would probably find the other fellow—we were then taming to<lb/>wards the station, but, on his saying that, we went back, but saw nothing of New stead—I was then conveyed to Vine-street station, in custody Stringer went into the private office, and made a charge against me which I did not hear—the inspector called me forward on Stringer leaving the office, and read the charge to me—I was then sent down, and locked up for the night—I applied for writing materials both that night and in the morning, and for a messenger, stating that I had money in my pocket to satisfy them, but it was taken no notice of—on the following morning I was taken to Marlborough-street—my charge was the third, I believe—I waited half-an-hour for Stringer to come—he made his appearance then, and was examined—I was then locked up as a prisoner at the police-court—the Magistrate called on me to find bail, and I remained at the office till I procured bail-one of my bail knew the firm of Shepherd and Sutton, in whose employ</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220216"/>
               <p>Stringer had stated himself to be, and he immediately went, and brought Mr. Shepherd back with him—Mr. Shepherd was then confronted with Stringer before the Magistrate—I was not present, but in the evening, by the advice of the Magistrate's clerk, I gave Stringer in charge for an as<lb/>sault, from what had transpired on Mr. Shepherd's arrival.</p>

                  </hi>. J attended as clerk to the Justice on the hearing of this charge, and took down what Stringer said on that occa<lb/>sion—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"John Ellis Churchill charged by William Fitzgerald, who, being sworn, says, 'I am in the employ, as porter, of Robert Shep<lb/>herd and William Sutton, of Foster-lane, Cheap side, wholesale stationert. About half-past nine o'clock last night I was in Hyde-park, and I was passing a cluster of trees, when I saw the defendant and another man (<hi rend="italic">the statement here went on to describe both the parties in an indelicate and disgusting situation, which in law would amount to a misdemeanor)—I</hi> sprang upon them, and seized hold of both—they struggled, and the defendant had a stick, and endeavoured to strike me, and in my endeavoring to prevent it the other one got away; the defendant buttoned up his trousers, and begged of me to let him go, saying he was a gentleman, and was going out on a party, as this morning, grouse shooting; he begged of me <hi rend="italic">to</hi> loose hold of him, saying he would walk quietly; on my doing so he attempted to run away; he offered me his stick, and all the money he had about him, if I would let him go; be said it was a gold-headed stick, and had his crest on it. I afterwards, on meeting some police-constables, gave him in charge of the police-sergeant. I have been in the employ of Messrs. Shepherd and Co. for these last two years.'"—The prosecutor was held to bail, him<lb/>self in 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and two sureties of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, to answer the complaint be was locked up—about half-past four one of the bail came, and brought Mr. Shepherd with him, and, in consequence of Mr. Shepherd saying that Stringer was not in his service, we sent a messenger off to endeavour to find him—he came to the office about six—the Magistrate remained till then—Mr. Shepherd was then confronted with him—Stringer was then asked some questions by the Magistrate, but he was not sworn—I have what he said—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"William <hi rend="italic">Fitzgerald</hi> says, 'I am now out of a situation; I was never in the employ of Messrs. Shepherd and Sutton, but my brother lived with them three years; I have left my situation about two months; I was then living with Mr. Charles Bailey, in a street running into Judd-street; I lived with him as his servant; he is an independent gentleman, and he had no occasion for my services; previous to that I was living in the service of Mr. Cale, a coffee-house keeper, in Brewer-street; I was living with him nearly two years. It is false what I swore this morning, that I was a porter, in the employ of Shepherd and Sutton—the reason I swore so was, I was out of a situation, and my brother having lived in their service, it came to my head to say so. It is about two years since that he lived there. When I swore this morning that I communicated to my employers that I had a charge at this court—that is, if I did do so—it was false. If I swore this morning that I had some difficulty in getting leave in coming from my employers, that is false. If any person has stated that I was seen in company with Edwards this morning, it is false. It is not true that Edwards, who spoke to Mr. M'Arthur, lodges in the same house as I do; he lodges in Berwick-street. I saw Edwards last night, and before that about a fortnight ago. I never saw Mr. M'Arthur before to-day. I do not know Mr. Ward. I did not instruct Edwards to employ a solicitor;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220217"/>
               <p>I did not know he had done so, nor can I account for Edwards's coming into court since the case first came on; I have not seen him since. Ed<lb/>wards is a journeyman cabinet-maker, and I believe earns about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week. I did not tell the inspector last night that I would be here this morning, but that I must first ask my employers' leave. I cannot say that I see Mr. Shepherd or Mr. Sutton now in court; I have seen Mr. Shepherd about six times. My stating that I was living with Messrs, Shepherd and Sutton came out unawares; I was not prepared for the question."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Mr. Shepherd in court at the time he made that statement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was—I had heard him say on the previous examination that he could with difficulty get his employer's leave, but that was not taken down at the time—he did not appear when the charge was called on, it was half-an-hour after its turn—I asked him what made him so late, and he said that—at the second examination in the evening, before he was apprized that Mr. Shepherd was there, I told him that he had given' a great deal of trou<lb/>ble, did he persist that he was still in the employ of Messrs. Shepherd and Sutton?—he said that he did—I asked him if we went there could we get one of the partners—he said it was no use, because they were gone to Cam<lb/>berwell and the warehouse was shut up—this was in the evening just before we went in before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. I went with Stringer to Vine-street station to make my charge of assault against him there, he being in cus<lb/>tody of a policeman—when I had made the charge, and was leaving the office, he turned to me in a menacing attitude, and said, "You shall have New stead before you in the morning, the man with whom you were inde<lb/>cently engaged in the park last night, I have Been him this afternoon"—that was the first time I heard the name of New stead mentioned, and a friend of mine remarked at the same time, that he was sure it was not a fictitious name, from the singularity of it—I had not been talking to New<lb/>stead in the park a minute before Stringer came up—we bad not been in company twenty yards—there is not a word of truth in the statement which has been read—I deny the charge totally—I have stated all that passed be<lb/>tween me and.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220218"/>
               <p>that this man (New stead) is the man that was with Mr. Churchill—he was shorter and stouter than this man; Mr. Churchill is a gentleman of respectability and high connexions, I am a poor man and with a character not the best, I know; at the same time that ought not to stand in the way of a man; it is not because I may have committed myself once that I should lose the feelings of a man; I never asked Mr. Churchill for a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or took a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from him; I never assaulted him in any way but taking and giving him in charge for the act which I found him at.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">New stead</hi>, I totally deny ever seeing Mr. Churchill in my life; he has employed a party who is paid to come and speak against me, to say that he saw me on the night in question with this party at six o'clock; I was in the City at the time; he has paid and kept him at a policeman's house; he told him, in the presence of the officers, that he would send him to prison if he did not do that. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

You met me again on the Friday previous to giving me into custody, by St. Martin's church, you, Plume, and a young drummer; you said again, "Are you not gone off to Holland?" some words ensued between you and one of the parties, which ended in a quarrel. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. There was a quarrel—I said on that occasion, that when I had an opportunity, a chance of transporting the pair of them, I would do it as far as laid in my power, such horrible characters as they were—as to the per<lb/>son he speaks of, he is the person he called his nephew.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the C division of police. I took the charge made by Stringer against Mr. Churchill—after doing so I told Stringer that he must appear next day at Marlborough-street police-court—he said he would appear, but he must first ask his employers' leave—lie said they lived in Foster-lane, in the City—he did not mention their names, that I recollect.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Stringer's Defence. The prisoner commenced by persisting in the statement which he had made before the Magistrate with regard to the indecent situate in which he found the prosecutor, and proceeded to say</hi>, I sprang on them, and seized them both; Mr. Churchill raised his stick to strike me; I put my hand up to keep the blows off; at the same time the other prisoner ran away in a side direction from me; I called loudly for police, but no one came; I seized Mr. Churchill, and kept him by the arm. In walking across the park to Oxford-street, he said, "I am a gentleman, and I will give you my word as such that I will walk quietly by your side, if you will allow me." I let him <hi rend="italic">go</hi> then for a few minutes, and walked by his side; he then attempted to run away from me half a dozen yards; I over<lb/>took him and said, "I shall keep you in my custody, and give you to the first policeman I meet;" he said, "I am a gentleman, for God's sake, don't expose me, it will ruin me." I said, "You should have thought of this before you committed the act, and then you would not have been in my power; after what I have seen, I shall certainly keep you in my custody till I give you to a policeman." I thought there was a station-house in Mount-street, and went in that direction; on inquiry I found there was no station-house there, it was a work-house. On going down towards Brook-street he said, "I am a gentleman, and don't expose me; I live in this neigh<lb/>bourhood; I will give you all I possess if you will allow me to go about my business." I said, "I want nothing from you in any shape or form; you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220221"/>
               <p>must go with me to the station;" he said, "I will give you all the money I have about me, and this gold-headed stick; I have promised to go with some gentlemen grouse shooting." I said, "I can't help it, as I have gone so far I shall give you into custody." He said, "If you are determined to take me, will you allow me to call at my house, to take a friend with me to the station-house?" I said I had no objection, if it was in our road, and provided we did not meet a policeman before. We met a body of police<lb/>men on duty; I went to the first policeman and said, "Can you take this gentleman into custody?" He said, "I don't know that I can; here is my sergeant, apply to him." I went to the sergeant, and gave him into custody, and said, "The other fellow is not far off, he is loitering behind;" and at one time the other man came so near to us, that Mr. Churchill said, "Get away, away." I went back with the policeman to look after the other party, leaving Mr. Churchill in custody of a policeman in Brook-street. I said to the policeman, "If he sees you with me he will be sure to get away;" so I walked three or four steps ahead of the policeman; he followed me closely, so that the other prisoner could have seen I was with a policeman looking after him; we could not see him, and came back, and went to Vine-street station, where I pressed the charge against Mr. Churchill, and he was locked up. I then came back, and went into the Quadrant, walked up and down, and met a friend of mine, Edwards, a cabinet-maker; I told him the case; he said, "You seem quite flurried." I said, "Yes, the thing has upset me;" he said, "Well, are you going to press the charge?" I said, "Oh, yes, I intend pressing the charge to-morrow morning;" he said, "You had better have advice." I said, "It is not in my power; the charge is straightforward, and I will answer to it." I went to Marlborough-street in the morning; and after Mr. Churchill was committed, a person came to the desk, stood by, listened to what was going forward, and said to the clerk, "Is this case committed?" he said, "It is." He stood for some minutes, and went out; the clerk said, "Do you know that man?" I said, "No, I do not." When I went out from Marlborough-street I saw this party; he said, "Do you know me?" I said, "No." He said, "My name it M'Arthur; I am sent to assist you by Edwards; I am a solicitor," or a solicitor's clerk. I went into a public-house in Marlborough-street, drank a glass of ale, and M'Arthur was with me; a messenger came from the office and said, "It is necessary for you to come into court again;" previous to this M'Arthur had been to the court, and made some observa<lb/>tion before the Magistrate; when I went in the Magistrate said, "Have you employed a solicitor?" I said, "No;" he said, "This gentleman says he is employed by a friend of yours, named Edwards." I said, "I know a person named Edwards, a young man, a cabinet-maker, who I mentioned this case to last night;" he said, "Are you agreeable that this gentleman shall conduct the case for you?" I said, "I have no objection, but I don't see that there is any occasion for it, as the party is committed." I came out of the office, went home, and was at home about ten minutes; I then went into the City; while I was gone, a policeman came to my lodging and inquired for me, and he was told I should be at home by six o'clock. I came home at a quarter before six, and was washing when a messenger from the office came again, and said, "The Magistrate wants to see you again; he has forgotten to ask you some questions;" when I got there a second time, it was to ascertain whether I had lived with Messrs. Shepherd and Sutton, which I had not. I denied that, but before that I said I had; at the same time I wish to impress on your minds that I gave my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220222"/>
               <p>right name and address, No. 16, Denzil-street, where I was found by the messenger. I answered the questions the Magistrate put to me, and the consequence was that while I was there the bail was accepted for Mr. Churchill, and immediately after I came out of the office I was given into custody for assaulting Mr. Churchill; in what way I have assaulted him I know not. I have not abused, ill-used, or struck him. I accused him of this act, and I will accuse him of it to the day of my death. I saw it with my eyes; I am satisfied he is the man; I will swear it before this Court and my God in any shape or form. I did not assault Mr. Churchill fur<lb/>ther than by taking him by the collar when I caught him in the act. I have received nothing from him; I have extorted nothing from him in any form. I was told at Marlborough-street that I was an extortioner. In what manner or shape have I extorted money? Has my language been bad? Certainly not. I caught him in a crime that every man who is a man will revolt at, which the very savages would revolt at. I certainly am a poor man, and my character, I know, is not good in consequence of once being in prison and being convicted; but does that alter the feelings of a man? I entreat you to weigh it well. I am pressed down by a per<lb/>son who has talent and money to clear him, and make the public mind easy; but I say it again, as I stand before the Court and my God, the man is guilty of the crime I have accused him of.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220229"/>
               <p>"Here is a young man who has been, like a great many more, rather wild at home—(I knew that, and expressed it particularly to Mr. Alsford)—the father seems inclined to serve them, as the sister has got some money, has brought me a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, which he wants discounted"—he said, "If you had come last night, and it is a real thing, I could have done it, but I have paid all my money away, and have not got above 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I met him again on Saturday afternoon—I had no idea at that moment that the bill would be done—however, we were to make inquiry, to get news of the elder Mr. Layel—I had not the slightest doubt of the prisoner's representation, that his father would do it—I told Mr. Alsford, that the best way would be to depute some one to go to Mr. Layel's house, and make inquiry, and he asked me to do it, as he was rather busy—I went, and the prisoner was standing at the street-door in his shirt-sleeves, and his tooth-brush in his hand, as if just up—I said, "Good morning, I have come to see the old gentleman"—he replied, "Oh, he got so terribly <hi rend="italic">lushy</hi> last night, when we had company, he is not up yet"—he asked me into the parlour—the place seemed all in confusion, and it seemed feasible that company had been there—he went up stairs, knocked at a door, came down again, and said, "The old man is too <hi rend="italic">lushy</hi> to get up yet; sit down"—I said, "No, thank you, I will go and get a glass of beer"—he said, "I will have breakfast, shave myself, and come down"—I went to a public-house, and stopped there three-quarters of an hour, and as I was coming away, hardly intending to go back again, I met the prisoner near the end of the street—I said I was just going—he said, "Well, I can't help it, I have been out some little way; come in, perhaps the old man is about now"—we went into the parlour, and his sister came in—he said, "Martha, go up and tell the old man (or "father," I will not swear which) that the person is come here about the bill"—she went up, and in a short time came down with a piece of paper in her hand; with "The Bill" written on the outside, which was the envelope, and gave it into the prisoner's hands—he said to her, "What did the old man say?"—"Why," she said, "all he said was, 'There it is, don't make a fool of it'—I said, "Oh, is that all he said?"—the prisoner opened the envelope, and wanted to show it to me—I said, "I am not going to do it"—"Oh," they said, "it is a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, with two months' date on it"—he put it in the envelope, and put it into his pocket—we then walked up to London together, went to the Duke of Gloucester, had dinner, and a little brandy afterwards—at three o'clock we went to Mr. Alsford—I had promised to go to him in the middle of the day, to tell him the result of the inquiry I made at the house—we had three or four tumblers of brandy and water, but that was afterwards, be<lb/>tween five and six, and we had something at the Red Lion—Mr. Alsford went with me to the Red Lion—I should think the prisoner was drunk at the time Mr. Alsford came—I judged so from his writing that he made, a memorandum—he was quite capable of taking care of himself—he had drank enough to make his hand shake.</p>

               <p>a drop of grog—I was in a drunken state—I did not think it a strange proposition if the father was a good man, to pay £20 for the use of the money for two months, for I had heard several accounts of the old gentle<lb/>man as being very eccentric, and a man that never paid any debts without giving a bill for them—the prisoner scarcely knew who was going to dis<lb/>count the bill, and he said to me in the morning, "I hope it is not going into any Jew discounter's hands, for my father has been punished so much through them with me"—I most decidedly thought it was a good bill—if I had not thought so, I should not have recommended it—the daughter brought it down, as if the father had written it up-stairs, otherwise it would not have been done by my recommendation—I believed it to be a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> transaction.</p>

               <p>the prisoner stated himself to be a widower—he said his former wife had died from excessive drinking, that she had drowned herself from excestivt drinking, and that he and her father identified her body—I have two chil<lb/>dren by him—I have been separated from him for two years and, I think seven months—at that time I had heard of his former wife being alive—I was not able to satisfy myself of the fact at the actual time of my leaving him—my mind was in doubt on the subject—I know a person of the name of Mrs. Pool—she has been represented to me as a sister of the prisoner—I once showed this letter to the prisoner, and asked him if he knew the handwriting—he said he did not, but he believed it to be that of Mrs. Aldhouse's sister, a lady of the name of Hill, who had got his eldest child—I do not know whether I asked him if it was his wife's handwriting.</p>

                  </hi>. I am son-in-law of Mrs. Jones—in 1891 I was living at Egham—I saw the prisoner there and became acquainted with him—he told me he was resident at Egham for a short time, owing to some law proceedings that were pending at that time, brought on by the extravagance of his wife—he made some remarks respecting an elder child of his—he said if his wife was, I think he said, a more serene, a more quiet woman, he should be much more happy in his mind, but it is so long ago I almost forget the word—it is eleven years since—it was in June, I think.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>.) The purport of all the letters I received from the prisoner, as far as my recollection goes, was to know where his wife was—speaking of her as "my wife," and "what has become of her"—an annuity was paid to her after her separation, and has been up to this day—it would not have become his if she had died—it was</p>

               <p>willed to her by my brother, to her sole and separate use during her life, and afterwards it goes to her children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might not his inquiries have been to know whether there was anything to which he was entitled, under the impression that she was no longer receiv<lb/>ing it, that she was dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It never appeared so to me—the last of those inquiries was in 1837—I cannot recollect when the first was—they might have come at various times—there were none as early as 18, 30—I never had anything to do with the property until my brother died, which was on the 6th of April, 1833—I have no objection to state my motive for keeping him ignorant of the place of her abode—I returned no answer ex<lb/>cept to the last letter—that was in 1837—I did not tell whether she was or where she was—I had every reason to believe, from various histories that I had heard, that his motive was not a good one—and as far as relates to his inquiries as to where his wife was, I was in total ignorance of her resi<lb/>dence—I could not have told anybody where she was—I could not tell myself—I tried to discover in various ways—I merely corresponded with her about her money, and my letters were always desired to be addressed to a Mr. Hodges, in Change-alley, Cornhill—that correspondence was with her—she wrote merely, "Address to me, at Mr. Hodges', No. 20 some<lb/>thing, Change-alley, Cornhill"—she studiously kept her residence con<lb/>cealed from me, as she has more than once stated to me, fearing I should tell her husband where she was—she was not living at Norwich to my knowledge—she was born there, and it was her home until she married—she was always called Morse—my brother did not educate her as a child—the mother lived in a separate house—he visited the mother constantly, and always brought her sister and two sons up in the same name—I was not at the christening of any of them—I never heard her called by the name of Montague, nor do I believe she ever was—I was not present at the marriage—she invariably bore the name of Morse—Sir William Foster is my co-trustee for the children, and co-executor—she never resided where Sir William Foster lived—he never saw her at all, I believe, at least, not to know her—he could not have given any information about her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So that all inquiries would have been baffled if the prisoner had made them most diligently, to find her out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as we were con<lb/>cerned, but in his letters to me he always asked me to tell him where his wife was—I understood from her, when I saw her a month ago, that they have been separated nearly thirteen years—since her separation I have always understood she has been attending to the education of her two daughters, and keeping them, as far as possible, concealed from the family, entirely eluding inquiry—she has the interest of a little more than 5, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the 31/2 per Cents.—I should suppose it was his interest in a pe<lb/>cuniary point of view to have lived with her, and that always appeared to me to be the motive for his letters—I have never seen her since her mar<lb/>riage until a month ago—I did not see her when she was married—I know her before she married—she has always gone by the name of Aldhouse since her marriage—I have directed letters to her, and she has written to me—the prisoner's inquiries were after that person as his wife—I was the half brother of her father.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220237"/>
               <p>that he was involved in law proceedings—probably it was on account of a by-gone transaction of his wife's—my impression is, that he spoke of his wife as then living—he was not a stranger, I had met him several times on the same ground—my impression at the time was, that his wife was living—he stated it in that way—he did not positively say his wife was living—he said his wife would not allow him to see his child—that he particularly spoke of, and it was a child for whom he had some fondness apparently—he spoke of that precise time—that is my impression—I am confident it was in 1831, because I came to Egham in April, 1831—I was at Wands<lb/>worth before the Magistrate, but was not called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What led to this familiarity between you and the prisoner, that he should talk of his affairs to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He frequently took the same walk that I took in the evening, and, from the number of times I saw him, we came into conversation with each other, and, from his dejected manner, I took the liberty of asking him the cause of his appearing so dejected—I am confident of the time, from letters which I have at home.</p>

I am the wife of Benjamin Vincent, of Smith's-rents, East-lane, Greenwich—I have lived there going on for four years—I knew Bridget Holloway, the deceased—she lived in the next room to me—mine is the front, hers was the back—a partition of wood separates our rooms—you can hear what passes from one room to the other—you can hear persons talk—the prisoner was in the habit of going to the room in which the deceased lived—I thought, at first, they were man and wife—he is a pensioner in the Hospital—on Sunday, the 10th of July, about nine o'clock at night, I was in my own room, and heard the cry of "Murder" coming from the deceased's room several times—I did not hear any other person but her—she continued to cry "Murder" several times, until the cries grew fainter—I went down and told Mrs. Smith, who was at the door—I then went back to my room, and heard no more noise, or cries that night—next day I went into Bridget Holloway's room, about half-past twelve—I brought her up some hot water—I found her sitting on her bed undressed, in her petticoat and shift—she told me she was very bad—she could hardly speak—she was obliged to stop two or three times between the words—she showed me her left side—it was all bruised black and discoloured—she said she should never get over it, for she was sure her ribs were broken—she appeared to be labouring under the impression that she should die—she said the prisoner had done it by constantly knocking her on the side—I saw her again on Tuesday evening, and then no more till after her death—she died on Thursday—about twelve o'clock on Tuesday night I was in my own room, and heard her groans—I never heard her any</p>

On Sunday evening, the 10th of July, about eight o'clock, I was going down stairs, and met her on the stairs—she appeared to be as well as usual—the spoke to me—I do not know what age she was—she appeared about seventy—Mrs. Vincent came and told me something; that evening, in consequence of which, I went up into my own room, and heard the deceased crying bitterly, in her own room—I did not see her any more that night—about half-past eight in the morning, I heard her knocking in her room—I went out to see what it was, and then went up into her room—she was just sat down on the bed—she was alone—when she spoke she put her hand to her left side, and it was several seconds before she could speak—she showed me her bruises—I observed bruises on her side—she said she was sure her ribs were broken, and he had given her her death-blow—she had a bruise on each arm, a bruise on her breast, and a slight one on the leg, besides those on the side—I went up about one o'clock, and took her a little broth, thinking it might do her good—she seemed in more agonizing pain than before—she was in the habit of going into the streets with a basket, for the last eight months—she went out that afternoon, between three and four o'clock—I carried her basket down stairs for her—she seemed very bad, and still complained of being very ill, that he had given her her death<lb/>blow, and she should never get over it—she returned between six and seven—I saw her next day, Tuesday, between three and four in the after<lb/>noon—she appeared to be getting worse—I did not see her on Wednesday—I heard her in her room about half-past twelve at night, groaning very much indeed—on Thursday morning, about half-past seven, the prisoner opened my door, came in, and said, "She is gone; she is gone"—another person said directly, "Is she gone to the Union?"—he said, "No; she is dead, she is dead"—in consequence of that, I went up stairs into the room, and found her dead, but not quite cold—there was a bruise to be seen then on her side as she was lying—the prisoner said, "What do you think will be done in this case?"—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Greenwich. I knew the deceased before this occurred—I was called to see her after her death—the prisoner applied to me to give a certificate of the cause of death—I had attended the woman twelve months prior, for a rheumatic affection—at the time the prisoner called on me he stated that she had been in a very infirm state of health a long time—I left the room, to consult a medical report book—on my return, I found Mrs. Vincent there, and in consequence of hearing the word "ill-treatment" made use of, I refused the certificate—I afterwards, by the order of the Coroner, examined the body externally—it presented appearances of bruises, extending from the left shoulder, over the left side, nearly to the pelvis, and also marks of bruises on the right and left arm—four ribs were fractured, two of which were found penetrating a portion of the left lung, which, in my judgment, was the immediate cause of death—the most prominent symptom was the difficulty of breathing—a blow or a kick would most probably produce such an injury—it must have been very violent—I should say she had been suffering from the injury three or four days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>.

I never attended her before with any complaint of that description—she was subject to rheumatic affection in the winter—the body was in other respects perfectly healthy—the fracture of the ribs was the cause of death, by producing inflammation of the lungs—I doubt whether, if it had been seen to in the first instance, that life could have been saved, from the position in which the ribs were, and the lung being lacerated—it might have given her a chance.</p>

On the 30th of July, about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner at my window—she put her hand under her shawl, and deliberately hit a pane of glass, but did not break it—she then hit it again, broke it, and drew the boots through the window—I followed her out, and she dropped them just before I got hold of her—I saw one fall from her.</p>

On the 8th of February I took a coffee-house of the prisoner, called The Arundel, at Greenwich—I agreed to pay 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he was to be my lodger, and to occupy one bed-room, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and to pay extra for what meals he had there—on the 3rd of May he made out this account, and delivered it to me—I think it she as 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. owing to me—on the 8th of May a quarter's rent would become due, which was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and on the 4th of July, a person was put into possession for it—on the 9th of July I signed an agreement to let it remain for three weeks—I have not got that agreement, I believe one of the condemning brokers has it—I do not know whether he is here—on the 3rd of August my demand against the prisoner was 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the 6th of August I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clergyman of the Church of England, and reside at Lewishan. I had occasion to go into Lincolnshire, where I had resigned two livings which I held there—I had a sister died a short time before, (Mrs. Charles Forster,) and I bad a box which contained various articles of hers, which were kept in Lincolnshire for a niece of hers—I took the prisoner down for the purpose of packing up the wearing-ap<lb/>parel, which I was removing from there to my present residence—she had access to every thing—in consequence of what my servants told me, I sent Duncan up stairs, and be produced these things—I can speak to these stock<lb/>ings very particularly, knowing them to have belonged to my brother—they were marked "C F"—I can see that the C has been taken out, and in this instance the stalk of the "F" is of a different colour to the new work—the box from which these were taken contained other articles of a similar description—this handkerchief I can identify, as being a handsome handkerchief—I have one from the box like it—I cannot say How many there were, but I can say that several have been abstracted—the box is much, lower than it was, in respect to the qnantity of things it contains—these other articles I cannot speak to—here are handkerchiefs which have been recently marked "M P"—they have been lying some time in the box, and they correspond.</p>
