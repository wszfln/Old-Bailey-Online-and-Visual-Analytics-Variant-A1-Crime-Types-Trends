               <p>and stayed the night with her, next morning nature relieved her, and she was quite well—she had another attack about two years after, or it might be a twelvemonth; that was not a sun-stroke—it was some months before her marriage; it lasted one or two days it might have been—she was staying with some friends, and I was sent for—she was quite well after that till her marriage—she genenilly lived with me—I am not a widower—I married again, about two years since, after the prisoner was married; I was a widower at that time—I have other daughters living with me—I think the prisoner was accepted as a suitor in August or the beginning of September and the marriage was in December—I did not tell him that my daughter had shown symptoms of insanity—I said there had been irregularities in her condition, arising from certain causes—I did not tell him that her mind had been affected; I did not consider it had been—I did not consult a doctor on the two occasions—one doctor was consulted, but I found her well before he arrived—no doctor attended her on the second occasion—I do not know or believe that after her marriage she stated that she had been living an improper life—I had no reason to believe so—about twelve months after she came to me from Bethlehem she went back; she found herself getting ill, and she went and placed herself under the same physician—she remained there about twelve months; she then came back to me—she did not go back after that—she has not shown any symptoms of insanity since—she never showed symptoms of dangerous insanity while at Bethlehem—it was mental insanity; that was what they termed it.</p>

I am errand boy to Mr. Sykes, a commission agent, of 57, Carter Lane, Doctors' Commons—on 21st November, about noon, I was in the office by the fire; I turned round, but saw no one—I heard another footstep, turned round, and saw the prisoner taking the coat—I jumped up instantly, and the prisoner walked through the passage, I followed him, and took the coat from him on the doorstep—he got shuffling about and said he would tell Mr. Sykes—I followed him across the road—he said he would go and have some dinner—he went down Creed Lane—I brought him back to my place, my employer was not there, and I asked him to go with me to the Horn Tavern in Knightrider Street—when he got as far as Paul's Chain, he said he would not go any further, and he offered me money to let him go—the policeman came up and I gave him in charge—this is the coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I have been in the employ of the Mint authorities twenty-seven, years—from information I received I went on 30th No<lb/>vember to 1, Bloomsbury Court, Holborn, accompanied by inspectors Brannan, Garfort, Fife, and other officers—we waited till the street-door was open, and then went up to the third floor, which consists of one room—the door was forced open with a sledge-hammer by Inspector Bran<lb/>nan—we did not knock first—when we got in Vine was sitting at a table near the fire in his shirt sleeves with a florin let into a stick in his hand, and he was filing it—there was a clear bright fire—the filing is to take the loose edge of the coin—Sweet was sitting at another table under the window with a bad florin or half-crown in her hand, paring the loose edges with a pair of scissors—on our entering, Vine threw down the stick and the florin and the file, took up an open knife and made a thrust at Inspector Brannan—I had a stick in my hand, and pushed bim back with great force on to a bed, or he would have thrust the knife into his body—Sweet had some coin in her lap—she stood up and threw it down—122 florins, 20 half-crowns, and 164 shillings were found near where she stood, also some imitation gold napoleons, and thirteen half-france—a saucepan was on the fire containing 10lbs. of metal in a state of fusion—I said to Vine, "<hi rend="italic">Well, Jack</hi>, I need not tell you who I am; we came here with a search warrant signed by the Magistrate at Bow Street—he said, "All right, Mr. Brannan, I will acknowledge to it all; she only came here last night for the first time," alluding to Sweet—I knew that to be incorrect—I found a galvanic battery on a bench, and some sulphate of copper, zinc acid, plaster of Paris, and an iron spoon, which are all things used in coining—Inspector Garforth handed me nine double moulds, some of them charged with hot metal; they are for making half-crowns and shillings—here is an article to perfect the</p>

               <p>edge where the get is poured in—I also found some pattern pieces and two counterfeit sovereigns, and thirteen counterfeit half-sovereigns—Ackrill found some good money, and Garforth handed me this box con<lb/>taining silver coins, which I have no doubt are all pattern pieces but one—the room was eighteen feet by fifteen, and it was not possible for Vine to have carried this on without Sweet seeing it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Mint—I have examined the things produced; here is everything necessary for coining on a very large scale—here is a sovereign mould and two counterfeit sovereigns from it; a twenty franc mould and two coins from it; a double sovereign mould and thirteen coins from it; a half-crown mould and twenty coins from it; a florin mould and 122 coins from it; a double shilling mould and 162 coins made from it—among the good money are the patterns which were used for making those moulds—they are very highly finished and very well done—the milling where the surplus metal comes off the get is better than I have ever seen—one of the moulds represents the obverse side of a half-crown.</p>

I said, "Yes; he said, "If you can get me the key of the copper wire cellar I will give you a shilling, and will return the key with the shilling to you in the morning—he did not say why he wanted it, but he said that he would lock himself in the cellar to have a chance to get his things out—he said that he would wait for the key in the public-house next door—I ran away to my masters' and left him without making any answer—I said something to Mr. Edmunds, who minds the front shop; he spoke to Mr. Fleming, who spoke to Mr. Compton Warner, who told me where the key was, and I got it, and took it next door, but the prisoner was not there; I saw him a little way off at the bottom of the Crescent, and went and gave him the key, and he took it away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a beer retailer, and live at 54, Old Nicholl Street, Shoreditch—I have a son who goes by the name of Thomas Burton—he is now a prisoner undergoing sentence—on Friday evening, 8th November, about twenty minutes to seven, the prisoner came to my house—I did not know him before—he sat down and said he had come from my son, and asked me for five half-sovereigns, that they were to be tied up in thread, so that they should not rattle when he gave them to him—he said it would be a benefit to my son—he told me he was a warder in the prison where my son was—he did not give me any paper on that occasion—I told him I had no money—I gave him a half-sovereign on that night, and told him if he came on the Sunday I would try and get him the other 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up—when he was going he asked me to go outside and look about to see that there were no police about, that they should not see him come out of the house—I did so, and told him there was nobody about, and he went out and went up the street, taking the half-sovereign with him—he came again on Sunday evening the 10th for the remainder of the money—I told him I had no more money that night, but if he came on the Monday night I would give it him—I asked him if he gave my son anything out of the money I had given him, and he said he had got him a little wine, and something to sleep him at night—he said he would give him something to drink on the Sunday night—he did not say what—he told me the same as he did on the Friday, to go and look if there was anybody about—I did so, and he left—he came again on the Monday night and asked if I was ready with the remainder of the money—I said, "Yes, my wife has got it," and she gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—I asked him how long the money would last, and he said it would last my son three months—he had a glass of ale and left—I went out as usual to see that there was no police about—he bade me good-bye and said he would send me a letter—on the afternoon of the 18th November from what I heard I went to the House of Correction—I was there shown a number of the prison warders—I picked the prisoner out, and afterwards gave him into custody for stealing the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., by order of the governor of the place; he wished me to give him in charge, and I did so—when he came on the Monday night he brought me a slip of paper from my son—I read a little of it—I think it was my son's writing, but it was written in black-lead pencil, and I could not tell his writing in pencil so well as with a pen—I destroyed that paper; in fact, we destroyed them all, because we were frightened to have them in the place—I am sure it is destroyed—I have looked for it—I have not seen it since that night—he gave it me from his pocket—it was not sealed up—it was put on the table.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—on Friday, 8th November, I saw the prisoner at our house—I gave my husband change of a sovereign, and he took a half-sovereign into the parlour to the prisoner—I saw the prisoner again on the Sunday, and afterwards on the Monday, when I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he was going to do good for my son, to give him a little that he wanted—I saw some bits of paper, but I don't know what was on them, for I cannot read—I saw a piece of paper on the first day the prisoner called, on the Friday—I did not read it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner</hi>). I am the son of James Howard—I was convicted at the Middlesex Sessions on the 5th November—after my sen<lb/>tence I was taken to the House of Correction—the prisoner was an officer there, doing duty—he had charge of that part of the prison where I was at work—he spoke to me on one occasion—he wrote me a piece of paper—I tore it up after reading it—the writing on it was, "Is your name Bur<lb/>ton,</p>

               <p>and are you the man that was tried at the Sessions for the Great Eastern affair?"—I went to the closet to read it—I could not read it on the wheel—he was not present when I read it—I afterwards saw him and nodded to him—the paper further stated, "I am square"—that was at the end of the paper—he gave me a piece of paper and a pencil, and I wrote on it a request to my father to give the prisoner two sovereigns for me—it was before dinner that he gave me the paper and pencil, and after coming from dinner I gave it to him (<hi rend="italic">notice to produce this paper was proved</hi>)—I wrote on the paper for him to give it to my father, giving the address 54, Old Nicholl Street, Bethnal Green, and to receive the two sovereigns—I did not state on the paper what was to be done with the two sovereigns, but it was understood that it was to purchase me some<lb/>thing to eat—this was two or three days after my admission—I saw the prisoner on the following morning, and asked if he had been to my father—this was as we were walking—I asked if he had received any money—he said no, he had not—I spoke to him frequently after that—I wrote again to my father to the same effect, bat more positively—the prisoner gave me some paper—I think that was on the Saturday—I afterwards asked him if he had received any money—he said no; there was no one at home but my mother, that there was a fight on, and all the people were away; that he had seen my mether, and that he had to go down again to receive the money on Tuesday week—that was on the Monday—that would be the Tuesday after my father made the report at the prison—the prisoner never told me that he had received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he stated posi<lb/>tively that he had received none—there was nothing said about what was to be done with the money when he got it—but he knew and I knew—it was understood that it was to purchase something to eat, as I was very hungry at the time, and every man in my position is the same.</p>

Smith's stall at the Cannon Street Station—I am responsible to them for newspapers and books sold there—on the evening of 4th December, about half-past seven, I marked some money to the amount of 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was put in the till—some of the pieces I marked myself—I looked them all over and they were all marked—among the money was nine marked shillings—I left the stall at seven o'clock—the prisoner was left in charge of it—the marked money was not put into the till then—it was put in at twenty-five minutes past eight in the evening—the prisoner was then in charge of the stall—the next morn<lb/>ing I examined the till, but not before the prisoner came—I had examined it over night and detected the loss—it was about a quarter past six in the morning when I examined it—the till was in a drawer belonging to the prisoner—the prisoner was there when I examined it, and missed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said to him, "Bring out the till"—he brought it out, and I then said, "Count up the money"—he counted it, and I then said, "There is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short—he said, "I know nothing of it, I assure you"—I said, "I know more of it than you suppose," and I then taxed him with stealing the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that was missing—he strongly denied it several times, and begged me to be aware of the gravity of bringing such a charge against him—I said I was aware of the gravity of the charge, and was prepared to go on with it—he then seemed very much confused, and tremblingly put his head on his hand—I then asked him if he was prepared to deny it altogether—he made no answer—I again asked him if he was prepared to admit it at once—he made no answer, and I asked if I should have to expose him in the stall by bringing a policeman to search him—he then seemed very much more anxious and confused—I was just about to leave the stall to call one of my boys to go for a policeman when he said, "I took 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. last night"—I then called the boy Holmes—I believe he was just on the threshold of the stall when the prisoner admitted his guilt—I said to him, "What have you done with the money?"—he made nojanswer—I then said, "Turn outyour pockets"—he flung down a shilling and a sixpence—Holmes picked them up from the floor, and handed them to me—I looked at the shilling, and recognised it at once as one of those I had marked and placed in the till—I then said to Holmes, "Richards has confessed to me of robbing two shillings out of the till last night, and this is one of the marked shillings; go for a policeman"—the policeman came after a short interval, during which the prisoner implored me to forgive him, and begged me to pity him—I went with him to the station, and charged him there—he again admitted taking the money—I believe he said, "I took the two shillings last night."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you been long in the position you occupy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two years—I have been at'various other situations—the prisoner had been at Cannon Street about four months—he went with me when I was appointed there—before that he was at the Lewisham Station—that was not considered as a promotion—he was merely sent there for a stop gap—I don't know what his salary was at Lewisham, or whether it was increased—I believe he was only there a week—before that I believe he was in the employ of the Brighton Railway Company for some time at London Bridge—I did not mark all that money—a friend of mine marked the rest, Mr. Charles Lamb, of Mincing Lane; but I examined all the coins as they were marked—I am quite sure they were all marked in my presence—it was about half-past nine in the morning—it was done in my friend's office</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186712160018"/>
               <p>at Mincing Lane—I came from Mincing Lane and went into the first-class waiting-room—Holmes put the money in the till—I was not present when he put it in—my friend gave him the money—I was not present, but I saw him from the first-class waiting-room window, which is exactly opposite the stall—Holmes was at the stall at the time—it was about twenty-five or thirty yards from the waiting-room—there is the width of the pavement between; nothing intervenes except passengers passing and repassing—I was standing at the wiudow of the waiting-room, and had a full view of the stall—my friend gave the money to Holmes about twenty minutes past eight—I did not go to the stall after that—not till after the prisoner had left for the night—when I was absent he had the sole managemeut of the affairs at the stall—if I was absent at the time he closed he would not have to take possession of the money—he would put it into his drawer into the till—I have known on three separate occasions the prisoner taking sums of gold home with him—I told him when I first went there that if there were large amounts of gold to take it home for safety—he did not take any gold home on the night of the 4th September—I am positive of that—on two separate occasions he has removed silver from the station, when I had the contents of the till counted, and I found on one occasion 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deficient, and on another 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never knew him to take the silver home to take care of it—my usual time for going to the stall in the morning was about nine o'clock—on this morning I went at six—I was there before the prisoner came—it was usual for him to produce the till to me when I came at nine—no contingency could possibly arise for him to have to pay money on account—it was the usual course when I went there in the morning for him to produce the till—I never counted the money—it was produced without my request—on this morning I requested it, and he produced it, and he counted it by my direction—he was going to count it out in one sum, and I asked him to count out the various coin, a list of which I held in my hand—when he came to the shillings there were but seven, and I then told him there were 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short—I did not say to him, "Confess that you have taken it, and I will deal leniently with you, and receive a week's notice"—I told him I considered the matter was out of my hands—I said I might have dealt leniently with him—I did not say I would—I did not say I would accept a week's notice, not at any time—the prisoner said at the station that I had promised to forgive him, but I denied it—he also said that he believed I had promised to give him a week's notice—I did not know that he had been very respectable, and was respectably connected—I don't know it now—I have not had any misunderstanding with him—he was appointed by the firm—there are five boys at the Cannon Street stall besides the prisoner and myself.</p>

STRAIGHT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the prisoner any authority to borrow money from the till? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the slightest—when he took away the gold it was by my express directions; he did not take any silver by my direction—I believe he stole it—I was at the stall before he came on this morning—I called him into the stall—I was present when he took the till out—I had been to the till the night previously after the prisoner left, about a quarter-past nine, and examined it and found the two shillings missing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk at the police-court, Marylebone—a charge of arson was preferred there against the prisoner Edgell on 21st October—on that occasion I think no solicitor appeared for the pro<lb/>secution—the prisoner Smith tendered himself as a witness in the ordinary course—I have here the statement that he made. (<hi rend="italic">Reads</hi>:—"Richard Smith, police-constable 302 S. At half-past ten on Saturday night I met the prisoner in Kentish Town Road—I went with him to the Old Farm House, a public-house—we then went to my house in the Maldon Road, and he stayed with me till half-past eleven—the prisoner had gone about three minutes when I went out into my garden to take a bird in, when I heard someone call 'Stop thief!'—I jumped over the garden wall—the prisoner was on the wall—the first witness said he would charge him with setting fire to a house—from the time I let him out of my front door till I apprehended him three minutes only had elapsed—the prisoner said, 'I did not do it'—his trousers were then unbuttoned when I pulled him off the wall—he said, 'I did not do it'—his less and clothes were in a muddy state. He then went down, and another witness, the constable Mar<lb/>tin, stood up again and gave his evidence, and after that Smith stood up again and said he had not completed his evidence; he then went on to say, 'Itook the prisoner in the act of getting over the garden wall—I said to the prisoner, 'Bill, don't be a fool, come to the station and settle it'—the prisoner jumped on to a little mound of clay and twisted his hand out of my hand, and ran away—he fell; at that time the prosecutor came up, and we both had hold of him, and Martin then came up—Martin was coming from Collier's Crescent direction, and the prisoner ran away and took a turn round Wellesley Road—I saw him fall about twenty yards from a chemist's shop—I brought him to the bottom of Queen's Crescent, holding him by the arm till Martin came up—the first witness told Martin lie would give the prisoner in charge for setting fire to a house, but he would not give him into my charge, because I was off duty—I was hold<lb/>ing the prisoner then; Martin took hold of him, and told me if I did not let him go he should knock me down, he was his prisoner; I told him he was not, he was mine.")</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186712160027"/>
               <p>I caught him getting over the wall next door to the house where Smith lives—he passed Smith on the road—he was standing just in a recess in the Wellesley Road—he was in his shirt-sleeves—by a recess, I mean a waste piece of ground at the back of the gardens—I called out, "Stop thief," that was before I got to Smith—Smith said, "Where is the thief?"—Edgell had just run by him, close to him—I said, "I will show you where he is," and I ran by him and caught him on the wall—I had not lost sight of him—at that time Smith was about thirty yards off—in the struggle Edgell got over the wall, but I still held hold of him, so that he was on one side and I on the other—Smith came up—I did not know that he was a constable, I thought as he was coming up I had another one to deal with, but when he came up I said, "I know who you are—I will give this man in charge for setting fire to a house in Wellesley Road"—Smith said, "You must be mistaken, it is a serious charge"—Edgell said, "I did not do it; I have been to supper with you, Smith, haven't I?"—Smith said, "You have"—he said to me, "Let him go, he will come"—I let him go, and he made a dart towards the house—Smith said, "Come here, Bill; don't be a fool"—Edgell upon that came back, and got over the wall—I then said, "You hold him here, Smith, and I will go and fetch a police-man, or else bring him down into Queen's Crescent"—Smith said he could not come down in his shirt-sleeves—he did come—we all three walked slowly together when we got into the Queen's Road—I saw the constable, Martin—I beckoned to him, and Edgell slipped out of my hands again and ran in the direction of the Maldon Road—I ran and caught him again, and Martin ran up behind me, and took him off my hands—I told him I charged him with setting fire to a house in the Wellesley Road—Smith was not holding him at that time—he never held him till Martin had got him, and then Martin and he held him both together—Smith never had him, he ran away twice—he did not twist his hand out of Smith's—after Martin had got him Smith wanted to take him—I observed the room in which the fire was—there was a fire-place, but no grate—I did not see any fire in the fire-place—it is not a fact that at the time I caught Edgell Smith jumped over his own wall, nor that Edgell when running from the wall fell—he did not escape from Smith at all, because Smith never had him.</p>

Smith said, "You have." I said, "And not left him the whole of the night? He said "No"—Smith was in his shirt-sleeves; he said, "This is my prisoner, I shall take him"—I refused to allow him to do so, and we had an altercation in the street—Edgell was not buttoning up his trousers when I saw him—when Smith said he should take him Howell said, "No, don't let him take him; he has let him go twice, and don't mean to take him"—Smith said nothing to that; we then went to the station; I searched Edgell and found on him five lucifer matches and this rattle, like a policeman's.</p>

               <p>witness Dear—I had a hare in my hand—the prisoner and another named Webb came in after we had been there about ten minutes—the prisoner said, "You have got a hare there, governor"—I said, "Yes, I have"—he said, "Did you catch it?"—Dear made answer and said "No, he bought it"—the prisoner looked round at Dear and said, "You, you b----, you don't know how to catch a hare"—I asked my friends whether they would leave; I did not like the way in which they were speaking; I said, "We will get out of this as soon as we can"—as we were going out of the door Dear said, "Perhaps I could catch one as well as you if I had the chance"—we then left—I went out first, about half a second before my friends; they came directly almost, it might be half a minute or so, and we all three went straight across from the Swan to the Bridge Road, to the left-hand side of the road, to the corner of a small shop there, I should think about forty-five yards from the Swan—we stopped talking there; it might have been ten minutes—I bade them good night, and had got a few yards from them when I saw the prisoner and Webb in front of me—they came straight across from the Swan to the corner where we were standing—Thompson was on the right-hand side of Webb—they were on the path crossing the road when I first saw them, coming towards me—Thompson said to Webb, "That is one of the b----s, let them have it"—I was knocked down directly by a blow on the face from Webb—I got up again directly and said to Webb, who was standing in front of me, "You have made a mistake, governor, I have never insulted you in any way"—I was knocked down again directly—I don't know which of them knocked me down the second time; I can't say whether it was either of them; there was no other person present at the time—I don't know what took place afterwards, I was stunned—I could not say how long I remained so—when I came to myself I was looking for my hat—a policeman came up—some one told him I was one of the three that had been knocked about, and he said, "There is one dead; do you know it?"—I said, "No, I do not"—I went with the police to the hospital, and there saw the deceased.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a single woman, and live at 19, Somerset-place, Hammersmith—on Saturday night, the 23rd November, at twelve o'clock, I was near the Bridge Road; I saw three men come from the direction of the Swan—they were Collins, Dear, and the deceased—I knew him, but I did not know his name—they went against Mr. Squib's corner, and stood there as the clock was striking twelve—they were talking together, seem<lb/>ingly as if they were bidding one another good night—while they were doing that I saw two men come from the Swan, one was tall and the other short—the prisoner was one of them and Webb the other—they went to Squib's corner; the shortone, Webb, left the prisoner, and the prisoner went like this, and said, "You b----b----s, you have been on to me all the evening," and down the man fell, and never moved—the prisoner thrust his hand towards the deceased, right in front of him—he fell on the pavement on his back, the prisoner then knocked Mr. Collins down, and before he gave time for him to get up he knocked him down again with the same hand that he gave the straightforward blow with—he kept his other hand in his pocket—he put his hand in his pocket as soon as he knocked Collins down again—he then gave a back-hander and knocked ihe other one into the road—he first</p>

               <p>not till next morning—I observed nothing that night, except the bruise on the forehead, and that was not very large then—about the size of a shil<lb/>ling—next morning between eleven and twelve, when I washed it, I saw that the bruise was getting much larger and darker, and I observed what looked like finger-marks upon the arm, like the check of finger-marks on both arms—there was no one in the room at that time but myself—the child eat a good breakfast that morning—about half-past one she took a fit, and died about two o'clock—I don't know whether it was a fit or a convulsion—I never saw any one like it before—I went for Dr. Pearl, who had attended me off and on since I have been at Woolwich—I went again at six o'clock and saw him; and I and Mrs. Barrett, my landlady, went to the police—Mrs. Boyce lives in the next room to me—I heard nothing from her about the child when I came home that day, not till seven or eight hours after it was dead, between eight and nine in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the police at Woolwich. On Thursday night, the 10th October, about half-past ten, I was called to see the child of Mrs. Golding; it had been dead, I should say, several hours—I examined it—I ascertained its age, a year and nine months—it was rather small for that age, a badly-nourished child—the greater part of its trunk, and limbs, and head were bruised all over; there were bruises on all the upper extremities, I mean the forehead and arms—a severe slap might occasion the bruises on the extremities and trunk, but not the one on the forehead which I saw, I remarked that particularly at the time; it was a prominent swelling, and was discoloured, like an ordinary bruise—it was about the size of half an egg—it appeared to be recent—they were all recent bruises—the child was in an atrophete condition, I found subse<lb/>quently that it was diseased—I made a post-mortem examination in con<lb/>junction with my assistant—I first opened the head—I pulled down the scalp on to the face and found that the bruise that I had observed on the surface of the forehead permeated through all the textures to the bone—I removed the skull-cap, and on a portion of the brain, corresponding to the frontal bone and to the bruise, there was another bruise of a similar kind, corresponding to the external bruise—I found the brain generally gorged with black liquid blood, I would not call it extravasation, it is a condition that you frequently find in children, from growing development going on—on the first night of the examination I passed my finger into the windpipe to ascertain if any foreigu body had been lodged there, I did not discover any—I then took out the trachea and lungs together—I found the lungs in a very engorged condition, which is called hepatisation, that would assimilate it more to the condition of liver—the inference I drew from my examination was that the child died from irritation of the brain, the consequence of the bruise on the forehead; that I bef ieve to have been the direct cause of death; it would be sufficient to account for it—I could not see any other cause to account for death; I must qualify that to a cer<lb/>tain extent; there was disease in the lungs of a very dangerous character, the result of inflammation either acute or chronic, I should say it was of a chronic character—I should think the cause of death was the bruise on the brain; had I not found that bruise, I might, in the absence of other symptoms, have been led to suppose that the hepatised condition of the lungs might have occasioned death, but the bruise was such an apparent cause that I naturally seized hold of that as the cause of death—I could not account for the death in any other manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Suppose you had found no bruise on the head, would you have attributed the death to the condition of the lungs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can scarcely bring myself to think so in so sudden a case—there is no doubt on my mind that the bruise on the head caused death—that might be caused by a fall from a chair—the skin is tender in children—a slight thing would leave a bruise in so thin a child—I don't think the bruises I saw were caused by the child falling about the floor; if it was standing up and fell on the floor that portion of the body that came in contact with the</p>

               <p>ground might have a bruise, not such as I saw on the forehead, but the others—there were several bruises all over—it would necessitate six, seven, or eight successive falls, or more, to produce them—some of them might have been produced by a fall or falls.</p>

I asked him to give me an open cheque, as I could not get it at Mr. Gardiner's.

Robert Marshall Mar<lb/>tin—previous to July I occupied Rowell House, Bermondsey—I have known Miss Adams some time—I had a communication with her on 25th or 26th July, in reference to taking charge of Rowell House, and arranged with her to take charge of it for three weeks certain at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—she went to reside there on 27th July, and we left her in charge—the first week ended on 3rd August, and I that day paid her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and on that day my husband and I and part of our family left London, my daughter remained, but not at that house—on 16th August I sent a letter to my daughter and I wrote to her again on the 19th, enclosing a letter to Mrs. Murray, which I begged my daughter to take to her—I ouly wrote that one letter to her—I returned to town on the last day of August—my husband saw the prisoner first, and I saw her on, I think, 10th September, she then demanded 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the three weeks after 24th August (she had been in the house a month, and my daughter had paid her)—I said that she could not demand that, because iu my letter I had told her that she would not be required, and that if she stayed it would be for her own pleasure; she said that that had nothing to do with it at all—I spoke to my husband, and a few</p>

Sir, there is 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due"—I said, "I think not; I think you had a letter from Mrs. Martin saying that if you stayed beyond the month it would be for your own pleasure, and you would receive no payment"—she said, "Oh, I told your daughter I should have 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I shall have it"—I said, "I will see Mrs. Martin and she will come and speak to you about it—she said that she had not got Mrs. Martin's letter, it was at her own house—I saw her again next day, and she showed me the letter she had received from my wife, and finding that she could not read it I read it to her—it was to the effect that she would not be required beyond the three weeks, but if she stayed the four she would be paid the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that week, and if she remained beyond that it would be for her own pleasure—nothing else material passed—my wife and I were afterwards at the house together—my wife tried to</p>

I am cabin-boy on board the <hi rend="italic">Jane and Mary</hi>—I recollect on Tuesday night last, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner came on board with my master and Mr. Fox—I got the purse out of the cupboard for the mate to pay him, and laid it on the locker—master told me to get the supper ready—I got out the meat and biscuit, and as I was doing that the prisoner rapped me on the shoulder, and asked me to cut him a bit of meat—I said it was not my place—he tapped me again and said, "Let me go up and look at my boat"—I stepped aside to let him go, and missed the purse—I said, "That man has got the purse"—I ran up on deck after him to stop him—my master ordered two oars to the boat and we pulled to the stairs, to see if we could find him, but he was gone—we did not call after him—we called for the police—I next saw him in custody on Wednesday morning—I know that there was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the purse, because the mate had shown it to me the same day—the prisoner was to have had his supper on board.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Henry Side, a grocer of 1, Bedford Street, Walworth—I knew the prisoner, I was present at his marriage on the 1st April, 1844, to Emmeline Weavill, at St. Peter's Church, Walworth—I was bridesmaid—they lived together after the mar<lb/>riage one year, when the first child was born; I lived with them some weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you intimate with Miss Weavill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I knew her from childhood; her father kept a tobacconist's shop, near the Elephant and Castle, at the time she was married; they formerly kept an hotel in the City—I knew the prisoner a few weeks before the marriage; I understood him to be twenty-two years of age, twelve months younger than his wife; he was a medical student; we called him "the Doctor"—shortly after his marriage, I understood he was assisting a surgeon, in the Broadway, Westminster—the child was born at her father's house, where she was married from—I have not been living in the same parish since 1844—I was travelling with my brother before I married—I have been married eighteen years, and for the last seventeen years have been living where I am now—I have seen very little of the prisoner's wife lately, up to two years since, when I was engaged to go to Scotland in a divorce case against the pri<lb/>soner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Wellington Street, Newington Cause<lb/>way—I went through the ceremony of marriage with the prisoner—I was a widow, and my name was Pearce then—I was married on the 2nd Sep<lb/>tember</p>

               <p>in the present year, at St. Mary's, Newington—we lived together until about five weeks ago, when he went to Wales—he described himself as a widower.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was it he went away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think on the 14th October—he came back again and remained with me till he was taken—I had no part whatever in giving him into custody—he treated me most kindly—I have four children by my former marriage—the prisoner was in a situation as an assistant to a surgeon, and contributed to the support of my family—this prosecution is not instituted at my request on the contrary, I am assisting his defence—he went into Wales for the purpose of attending to a gentleman's practice there for ft short time, with my consent.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I have not seen the prisoner since I left him at Glasgow two years ago—his wife was then a witness in Court against him in a case of bigamy—he had a wife in Scotland, and had one year's imprisonment for it—he must have been aware at that time that she was alive; they were in the same Court together—it was at the Judges' Court at Glasgow—a much better Court than this, rather larger and better fitted up, more handsome in every respect—I was a witness—the prisoner's wife was in Court facing her husband—she was not called upon to speak, but merely to show herself—she was put into the witness-box to show herself, and I said she was the person to whom I was brides-maid—I knew the prisoner's name was George Pearce before his marriage—I know that the name of George Wortham Pearce was introduced into the register, and his wife knew it—I supposed that to be his name—I never heard him called anything but Mr. Pearce until his marriage—I did not know his Christian name till then—I did not know that Wortham was a fictitious name.</p>
