            . I live in the Borough, and attend the Justice's at the rotation. The prosecutor came to me about the ninth of August last, and informed me his house had been broke open. I told him I had reason to believe some of his goods were at one Silva's, for I had been so informed by one Griffiths, who had been indicted for the same offence, We went to Silva's with a search warrant; there we found two glasses, four bowls, and a delph dish. ( They were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Silva. I am a carpenter, and keep a pawnbroker's shop. I have known the prisoner two or three years; he worked with Mr. Cooper, a gardiner: I met the prisoner in the street in company with two other men on a Sunday: after I passed them the prisoner turned round, and went home with me; he asked me to buy the china, that has been produced; I told him I did not chuse to deal with him, it being Sunday: he asked me two shillings for them, I told him that was too much, then he asked me to lend him eighteen pence upon them, and said; he would bring some other things the next morning; I let him have the eighteen-pence: the next morning he brought the two glasses.</p>

            . As I was passing through - Lane about six in the evening of the 31st of December last, I saw the prisoner and two persons with him standing at a chandler's shop; I thought they were about no good; the other two passed me, and I felt a motion at my pocket, and missed my handkerchief. I pursued the prisoner and overtook him; he had my handkerchief in his hand, but when I sezed him he threw it down: I felt my handkerchief not above two minutes before.</p>

            . I am a shopman to the prosecutors. When I came down from dinner, on the 13th of December, the apprentice was shewing the prisoners some handkerchiefs I had shewed them some before; I had some suspicion of them, therefore I chose to serve them myself, being determined to watch them narrowly. I saw Jones convey something under her cloak or apron: I let them go out of the shop, and then I acquainted Mr. Hussey with it; he went after them and brought them back: the handkerchiefs were dropped after they were in the shop; I did not see the prisoner drop them, but I saw them as soon as they were dropped:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177501110007"/> I know there were no handkerchiefs in that place before.</p>

I showed him some, he said, they were not of the kind he wanted; he desired to see a neckcloth; I sold him one, then he asked for a pocket handkerchief; turning round, I saw him secrete something under his apron; after he had bought the handkerchief, he said, he was going to Maiden Lane and he would call for the things and pay for them. I insisted upon seeing what he had in his apron; and then leaning over the counter I saw him drop the piece of handkerchief from under his apron. These are the handkerchiefs (producing them) they are the prosecutors property.</p>

I went directly to Clerkenwell Bridewell and gave an account there of the robbery, and I described the persons and dress of the men that robbed me, that one had a cutlass, another a large flapt hat, and another had a light coloured handkerchief tied loosely about his neck.</p>

             the prosecutor came to Clerkenwell Bridewell, and gave an account that he had been robbed by three men, he said that two had pistols, and one had a cutlass, that one had a handkerchief loose about his neck, and the other had a flapped hat; Dignam a fellow servant of mine, and I went after them, and we were joined by one Kipping. We met the prisoners in another part of the field, in which the prosecutor had said he was robbed, we immediately attacked them, I saw Brown throw away a pistol, Kipping seized Pinkston and he threw away a pistol likewise, Free had a remarkable large slapped hat, Brown had a handkerchief tied about his neck, exactly in the way the prosecutor had described one of the men, we took them to prison, I believe they were in hold in less than three quarters of an hour after the robbery was committed.</p>

            . On Monday the 19th of December, I saw the prisoners in Fleet-street, they behaved very indecent, being a peace officer, I thought proper to follow them. They sat down in New-street, Shoe-lane, and seemed to be sharing something, I called to Mr. Figgins to assist me in taking them; I took a pair of white silk stockings out of Ellis's lap, and when they got up, there were several other pair of stockings found, we took them to Mr. Figgins's house; while we waited for the door to be opened, they dropped four pair of silk stockings which I picked up.</p>
               <p>(The stockings were all produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>

There were four of us in the coach, two men came up to the coach, I first saw a man on the side of the coach my daughter was on, she let down her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177501110014"/> glass immediately, while my attention was engaged to that side of the coach, another man broke the glass on my side; then they both opened the doors and came in, and demanded our purses; we all gave them our purses, I told the man that came in second, that we had given our purses already, to the other man he swore an oath, and struck me on the left side of my head, I felt the blow, but I leaned my head back in such a manner, as to prevent a great deal of the violence of the blow; then the same man, with his left fist, struck me a very violent blow on the right eye, and at the time he struck me on this eye, he gave this little girl a violent blow upon the temple, he threw his hand back, and struck her, she fell back stunned, I thought she was dead, the child was all bloody; then he demanded our watches, I told him we had none, he threatened very violently and struck me several blows with the pistol upon the face, I avoided the blows as much as I could, but yet I felt them, then he struck me with his fist on the right eye. He searched my pockets, and my little girls pockets, and often threatened to blow our brains out, we begged for mercy and pity, my daughters begged him to spare their mamma, he threatened to blow their brains out if they spoke a word, he went out and came in twice, at the second time of coming into the coach he took off my cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any idea of the persons of the men?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Greme. No I have not, I was very much terrified.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark or moon light?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Greme. It was moon light, it was pretty light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation, whether that was a large or little man?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Greme. I dont think he was a large man.</p>

            . I was in the coach with my mama. They took my watch and my cloak, the man that was on my side the coach, and he threatened to blow my brains out, when I begged mercy of them; they opened both doors, and one came in at each.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they step upon the coach, or get entirely into it?</p>
               <p>Miss Greme. They got quite into the coach, one of them, when he went to search my aunts fingers for rings, when he turned about, he was almost in my lap, they felt our hands for rings, we told them we had none, we were in mourning, it was light enough for them to see that we were in mourning. I saw the man strike my mamma three blows, I begged him to spare my mama, the man that was with me, said to him,</p>
               <p>"Be quiet John, get out," or to that effect, but the other did not pay any attention to it; they took away our cloaks.</p>
               <p>Q. What size man was it, that you say was almost in your lap?</p>
               <p>Miss Greme. I think he was a small man. One had a crape over his face, the other had something over part of his face, they were a long while with us, they once bid the coachman drive on, but then they bid him stop, and they came into the coach again; they were a long time with the footman for his wacth, he told them he had no watch, no more he had; they took my cloak and my watch, I gave them my purse the instant they came in.</p>

            . I was with my mistress on the 13th of December, when she was robbed. As we were going on these people stopt the coach at about a quarter after Eve to the best of my knowledge there were four; they opened the coach doors, and went in and desired my ladies to give them what they had. I heard an outcry in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observations upon the persons or dress of the men, and was it light enough to distinguish their faces.</p>
               <p>Allpress. Yes, I could see they had some black crape over their faces, when they went into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. When did they go first into the coach?</p>
               <p>Allpress. I cant tell when they went into the coach first.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the other two men do?</p>
               <p>Allpress. One was with me behind the coach, he had a hanger; the other man was at the head of the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any arms?</p>
               <p>Allpress. I can't tell.</p>

               <p>Allpress. I could see plain enough,</p>
               <p>Q. What size men were they that went into the coach?</p>
               <p>Allpress. They were the size of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177501110015"/>Q. You will be cautious what you speak; have you any reason to think the prisoner is one of them?</p>
               <p>Allpress. I believe so, because of the size.</p>
               <p>Q. Your belief is founded only upon the size?</p>
               <p>Allpress. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how he was dressed?</p>
               <p>Allpress. That I could not say.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish whether he had his own hair or a wig?</p>
               <p>Allpress. He had his own hair.</p>
               <p>Q. Had both that went into the coach their own hair?</p>
               <p>Allpress. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they stay in the coach till they had taken all the things away, or did they go in and out?</p>
               <p>Allpress. They went into the coach two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the two men that had been in the coach, did they go away directly?</p>
               <p>Allpress. They came to me and bid me give them my watch and money. I had no watch. One of them had a hanger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe them take any thing out of the coach?</p>
               <p>Allpress. Yes, four cloaks? They struck me over the eye with a pistol.</p>

They came into the house and insisted on having the girl out; I struggled with them; I got Thomas to the door and gave him a fall; immediately as I had got the door fast Hunt dashed a pistol thro' the window with such violence, that he broke the sash frame and he broke his pistol, the lock stuck in a butter tub that was standing in the window and two pieces of the barrel and a piece of the lock lay by the side of it.</p>

I called up Mr. Dinmore, and we went to Cow Cross: he was not there; I went into a public-house, the Marquis of Granby's heads in Chick-Lane; I saw the prisoner standing at the fire; I went out and called Dinmore, we went in, and we met the prisoner in the passage coming out: he had this pocket pistol (producing it) in his hand; he held it partly behind him, I seized him, and pushed him up against the wall, then he dropped the pistol, and Dinmore took it up. The pistol was loaded with a piece of lead, rolled up and chewed.</p>

About six months ago I began to suspect him: in August last, I went to France, the prisoner had access to the outer cellar where the wine was kept for daily sale; but the store cellar was locked with a padlock, to which he had not access. When I returned from France I brought a boy with me, I gave him, and my clerk orders to watch the prisoner; my cellar is at the bottom of the Hay-market; I hire a coach-house near Golden-square, which I keep for washing bottles. On the 16th of December, I asked the boy what the prisoner had been doing; he said, he and the prisoner had been at the coach-house washing bottles, and that they had been in the cellars. I asked what they did there; the boy, after some questions told me that the prisoner brought some soul wine out of the store cellars. I then asked the prisoner if any person had called for any wine; he said, no; I asked him if he had prepared any wine to be carried out the next day, he said, no; then I asked him what wine it was he had removed from the store cellars to the other cellars; he said, it was wine upon the lees. I then asked the boy in what part of the cellar this soul wine was, and whether it was standing, or together in a heap; he said, it was in two or three different places in the cellar, and that there were both red and white wine. I supposed it must have been both Burgundy, Claret, and Champaign, and none of the foul wine is in the store cellar. I sent the boy for the key of the little cellar, but the prisoner was gone with the key: I set out to go to the cellar, and one of the clerks followed me. I found the prisoner at the cellar door with some empty bottles and a hamper, he was putting the bottles into the hamper; he said, they were all empty bottles. I made him take them out, he took out about a dozen empty bottles, then there was a wad of straw, I put my hand under the straw, and took out a full bottle, which appeared to be Champaign; then the prisoner made a motion to kneel down and ask my pardon: I told him I must take him before a magistrate, he made no scruple at all; we then went to the office, and the magistrate asked how many bottles there were, I said, I could not tell, for I had only touched one: the prisoner then said, there were only one or two that he was taking to the coach-house for his drinking, while he was washing the bottles. The Justice ordered somebody to take an account of what was in the basket, and the clerk was sent with the key, and brought an account of five bottles of claret, two bottles of Champaign, two bottles of Maderia, one bottle of old hock, and two bottles of sweet oil. During the rest of the time he lived with me, till within these last six months, he always behaved honestly: about six months ago he fell into bad company, which I am afraid persuaded him to do wrong things.</p>

            . I am a constable, on Tuesday fortnight I saw the prisoners wife coming by Hogg-Lane, they live near there, she had then a bundle under her arm, covered over with an old blanket, having heard of this matter, I was determined to follow her home: when I came into the house, I saw her husband the prisoner I asked her what she had got under her arm, she said, only some old blankets that she had taken from her lodgers, this have some old houses just by, which they let out in lodgings, the husband then said, poh, poh, they are only some old blankets, come with me up stairs, I will shew you more of them; that raised my suspicion more, I had the bundle opened and I found a sack under the blankets and in the sack was the cotton mentioned in the indictment. I took it way.</p>
               <p>William Edward's cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you have not worked up great quantities of cotton, of the same sort and whether this might not be some other, and not a part of the four pieces of linen, Welch stole.</p>
               <p>Edwards. I have worked up fifty pieces I believe, but all the rest, but those Welch stole were finished, this is not finished and I am very positive this is one of the four pieces I missed the 5th of Nov. last.</p>

            . I live with one Mrs. Wade, who keeps a broker's shop; when she was gone out the prisoner came in and sat down in the back parlour, that is a dark room, soon after that Welch came into the shop, and asked me if I would buy some new linen. I said no, we never buy any new linen: upon this Welch went out, then Martin stepped forward and said, what had the man to sell; said I some new linen; he said call him back again, I did call him, he asked him what he had got there, he told him, then the prisoner asked him what he asked a yard for it, he said twenty-pence; he was going to buy it by the yard, but I refusing to go out to borrow a yard, as there was no-body to be left in the house, he asked him what he would sell it for; to lump it what do you ask for the whole of it, said he; Welch told him thirty shillings, he bid him twenty shillings, and at last bought it for a guinea, he had seventeen shillings, and before he had paid for the whole, my mistress came in and lent him four shillings. Martin would have had me carry it home to his house, I would not go then, he said to my mistress do you put this in your apron and go for my wife wants to speak with you and you may take the four shillings of her. He does not live above twelve doors from my mistresses.</p>

My Lord, very unfair practices have been made use of in order to prevent this man's coming to justice; they took this girl last night and made her drunk, and got a post chaise to carry her into the country, if I had not taken her into custody; she would have been carried off last night, and the prisoner's friends have given her the cloaths she has on.</p>

The girl and her mistress about eight weeks ago, came to me at my own house and said there was a countryman of her's, (an Irishman) had some cloth, I went to look at it, she went with me, he said they are remnants; he asked me two shillings, I said I would give him twenty-pence; I asked him how he came by it, he said from Ireland. After I heard of his being taken, I said I gave a fair price for it, nor did I know he had stole it; I put down a guinea, the cloth lay in her open shop. That girl has been bribed upon several occasions, her mistress is an infamous woman; she was prosecuted for receiving these things last sessions, she said then, she knew of no more things; since that she has turned evidence against me, she stood indicted last Monday to be tried here. The constable is an infamous man and the justices are not too good.</p>

            . I live near the prosecutor. A little after seven in the morning of the 30th of December, I saw a man in Robinson's back kitchen; the window next the street was open, by that means I saw what the man was doing. I asked him what he had to do there; he said, he had left a bundle there; he was handing it out of the window: at that time I saw the prisoner in the street, near, or close to the window standing there, he at least stopped. I asked him whether he had any thing to do with the man in the kitchen; he said, no. I said, I think you have, and laid hold of him: the man in the kitchen was then just putting the things out at the window into the street, and nobody being there immediately to receive them, they all tumbled down; I secured this man.</p>

The consequence was as I imagined, both the prisoners went by and one of them, with a great imprecation, said d - n my eyes, they have not found us out, they crossed over to the Prince of Orange Coffee house; which is directly opposite my house, then they ran across to my window, put their hands through the hole, snatched the watch out and ran away, my son ran after them, he took the eldest (Lewis) with the watch in his hand, and he brought them both in, my housekeeper was so affected to see Lewis behave so hardened, that she struck him, he said with a great imprecation, what do you strike me for; and when one of my neighbours humanely said, do you know what you have done will hang you, he said I do not mind hanging, I sent my son with them to Sir

In a minutes time the boys came down, they went to the coffee-house opposite, then they ran across to our shop, I saw them pull at it, which took it I cannot say, the little one ran up the Hay-market, the biggest with the watch down Pall-mall, I caught him by the collar and threw him down with force upon his face and he had the watch in his hand, the other ran up the Hay-market; which took it out I cannot say, they were both trying at it, I saw both their hands in the window, Lewis had a long wire inside his coat.</p>

I put my box with my money in it in the room, where the prisoner and another young man lay: in one box there was a good deal of gold, and in a tin box there were three crown pieces; I missed the whole money; the prisoner was afterwards taken (two crown pieces produced in court.)

            . I received a letter from the prisoner desiring me to come to him at the Poultry-Compter, I went there to him, he gave me the key of a small table drawer, i n which he said the key of his trunk was deposited, and desired I would bring him some memorandum books out of his trunk, in which were some receipts, I carried them to the Poultry Compter, and delivered them to him, he looked at the receipts and memorandums books, and gave them to me again</p>
               <p>(Three receipts shewn the witness.)</p>
               <p>Kendall. These are the three receipts I had from him, I staid about an hour with him, he expected he was going before my Lord Mayor, but I found they were taking him to Litchfield-street, I went with him there, they kept him there all day, I asked him why he had not a hearing, he told me he believed they were about making it up; in the evening they sent over to the public house we were at, (that was on Monday the 2d of this month to the best of my knowledge) they desired he</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177501110031"/>would send some friend over with the receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the justices know any thing about the receipts?</p>
               <p>Kendall. I can't tell, I was along with Elcan there, and several of the parties, I believe, though I did not know any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. 
               <persName id="t17750111-60-person511">

             the clerk of the office of the receipts?</p>
               <p>Kendal. I believe not, I applied to Mr. Carlton, to know why he had not a hearing of the justices, he said he thought he had better make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. The charge then was for a fraud?</p>
               <p>Kendall. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know what receipts you were to carry?</p>
               <p>Kendall. I suppose Mr. Elcan had mentioned that he had some receipts, I went over with these three receipts at Mr. Elcan's request, and delivered them to one of the clerks in the office, and he went into the office and delivered them to Mr. Welch, Mr. Carlton his clerk, and myself, looked them over; when the receipts were looked over, I believe Mr. Hart was called in, and shewn them by Mr. Welch; he looked them over, Mr. Welch asked him if they were his receipts, he said the receipt for an hundred pounds, and that for fifty pounds, were his receipts, but that the other was not his receipt, Justice Welch replied, if those two are your receipts, the third is yours, he declared it was not his receipt, and upon examining that for the 160 the name William was at length; he said he always signed his name Wm. and his partner declared he always saw him write his name in that manner, and never William at length. Elcan was sent for, he insisted upon it they were Hart's receipts, and desired liberty to write his name upon the back of all the three receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say upon what occasion that receipt for 160 was given?</p>
               <p>Kendall. I dont recollect that he did, any more than that he had taken those receipts for the value he had paid for them. He said they were Mr. Hart's receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the charge then?</p>
               <p>Kendall. On suspicion of obtaining a note or notes by false pretences.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it with a view of exculpating him self from that charge, these receipts were produced.</p>
               <p>Kendall. I believe so, when he wrote to me to come to him, he said he had the proper receipts for the money he had paid.</p>
               <p>The Letter from the prisoner to the witness was read, the purport of it was desiring the witness of come to him at the Poultry Compter. As he had no other friend that he could trust his receipts and valuable papers with.</p>
               <p>Q. The body of this letter is not the prisoner's hand writing?</p>
               <p>Kendall. I believe he cannot write or read English. The first time I over saw him, was on the 17th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what he is?</p>
               <p>Kendall. No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the receipts were sent in to the justices, was it before the prisoner was brought over.</p>
               <p>Kendall. I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, Hart said before the justice that he always signed his name William.</p>
               <p>Kendall. Yes, he and his partner both said so.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he sign the information he gave there.</p>
               <p>Kendall. In full length, Mr. Welch got up and seemed angry, and asked why he did not write his name there, as he always did.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. When did you become acquainted with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Kendall. The first time I ever saw him to my knowledge was on the 17th of December,</p>
               <p>Q. Because in this letter, he says, I have no friend but you that I can trust; that looks as if you was an old acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Kendall. It does; I rather was surprized at that letter, it was wrote upon New Year's Day. I thought it a little particular that a person should forge a receipt and not be more particular in copying it from others, but write it at full length, when the others were only Wm.</p>

When Elcan was in custody on Monday the second Mr. Kendall desired to know what the charge was, I told him it was for a fraud. Mr. Kendall told me that the prisoner said he had a receipt to produce; I acquainted the sitting magistrates with that, they told me to desire Mr. Kendall to bid Elcan produce them, Mr. Kendall took them into my room; we went with them into the room to Mr. Welch, before the prisoner was called in, Mr. Hart and Mr. Kendall were called in. Mr. Welch looking at the receipts, he thought they were all the same signing; but upon Mr. Hart and Mr. Fikes being both examined, they declared that the receipt for one hundred pounds and the other for fifty pounds, were the receipts signed by Hart for himself and co. but they both declared, the receipt for one hundred and sixty pounds was not the signing of

            , Mr. Welch cautioned them of what they were about respecting the charge against the prisoner, he was brought over and they both persisted in the charge that the receipt for one hundred and sixty pounds was not Hart's hand-writing; the prisoner said they were all given him by Hart, for money he had paid him</p>
               <p>Q. Were the sums of each receipt mentioned before Elcan?</p>
               <p>Kendall.

The next day or the day after, Mr. Elcan called again and shewed me this receipt for one hundred and sixty pounds; I suppose in order to convince me that value had been given for the bill. Mr. Hart called that day or the day after, he said he was satisfied, and had received value for it, and if I chose I might do the bill. I did not discount the bill, I told Mr. Hart, that I had seen a receipt for one hundred and sixty pounds to the best of my recollection, he said, he had given a receipt, but did not I believe say what for.

            , which I had paid. From several concurrent circumstances I had reason to suspect the prisoner. I began to call to mind the story he had told me, and to observe the improbability of it, that the ship was to go from London to Portsmouth<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177501110035"/> and take in cargo. I have the copy of the letter here; I did not at that time miss the particulars in the indictment; the only loss I discovered at that time was my papers, and knowing this gold seal ring lay in the same bureau, in what we call a pigeon hole, and concluded that the person who had taken the letters had taken that ring. I found the cover of the letter upon which I remembered particularly the seal ring lying, the bureau was in a private office of my own, the prisoner had no business there, he sat in the adjoining room, which we call in Scotland, a writing chamber.</p>
               <p>Upon this I enquired whether he was gone from Edinburgh, I could not find him that night, the next day I found he had gone that very night, when the rumour began to get abroad.

            , Esq; in Clement-street, I knew it was his hand writing. I cast my eye upon the seal, it immediately struck me, it was the seal of that gold ring that I had lost, which was esteemed an antique, among the books, there were the confession of Faith, a book of Devotions, Mairs book-keeping, Thompson's Seasons and a demonstration of the existence of God; they were left in Mr. Russell's possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. These books (producing them) were found in the prisoner's trunk; they have been in my custody ever since. Mayne the prisoner was recommended by an acquaintance of mine; I believe he asked leave to send the trunk.</p>
               <p>Hart. These books are my property the first book that struck me was Kelson's Devotions, I know it from a particular examination, A nephew at my house was taught to repeat the hymns, he had wore it there; there was another book that I knew, entitled, A Demonstration of the Existence of God. I had two copied of Thomson's Seasons, but this was a large copy I bought of Mr. Donaldson; I know particularly the place where it stood, and in like manner the Confession of Faith: but that I might be under no doubt, I asked the prisoner; he acknowledged the books were mine, but said, he put them up by mistake. I wrote down to Edinburgh concerning then, and they wrote me word these books were wanting. I saw the prisoner when he was apprehended, and brought to Bow-street; I asked him for that seal ring, he refused it, I said, it was in vain to refuse it, because I had seen an impression upon his trunk, that I was absolutely certain was sealed with the impression of my ring; where did you get the impression?</p>
               <p>"I got it at the Golden Cross, Charing Cross." Said I,</p>
               <p>"well, we'll soon know that, I will send to the waiter." Said he,</p>
               <p>"I got it of a gentleman there." My clerk said,</p>
               <p>"why you have a seal to your watch." Said he,</p>
               <p>"that is a small gold seal." Said he,</p>
               <p>"let us see your watch:" immediately I knew the seal he had there to belong to me: that was a small seal set in gold: when I had it, the gold was wore away and the stone was dropped out; I put the stone in a writing box, so it was not set. On looking afterwards, I immediately knew the chain to be mine: the seal is a common head, I had sometimes sealed letters with. He said, he found it upon the stairs. I said, this chain is mine; where did you find it? He said, he bought it of a packman. I knew it from this circumstance, it had lost a swivel, and one of the links of the chain was broke, I had another put in, but it is a larger than any that were in before, I had another of the same size put opposite to it, and having it a long time, I know it perfectly well, on finding that seal, and on finding them impressions.
