On the 15th April I was in High Street, Hampstead, and saw the prisoner and another man—they kept looking back—I followed them to Heath Street and back to High Street, where they joined a third man—I saw the prisoner give them something, and then come quickly across the street to where I was standing in a dark doorway—as he came across I saw him put a small paper parcel into the breast pocket of his undercoat—as he seemed to notice me I seized his right hand and said "I am a policeman, what are you loitering about here for with these other men?"—he said "Other men, I have not been with any other men"—I said "Who are you? what are you doing here?"—he said "I suppose I have as much right to walk about here as any one else?"—the other men had disappeared—the prisoner put his hand to his coat and just then Alabaster came along the street in private clothes—I told him to take hold of the prisoner's left hand—we took him to the station and I said "What have you got about you?"—he said "Nothing"—I said "Let me see," starting to unbutton his undercoat, but he unbuttoned it himself, put his hand into the same pocket, and pulled out this parcel containing nine counterfeit florins wrapped up in bag paper, but not all separately—he said "That is all I have got"—I said "What is it?"—he said "I don't know"—I unfolded the paper, and he said "It is money, I suppose, I picked it up"—he was then charged—he declined to give his address—the inspector said "Shall I put down no home?" he said "If you like."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, carrying on business at 123, Pall Mall—late in the autumn of 1882 Young called on me, giving the name of W. H. Young—I understood he was connected with the law; a con<lb/>veyancer—he said "I have some friends in the country, Roberts, builders at Bristol, who have sold some property near there to Sir Herbert Murray; they want a small advance pending the completion of the purchase, can you make it for them?"—he said ho acted for the Robertses—I said "Yes, if the matter is all right, I don't mind doing it"—he then gave me par<lb/>ticulars of where the titles to the property were to be seen—I said I shall want to apply to the purchaser's solicitors"—he said "Oh yes, you may do so," and gave me their names, Mitchell and Webb, of Bedford—he said the property consisted of some houses at Clevedon, near Bristol—I said "Before I do anything I must see the title to the property and examine it," and he gave me the names of the solicitors who held the title, Messrs. Gander and Son, of Gray's Inn Square, I think—I arranged to go and see the title, and he was to call again—I made inquiries, saw the title, and then wrote to Messrs. Mitchell and Webb, inquiring if they were Sir Herbert Murray's solicitors, and whether they were in<lb/>structed to carry out this purchase—I got a letter from them saying that the loan referred to had been arranged; in consequence of that the matter dropped, and I did not see them again on it—I cannot recollect for the moment whether I saw Young again in reference to that matter; I think he called in January, 1883, he said "I am sorry that matter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188405190008"/>
               <p>went off, but I could not help it"—I said "I had a good deal of trouble in it for nothing"—he said "Well, I have another matter which is just about the same, if you like to take it up you may. The same people, Robertses, have sold some property in Bristol to the same purchaser, Sir Herbert Murray; the property is mortgaged, but there is a balance of about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., part of the purchase money belonging to the Robertses, which will be paid on completion"—I said "I shall have to make in<lb/>quiries beforehand into the title." and he said "That is down at Bristol"—he said "The Robertses want an advance as before pending the comple<lb/>tion of the purchase"—I said "If I am satisfied with my inquiries I don't mind making it; I shall require to act for the vendors, the Robertses"—he said "You may do that; they will consent to it when we see them"—we arranged to go down to Bristol to examine the title—I fixed a day when I could go, and he said he would write to the solicitors at Bristol and make appointments—I believe the 24th January was appointed, and I then went to Bristol and met Young there, and we met the two Robertses in the town—I had not seen them before Young introduced them to me, we went to the various solicitors, four firms I think, who had to do with the property, and the deeds were produced and I saw them—I walked by the property with the Robertses; there were four lots I think—Young I believe pointed it out—we were all together I should think two or three hours—there was a general conversation between us—Sir Herbert Murray was undoubtedly spoken of, but I cannot remember whether his name was—I addressed Young as Young—on a subsequent day to the return from Bristol an agreement was shown to me—at Bristol I examined all the titles, looked at the property, and stated I was willing to make this advance pending the completion of the purchase, which was to be at a short date, I believe in April—an appointment was made at my office for the advance—I parted with them at Bristol—during the time I was with them I did not hear either address the other as Murray or Sir Herbert Murray, but I do not wish to speak positively about it, it is a long while ago—I think the 31st January, a week after, was fixed for meeting at my office—on that day the three prisoners came to my office—Young produced this agreement. (<hi rend="italic">This was for the sale to Sir Herbert Murray of the property at Bristol by the Robertses for</hi> 4,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 13th January, 1883, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">part purchase money having been paid into the hands of Young as stakeholder, and contained on the back a receipt signed Murray. The counterpart was signed by George and William Roberts, and there was also a receipt signed by William Young.</hi>) When the two agreements were produced I read one of them, and as I went through it Young made remarks; when I came to the name of Murray he said he was a man whose uncle had recently come home from India or from abroad, and who was allowing him 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; that he did not want it all to live upon—then he referred to the other matter some time before, and pointed out that the purchase money would be 4,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., more than sufficient to pay off the first mortgage, and that "Sir Herbert Murray has placed 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my hands as stakeholder; that will have to go to the Robertses, but of course I cannot part with it now"—I inquired whether he was quite certain that the purchase would be completed on the day named in the contract, and he said, "Certainly then, but probably before, some time"—I said, "It is a short time, I shall not say anything about interest for it, I will put it into the charge, I propose to charge you 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188405190009"/>
               <p>for completing the whole matter for the Robertses"—the Robertses agreed with my suggestion about the charges, and Young said, "That is very reasonable, I think you might act for the purchaser as well; I shall be seeing him within a few days, and if he has not another solicitor in the matter you could, no doubt, act for both parties"—in going through the agreement I asked if Sir Herbert Murray would be able to complete by the 19th April, because it was a short transaction, and my arrangement about the interest was on the terms that it would be completed then—he said, "Certainly by then, probably some time before, and he again mentioned the fact of his having 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year from the uncle, as showing that he was a man with money and there would be no doubt about the completion at the time I insisted—when the agreements were given to me he pointed out that one was signed by Sir Herbert Murray and the other by the Robertses—when I fixed this sum for carrying out the purchase the Robertses agreed to it—in fact it was much less a sum than any one else charges—it was because I thought it was a matter that would be soon over, and for that reason I made the charge very small—there was some other conversation—Young asked me which agreement I would have; he said, "Here is one signed by Sir Herbert Murray"—he pointed out that he had the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit in hand, and that I should be safe in any case—I said, "I will have this," pointing out the one signed by the purchasers, that being the proper agreement for me to take—there was a memorands of mortgages which I read through to all three—the agreement that I took was signed by Sir Herbert Murray—it bears the receipt of Young for the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other agreement was retained by Young—I next saw it when it was produced before the Magistrate at the police-court—I suppose it had remained in his possession until then—this memorands of mortgage I prepared and read to them—it is a mortgage of the property in question—at the end the receipts to the previous mortgages were countersigned by the two Robertses in my presence, and in the presence of Charles H. Young, 22, Wood Lane, Shepherd's Bush—Young witnessed the signature at my request—nothing more of importance passed—I have two banking accounts, and I draw on both—these are the four cheques that I drew (<hi rend="italic">One was for</hi> 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">payable to Messrs. G. and W. Roberts or order, on the Union Bank of London, Charing Cross branch, endorsed "G. and W. Roberts; the other was</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">payable to the same, on Thomas Butcher and Son; the other for</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on the Union, endorsed in the same way, and one for</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">payable to Roberts, endorsed in the same way</hi>)—these cheques were paid, and came back in the ordinary way through the bank—with regard to the endorsements I don't remember seeing them endorsed at my office—as time went on I went down to Bristol for the purpose of getting abstracts to complete the purchase—I saw Young on several occasions before I went to Bristol—before he left he promised to see Sir Herbert Murray and to arrange about my acting for him, and he called in about a week or so to say that he had seen him—as the 19th April approached no further steps were taken towards completing the purchase—I kept corresponding with Young and certain solicitors at Bristol, who wanted their mortgages paid off, and who understood that it would be completed before the 19th April—I saw Young about a week after this interview, and he told me he had seen Sir Herbert Murray and he would be glad for me to act for him, and he said, "What will you do it for? You had better fix a sum and write him what you will charge, and I will see if he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188405190010"/>
               <p>assents to it"—I then prepared this memorandum, saying that I was prepared to carry out the business for him, and Young took it away—I believe it came back through the post, I am not quite certain. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Sir,—I am satisfied with the terms stated. Yours truly, Sir Herbert Murray.") That is dated 1st February, it must have been intended for 1st March—after I had received the retainer, no further steps being taken towards completing, I saw Young and pressed him to give me an opportunity of seeing Sir Herbert Murray, because it was getting serious, as the 19th April had passed—he made various excuses—I said I should go to Bristol to see him—I had begun to press him very much because I was anxious to see Murray; he seemed kept in the background, and I could not communicate with him—I wrote to him on one occasion, begging him to come up and give me the address—he gave me two addresses, one of which he said was sure to find him—one was Clifton Down Hotel, and the other Rock Hotel, Clevedon, Somerset, and from that in Young's presence I proceeded to write two letters—I wrote one letter and read it out, and the other is practically a copy (<hi rend="italic">These were dated 26th June</hi>, 1883, <hi rend="italic">pressing for an interview and stating the particulars</hi>)—I posted those letters to the two addresses Young gave me—the second day after I had posted these letters Young called and inquired if I had had any answer—I said "No"—he said, "You will, then, presently"—that day or the next day I received this telegram: "June 29. From Sir Herbert Murray, Bart., Bristol. Have been away, letter received, unable to see you till next week, will then arrange for speedy settlement"—after I had received this telegram my two letters came back from the Dead Letter Office—one came back some time before the other, I believe one came back as late as 4th August, the other came back shortly after the telegram—I saw Young, I think, before 4th August—I had become very suspicious when no Sir Herbert Murray came or wrote, and on one occasion when Young came I said, "I am resolved to find this man, because he does not write or make any communication, and I shall find him"—he said, "Well, where shall you find him?"—I said, "In the first place I shall go to Bristol, I know that the telegram has come from there"—he said, "Well, it is of no use keeping this on any longer, the fact is I am Murray"—I think this was rather before the second letter came back through the Dead Letter Office, at all events it was about the end of July—when he said, "I am Murray," I said, "It is a very serious matter, and I must consider this"—then he went into some long explanation about having used the name of Young because of the uncle, I don't quite remember—he was quite sure it would be all right, that money was coming, he was receiving 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and it was only a matter of a few days, that he was impelled by necessity to use the deception—after that I sent a registered letter to the Robertses; that did not come back again; I did not get an answer to it—after that I con<lb/>suited Messrs. Wontner, and a summons was taken out—Young kept on his excuses for some time, begging me to wait a few days—I gave him every opportunity; I waited a day or two—he did not come, so I saw Mr. Wontner about it—this is the letter I wrote (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>): "25th July. As there has been very great delay in completing the purchase of this property, I beg to give you notice I request immediate payment of the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced to you; the money is now urgently required, I must insist on payment forthwith"—to that letter I got no answer; the</p>

               <p>Robertses did not communicate with me at all in any way—on the return of the summons Young did not appear, and on 31st December I obtained a warrant—on or about 27th January I met him, in the street—I remained with him till I saw a constable, and then gave him in custody—he said at the Court there was no warrant out, and the officer told him there was—the warrant was not just at hand, I believe—after he was arrested on the warrant he was admitted to bail—the Robertses were summoned then, and they appeared—I think Young did not appear at Bow Street after he was bailed; the case was adjourned on the statement that he was not well—he sent this letter saying he would commit suicide—I remember it being spoken of, I did not see it at the time—after that he was Seen by a medical man, and he did appear—at the interview when I parted with my money to the Robertses I believed the statement in the agreement that Young held 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in deposit—I have never received a farthing of my money.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. I parted with my money partly on the faith of the agreement—that had a great deal to do with it—before I parted with anything I went and made careful inquiries as to the title of the property on the spot; I mean to say I made inquiries as to whether the vendors had a good title to the property they had to sell, and I found they had a sufficient title to warrant my advancing the money—I took no measures to ascertain the value of the pro<lb/>perty—I saw the property, and found that there was sufficient to satisfy my amount of 500a,<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was satisfied that I would be safe to take a second charge in respect of my 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I took one—I con<lb/>sidered the agreement was the security—I did not consider whether the second charge on the property was sufficient to hold me safe an regards the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not go into figures at all—I was bound to take the mortgage to secure the payment of the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if I had found the title was not good I certainly should not have lent it—that was the condition on which I agreed to lend it—I have not heard that the property has been since valued by a competent valuer—I have never caused it to be valued—I wrote to the solicitors for the mortgages to inquire if they thought there was any margin, and the reply was to the effect that there was not, in fact they had taken possession of the property and sold some of it—they told me there was a mortgage of 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Young told me that there was a margin of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he pointed that out when the money was advanced—it was later than 29th June when Young said "I am Murray"—I think it was about the middle of July, but I cannot speak without my book—I have sent for it—Young said that he did not want it to come to the uncle's ears that he, as Sir Herbert Murray, was dealing in property, and that therefore he had adopted the name of Young—he said he was receiving 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the uncle, and expected an instalment shortly—I did not go to Bow Street or Mr. Wontner's at once because he begged me not to take any steps, and I proposed that if he could properly explain the matter and pay the money it had better remain—if the money had been paid off according to the mortgage I should have accepted it—I should not have treated it as a debt; it was a question of repayment of money advanced on the agreement—if the money had been paid off, even after he had told me this, I should have accepted it—I did not treat it then as a criminal offence—I was not then absolutely certain that he was not Murray; I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188405190012"/>
               <p>believed that he was—he told me then that he was Murray, and that Young was a different person—if I had seen there was a proper explana<lb/>tion of the circumstances I should have accepted the money—if he had told me that he was obliged to use this name to keep his uncle in the dark, I should have considered that a proper explanation, if there had been real grounds for it—50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would have been the amount I should have got out of this transaction; I should have got something from Murray—it was expected to last from January to April 19—I should have got 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Roberts and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Murray—I have got no letters of Young in which he, as Young, was to pay me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he was never to pay me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that I am positive of—I am sure that I should not have got a farthing more than the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi>. The money was lent on 31st January—it was to be repaid on 19th April—I was to receive nothing for the advance of the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., only 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my charges, and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my convey<lb/>ance to Murray—the interest was a trifle, not worth mentioning—before parting with my money I made no inquiries about Sir Herbert Murray, except what Young told me—this is not the first financial transaction I have had in lending money—if a client wants an advance I am prepared to advance it—I am in the habit of lending money to clients—I have been a solicitor about twelve years—it never occurred to me to look in the baronetage, or to ask Young if there was such a person as Murray—on the first occasion he was quite a stranger to me; that was when he said the property had been sold to Sir Herbert Murray—that was a similar transaction to this—I said I would think the matter over about lending the money, and I said "I shall write to Sir Herbert Murray's solicitors and make inquiries"—I was satisfied with what they said, and the matter was arranged—the date of this transaction was November or December, 1882—I did not hear anything more of Murray or Young till January, 1883, when I entertained this proposition—he told me that the uncle of Sir Herbert Murray was at Bath—I went to Bristol—I made inquiries at Bath—the fact is, the first matter having gone through all right, I never had any suspicions that Young was any<lb/>thing but what he represented himself, and to a certain extent he imposed on me—I received a great quantity of letters from Young; I have got them here—he first commenced to correspond with me as Young immediately after 31st January, 1883—that is a letter in the hand-writing of Young (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have received a great many letters in the same handwriting—I first suspected that Young and Murray were the same person about July, 1883; not until then—it did not occur to me to look at the back part of the return letter to see whether it was in the writing of Sir Herbert Murray—it did not strike me that this letter of the 1st February purporting to be signed by Sir Herbert, and the one written by Young, 22nd January, 1883, were written by the same person—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter I wrote to Young—I gave it to Young when he called—he called twice—on the 31st January he said "Sir Herbert Murray will no doubt let you carry out the matter for him, I will see him and find if he has another solicitor"—he called on the 9th February, and at that interview I arranged with him for carrying the matter out for Sir Herbert Murray, and wrote it down and delivered him the letter; afterwards it came back with the answer—it was a letter written to Murray, not to Young—I believed that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188405190013"/>
               <p>Young had written it—it did not strike me that the endorsement at the top to the letter was in Young's handwriting—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter I wrote to Murray—I received it back—it did not strike me that the writing at the top was in Young's writing—it subsequently struck me that the writing on the agreement and the signature were the same, it first struck me about the beginning of July, I will tell you how it was; knowing that Mr. Webb, the solicitor, had seen Sir Herbert Murray, I showed him this agreement, and I said was that Sir Herbert Murray's signature; he said yes, it was—in July I went to Mr. Webb, I will not say the exact date, that was when I suspected the two signatures—I went to him, I showed him this agreement, and said "Is that Sir Herbert Murray's signature?"—he said yes, it was—I said "I don't quite like the look of the matter, there seems a great similarity between the signatures," and he said "It occurs to me so too"—nothing more passed between us—I believe this conversation took place about the beginning of July, but I cannot speak to the exact date—when I said I did not like the look of it I said the signatures looked very much alike, I did not like the look of things at all; I gave him to understand that I thought they were written by the same person—I have given the whole of that conversation as near as I can; there was probably more—Mr. Webb did not tell me at that time that he had known for some time that Young and Murray were the same person; he said he suspected it—he agreed with me in what I suggested, that they were the same—I went to Mr. Webb because I considered he was acting for Murray—I do not think he gave me any reason for suspecting that they were the same person—I believe he said something to this effect, "Yes, it looks very much like, I should advise you to look out," that was practically all he said—when Roberts told me that Murray was a man in receipt of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year from his uncle, I did not ask for the uncle's address at Bath; I did not ask any questions—I think I went to Bath about a week before the loan was actually made—I met Young at the station, and in the town I saw the Robertses—I do not know how they addressed him, I do not know that they said a word about it—I was in their company about two or three hours—I had no suspicions then that Young was Murray—I went to the solicitors and found that the amounts of the mortgages and interest were about the same as Young had stated to me—I saw the deeds that referred to the property—I went to the separate properties and looked at them, we had just time, we walked round, and he said "That is one, and that is the other"—Murray was always spoken of as a distinct in<lb/>dividual—I went to Bristol a second time, after the advance, and I then carefully examined the deeds with reference to the sale by Roberts to Murray, and ordered the abstracts to be sent to me—I did not then suggest to Young to put me in communication with Murray, but some time before April I did, I forget quite when that happened—I said before the Magistrate "The abstracts came in due course, and as the 19th of April approached I suggested seeing Murray, and then Young said 'The purchase money will be forthcoming at once'"—the solicitors to the mortgagees lived at Bristol—I think it was between the return of the two letters that I looked at the signatures to the agreements, and was struck with the similarity—I think Mr. Webb called on me about some<lb/>thing, and I then showed the signatures to him—I am not quite sure</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188405190014"/>
               <p>whether it was at my office or his—a good many letters passed between me and Young between 19th April and July.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My reasons for lending the money were that Young said he had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in hand which would belong to the Robertses and which would repay my advance, and that there was an amount of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to the mortgagees which the amount for which the property was sold would give a margin—there was no margin; the property would not now sell for the amount of the mortgages, the mortgagees have sold it—Young took away the retainer for the purpose of getting it signed by Sir Herbert Murray, and when it came back I believed the signature to be Sir Herbert Murray's—I considered that Young had written the formal part—the signature of Murray to the agreement resembles that to the retainer—I did not look at the retainer again after I received it till after these proceedings were taken, it turned up among the letters—I did not pay particular attention to it when it arrived—I had not noticed the date till it was remarked upon before the Magis<lb/>trate—this was the only agreement I had possession of—that was the only one on which Mr. Webb had the conversation with me, he was looking at these two signatures and no others—there were four different titles to this property, complicated, heavy titles—I was to do all the legal work for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is much less than is allowed by the Incor<lb/>porated Law Society—there was never any question about interest, I said should charge no interest, I should be sufficiently paid by the charges—I looked at the signature to the second agreement that was produced by Young at the police-court—the signature of the Robertses was afterwards admitted to the second agreement—it was stated to be a forgery to begin with; the Magistrate then looked at it with the cheques, and said that it was undoubtedly the same signature as the endorsement to the cheques—neither of the Robertses said that they had seen Young write as Herbert Murray—these agreements are dated the same, they are counterparts, witnessed by the same person—they were evidently signed at the same time, as agreements usually are—the signature is G. and W. Roberts—it is an illiterate signature—there is a great similarity in the signatures to the two agreements.</p>

I believe it was the Robertses' solicitors who said it was a forgery; the Robertses did not deny it—I don't think they said it—they made many observations—I think I saw Mr. Burgess, of the firm of Burgess and Laurence, at Bristol, when I examined the deeds—I did not tell him that I had seen the property; I don't think I had seen it; I think I saw the deeds first—I don't think I said I had seen the property and was quite satisfied with the value; I cannot remember having said anything of the kind—I was satisfied with the value of the property at that time—I did not see a Mr. Munro, an architect, there—I saw a Mr. Barnett—I did not have any conversation with him as to the property; I am reasonably certain about that—I don't think I spoke about the value of the property to any of them—I went on the legal value of the title, the value may have cropped up—I went down to see the deeds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of 5. Waterloo Place, Pall Mall, and at Bedford, where I have a partner—I knew Young or Murray some few days before 18th December, 1882, when I saw him alone at my office in Waterloo Place—he said he was Sir Herbert Murray, and came in reference to a conveyance of some property at Clevedon from the Messrs. Roberts—he produced a contract between the Robertses and himself for the sale of three houses at Clevedon, Somersetshire, and he asked me to act for him in the matter—he said "The Robertses require a temporary loan of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. until the Completion"—on 18th December the three defendants came together, and the Robertses executed a mort<lb/>gage upon the property to a client of mine named Hall for 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the agree<lb/>ment for the sale at that time was in my possession—the prisoner was addressed as Sir Herbert Murray in the Robertses' presence—he did not make any signature in their presence—nothing was said about the use the property was to be put to—the Robertses then executed a mortgage for 460<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., subject to the sum of 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I believe had already been advanced by Mr. Goodwin, the owner of the ground rents, on an equitable mortgage which conveyed the land subject to the fee ground rent—I handed the cash to the Robertses and they went away—on that day I received a retainer from the Robertses to act as their solicitor in the matter of the conveyance to Sir Herbert Murray of the three houses at Clevedon, and they signed this retainer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the same day, a letter having come from my Bedford house, I wrote this letter to Mr. Cheese about a temporary loan, which I said I might as well do—I cannot say if Mr. Cheese's name was mentioned at this interview—the name of Young turned up at no time except on the visit to Clevedon in the beginning of January with reference to the deposit of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid on the property—I then asked William Roberts who Young was (I think George was not present)—he said he was an estate agent down at Shepherd's Bush—the business was completed on May 10th or 11th, 1883, I believe—I first heard on 6th June, 1883, at Bristol, that Sir Herbert Murray had used the name of Young—I did not speak to either of the prisoners about it—I cannot fix the date, but at a meeting of the directors of the proposed Walton Hotel Company Murray suggested that the three houses should be used at an hotel until the hotel was com<lb/>pleted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188405190016"/>
               <p>—all this time I knew him and he was treated by the Robertses as Murray—I went to Mr. Cheese's office on other business, and he showed me this agreement with Murray's and Robertses' signatures on it—I cannot say when that was—my attention had been directed to the question of Murray being Young before that at Bristol—at a meeting of directors one proposed director refused to serve because he had heard that Murray had assumed another name, and asked me to go to a firm of solicitors who had the letters in which Young's name appeared, and I went there with Mr. Goodwin—after I had seen the letter and the signature I asked Murray to account for using the name of Young—he told me he simply used the name when he applied to Salt and Parnell to obtain the loan on the Clevedon property on better terms; this was on June 6th, 1883, at the meeting of the directors of the Walton Hotel, which was to be put up at Clevedon adjoining this land—Murray was a director.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi>. I believed at the time that Murray used the name of Young because he thought he could get the loan on better terms—he completely imposed on me, as he has on all of them, only I happened to get my money back—I had not the slightest idea up to June 6th that he was an impostor—I have made a mistake, it was a few days before 21st May, I should think, when I first heard that Murray and Young were the same person, when I saw the Robertses—I cannot remember what date I was at Mr. Cheese's office and saw the signature, it was long after 6th June—I cannot remember telling Cheese then that I had written to Sir Herbert Murray in May, telling him I suspected him to be Young—I had written to Young in May, stating that I had reason to believe that he and Murray were the same person; he contradicted it—Mr. Cheese showed me a document in his office in July—I don't remember a comparison of the signatures being made—he showed me two documents, one supposed to be in Murray's handwriting, and the other in Young's, and said he strongly suspected they were written by one person—I cannot remember if at that time he led me to believe that Murray and Young were the same person—I cannot say what was said, I took no notice of it—the document was just shown to me—he knew I was Murray's solicitor—he told me at one time he had a shrewd suspicion by looking at the signatures, that Murray and Young were the same person, but I cannot recollect when that was—I don't know why I did not tell Mr. Cheese that they were the same person when he made there inquiries—I did not tell him I had written to Young in May, 1883—Murray was a client of mine, and I thought when this interview between myself and Mr. Cheese took place that he had done wrong, and assumed a false name—I Implicitly believed he was Sir Herbert Murray down to the time this prosecution was instituted, in November, 1883—after I wrote to him in May, 1883, he gave me an explanation, and reinstated my opinion, and I believed that he was Sir Herbert Murray up to 1884, and so did plenty of others—I knew him also in the name of Sir Herbert Murray Herbert—I received letters from him in both names—I asked him as to it, and he explained the use of the Herbert at Bristol, and gave me a long family history—I thoroughly believed it; we all did at Bristol—I prepared a deed for the conveyance of this property; Mr. Harris, of Cannes, the mortgagee, has it—I should think I had six or seven interviews with the Robertses when Murray was present—there was</p>

               <p>only one up to January 31st, when both Robertses and Murray were present—that interview was in reference to the loan of 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the appointment of myself as solicitor—Mitchell, a former articled clerk of mine, introduced Sir Herbert Murray to me—Major Furnival is a com<lb/>mission agent, at 5, Waterloo Place, in the same room that I am—he obtained the loan of 3,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Harris for Murray—I have not seen Mr. Furnival here—it was not done through my office, I acted as solicitor for Sir Herbert Murray—Mr. Furnival is not in my office, he merely has a seat there, he is in no way connected with me; he pays part of the rent—the matter of the loan was not introduced through him, he obtained the loan and I paid him—no money passed in my office, the matter was completed at Bristol—I prepared the deed and saw the 3,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. pass—I prepared a conveyance from Roberta to Murray, which is in the hands of the mortgagees—it was in consideration of 5,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was not paid—nothing went through my hands—when the conveyance was engrossed I said to the Robertses "There is 5,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be paid for your houses; you have 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, am I to receive that money for you?"—they said "We have arranged with Sir Herbert Murray about that sum, he has been making advances from time to time on the Hornsey property, and we have arranged for the disposition of that money, you have nothing to do with it"—I said "Very well," and simply executed the conveyance—I do not know that Mr. Furnival introduced the business and was to receive 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the negotiation—I know Murray gave him a commission of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with regard to that very property—he received it, I gave it to him out of the money I received from the mortgagee, at Murray's request—I did not hand him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—certain costs had to be paid to Harris—I forget the sum I gave him—the balance about 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I paid to Messrs. Salt and Parnell, the equitable mortgagees, that was the amount, charged on the property—I took an undertaking from Sir Herbert Murray to pay 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd to Salt and Parnell, leaving a balance of 202<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he told me to write a cheque and hand it to the Robertses, which I did—some time in May, before I wrote that latter, Roberts told me he had never received a penny from Murray or Young of the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I acquainted "Murray of the fact, and he produced an account showing sums he had for them, and ultimately they came with him and said it was all right, they had settled the whole matter—they satisfied me, subject to the Robertses' explanation—I think I told them that I saw on the contract for the purchase of the Clevedon property that Mr. Young purported to receive a deposit of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they led me to believe Young and Murray Were the same person—I cannot remember what then took place—I have lent other money on mortgage to clients; none of them through Major Furnival—this is not the only transaction I have had through him since he has had a seat in my office; I can't say about how many—I don't know that I have had any except this through him—I did not look in the Baronetage for the name of Murray; he was introduced to me by Golding and Mitchell, solicitors, of Southampton Street—I made no further in<lb/>quiries then, or when I saw he was Sir Herbert Murray Herbert—I believed him to be Sir Herbert Murray.</p>

(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>

After that letter he came with the Robertses and gave such explanation as made me believe he was Sir Herbert Murray—I cannot fix the amount that the accounts showed the Robertses had received—the accounts explained that Murray had made certain payments for them, including the payments he had made on the equitable mortgage to Messrs. Parnell and Salt—the purchase money of the three houses was originally 2,550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it had nothing to do with the hotel—on the statement that the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been absorbed Roberts said they were satisfied with the arrangement—I continued to believe in Murray down to the time of going before the Magistrate.</p>

On 18th April I was crossing the road and saw Marks come out of my shop; I went in and received a bad florin from Mrs. Walker—in consequence of what she said I turned round Townsend Road and saw Marks, Hogan, and Thorpe standing together about 100 yards from my shop—I took Marks by the collar, and said "You will have to come back to my shop for passing a bad florin"—the others then ran away—Marks said "You can search me; I have no more about me"—I said "No, your friends have got them"—I took him into the shop and gave him into custody—on the 24th, when I was talking to the inspector at the police-court, I saw Hogan and Davis in custody, and said as to Hogan "That is the man"—I went into the station and said that I wanted Hogan for running away from Marks—he said "You perisher, your life will not be worth twopence when I come out; I will do for you"—I said "Your threats wont intimidate me from coming to-morrow against you at the police-court; I shall come"—it was about 3.5 on the 24th when Hogan was taken—I was at the police-court on 25th and 26th, and saw him again—I saw Thorpe the next night, Friday, and picked him out from about sixteen—he said "Yes, I was with him"—on 11th April, Good Friday, I came home, and Ada Elsden showed me a florin which was in the till—there was no other florin there—I found it was bad.</p>

This is my signature—the deposition was read over to me—he said "You perisher"—when I saw the three men together they were sharing the tobacco or the money, I cannot say which, because Marks had his back to me—they were all three with their hands together; I say that because he had tobacco in one hand and the change in the other when I took him—the tobacco was undone; I believe he had eighteenpence in silver and some coppers in his hand—he offered it to me—I did not take it; the constable did.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When she exchanged the Uxbridge ticket for money, she said she feared it was too late to get in at home—it was not because they required too much money at the coffee-house that I did not stay, I had money—I have been very intimate with the prisoner—I was not discussing marrying her on that day—I had done so previous to her going to prison—I had written to her sister asking for a sovereign to get married with—that was the last time I saw her, between December and January—she brought me a letter from the Vicar of Uxbridge asking me to marry her—I do not know that I am the father of the child that the was pregnant with at that time—as far as I know I am, I may have been—I was walking with her down Shepherd's Bush Road when she gave me the letter; I read it and tore it up and said "What have you done with the other child?"—she said "I have put it in a home"—we went on towards Uxbridge Road Station, and she brought it up again—I said I had got no money and asked whether she had any, or her sister—she said she did not know whether her sister Polly had any, and I asked whether I should write to her—she said "If you like"—I said "If you can bring me papers to prove that you have got that child in a home I will marry you"—I did not meet her at the prison door the day she came out; I saw her at my brother's house on Tuesday, the 25th March, about 4 in the afternoon—she seemed fond of the child—she said a lady had got it in a home—I understood it to be a home for children where so much a week was paid and the mother had no more to do with it, and it was on that condition that I was willing to marry her, so that it would no longer be a charge to me or her—she said "I can't bring tile papers to prove it, but a lady has got it in a home"—at that time she was living at Hillingdon with her father, as far as I knew—when I first knew her she was living in service at Mrs. Hicks's, at Shepherd's Bush—when she left there she went to Hillingdon, that was all I knew—I did not see anything more of the child till I saw it at my brother's—that was an accidental meeting—I went there, I thought she would be there.</p>

At a quarter to 6 on the morn<lb/>ing of 26th March, in consequence of information, I went to the River Colne on Uxbridge Moor, at the back of the Pipemaker's Arms—I saw there the body of a female child lying on the bank of the river—it was the same child that has been identified as Florence May Rider—I had it removed to the General Elliott public-house—I then went to the house of the prisoner's father; that is about 60 yards, from where I saw the child on the bank—I saw the prisoner there—I said to her, "Your mother has made a communication to me; where did you go yesterday, and what time did you get home to Uxbridge with the child Florence May?"—she replied, "I will tell you the truth; I left Hammersmith between 2 and 3, and came to Uxbridge after the public-houses were closed, and came straight down over the two bridges, and went down by the water and threw her in, and when I got indoors it was about a quarter to 12"—the doctor saw the prisoner at her father's house, and I then removed her to the police-station—the charge was there entered and read over to her; she said nothing—afterwards in the reserve room she said, "I was liberated from Millbank Prison yesterday, where I had been two months for leaving this child"—I took down in writing at the time what she said.</p>

I am surgeon of Her Majesty'a Gaol, Clerkenwell—the prisoner has been in that prison since 26th March—I have seen her nearly every day—she was confined on 8th April—I have seen nothing whatever about her to lead me to believe that she is other than a person of sound mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She seemed to be aware of the difference between right and wrong—women advanced in pregnancy sometimes have delu<lb/>sions, not often—it sometimes affects their minds so that they do not know the difference between right and wrong—that happens more particu<lb/>larly about the sixth or seventh month, after the sixth month as a rule—if such a thing does happen the effect would be that they might commit suicidal or homicidal acts.</p>

I live at 112, Uxbridge Eoad—the prisoner was in my service from a little after Easter last year up to about a fortnight before Christmas—she gave notice to leave, saying that she wanted change and she should go to Birmingham to her brother's for a while—she was an excellent servant, such a one as we shall never get again, of a very cheerful disposition and very kind, both to myself, Mrs. Hicks, and the child—she was very kind to children; on one occasion about August we had a friend come, and she would take the child out for an hour and a half—at times she was very excitable—I have noticed her looking pecu<lb/>liar at times, but not thinking anything about it I never took par<lb/>ticular notice of it.</p>

I am a M.B.C.P. of London—I have had some experience of persons who are insane—I have heard the evidence that has been given of the act committed by the prisoner—I agree with Mr. Gilbert that women advanced in pregnancy are very liable to attacks of mania, I mean to loss of reason, a loss of the faculty of knowing right from wrong, and a special tendency to commit suicidal and homicidal acts—having heard the facts under which the prisoner committed this offence, in my opinion she did not know at the time that she was com<lb/>mitting a crime.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Bumpus, bookseller, of Oxford Street; I have been in that employ from three to four years—on Sunday evening, 23rd March, I left home about 9.30 for a walk—I live with my parents at 43, Bridge Terrace, Harrow Road—I walked leisurely down the Edgware Road to the Marble Arch into Hyde Park—I was in the third part of the drive leading to Hyde Park Corner, walking leisurely across the park towards the Reformers' Tree; I had got between 50 and 60 yards up the path when the prisoner suddenly overtook me; he was in his soldier's dress and was smoking—he said "Good evening"—I said "Good evening"—I noticed that he was tipsy—he said "A fine night"—I said "Yes"—he said "How are you?"—I said "Quite well, thank you"—he walked a little farther by my side and then said "How do you feel?"—I said "I feel all right, thank you"—he then began to press against my side, which compelled me to go on to the grass—I then made for the more frequented path—when we got half way across he put his hand down the front of my trousers and asked me what I had there—I had on an overcoat—I said "Go away and mind your own business"—he then caught hold of my arm with his right hand and said "Give me a shilling" (he had a stick in his left hand)—I said "I have not one"—he said "You are a b----liar, you have"—I said I had not—he said "If you don't give me one I will split your head open," or "split it in two"—I then gave him a shilling out of my purse, which I opened inside my pocket and took the shilling out—he then said "Give me another"—I said I had not one—he said I had; I said I had not—he said "If you don't give me another I will split your head open"—I then gave him another—he, then asled me for another—I said I had not one left—he said that You are a b----liar, you have"—I said I had not—he said "You had better give me one"—I then turned my purse inside out in my pocket and showed him the empty purse—I believe I gave it to him, but I am not certain in my fright—he said "Give me that money in your pocket"—I said "I have not any more"—he said "What was that that jinked?"—I then gave him sixpence in silver and five penny pieces—he kept asking me for more money—I said I had not any—he said "If you don't give me another I will get you five years"—I said "Very well, come to the station"—he said "No, I will not, for your sake"—he then said if I did not give him another he would give me something to remember the longest day I lived—he kept asking me for more, and I said I had none, and he suddenly let go and walked away; and as I turned to get in front of him the policeman's lantern flashed upon me—I told the police<lb/>man that I would give the soldier in charge for stealing two shillings, and he went after him and brought him back—on the way to the station he tried to get his hand into his pocket, or did get it in, and the police<lb/>man caught hold of his hand and prevented him from moving it—at the station the prisoner said "He followed me about and he gave me the money, and because I would not do what he wanted he went away and fetched a policeman"—I then asked the constable whether I fetched him or whether he came up, and the constable said he came up—the</p>

I am an engine cleaner in the employ of the Great Western Railway Company, and reside at 23, Brindley Street, Paddington. I believe I am dying, and wish to make a statement as to the cause of my injury. About 7 o'clock on the morning of the 10th of this month (April) I was going to have a drink of tea near the furnace and had some tea in my mouth when I squirted some over that young man (Coleman). I did it in play. He took up an iron rake and struck me on the back of the head. I fell insensible, and do not remember anything more till I found myself in St. Mary's Hospital some hours after. I do not remember Coleman saying anything to me before striking me with the rake. I believe he only struck me one blow, and I believe he wilfully struck me, and that the blow was not the result of an accident. A young man named Alfred, a cleaner, was present and saw what occurred. Several others were also present, but I do not remember their names. Coleman and I never had any quarrel, and I do not think he had any ill feeling against me. I believe he struck the blow on the impulse of the moment. I make this statement in the presence of Samuel Coleman, believing I am dying and that I shall not recover. It has been read over to me by Morgan, and it is true"—I afterwards took the prisoner into custody—he said when charged he should like to make a statement, and wished me to take it down in writing.

I am a carman, and live at 23, St. Ann's Court, Dean Street, Soho—about half-past I on the morning of the 16th April I was standing at my street door and saw the deceased come up to her door with a strange man; they went in, and in seven, eight, or ten minutes came out again—the man shook hands with her, wished her good night, and went away—she then came back to the door and opened it, and as she did so I saw the prisoner strike her on the left side of the forehead with his right hand—she fell on the back of her head on the asphalte and laid insensible—the prisoner must have been waiting for her—he shut the door very quietly and ran upstairs—a policeman came up, brought the prisoner out, and I recognised him—when he struck the woman he would have been down, only he saved himself by his left hand on the doorpost—he had on a shirt and a pair of lightish trousers, that was all—I saw the policeman pick up the door key.</p>

I live at 4, St. Ann's Court—I am married—on the night this occurred I was at my own door, which is next to No. 5, where the prisoner and deceased lived—I saw her come up the court with a strange man and go into No. 5 with him—they shortly afterwards came out, and the man went away—she had her key in her hand and she went to open the street door with it, when the prisoner got the door open before she had time to do so—I saw him, and he struck her over the left eye with his right fist, and she fell on the back of her head on the asphalte—he nearly pitched out with her when he struck her, but he saved him<lb/>self by holding the handle of the door—he then shut the door, and I saw no more of him—I heard him say something to her in French, only one word, I believe, I didn't understand what it was—a policeman afterwards came and took him in custody.</p>

On Saturday, April 12, about 8 o'clock p.m., I was on duty in Little George Street, Minories—my atten<lb/>tion was drawn to a van being led past No. 1 by Schofield, who was in the act of turning the horse round when I took hold of the reins and stopped the van, and told him I wished to speak' to him—he got over the tail of the van, ran up Little George Street, and then returned into the Minories, where he made his escape—I looked in the Tan and saw the five bags there, and got my mates to take charge of the place while I took the horse and van to the station—it contained these five bags, a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, a coat, and a pocket-handkerchief—I next saw Schofield on Monday morning, the 14th, in the station, where I was taken for the purpose of identifying the person whom I saw in the van—I picked him out from several others.</p>

I met two men on Saturday night, they said they wanted to hire a horse and van, I told them they could get one at Ems's, in Shep<lb/>herdess Walk; they said 'Ems does not know us;' I said 'I will got one for you.' I met Schofield, we went to Ems's, in Shepherdess Walk, and hired the horse and van"—I said to Walker "Did you pay the deposit on the van yourself?"—he said "Yes, I did, and I said they would have half-a-crown to draw on their return"—I said "Did you pay the deposit with your own money?"—he said "Yes, I did"—I said "What kind of men were the two who asked you to get the van for them?"—he said "They were two men we had seen in a public-house; I do not know them by name or any nickname. I have known one for a short time and one for six or seven months by seeing him in the public-house; one of them is a stout man, about 5 feet 8, with a ginger moustache; that is all the description I can give of them"</p>

               <p>more came out of the neighbouring houses, and I then picked from the ground a pipe, a cigar, a button, and an umbrella—the prisoner had made his escape—I next saw him at the Thames Police-court, 10 or 12 days afterwards—there was a row of prisoners in the passage leading to the cells, I should think nearly 20 altogether—the prisoner and another man were just through the door—I instantly recognised the prisoner, and said "That is the man"—he gave me a glaring look, exactly the same as he did when he struck me the first blow—as soon as I had recovered my strength I gave a description of the man that had assaulted me—he had on a long brown or grey overcoat, which fitted rather loose, and a brown felt hat, and he appeared to me about 45 years of age, and his height about 5 foot 7 inches; hair and whiskers turning grey—I have heard the prisoner speak since then, and his voice is the same—I am able positively to swear that he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 13, Old Jewry Chambers—I knew Mr. John Eaton Cox, of 60, Harford Street, Mile End, who died on 17th December, 1879—I produce the probate of his will, which is dated September, 1877, and was proved in January, 1880—his widow survived him, and was appointed jointly with the prisoner trustee under that will—he also left surviving his daughter, Eliza Cox, still under age, to whom he left 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., free of legacy duty—the rest of the property was left to be divided in equal shares amongst his daughter Eliza and the children of his wife Sarah by her first husband, John William Eady, after the death of his widow, who was to have the life interest—the children by the widow's first husband were William Eady, Sarah Ana Eady, the prisoner's wife, Martha Mary Eady, Emma Eady, Clara Eady, and Mary Eady—the widow, Mrs. Cox, died on 22nd April, 1883, leaving the prisoner the sole surviving trustee to execute the trusts of the will—among the property were some leaseholds—I acted at solicitor all through in realising the estate according to the trust—on 16th August the whole</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188405190052"/>
               <p>leasehold estate was sold and realised some 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the balance of the purchase moneys was paid, and the total to be paid into the benefit of the trust was 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—on the completion of the purchase 1,541<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid to the prisoner in gold and bank notes by the various pur<lb/>chasers from time to time—I was present as solicitor for the vendor—that did not include the deposit paid on the contract when the sale was made.

                  <hi rend="italic">ruled that it should be produced by its proper custodian.</hi>) This receipt "A" is signed by William Norton twice, and the address "60, Harford Street, Mile End, East," is his—afterwards he took the money and went away from my office where the purchase was completed—there was other trust money besides that which he had received on the estate; all these documents numbered 1 to 7 have been endorsed by the prisoner—in the middle of October I received some information, in consequence of which I went to the prisoner's house at 60, Harford Street, Mile End—I there saw his wife, who had been Sarah Ann Eady, and Walter Eady—at that time the prisoner could not be found—his desk was broken open, and these documents in his handwriting found in it—in a letter to his wife were these twelve 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes numbered 62626, '7, '8, '9, '30, '31, '2 '3, '4, and 62641, 62640, and 62625, all dated 21st March, 1883, and then there was a 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note of which I do not re<lb/>member the number and date—the letter is "For my dear wife Private. Mrs. Norton. Dear Sarah, keep this money to yourself. Don't let any one know, for God's sake. Don't fret about me. Gone to New York. If they follow me I will k—myself. Let Charles know. Be back soon. Be good. Keep from drink." The other one is addressed "Sarah Norton," "Eliza Cox's money take to Mr. Lee. 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Mr. Lee got lot of money. Shall be back soon." After that I received instructions to take proceedings—I got the Attorney General's fiat dated 22nd November, 1883—I got a warrant at Bow Street, and received information about the prisoner, and sent the inspector to Australia in December—the prisoner was brought back to England, and I gave evidence at Bow Street, and he was committed for trial.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoner on two or three occasions after he received the money, and he told me it was on deposit; he did not mention the bank, because throughout the winding-up the money was put on deposit at the National Provincial Bank, and I understood it was there—my costs have to come out of the estate.</p>

               <p>death an action was commenced in the Chancery division of the High Court for the administration of the estate—Joseph Mitchell and others were plaintiffs, and Annie Mitchell and others defendants—I was appointed by the Court as manager of a colliery—the prisoner was a friend of mine, he was a member of the firm of Singleton and Tattershall, of Great James Street—it was part of my duty as the money accumulated from the colliery to keep a sufficient capital for working it, and to send up the rest to be paid into Court—there was no official order to do so, but I did it—the money was not my own, I was the Mine manager, working it for the beneficial interest under the will—this letter to the defendant of the 9th January, 1882, is my writing, I enclosed in it this cheque for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is endorsed by him—on the 10th I received this letter of acknowledgement and this receipt—this affidavit was afterwards sent to me to make, and I returned it to the defendant—I do not remember when that was, but I should think it was some time early in February—in July, 1882, I sent up a cheque for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in February, 1882, one for 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in September, 1883, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 13th October, 1883, 564<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making altogether 8564<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that was the surplus capital of the colliery—it was not all profit; it was part of the estate for which I had to account, sent up to be paid into Court—on Monday, the 24th of March this year, I telegraphed to the prisoner, I received an answer from him and came up to town to Wood's Hotel, Furnival's Inn; the prisoner came to me there—he was in an excited state—he said he had not paid the money into Court—I said "What money?"—he said "The sums you have sent me up from time to time"—the whole of the money was mentioned, 8,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "The money has gone in my business"—he expressed himself grieved, I forget his exact words—next day I instructed my solicitors, Messrs. Ridsdate and Sons, in the matter—an application was made to the High Court and an order was made on myself and the prisoner to pay in the money at once—I was served with a copy of that order that afternoon, and afterwards with a notice to commit me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was on very friendly terms with the prisoner—we were in the habit of meeting one another, and going to one another's houses—I am not the prosecutor in this case—after this money was sent up there was some question as to whether it ought to be paid to capital or interest account, as shown by a new order made in the May following, and a second suit was instituted—it was agreed that the accounts in both suits should be taken before the official referee—I suppose before that was done it would not be ascertained to which particular account the money belonged, or how it was to be distributed—I do not know of my own knowledge that Mr. Tattershall materially expedited the taking of those accounts, I know that he spent a considerable amount of time over them—notice of motion was made against me to restore this money, and an order was made directing the defendant to pay in the money within 24 hours—I believe his estate was sequestrated the following day, and therefore taken out of his hands—I have every reason to believe if that step had not been taken and they had given him a week's time the whole of the money would have been repaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My reason for that belief is that Mr. Ward, one of his friends, said that he would have found a considerable sum, and other friends would have found considerable sums to have helped him to pay</p>

               <p>it; not to save him from being prosecuted, but I should say to pay the money; I suppose to lead him the money—I don't know about leading, or what they would have dose; that was a question for them—I was told this by Mr. Ward, of the film of Lloyd and Co., stockbrokers—he is a man of means—I don't know whether the prisoner has employed him on the Stock Exchange—he is a friend of his—I support my brother John is the prosecutor in this case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing Chancery clerk to Messrs. Torr, Janeways, Gribble, and Oddie, solicitors, of Bedford Bow—I had the management of the proceedings in Mitchell c. Mitchell—judgment was given in the administration of the suit on May 10, 1878, and there was a order appointing Mr. Joseph Mitchell the manager on November 3, 1879—I have the order—his duty was to manage the colliery as directed by the Court, for which he had a salary of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and he was to remit the money to pay into Court to the manager's account—there was an order of the Court of February 14, 1882, for payment into Court of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—another of May 9, 1883, obtained by the prisoner, to pay into Court 7,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to be invested in three and a half stock; that included the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should like to state here that before the Magistrate I think I stated that the prisoner never admitted that any money had been re<lb/>ceived; I found afterwards, on going through the books and letters, that he had admitted to me that this 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in his hands—he ad<lb/>mitted that a few days before the date of that order—I find that I have an "attendance" in my book—the order was subsequently made—about a fortnight or three weeks afterwards I asked him whether he had paid the money in, and he told me no, it was only in town a few days, and it was returned; it was wanted for colliery purpose, and I thought nothing more of it then—that was long before the order of May 9, 1883; it was a few days before the date of the order of February 9, 1882, to pay in the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am referring to a note of the dates of the various documents, which I made late night—the order for the final account is dated November 29, 1888—I ascertained that the money had not been paid in, a few days after the date of the last order to pay in the 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had occasion to meet the prisoner, and he told me that the order to pay the 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was all a mistake, that the money had not been received, there was no such account at the bank, and we must wait for the final account—I ascertained that the money had not been paid in—I applied in Chambers for a peremptory order for the manager to file his final account, and it was made—about March 19, 1884, we had a telegram from a client at Wakefield, and it was ascertained from the bank at Burnsley that the money was remitted to London—I then served a notice of motion asking for the manager to pay in the money, and the solicitor too, as well as the client—that came before Mr. Justice Chitty on March 21, and his lordship then said "You ask for the solicitor to pay in, I can't do that; I must have them here," and he summoned Mr. Tatter-shall in Court, and Mr. Tattershall attended to show cause why the money should not be paid in—before coming into Court I met him out-side, and he said "I must not have this matter discussed in Court, I will consent to an intermediate order," and he then came into Court and saw Mr. Bunting, his Counsel, and instructed him—I was present—the order was made by consent, and Mr. Justice Chitty said "I will only give 24 hours to pay the money in."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not the prosecuting solicitor here—our client, Mr. John Mitchell, has instructed another solicitor, because we do not practice in these Courts—I have not attended any of the consultations that have been held in respect of this matter, nor has any gentleman from our firm—I did not state before the Magistrate that the prisoner told me the money was returned for colliery purposes—I swore before the Magistrate that I had frequently applied to the prisoner to pay money into Court, and that he always told me that no money had been remitted to him; that was my impression; but that impression was wrong—he told me that the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was only in his hands a few days; that was about the end of February, 1882, it was not on January 21, 1882—I have made an affidavit in this matter—I have not got my diary here—it is true "that on searching back since 28th March last, when the matter was last before the Court, I found that on January 21st, 1882, Mr. Tattershall communicated to Torr and Company the fact that 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been remitted to the firm by Joseph Mitchell"—I have the copy letter—I was under the impression that it was in February—I suppose that is a mistake—if a cheque was sent up to our firm in the way it was sent to Mr. Tattershall, we should pay it into our bankers, that is the ordinary practice—before it could be paid in to the Receiver-General of Chancery we should have to apply to the Court for an order so to do; that would not necessarily have to be supported by an affidavit; some<lb/>times the Court makes an order to pay money into Court upon admission that you have it in hand—it is often done upon affidavit, but sometimes without—in the order for the 7,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there was no affidavit, there was consent—it takes a fortnight to complete the order—there is no trustees' account of the Mitchell estate; the prisoner was ordered to pay the money into the manager's account, not the trustees' account—the orders were obtained by the prisoner.</p>

I met Cornish in Gordon Square, and from what he said to me I went to Upper Bedford Place and got on the wall and saw a man on the top of the wall of No. 30—we got into the garden of 48, Tavistock Square and saw some marks on the wall which led us to get over into No. 49 garden—I there saw the prisoner crouched down by the back door with these tools close to him—I picked up the hammer—I asked if it was his property—he said no, he had found it in the garden—the other instruments he said belonged to the other man—we took him to the station.</p>

I live at 34, Upper Bedford Place; that is my dwelling-house—about 6 o'clock on the morning of 4th May I was called down-stairs—I found that a small shutter, level with the surface of my garden, had been removed, leading from the garden into the beer cellar—there was perforated zinc over that part, which would have to be broken away before they could get there—I am not able to say whether the shutter had been fastened the night before, but the zinc was a fixture—that was broken away from its fastening—after they got into the beer cellar they had access to all parts of the house—I missed from the stand in the hall a coat and an ebony silver-mounted stick, a hat, some gloves, and also, some knives and forks, seventeen altogether, and three silver spoons, but there are many more things I have discovered missing, and also two canaries; I have not seen any of them since—from the back of my house to 49, Tavistock Square, it would be necessary for a man to get over about six walls, but by getting over these walls he could have easy access to my premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am accountant to the Southampton Dock Com<lb/>pany at 19, Bishopsgate Street Within, their office—on the 27th March I had to pay into the National Provincial Bank money on my own account to be placed to the credit of their branch account at Southampton—it was my own money, and consisted of a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank notes—I was at the bank about half-past 3—I put the notes on the counter just before me, and was making a paying-in note when I felt some one behind me touch my shoulder, I think both shoulders—I turned round and the party said "Can you tell me?" and then went on in a mumbling tone which I could not understand, it was quite unintelligible—I do not think any words were said—then I tuned round to where my notes had been,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188405190072"/>
               <p>and they were gone—when I looked back I saw the person who had been mumbling to me—I do not know who he was, he had hollow cheeks and a brown coat—afterwards I saw the back of a man walking down the Bank towards Broad Street, there are two entrances to the Bank—I knew the numbers of the notes, 33851, 26th December, 1881, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 97949, 17th May, 1883, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to the Bank of England and stopped them, and then gave information.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Alderman that the man who tapped me on the shoulder was a paler man than the prisoner—when I turned round there was only one man behind me—I did not notice any one at the side of me—the clerk had gone away for a moment in front of me—there were other people a little distance off—I did not notice them—the man close to me was the one that tapped me on the shoulder.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreign bill clerk in the National Provincial Bank—about 3.30 on the afternoon of the 27th March, Armitage came to the Bank to pay in some notes—previous to that I had seen the prisoner there for nearly three-quarters of an hour moving backwards and forwards on the seats between my desk and No. 13—he paid no money in—the desks in front of which he was standing were solely paying-in desks—I did not see any one else with him then—when Mr. Armitage was writing out the paying-in slip I saw the prisoner standing behind Mr. Armitage, close to his back, not more on one side than the other—no one else was standing near Mr. Armitage at that time—the only thing I heard was Mr. Armitage saying "What did you say?" and I looked up—he was not paying in to me, he came to my desk to fill in the slip, as No. 11 desk was full—the notes were before him at my desk—the next thing that attracted my attention was his saving "I have lost my notes"—I said "There is the man that has taken your notes, and there is the other one"—we have two entrances, one man went out into Bishopsgate Street, and the other into Broad Street—I had plenty of opportunity of seeing the prisoner's face while he was in the Bank—I am sure he is the man I saw, I have no doubt about it, and that he is the man I saw standing behind Mr. Armitage—I gave a description of the prisoner to Downs—on the 13th May I saw him at the Old Jewry Police-office, with seven or eight others, and recognised him—I was in the room perhaps a minute or two before I did bo, but immediately I went into the room I had no doubt about the man—at the Bank the prisoner had a long brown ulster on, and a low crowned hat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not watching the prisoner for three-quartern of an hour, I was standing at the counter and could not miss seeing him—I was not looking at him for three-quarters of an hour straight off—there were two men besides Mr. Armitage—the other one, not the prisoner, stepped from behind my desk and spoke to him, and imme<lb/>diately he went out by this door and the prisoner by that—I had no opportunity of seeing who he was—the man I saw with the prisoner had not so much hair on his face as the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was not put among others when I saw him the second time, he was in the dock—on the 27th I saw him sitting in the bank; he had been there some time—my attention was called to him—he was wearing a brownish overcoat, not a long one; it did not come below his knees; it was a nondescript sort of overcoat—I think he had a black hat; I think a billycock hat.</p>

On 3rd May, at 4 o'clock a.m., I went to the prosecutor's house, which is in the parish of St. John's, Hack-ney—an entry had been effected by a window at the top of the shop which projects beyond the pavement—there were marks on the window cash where the glass had been wrenched off, and the window was open wide enough for a man to get in—this knife found on Dixon, fitted the marks—this screw exactly fitted—I agree with the evidence as to the prisoner's boots fitting the marks in the back garden.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an outdoor officer of the General Post-office, and have been so upwards of 10 years—I live at 17, Rixen Road, White Post Lane, Manor Park, Little Ilford—on 16th April I was with Mr. Hurrell, an auctioneer—we visited Mr. Ball, of 44, Blackfriars Road, on business, after which we went to the Three Running Horses just to have a parting glass—the prisoner came in with a fare about 9.20, and I told him if he liked he could have a fare back—he was driving a Hansom's cab—we left the public-house in his cab between 9.20 and 10 o'clock—Mr. Hurrell told him to drive to Great Eastern Street, Shore<lb/>ditch, near the city Bank—on the way to Shoreditch we pulled up by the Barnard Castle, Queen Victoria Street, and remained there while Mr. Hurrell made up some notices—we had one glass of bitter there, and the prisoner then drove us to Great Eastern Street, outside Mr. Hurrell's house—he wished me good night, and I saw him hand the cabman something and go in—the cabman then said that he had not been paid—Mr. Hurrell said to me, "The cabman says I have not paid him his fare"—I said, "I saw you hand him something"—he said it was a two-shilling piece—I said, "Don't have any bother with the cabman, Pay again, because I want to get home"—Mr. Hurrell's nurse then brought out 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and handed it to the prisoner—I then told him to drive to Manor Park; I did not give him my address—we stopped at the King</p>

               <p>of Sardinia beerhouse, Clinton Road, Mile End, and the prisoner lifted up the flap of the cab and said, "Ain't we going to have something to drink before we go farther?"—I said, "You can have a drink if you like"—we went into the public-house, and I believe he had old and mild or malt of some description, and I had some lemonade—we then left the house, and as I was going to get into the cab he said, "How am I going on about my fare, I don't care about going all the way to Manor Park unless I know my fare is all right"—I said, "All right, cabby, we shall not fall out on that point," and handed him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then said, "We had better have another drink, as we shall get nothing more on the road after that"—it was then 12.15 or 12.20—I said that I did not care for any<lb/>thing, but he could have what he liked—we returned to the King of Sardinia—he said, "Don't have lemonade, have something stronger, have whisky"—the proprietor said, "I don't sell spirits, beer and wine I sell"—I had fourpennyworth of lemonade, and he had beer—we then drove to Barking Road, to a corner shop which is next to my house—at the time I met Mr. Hurrell I was wearing two watches, a gold watch in my right pocket and a silver watch in my left, with a double chain between them, and a centre bar—I had an overcoat—as I passed Druce's, the jeweller's shop, about one and a half minutes' drive from my house, I saw my watches safe because I compared them with the jeweller's clock—the cab stopped about one and a half minutes after that, and I stooped down and picked up my bag—it was a kind of black leather brief bag; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had in it a telegram and some deeds—as I stepped from the cab I was surprised to see that the prisoner had got down from his seat and that he was standing near his near side lamp—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and said, "Good night, cabby"—he said, "Here, I want a b—y half <hi rend="italic">Quid</hi> out of you, and if you don't b----y well pay me I shall pay you"—I said, "You have already had 6. from me, and I think that is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. above your fare"—he said nothing, but seized my bag by the handle and said, "I will have something"—he pulled me backwards and forwards by the bag, and eventually he gave me a long swing round, and I fell into the road, and he had possession of the bag—he succeeded in opening it with difficulty, and threw down the contents in disgust, as if he was in a passion—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the telegram which was in my bag; it was found by the police—I stooped down to pick my bag up, and he struck me a blow on my left jaw, which caused me to fall—he then seized me by my neck, and punched me about the sides of my head again, and dragged me along six or nine yards—I succeeded in getting away from him, and ran across to 16, Brockley road, where Mr. Harry Broustt lives, and as I was trying to open his gate the prisoner drew me back and threw me down, and as I got up I discovered that he was on the cab and was driving off—I ran alongside and sprang into the cab, and as I got to the end of White Post Lane I caught hold of the reins—he had turned towards Forest Gate, but I turned the cab round towards Ilford and called "Police" and "Help"—three policemen came up one after the other, and the prisoner said, "I give this man in custody for not having paid his fare, or I want his name and address"—he said that before I had time to speak to the police—I then said, "Indeed, on the other hand, this cabman has knocked me about in a most shameful manner, and he has forcibly taken my bag and ransacked the contents; I want one of you officers to accompany me to Brockley Road to assist</p>

               <p>me in recovering my papers, as they are of the utmost value to me"—that was to a stout constable, No. 386, I think—he said, "Your papers are nothing to do with us; if you don't give your name and address you will have to go to the police-station"—I positively refused to give my name and address, and I went to the station voluntarily, and the prisoner drove his cab there—when I got there I charged him with forcibly taking my bag from me and ransacking the contents—he said, "Oh! he hit me on the head with it, and the contents dropped out"—I explained to the inspector that I had been grossly knocked about by him—he said, "Have you any witnesses?"—I said, "No, I was entirely alone"—he said, "Then in the absence of witnesses, and seeing you have no visible marks of violence, your remedy is by summons"—I unbuttoned two buttons of my overcoat and took out my pocket-book, in which I put down the prisoner's name and address in shorthand—I saw the prisoner outside in his cab, and did not go out at once, but afterwards I went home, and on undressing I noticed that my waistcoat was torn and my two watches and Albert chain were gone—this is my waistcoat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); that is where the chain ran through—I then went to the police-station again and told the inspector what I had found out, in consequence of which I went with a constable to the prisoner's address—he was in bed—the constable charged him with assault and robbery of two watches—he said, "Oh, he did not have any watches on when he was with me"—I afterwards went with the same constable to examine the spot where the assault took place—we found marks of a struggle, and I saw him pick up the telegram in the road, which was safe in my bag before the prisoner got hold of it—I had at the Three Running Horses two lemonades and sherry, four lemonades and a little sherry in them, and at the Barnard Castle one glass of bitter; after that I had two small lemonades—I was perfectly sober at Ilford Police-station, and also when the cabman took hold of my bag; I was perfectly sober all the evening.</p>

On 17th April, at 1.30 a.m., I was on duty in Forest Road with Pegram—we heard cries of "Police," ran in that direction, and found a man having an altercation with a cabman—I asked what was the matter—he said he had been roughly pulled out of the cab and his papers taken from him and thrown about the road—Pegram asked him who by, and asked the cabman what he had to say about it—he said he had been driving the man about for five or six hours and could not get his fare, and he tried to get away and he stopped him—I asked the prosecutor if that was true—he said, "I did not engage him, my friend did"—Pegram asked him his name and address several times, he refused to give it, but went to the lamp and took a book from his pocket—he had one coat on only, he had no overcoat on—I did not go with him to the station, I went to look for our oilskin capes, which we had thrown away—the prosecutor had been drinking, but he was not drunk, he knew what he was about—when I first went up, the prosecutor's coat was buttoned up.</p>

On 17th April, about 2 a.m., the prosecutor, the prisoner, and the constable came to the station—the con<lb/>stable said that the prosecutor declined either to pay his fare or give his name and address—I asked the prisoner what the fare was—he said that he could scarcely say, but he would take 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prosecutor said that he considered his friend had paid the fare—I advised him to pay and he declined; I advised him to give his name and address—he said "5, Saxon Terrace, Selhurst Road, Croydon"—I asked him how long he had left Ilford, knowing that he lived there—he said "Some time, but I am staying at 17, Rixen Road, and shall be there about three weeks"—I asked him if he had any charge to make against the cabman—he said that he had been roughly pulled from the cab and his bag and papers strewn about the road, and asked me if I would search him to see if he had a whistle, as the cabman said he had one—I said "It is no part of my duty to search you for a whistle"—he had no overcoat on, he had one on his right arm; if he had two they must have both been on his arm—he showed me a bag, and the cabman said "I held the bag to prevent him running across some fields"—I asked him if he had any charge to prefer against the cabman—he said "No, I only want my papers"—I took their names and addresses, and told the cabman he could attend at the police-court and apply for a summons—he said "What police-court?"—I said "Stratford"—at that time I saw no marks of violence on the prosecutor, but I did not look to see, because he did not complain of being assaulted—he did not point to his face as being swollen—I saw him next at 5.35 the same morning at the station, and as he came in at the door he said "Since I was here this morning I find that both my watches and my chain are gone"—I said "What a pity you did not discover the loss at the time"—he said "Yes, but I have been in no one else's company"—I did not say "Had I known your jaw was injured to the extent it now appears, I should certainly have taken the charge;" nor did I go on to say "And no doubt we should have found your pro<lb/>perty in the possession of the cabman"—I positively swear that—when he complained of the loss of his watches, he complained that the cabman</p>

I said "Yes," they said "We intend getting into this house." I at once left them and went into a brickfield. One of them pulled out a pair of gloves, he held one and gave me the other. I heard a whistle and ran away, and I was pointed out to the officer.</p>

I am an oilman of 27, Great Chapel Street, West<lb/>minster—Copeland came to lodge there on 26th July, and occupied the second-floor back room—he gave the name of George Copeland—he said he worked on the railway; he did not say where, and I did not ask him particulars—I remember the police searching that room—on 31st January a letter came for him which I gave unopened to Inspector Marshall—this is the handwriting of the envelope. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was read, addressed</hi>; "Mr. Copeland, 27, Great Chapel Street, London, near Westminster. January 31, 1884. Sir,—The goods will arrive at Victoria Station about 1 o'clock to-morrow, Tuesday. I am in trouble; do you know my house was searched yesterday afternoon and them stones and one pawnbroker's ticket—them lockets they did not find, the picks—my daughter pledged for my son, the remains of Forest Hill, so I know not how it will end. They have not been since. What had I better do? think. Please tell me soon, but they are.... I believe, as he was down at the trial as a prosecutor; so I trust and hope I shan't take much harm.

On 22nd January I was shown a statement made by a man named Clark, in consequence of which I went to Pentonville and saw him, and obtained a statement from him—in consequence of that statement I obtained a search warrant, and on 30th January I went with Inspector Marshall and Sergeant Preston to 27, Great Chapel Street, Westminster, where Copeland occupied a back<lb/>room on the second floor—I said to him "My name is Roots; I am an inspector of police of Great Scotland Yard; this is Inspector Marshall, and this is Sergeant Preston—I hold a warrant to search your room"—I read it to him—I then commenced to search the room—I first found three pictures—I asked where he got them from—he said "I bought them"—"Who from?"—"A man"—"Where does he live?"—"I don't know"—Preston said "They were stolen from Mr. Curtis"—he said "I bought them of a man outside the Aquarium"—I asked if he knew the man's address—he said he did not—I said I should take them—I took from the chimneypiece a barometer—I said "Where did you get this?"—he</p>

               <p>said he bought that of a man outside the Aquarium—I found some stones and two imitation cameos—I asked him the same questions about them, and he gave the same reply—I also found a pearl pin, a metal buckle, a ring, a wedding ring, and a bouquet holder—I showed those articles to Mr. Cox, and he identified them as part of the produce of the burglary at his house—I also found a white damask tablecloth with the marks partially cut out—I showed that and the three pictures to Mr. Curtis; he identified the pictures, but was uncertain as to the tablecloth, though he lost one of a similar pattern—I also found a black marble clock, a bronze ornament, a pendulum of a clock, a pencil, a medal, and two pairs of trousers which Mr. Frazer has identified as the produce of a burglary at his house—I also found a clock with imitation bronze figures which I showed to Mrs. Morgan, and which she identified as part of the produce of a burglary at her house—I also found a great quantity of other property of all descriptions—while making the search Copeland opened the window at the bottom—he had some birds there, and he said he would feed them before he went—I closed the window and said it was too cold—it was closed at the top but opened for air—it was a very small room and very stuffy—while I turned my back upon him momentarily he jumped through the window; I turned in time to see his feet disappearing—I threw the window up, and he fell on to a small building built out from the floor, jumped from that into the yard, and escaped—he was dressed in his trousers, shirt, and socks, but no boots or overcoat—I went out and searched for him, and found he had fallen on a spot of the District Railway, about forty paces from the District Railway station—I went to the Westminster Hospital and found him there with his right leg and arm broken—he remained there till 4th April, when he was brought to the police-court—I found some chisels at Copeland's two of which I fitted to some marks at Mrs. Morgan's 59, Binfield Road, and one fitted nine marks on a wardrobe from which clothing was stolen, and one a cupboard in a bedroom—the other fits a mark on a chest of drawers at Mr. Fraser's, at Hendon.</p>

Campany, boot and shoe maker"—the hole was empty—I returned to the house, and Hunt said to George "Where are those tools that were in the hole?" and he said "I know nothing about any tools, that hole was made for a closet"—I said "I have a warrant to arrest you for receiving a portion of Mr. Cox's jewellery"—he said "I know nothing about it"—I read the warrant to him—they were both taken to the station—George there made a statement, which was taken down by Inspector Wren—I found on him this pocket-book containing this entry, "Thursday, Cox, 20th, garters and bracelet, F.

I live at 90, Smyrke's Road, Walworth, and am a receiver of goods on the Brighton Railway—on 18th December, about 4 in the afternoon, I was in South Street, Walworth—I saw William Henry Day driving a van—I saw a man take a parcel from behind the van and throw it into a barrow that was standing outside Mr. Mellish's shop and run away down Shaftesbury Street—I called out to Day and he jumped off his van and ran after the man; he caught him by the coat; the man hit Day with his fist and ran down South Street, Day after him down Inville Road, and I saw no more of him—I next saw Day at Dr. Causton's, about twenty minutes after 4 the same afternoon, he was then suffering from wounds—I am not able to identify the man who took the parcel—I cannot positively swear that the prisoner is the man, because he had whiskers, and was dressed differently—the man had on a ribbed overcoat and an old felt hat and a stripish sort of trousers—he was rather dark, because his whiskers were dark—I gave the police a description of the man as near as I could.</p>

I am a surgeon, of Chaplin Villa, Forest Hill—on 18th December I was house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—Day was brought there about 5.20 in the afternoon—he was partially collapsed—I examined him—I found two incised wounds on the front part of the abdomen, both on a level with the navel—the one on the left side was three-quarters of an inch long by a quarter of inch wide, three inches and a half from the navel—the one on the right side was an inch and a half from the navel, about half an inch long, and the major axis of each wound was vertical; the internal fat of the abdomen was protruding from the wound on the left side—it is possible that this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) might have produced both wounds—it would require considerable force to produce such wounds, especially that on the right side—I continued to attend to him until the 21st, he was then sinking—I sat down on his bed and said "You are in a very dangerous condition," and having previously written some words on a slip of paper, I gave the paper to him and requested him to read it—he read it and signed it, and I witnessed it—before he signed it I asked him if he understood its contents—he said "You don't mean to give me up, do you, doctor?"—I said "It is my duty to tell you that you are in a very dangerous condition"—that was all that was said—he signed it after that—he then simply put his head on the pillow and laid back exhausted—this was between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening; he died about 7.20 next morning—I made a post-mortem examination—he died from the wounds—he was 5 feet 8 1/2 inches in length, of a dark-brown complexion, well nourished.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have said that it is possible that this knife might have produced both wounds—I have a doubt about the wound on the right side, not on account of the size of the wound; that wound pene<lb/>trated the wall of the abdomen and extended upwards—it had transfixed the liver about three-quarters of an inch from its front edge and then punctured the gall bladder; and my doubt as to the knife is this, that in order to have inflicted that wound either Day must have been bent down and doubled when he received the wound, or else it must have been in<lb/>flicted with very considerable force, looking at the length of the blade—I do not mean that the man must necessarily have been stooping from the hips, but bending down, crouching as if anticipating a blow—I should certainly have thought it more probable that such a wound would be caused by a knife having a larger blade than this, it might have done</p>

About 4 o'clock in the afternoon on Tuesday, 18th December, I was passing through South Street, Walworth, with my van, which I was driving, when I saw a man take a parcel of tea from the hind part of the van; I got down and ran after him. He ran into the Queen Ann public-house, in South Street, and seeing I was following him he came out again and said, 'What are you following me for? I am a perfect stranger.' I laid hold of him by the collar, he pushed me away from him; I ran along several streets, and in South Street I lost sight of him. &gt;From what a man told me I went into a coal-shed, and in a water-closet I saw the man I had chased; he said, 'What do you want?' I said 'You are the man that stole my parcel.' He came out, I took hold of him, we struggled together, during which he stabbed me several times with a knife which he had in his hand; when he came out of the closet he stabbed me two or three times in the stomach. I had never seen the man before, but I should know him again. Several men came to my assistance after the man had got away. I told them what had happened; they took me to a doctor's; I was brought to the hospital the same evening. I am sure the man that stabbed me was the same that stole the tea, and he was very much out of breath when I saw him in the water-closet. He was about 27 years of age, 5 feet 7 or 8 inches, dark whiskers and moustache; white shirt, dark dress, dark Chesterfield overcoat, dark trousers, black felt hat, boots can<lb/>not describe." (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's statement was then read as follows</hi>: "I, John Bolton, did on the 18th December, 1883, stab a man. I took a parcel off from his van, and he saw me and ran after me, and caught me in a shed and held me by the peck. I tried to shake him off, but could not, and I took a penknife out of my pocket and stabbed him three or four times in the stomach. I solemnly declare that I did it. I have been tor<lb/>mented</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188405190115"/>
               <p>ever since I was sentenced about the thought of him." (<hi rend="italic">This was written by the prisoner on a slate.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">His statement to the inspector was as follows</hi>: "I, John Bolton, a convict, undergoing a sentence of five years' penal servitude, having been duly cautioned by Inspector Hunt, whom I know, that all I say will be given in evidence against me, most solemnly declare that on the 18th December last, about a quarter past 1 in the afternoon, I was in South Street, Walworth, and I saw a covered van containing some parcels, one of which I took out of the tail of the van and ran away with it—the man who was driving the van ran after me through several streets into Portland Street, Walworth, where I, finding I could not get away from him, ran into a shed at the back of a house in Portland Street, and hid in the water-closet, where the man found me and caught me by the throat. We had a struggle, and finding I could not get away I took out my knife and stabbed him two or three times in the stomach—he then let go his hold of me, and I ran away. The same night I slept in an omnibus in a yard at the back of a beer-house by the canal bridge in Trafalgar Road, Peckham. The knife I did it with is the one now shown to me by Inspector Hunt, which is the same that was taken from me when I was apprehended for the offence of which I am convicted. The knife has two blades in it; it was the larger of the two I used. I never told any person that I did it until the 12th of this month, when I wrote the particulars on a slate, which I handed to the chief warder. I did not intend to kill the man, but only to get away from him. The clothing I was wearing at the time I changed away to a man on the tramp at Peckham two or three days afterwards for his, so that I should not be known. The contents of the paper dated 19th December, 1883, signed by William Henry Day, now read to me by Inspector Hunt, is true in substance, but I don't recollect going into the public-house, as mentioned therein. I did not know the man I stabbed, but I saw his name was Day in the bills offering a reward. I make this confession well knowing the consequences, but I wish to be brought to judgment because I cannot rest with it on my mind; it has troubled me ever since, and I cannot sleep at night. Signed, John Bolton. Wit<lb/>nessed by Inspector Hunt"—The prisoner also stated that in his flight he threw the parcel away—bills were issued in which Day's name was mentioned—I went into the shed—there is a water-closet in the yard adjoining the shed—the shed is a temporary one used as a coal-shed, in a small backyard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> One of the bills issued offered 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward, and described the man who stabbed the deceased—before I went to Penton<lb/>ville I had read Day's statement; I took it—during the prisoner's state<lb/>ment I said something to him, and then he went on with his statement; I asked him questions if I did not exactly follow him—his statement was partly elicited by questions put by me; for instance, I asked him where he slept the night after the murder, and what he did with his clothing, and so on—I asked him what sort of a van it was, and he said one covered with tarpaulin—Inspector Roots was with me at the time—I did not ask the prisoner if it was a covered van, in fact I did not know at that time that it was covered—I do not know the date on which the prisoner was taken into custody on the charge for which he was sentenced to five years—I do not know what became of him after he made this accusation of murder against himself, the chief warder will tell you.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Since then he has not been undergoing the sentence of penal servitude—he was treated as a convict till last Friday—the first nine months' punishment of penal servitude is the most severe portion of the sentence, the diet is less and they are kept in close confinement, in solitary confinement in the cell, and they work there, speaking to nobody but the officer, twelve hours a day, with the exception of an hour for exercise.</p>

I am the wife of James Harris, and live at 3, Fullerton Road, Croydon—the prisoner had lived with us about ten weeks—he had a wife and two children; the eldest was 22 months old, the other child had died—the boy's name was Frederick—on Easter Tuesday, 15th April, I heard the prisoner come home from work about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—he was very drunk—he went up a few stairs and he could not get up with his basket—he called his wife to help him with it, and she came down part of the stairs and helped him up—I then went back into my kitchen; after that I went to shut the front door—I stood at the door a few minutes and I heard the prisoner ask his wife to sing; she began to sing and then she began to read a little—I heard the prisoner say that it was all wrong that she was reading—after that the wife came downstairs into my kitchen with the child in her arms; just after he came into the kitchen—the prisoner said "Liz, I will give you ✗<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if you will go away and leave me the boy"—she made no reply—he said "I will give you 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—then she said You are getting kind, Fred," and smiled—the prisoner tried to get at his wife; she kept behind my back—he came the other side and tried to get at her—I put up my hand and said "I can't have any noise in my place, Mr. Knight"—he used some bad language towards his wife and caught her up and said "I will go and cut the child's throat and my own"—he took the child under his arm and carried it upstairs—I saw him go upstairs into his room—shortly afterwards he came out to the top of the stairs and help up a razor and said "That is the knife"—he had the child under his arm—I did not see that it was bleeding then—Mrs. Knight ran into the room and screamed—I ran outside the front door—I saw Tranter with the child; it was then bleeding from its throat; he ran to a doctor's with it—I afterwards saw the prisoner with his throat bleeding—he passed me outside the front door.</p>

I am house surgeon of the Croydon General Hospital—the prisoner was in that hospital under my care from 15th April to 2nd May—he had a cut in his throat; it was about two inches long—it was done evidently with some cutting instrument; probably a razor—there was nothing in the character of the wound to indicate whether the instrument was sharp or blunt—I also saw the child with its throat cut—while the prisoner was in the hospital he made a statement to me several times, I don't remember his exact words, but it was that he cut the child's throat to be revenged on his wife—his wound was never of a serious character.</p>

She said "Get it yourself." I said no more but went downstairs and got my things ready on my barrow and washed myself. I am a hawker with cottons, needles, and drapery. I got ready to go on my rounds. She had not got up then. I fetched a policeman and told him I could not do anything to my wife as I was out on bail, and she was trying to make me commit myself. She came to the window and said she did not care for me or the policeman, "You had better go on and do your work." I started off. I got as far as Mr. Turnbull's shop, and he gave me a cup of tea. I afterwards got a little to drink, and I do not remember anything after that. I had had no food since Sunday at dinner time. Mr. Tranter knows that I had no breakfast that morning.</p>

I live at 19, Audrey Place, Shoreditch, and am a painter and writer—I know the prisoner—in November I painted a cart for Mr. Leach dark green, picked out with light green, and the initials R. L. on it in gold on the panels, on two sides, and the back—I saw the cart in the yard on Christmas Day—on the 27th December I saw it again in Thomas Street, Hackney Road, or Kingsland Road, at 2 o'clock, in the road outside the Marquis of Lansdowne—the prisoner and another man were with it, and there was a pony in the shafts—between 2 and 3 I saw him in Old Street riding in the cart with the same man.</p>

I shall lock you up for it"—he said "Don't lock me up, and I will make you a new one in place of it"—he came out at the door and then came back, saying he had left some eels in the basin—it was an eel-shop—he went back into Mr. Brittain's, and I did not go in—he came out of the eel-shop again; I was standing at the door, I followed him up the Black<lb/>friars Road—he said "Then you intend to follow me?"—I said "Yes, I am determined to see where you live"—he said "I live a long way off here, we had better have a cab"—I said "Never mind about a cab, I will walk"—I walked till the prisoner walked into a constable's arms, and then I gave him into custody—I have never seen my cart—it was worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>of a man named Chick—Chick is in prison; I think he cut his throat, but not in the infirmary; it was at West Croydon Station I think—until this Good Friday the prisoner had been in bed—he was in a very bad weak state as far as I know; he appeared to be often in pain—he never asked me but twice for the doctor—I did not fetch the doctor; my duty was to report to the nurse—on the Good Friday, about 3 or 4 o'clock, I heard him ask the nurse for the doctor; he appeared to be in pain then—he asked me to call the nurse's attention to him, which I did—he said he was in pain about his water, he was troubled with the water, and I want the doctor—when I found him with the poker in his hand he was at the foot of the bed—I took it out of his hand; we did not have a struggle for it—I asked him what he did it for and he replied "I hope I have killed her; I intended to kill her"—I am quite certain those were the words—I was not particularly excited when I was before the Magistrates—these things do not occur in this ward—it would excite me a little—the words were not "I have murdered the nurse and intended to do so"—I believe I am speaking the truth—I am sixty-four years of age; my memory was better some years ago. (<hi rend="italic">The words in the deposition were "I have murdered the nurse and intended to do so."</hi>) The man seemed very agitated—his hands were not cut when I took the poker from him—I left him to assist the nurse—he did not remain at the bed where I found him; he returned to his own bed and remained there—his bed is about three yards off Finch's—the beds range along the wall, and there are three or four on the other side—the prisoner's was on the other side of the room—it could not be a minute before I found him at his own bed—the backs of his hands were cut; the knife was not in his hands but on the bed—there was a great deal of blood—there were no other cuts about him besides on his hands, that I am sure of—I don't think I said anything to him then—the knife was close to his hands on the bed—he did not show the least anger or violence towards me—he appeared excited.</p>

I was 84 on 24th last April—I am an inmate of the Croydon Union Infirmary, and have been there three or four months as nearly as I can tell—on Good Friday last I was in No. 3 ward; I was ill in bed—I occupy one of the nine beds along the side of the wall—I remember seeing the prisoner; he occupied one of the beds on the other side of the ward—I remember on Good Friday afternoon, about 6 o'clock in the evening, the nurse coming to give me my physic—the prisoner was sitting alongside the fire like that (<hi rend="italic">Leaning his head down upon his hands</hi>)—she gave me my physic, and was putting the cork in the bottle, when I heard the blow come like that, and it knocked her up against my bed—the prisoner did it—I did not see him get up from where he was sitting; I did not see him till he hit her; I saw him hit her with the poker—I cannot say exactly whether he hit her at the side of the head the first time, it was somewhere on the head—this is the poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was sitting at the fireplace resting his head on the poker for some</p>

               <p>time—I saw more than one blow—he hit her somewhere on the back part of the head—she was down alongside my bed, and when he hit her the second blow she went under the next bed—the first blow knocked her down—my bed is opposite the fireplace—he never spoke—I saw Ward come in and take her away, and take the poker away from the prisoner—I did not hear anything the prisoner said to Ward when he came in—I had not heard him speak to the nurse that afternoon, at least I did not take notice—I was bad again—the doctor was there the day before and saw me and saw them all—I can't remember anything he said to the nurse or anything about the doctor that afternoon; I believe he did speak, but I did not take much notice.</p>

I asked the nurse to send for you, as I was very bad"—he appeared to be in pain—he did not seem excited—he is sixty-two—that night I sat up in the adjoining room and saw him five or six times in the course of the night—I asked him how he was, he said he was very bad—Mr. Chick was in charge of him—Mr. Chick cut his throat afterwards, for which he got three months—he did not cut his throat on this occasion in the in<lb/>firmary.</p>

               <p>medical officer of the infirmary there—I have an assistant who assists me in attending the patients at the infirmary—we both attend there daily—I know the prisoner as a patient, and remember his being in between the 7th January and 18th February—he then discharged himself and came in again on 28th February—on each occasion he was admitted as suffering from chronic bronchitis—while under my charge I detected nothing else the matter with him except general debility; a broken-down constitution—after the 28th February I always attended to him—he had medicine constantly while he was being treated—I gave instruc<lb/>tions to the nurse how he was to be treated—as far as I saw she always carried out my instructions—before Good Friday he used to complain of various symptoms at different times—he used to pass but little water—his water being scanty and thick, he complained of that—he used to speak of not being able to pass his water, and ask for assistance—he had no difficulty in passing it; he had no water in his bladder to pass—that was his general state of health, and disease of his heart—it was part of his general symptoms—I saw him on the Thursday before Good Friday—when I saw him in the morning up to Good Friday he was in bed then, but he used to lie in bed or get up as he wished—I had allowed him clothes, and so allowed him to get up when he wished—I did not see him on the Good Friday until I was sent for—I was in the building, but I did not go into all the wards on Good Friday—my as<lb/>sistant did not go into that ward—we went to the infirmary every day; but there are so many wards—I had seen him on the Thursday—I was fetched to the infirmary a little after 6 o'clock—I saw nurse Wyeth—I had been told the prisoner assaulted her—I examined her, and found she had a scalp wound on the top of her head about an inch long—it was an incised wound, but you may have an incised wound caused by a blunt instrument where there is little flesh—she had also another wound on the outside of the left eye which had injured the eyeball; that was bleeding—they were both bleeding at the time—the wound outside the eye might also have been caused by the poker—it could not have been caused by contact with the bed, it must have been by a blow across the cheekbone—she was in bed in consequence of those injuries for 10 or 12 days afterwards, and is still suffering—it is doubtful whether the eye can be saved; time only can show that—she is not able to attend to her duties—soon after that I saw the prisoner—I don't recollect the words he used when he first saw me—the substance was, I was his murderer; that was one thing he said—I don't recollect the remark I made then; I simply said he must be given into custody for the assault on the nurse; that was all I said—I cannot recollect whether he said anything about my being sent for or not being sent for; he may have done so—I think he must have made some complaint, the usual com<lb/>plaint which attracted my attention—I then examined his bladder to see whether there was water; I found his bladder was quite empty—there was nothing in it—I am satisfied that at that time he was not suffer<lb/>ing any pain from stricture or anything of that kind—there might be pain, but nothing to pass—stricture is an impediment—he could always pass water, but it was so scanty—my attention was called to the fact that he had passed his water that morning; besides, I often explained to him he had no obstruction—I observed he had cuts on his hands—</p>
