I am a German; I understand English—on January 18th I was living at 1, St. Ann's Court, Soho—on that day I went to the Admiral Duncan in the evening—I saw Mr. Baker there—the prisoner was not there—I did not see Mrs. O'Leary there—I know her; she lives in the same house as I do; she did my washing for me—she and the prisoner were living as wife and husband—I returned home and went upstairs—Mrs. O'Leary was at the door—she said my washing was done, and asked me into the room—immediately afterwards a quarrel arose between me and the prisoner in German—he called me some beautiful words—he said, "I am going to get rid of this woman who has been living with me"—I did not see Mrs. O'Leary there then—I said, "I have enough to do to look after my ownself, withouttroublingaboutyour business"—he said, "Youare sticking up for her, and you have no reason to do so"—he came at me and struck me on my right arm with his hand—I fell backward on the floor—he was on the top of me—the candle was knocked over and went out, and we were left struggling in the dark—I felt a kind of a stick in my right eye—I do not remember anything else—I became unconscious, and was taken down below to the landlady's room—I was taken to the Middlesex Hospital—I had a wound on my hand on both sides, one on my left cheek, the left part of my nose, and on my forehead, and two stabs on my upper and lower eyelid—my eye was lost entirely—my left eye is very weak now—I remained in the hospital till April 3rd, and I have to go back as soon as this case is settled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I remember Mrs. Blackman, the landlady, coming up<lb/>stairs just when I was stabbed—she asked me who had done it, and as I was nearly unconscious, I said both of them had done it; I was referring to Mr. and Mrs. Klein, but I did not mean it—I came in a little after 11 o'clock; between 9 and 11 I had been out—I might have been into several public-houses, but I was quite sober—a friend of mine, Mr. Glcighauser, paid me some money that evening—I did not take Mrs. O'Leary out and have a drink—I did not return to the house with her—I thought she was my foreman's wife, and I always respected her as such—I did not try to get into the room; it was open—Mrs. O'Leary did not keep me out—I did not go upstairs to my room and fetch a heavy belt; I have not got one—when I came home I was going up to my room: it is a few steps higher than the prisoner's—when I went into the room Mrs. O'Leary went out—she did not say, "You are not to fight the old man; you are to fight me"—I went upstairs,</p>

               <p>and when I came down she asked me in, and said, "Don't have any <hi rend="italic">rows</hi>, "let me have one Saturday night in peace"—she did come at me with her fist, I own to it—I did not hit her back—when I got this stab I only saw the prisoner on top of me—I swear that nobody was in the room<lb/>—then Mrs. O'Leary came in and called for help, and the landlady came up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mrs. O'Leary was not in the room when I was stabbed—we were in the dark for at least twenty minutes before I felt the stab in my eye—the candlestick was knocked over in the struggle—the man is too big for me—we were nearly half an hour in the dark.</p>

                  </hi>. My son is the landlord at St. Ann's Court—<lb/>about 11 o'clock on March 18th I heard quarrelling upstairs—I went up—<hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi> was about two or three steps up his own flight of stairs, and Mrs. O'Leary was standing in front of him on the landing, they were shouting at one another—I do not know what they were saying; it was in German—Mrs. O'Leary said in English, "You will not fight the old man; you will fight me"—she put up her fists and attacked <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi>—I took hold of her cape and said, "Don't fight"—she took no notice, but flung my arm away—the prisoner came out of his room—he had his trousers and shirt on—I took hold of him and begged him not to fight—he leaped up the stairs towards <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi>, and tried to pull him back—I left them and went downstairs—I had only got to the first flight of stairs when the woman called out, "Mrs. Blackman, fetch a light"—it was not two minutes after—I fetched a light and met <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi> on the stairs pouring with blood—he said, "Oh, Mrs. Blackman, I am done for"—he was nearly unconscious—I said, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi>, who has done it?"—he said, "Both of them, both of them"—I took him down-stairs to my room and bathed him with cold water—I was present when the prisoner was brought down by the policeman—the prisoner said to me, "<hi rend="italic">Missus</hi>, I never done it"—Mrs. O'Leary had got one of her hands hurt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now living at 9, Bennett Street, Fitzroy Square—at the early part of this year my husband was in prison, and I was living with the prisoner as his wife—I did not know <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi> till the prisoner introduced him to me—the prisoner told me be thought that <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi> wanted to take me away from him—I said I had committed myself once in nine years, and I should not do so again—on this night <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi> came to my room between 11 and 11.30, and asked for the remainder of his washing—I said, "Come inside"—the prisoner was sitting on the bed, and Ion the chair—I asked <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi> to sit down while I made out his bill, and asked him if he would have a drink—there was a glass on the table, but not sufficient to drink, and I went down to get a pint of ale.—I was away about 10 minutes, and when I came back I found <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi> on the staircase, with his head towards the banisters and his feet towards my door, and the prisoner kneeling on him, with two knives, one in each hand, stabbing him about the face and head—I had no words with <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi>—I knew nothing of the affair till I found them in the dark—I said, "What are you doing?"—I was stabbed in the hand by the prisoner—I screamed for somebody to show me a light; it was in the dark—some light came in from the adjoining building—my lamp was alight</p>

                  </hi> (292 <hi rend="italic">C</hi>). I was called on Saturday night, March 18th, to St. Ann's Court—I found the prosecutor on the ground floor, bleeding from wounds about his face and hands—I fetched the prisoner from upstairs—before I took him into custody he said, "I am the one that did it"—I asked him if he knew anything of it—I held out no inducement to him to say anything—a doctor was sent for, and the prisoner was charged and taken to the station—in answer to the charge he said, "We had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, but I did not use the knife."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examine.</hi> I may have said before the Magistrate that I asked the man, "Did you assault that man?"—I think I asked him if he knew anything of it downstairs, and he replied, "Yes, I am the man who did it"—the prisoner's hands had no blood on them—Mrs. O'Leary's hand was bleeding, as if from a stab—I did not ask her what she had in her hand; it was not closed.</p>

                  </hi> (199 <hi rend="italic">C</hi>). About midnight on March 18th I was called to 1, St. Ann's Court, and saw the prosecutor in the ground-floor room, with the landlady by his side—he made a statement—I went upstairs and found the prisoner in the back room, second floor, with Mrs. O'Leary—he was asked by French if he had assaulted the man downstairs—he said, "I did it, but I had no knife; we had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, and I put him out of my room"—he meant the prosecutor—I took him back into the room to finish dressing himself, and there I found this knife lying on the table under a paper (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I am not positive if there was a light there when I went in first—the knife is bent—I asked him how he accounted for it being bent—he said, "My wife <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it about two hours ago"—I found some pieces of a broken glass, and the bottom of the glass, in the fireplace—it is an ordinary beer glass—there was some beer on the floor and blood on the stairs—when I got downstairs I asked the prosecutor if I was to charge both—he said, "No, not the woman, only Adam Klein"—I asked the woman to accompany me to the station, which she did—she was detained for a short time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The woman had her hand closed—she opened it and showed me a mark on it—there was blood there.</p>

               <p>the centre of his right eyebal, and I saw it would have to be taken out—he had a wound 1 1/2 in. long on his right eyelid, a wound at the back of each hand, each over an inch long; they were both bleeding freely; a deep wound over 1 in. long on his left cheek; two slight wounds on the right side of his nose, and one over the bridge of his nose between the eyebrows—I do not think there is any doubt that the wound in his eye was caused by a knife—such wounds could easily have been caused by either of these knives—this wound was not dangerous to life, but a wound in the eye might cause death by penetrating the bone seperating the eyeball from the brain; a little difference in the direction might have caused death—the right eyeball has been taken out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 116, Maron Road, Stoke Newington—from 1870 till last February I held the past of indoor superintendent at the Millwall Dock Co.—I was appointed chief clerk and paymaster on their opening in 1868—at that dote Mr. George Raymoud Birt was the general manager of the company, and he continued so till August, 1893—in 1870 I was promoted from chief clerk to indoor superintendent—there are two, one indoor and one out-door—my duties were at the docks—Mr. Birt was my immediate superior all along—from 1866 to 1893 he was at the docks almost daily, and in his position of general manager he would give me instructions as to what he would require done, which I obeyed—at the offices a large number of the, company's books were kept; there were 209 cargo ledgers there at the end of last year, and still increasing—the cargo books contaiued the record of all goods landed on behalf of the sundry merchants or companies interested—they were our record for the delivering of such goods, and contained full details—those books never left the dock offices—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—they do not show how long we keep the goods—we calculate the rent due up to June 30th and December 31st—the audit of the company's accounts occurred half-yearly—they were audited up to June 30th and December 31st—about January and May of each year, before the audits, I received instructions from Mr. Birt to proceed with the abstraction of the outstanding accounts—I instructed the chief clerk, and he instructed those under him, and an abstract of the actual outstandings, as they appeared in the cargo books was made—under Mr. Birt's direction I used to summarise that abstract myself and present it to him and also a summary of the tonnage of the goods on hand; he would return them to me, and instruct that we should take so much per ton, according to the class of goods shown on my summary, which would make the total amount of the revenue—he would name the approximate figure up to which he wished the revenue to be brought, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189905080037"/>
               <p>the staff would proceed to make the necessary calculations for increasing the figures up to the amount required by Mr. Birt—in the first instance, the summaries were always prepared on foolscap paper in black ink, and the increased figures would be shown in red ink, and the actual figures and the added figures would be cast together, and the sum of them shown in the revenue books, which were then forwarded for audit to the London office—the cargo books were the working books—I myself signed the revenue books before they were forwarded each half-year—there were eight books, and each was also signed by the ledger clerk and the chief clerk—my summary was also forwarded to the City office—it showed the alleged certified total amount of the outstandings—Mr. Birt also signed the certificate, which was placed before the auditors—Mr. Birt and I attended the audits—he wan there to conduct the audits, I was there to answer questions—this book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) shows the actual amount of the outstandings in each half-year, from June 30th, 1884, to December 31st, 1898; it is in my handwriting, and also the advances made under Mr. Birt's directions—the proper amount i'or the half-year ending June 30th, 1884, was £40,937; the total as shown in the book was £72,940—on December 31st, 1884, the actuals were £43,416, the advance £35,100, making a total of £78,516—on June 30th, 1885, the actuals were £40,755, the advance was £35,750, making a total of £76,505—I have made a list from this book showing the increase at the different half-yearly dates, from Juno 30th, 1884, to December 31st, 1898, which is accurate—I have made up the fourth column showing the increase, from figures I have had since—these (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are the summaries handed to Mr. Birt for the purpose of showing what were the actual outstandings. On the back of thin document (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) I find, in Mr. Birt's writing, directions for the proportion of the accounts; the actuals are £34,237, the others are £72,996, total £107,233—when these two statements were pre<lb/>pared in 1888 1 considered the amount heavier than it had been, and I became anxious, and I said to Mr. Birt that the advances were growing large, could he justify them? and he assured me at thai time, as at others, that he could—I said I should be more satisfied if I had written instruc<lb/>tions, and he made the remark shown on Exhibit 1. In 1893 I was still very anxious, and I said to Mr. Birt, "I must have definite instructions," which he gave me—this document, dated January 21st, 1893, is what he gave me—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Mr. Wood, the stock of goods of all kinds on hand on December 31st being 86,546 tons, in working out the revenue take the pro<lb/>portionate earnings on those goods at £3 a ton for fruit, and 25s. per ton on the residue.—G.

R. B."—in August, 1893, Mr. Birt became a director of the company, and was elected chairman of the directors by the shareholders at a general meeting in August, and from then till February, 1898, he was chairman and general manager—he continued to come to the docks regularly, and the accounts were prepared in tho same way—the balance-sheet was published up to June 30th, 1898, but not under my directions—the actuals were £24,698, the addition was £202,622, making a total of £227,321, the increase being £17,058—on December 31st, 1898, the actuals were £33 430, the addition for that half-year was £208,670, making a total of £242,100, or an increment of £6,048—the total amount of the increase up to December 31st, 1898 was £220,467, and we deducted an increase of £11,797, leaving a nett total of £208,670—this document (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) shows the black figures as extracted from the cargo ledgers, and also the red ink figures, the total amounts as made by Mr. Birt's instructions—on February 6th Mr. Birt was unwell and unable to attend the board meeting as usual—I was summoned by the Board unexpectedly—that was the first time I had had the pleasure of meeting: the Board-certain questions were put to me, which I answered—after I left the direc<lb/>tors, I went to Mr. Birt's private house at 59, Compane Gardens—I told him that the directors had been asking me questions about the out-standings, had he any anxiety about them t—he said, "Not at all, I can justify every iota"—I said, "This matter is troubling me very much indeed, Mr. Birt, does it not worry you?"—he said, "Not at all, I have no anxiety about it"—I told him the audit was fixed for the following Thursday and that it was imperative that he should attend—he said he should be present—I took up my duties next day again at the docks—</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been with the company since it started—M indoor superintendent I bad nothing to do with the general accounts of the company—the first increase to the accounts had occurred by the third year—it has taken place from 1870, but at that time the business at the docks was very small compared to what it has been since, but the increase has grown considerably—the earliest document I have, which shows the way in which the increase was made is in 1888 in Mr. Birt's writing—that is his authority—the earliest document I have which shows the difference between the actual and the estimated is the half year ending December 31st, 1883—that is not in my writing, but in the writing of a clerk who was superannuated—the amount of the actual charges in 1886 was £43,106—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the revenue book for the half-year ending June 30th, 1892—the actuals then were £44,118, some proportion of them appear in this book, but not the identical figures—those figures would be contained in eight books—there is no page here which shows the sum £160,929—each book shows its own department and my nummary shows the total—I cannot say if the statement for 1892, signed by Mr. Birt, is in existence—I sent it to the dock-honse and I have lost sight of it—there is no book which contains the very figures which are upon the certificates—the revenue books contain the black and red figures united, the inflated figures—there is nothing to check the accuracy of my summary—there are eight revenue books one for each department: North, South, East, West, wood exports, dues, dry dock rentals, grain and fruit—several clerks have this book under their control—there are about 120 clerks altogether—they all more or less had access to the revenue books—they could have found out that the actual figures did not correspond with the figures returned—it would be pretty obvious to anybody who was in the habit of dealing with books, but the clerks were assured by me that Mr. Birt justified it—the chief clerk spoke to me on several occasions about it—he was as anxious about it as I was—I accepted the figure £38,000 as the receipts for the half-year of 1888 without question at that time, and £24,500 for general goods—I thought Mr. Birt could explain it—I had nothing to do with the preparation of the balance sheet—the accounts for land never came before me—I knew it was an inflated figure, but I thought it might represent the assets or accounts, with which I had nothing to do—in 1888 the amount suddenly increased, and I became anxious about it—it had been going on some time, but in a very much smaller degree—I always looked upon Mr. Birt as a gentleman of the highest integrity—I did not think he was doing anything fraudulent—nobody at the docks benefited 1d. in consequence of this—when I asked for written instructions, he gave them to me very readily, and said, "I wonder you did not ask for them before"—the auditors, their assistants the secretary, the general manager and myself attended the audits.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chartered accountant, and have been one of the auditors to the Mill wall Docks Company since 1891—my firm were so before that—since 1891, I have been in the habit of conducting an audit of the accounts for each half year, up to June 30th and December 31st—I did that for the purpose of preparing the balance sheet—the audit took place at the Dock Office, at Fenchurch Street—I did not goto the docks themselves<lb/>—I never saw any books that were kept there till last February, when J was specially directed to inspect the cargo books—each year when I was proceeding with the audit I was furnished with the revenue books, purporting to con<lb/>tain the result from the cargo ledgers—each revenue book was certified; there was also a summary prepared on the whole, which was certified also—if the revenue books had reisdly corresponded with the cargo books the matter would have been quite correct—after having seen that they corre<lb/>sponded, I would make an appointment with Mr. Birt for the audit, when I would go over the totals with him, and generally ask a few questions—I always cast up the revenue books to see if they were properly represented in the certificate, and finding that the revenue books corresponded with the certificate, I put the figures into the balance-sheet and certified it—I observed from time to time that the outstandings were incrt<lb/>asing and I drew Mr. Birt's attention to the fact, and his explanation was that the business at the docks consisted so largely of warehousing material, and that the rent and charges upon it accrued, and did not become pay<lb/>able until the goods were removed, but the character of the business at the docks had so much changed of recent years that the outstandings would continue to grow, and had grown in the past, and chiefly represented the charges; which are not supposed to be entered into the accounts—that the character of the business at the docks up to a great extent that year had become one of a storage character, and that the warehouses were filled with goods, and that it was in the ordinary course of business that the outstandings increased—I accepted his statement as an explanation coupled with these certificates; I never dreamt that there was anything the matter with the accounts—since Mr. Birt became chairman in August, 1893, the balance sheet was prepared in that way—last February I was instructed to verify the figures from the cargo books for the previous half-year, ending December 31st, 1898; I have not quite finished it, but practically the actual amount of over-stated outstandings as compared with the revenue books is £208,000—there is a little difference between Mr. Wood and myself; he includes' the dues of vessels in the docks on December 31st, but putting aside small matters of book-keeping, we do correspond—there is a deficiency of over 200.000—I do not know when Mr. Birt was appointed general manager, it was long before my time, I think it was about 1870, he was general manager then—I have gone into the company's accounts to ascertain the commissions that Mr. Birt got—for the year ending December, 1887, the commission actually paid was 1,583 128. 6d., calculated upon a sum of £79,181 8s. 4d., the amount overpaid that year on the basis of Mr. Wood's figures was £363 in 1888 he was overpaid</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think the cthareholders have had £200,000 more than they should have had by reason of these inflations; that is over the whole period—I was not connected with the company in its early stages—I be<lb/>lieve the company was started with the intention of purchasing land and reselling it at a profit after it had been turned into wharf frontage—I knew that they acquired 200 acres of land—I know that the company kept about 100 acres for their own purposes, and the remainder has been in part let on ground leases—the rental from it at present is between £7,000 and £8,000 a year—I heard that the directors resolved not to let the land at less than £200 an acre—I believe they have let about 20 acres; about 80 acres remain to be disposed of—the £7,000 or £8,000 a year includes the rental for the buildings on the land—I believe the land cost them £800 an acre; it was before my time—if the land has increased it undoubtedly would be of advantage to the company—they have been paying interest out of the revenue—I do not think they could properly put the increased figures from the value of the land as a revenue of the company; it would be an asset, but the company would be so much improved—no statement has been made to the shareholders with regard to that in the accounts submitted to them—I am quite sure nobody has made 1d. out of this matter—there is no question that it has been done with an idea of profit—on the profit and loss account on the balance sheet the inflated figures of outstandings appeared—if the inflation were £100,000 the commission would be twice as much as if it were only £50,000—the inflated profits of the company in 1888 were £156,000 and Mr. Birt got a commission on that, which he ought not to have done—the commission was paid twice a year—according to Mr. Wood's figures the total in<lb/>crease of Mr. Birt's commission is £2,700, that is from 1868; that would give him about £108 a year for 25 years—Mr. Birt's income up to the end of December, 1892, was £2,154; up to the end of 1891 it was £2,190—for 1890 up to December £2,175, and for the year ending in December, 1859, £2,110—he accepted the position of managing director and chairman at a salary of £2,000 a year, a sum lower by £150 than it had been during the last five years—from December, 1885, his income was £2,188; December, 1886, £2,126: December, 1887, £2,083; and Decem<lb/>ber, 1888, £2,185—Mr. Birt invested about £2,000 in the company, and he invested at the beginning of this year £167 in shares—he purchased shares from 1875 to 1899 and never sold any—I think he bought the ordinary shares in the company—I believe Mr. Birt had a current account with the company—there is a balance due to him on account of salary of £40 or £50.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">hefsexamined.</hi> Showing the increase of £200,000 would put up the shares of the company in the market—if a shareholder came in on the assumption that that sum could be paid for dividends, he would come in on a false assumption, as the earning power would be decreased to the extent of £200,000—the increased value of the land would not come into</p>

               <p>the revenue account, only into the capital account, but it never did go in; dividends would not be properly paid out of it—in June, 1898, the rent for land and buildings on it was £316,000 188. 2d.; that had nothing to do with the goods; out of the income there was sufficient to pay the debentures and something more—the commission paid to Mr. Birt would be paid upon the actual increase of each year, the overpaid commission would be upon the inflation of each particular year—if the inflation had been found out it would have to be debited to what we call the deficiency account; it would have been put against the profits—Mr. Birt never suggested that the inflation was due to the increased value of the land—I certified the balance-sheet, believing the figures were correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Further Cross-examined.</hi> In 1882, when Mr. Birt had a salary of £500, bis commission was £1,664. which made it up to £2,164—the dividend of the company in 1896 was 2 per cent.; in 1894, 2 1/2 per cent.; in 1892 it was 3 per cent; in 1890 it was 3 1/2 per cent.; in 1887, 4 1/2 per cent.</p>

I am a coachman, of 1A, Church Street, Homerton—on April 11th I went with two friends to the Black Swan at Bow, and saw the prisoner outside—I did not know him—he spoke to my friends, and we all four went in and had some drink—we remained there about half an hour, and then we all four went to Hackney in a cab—at 11.30 I left one of my friends behind and went to Abbey House, Stratford, with Williams—I had a gold watch, and the chain was showing—I went out into the street, and my friend locked the door, and the prisoner snatched my watch and chain and ran off—I ran the other way for a constable—I was sober—he said, "Clear off here, or I will shoot you"—I called 151 A', and returned with him to Abbey Lane and saw the prisoner in High Street, and gave him in custody—he handed the constable my watch and chain from his inside coat-pocket—they are worth £14 5s.—I had bought them the same day.</p>

Samuel Johnson and Co., Ltd.—on Saturday, April 22nd, I was returning from the bank at Stratford, carrying £150 in gold and silver in a black bag, to pay the men's wages, as I had done many times, taking the same route—I was in Carpenter's Road about 12.45 mid-day—within a few yards of the office-door I felt a violent blow on my head, and the bag was snatched—turning round, I saw three men; the prisoner was one—he had his hand uplifted with this piece of iron in it—he struck me with the iron—I was hurt, but I saw it meant robbery and tried to pull the bag from the man who held it—I received two more blows with the same instrument, and fell while endeavouring to get the bag—I saw the bag on the pavement and endeavoured to pick it up, when the prisoner dealt me a fourth blow, which I ran away from and called for help, and tried to attract the attention of a boy on a railway van, but failed—the place is lonely—I was taken to the West Ham Hospital, and afterwards to the Police-station at about 1.30, where I picked out the prisoner—my hat was cut through, and I received three nasty blows, and was not able to, return to business.</p>

I am a fishmonger, of 12, Station Road, Forest Gate—on March 24th, about 10 p.m., the prisoner came into my shop, called me on one side and said, "I am in a little bit of trouble; I want to sell my chain; my wife is confined; it is 18<lb/>carat gold, and marked in every link"—the watch was on it—I said, "How much do you want for it?"—he said, "£2 10s."—I said, "All right"—he said it belonged to his father—I believed what he said, and gave him £2 10s.—I found out that it was not gold—I met him in the Station Road, and said, "Ingram, that chain is not gold; it is brass"—he said, "Go on!

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's mother—he has always been a well-behaved and well-couducted son—he had an injury to his head when he was a boy—he has had fits—when he was employed at Maple's two years ago some ceiling fell on his head, and he had an accident on a railway—there was a change in his manner after that; he looked very vacant, and he would leave off doing things all of a sudden, and go and sit down—I have seen him since he has been in prison—he told me it was like a dream, and that his head was like as if it had been lifted off.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—he had a railway aocident in August—that was the same August when he went with the Volunteers—he had the injuries before he went to Aldershot—he went about three weeks after the accident—he was treated at the hospital—I do not know what he was doing at Aldershot, I did not know he was going—he was supposed to go and play in a cricket match at Woking—the injuries were principally to the big toe of his left foot; he had an abscess on his cheek, and his left arm began to swell—I first noticed a change in his manner after the accident; he seemed to be very vacant and strange—after the occurrence on April 18th he said to me, "Brave it out like an Englishwoman; the nation will look after you."</p>

                  </hi>. I am Medical Officer at Holloway Prison—since the prisoner has been there he has been under my care—he has been there since April 19th—I consider he is a man of weak mind—he had rather a confused recollection of the occurrence itself—his statements were con<lb/>fused—he said he acted on the impulse; that his wife had informed him that Mr. Carter had said something which he did not like—he did not suggest impropriety—the injuries he has received to his head would not improve his mental condition—I do not think he understood the act so fully as a person of a stronger mind would, but I think he knew right from wrong—I do not think a person in his state could form a lucid statement about the facts.</p>
