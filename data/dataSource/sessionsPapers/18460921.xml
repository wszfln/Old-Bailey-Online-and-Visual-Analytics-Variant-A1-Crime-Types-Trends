I have been in Court during part of the time the wit<lb/>nesses were examined—I went out when Worthington came in—I am a coach-maker, and live in Shouldham-street—I know Worthington perfectly well—I had known him since the beginning or latter end of last Feb.—about the 26th of May, about a quarter to seven o'clock in the morning, he came to me about this clarence—he wanted me to put on the back and the side-plates—he was indebted to me at the time—I said, "You have got a new clarence"—he said, "Yes, but I have not purchased it, it is on hire"—I thought he might pay me some of my account if he had purchased it—he had hired it at so much a month—Mr. Keene called on me in June—I had known him some time before as a money-lender—he came about the balance of an acceptance of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we went up to the public-house, and had something to drink together—I said I was going down to Oxford-square to Worthington—he said, "Did I know Worthington?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I am going down to my mother's, we will go together"—I said he had hired a clarence—he said, "I have not seen it"—he said, "I will go down the Mews first, do not take any notice of me, and I will come in afterwards and see the clarence," but it was not there—he wanted to see the one he had hired—I did not mention it to him to intimate that his circumstances were mending, that he might get some of hit debt—I did not know he was indebted to him—I said I was going down to Worthington, and he said, "Do you know Worthington? he owes me a good bit of money," and then I told him about the clarence—he said, "I will go down first, you pretend you have not seen me"—I went, and Keene let me in—Worthington came, looked into the coach-house, and then went in this way to me, as much as to say it was not there—he said, "What will you say old boy, will you go and have something to driuk?"—I said, "I don't mind;" and me, Keene, and Worthington went round to his mother's and had a pot of beer—Worthington drank and said he must go, for his old lady was out, and he must get something in—Keene said, "I cannot get anything out of the old devil now about the clarence;" and he and I stopped and had a pipe of tobacco together—he had not bought the clarence at that time—a day or two afterwards I again met Mr. Keene at Camden-town—he said, "Have you seen anything more of the clarence?"—I said, "No"—he said, "What do you think it is worth?"—I said, "100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "I must have that"—I said, "You may depend upon it there will be something wrong about it"—he said, "I will chance all that"—to convince myself it was on hire, for I knew it was one Morgan had bought, I went to Morgan to ascertain, because I thought Worthington was telling me an untruth—I did not believe he had hired it—I thought he had told me so to screen himself from paying me—Morgan showed me the agreement—I told Mr. Keene I had seen the agreement for the hiring of it, when I met him in Camden-town—I saw the agreement about four days after Whitsuntide—I should know it, for his name was on the right-hand side—to the best of my recollection this is it</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 27th of Aug. the prisoner came to me in the morning, and asked me if I would lend him half-a-crown—he said my husband told him the money was in a bag in the drawer—I went to the drawer, took out the bag, and gave him the money he wanted—he then asked me if I had a fourpenny piece—I emptied the money out of the bag on the table in the middle of my sitting-room, where the prisoner was—I said, "There is not a fourpenny piece"—he said, "Never mind, I must do without"—that was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning—I put the money in the bag again, and put it in the drawer—there was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I remember my husband paying some money to Mr. Knowles about eleven o'clock—I saw my husband take the money and put it into the drawer again—he then went out with Mr. Knowles—my husband came in to dine—I was then in the house, and my two children, and the baby in the cradle—I remained in the house from the time my husband went out at eleven o'clock till one o'clock, and no one had an opportunity of going to the drawer during that time—they could not without my knowing it—my boy is fourteen years old, my little girl is ten—the boy came home with his father to dinner, and after dinner he and his father went out—my son did not go into the bed-room, I am positive—when my husband and son left, there was me and the girl, ten years of age, and the baby in the house—I went out about one o'clock to take my father's dinner, who was at work in a field—I left my daughter Ann in the house, and the baby—before I went out, I shut and fastened the bed-room window, which is on the ground-floor—I then locked the bed-room door, and left home, leaving my little girl at home—I returned home about three o'clock, and was in the house from then till six—when I came home at three my husband was at home—the prisoner called again about six, and brought me the half-crown—I went to put it away where I took it from, and the bag was gone—when I came home at three my husband was at home, at the desk—he did not say anything to me about any loss—when he came home again afterwards, we had some discussion about a shilling, and discovered the loss of the bag—I did not observe whether the window was fastened as I had left it, when I came home at three—it had been open till I shut it up.</p>

On the 10th of May I went out for a short time, and left him alone in charge of the house—I returned soon after nine in the evening, and could not get in—I got a person to enter at the window and let me in—the prisoner was gone—he had been a month in my service—I went to my bureau, which I found locked as I had left it, but missed 4 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., notes and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, which I know was safe early in the day—I found the prisoner at Bow-street, a fortnight ago—I had given notice to the police directly I was robbed—I have seen two notes since, which I believe to be mine, but one I am certain about—I cannot swear to the number—I got the numbers from the gentleman who paid me them—I had received three from Mr. Beardmore, and the other from Scotland—I believe the one (16442) is one of the three.</p>

                  </hi>. I am not in any business—I live in Margaret-street, I Cavendish-square. About the middle of Feb. this year I was in the habit of transacting business with Fabian and Co., share agents, in the City—I did not usually go to their place of business—I met Fabian usually at the West India Coffee-house—I occasionally went to their counting-house, but more frequently to Garraway's—I was introduced to the prisoner at the counting-house, about six weeks after the first transaction with Fabian as likely to do business together, and they occupied this office—after that I raised money on certain scrip of the Buckinghamshire Railway—I acted for Mr. Fabian—I did not know Mr. Falkner—after I was introduced to Falkner I continued to raise money on these shares—I went to Worthing to Falkner on Good-Friday, and spent two days with him there, and we thought of going into some large business together, in the shipping way—that was my introduction to him—I did not have any communication with Falkner on the subject of the Buckingham shares—I paid the money I raised from time to time to Mr. Fabian, usually at the Hall of Commerce, at Garraway's, and at the Jamaica Coffee-house—I have left money at the counting-house, and have seen Mr. Fabian and Mr. Falkner in the office—I received the shares from, Fabian—he had offered me other shares, and I never would take them—I only took the Buckinghamshire shares—I did not receive any of those shares, I from Falkner, or in his presence, not for him to know anything about what we were doing—among other persons, I raised money frcm Mr. Killick on these shares—it must have been previous to May last, because it was one of my first transactions—there were three transactions with him—they were previous to the month of May—I cannot be certain whether those three transactions were before or after my meeting with Solomon; I can hardly say—about the 6th or 7th of May last, I think, this matter became the subject of inquiry—I think one of my transactions with Killick must have feen before that, before these parties were in custody—I do not know Mr. Beaton—I did not raise money of him by these shares—I know Mr. Solomon, the pro<lb/>secutor—he lives in Jermyn-street, St. James's—about the 6th of May I raised money from him on some of these Buckingham shares—it must been before the 6th of May—I acted for Mr. Fabian in raising that money from Mr. Solomons—I cannot positively say whether I was at Falkner and Fabian's office on the 6th of May—I was in the City that day, and saw Fabian—I cannot say whether I met him out of the office or in the office—I remember Mr. Fabian saying something about the urgent necessity of raising money before four o'clock—Mr. Fabian went with me westward—we took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> near the Bank—I do not think I saw Falkner that day before I took the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I dined with Falkner and Fabian after the transaction—I do not think I saw Mr. Falkner that day before the transaction—I cannot positively swear it, be<lb/>cause I spent the whole of that day nearly with Fabian—I cannot say I saw him that day, except at dinner—afterwards I went up with Fabian to Mr. Solomon's—I did not take any of the scrip with me—he had no scrip with him—we went to ask Mr. Solomon the question whether, if scrip was left, he would advance any more money that day—I do not think Falkner knew what Fabian was going to do, till we had ascertained whether money could he had that day or not—Mr. Solomon agreed to advance money if Mr. Fabian would get the shares—I waited there while Fabian went to procure the scrip—he re<lb/>turned with it—the transaction was completed by the advance of the money—I then left him till six o'clock, when I dined with them—Fabian then said some<lb/>thing about the money that had been obtained—I do not recollect what Faulkner said particularly—I have made a general statement of the whole tranaction</p>

                  </hi>. I am bar-maid at Mr. Gurney's, the Coachmaker's Arms, Marylebone. On Monday, the 17th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I was in the bar, attending to customers—(the prisoner came to the bar, and asked for a glass of spruce—I served him—it came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a sovereign—I examined it—I found it was a good one, and gave him six half-crowns, four shillings, two 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces, and four halfpence—he drank the spruce, and asked me if I could give him a half-sovereign instead of the silver—I gave him a good half-sovereign and he gave me four half-crowns—he then said he had some halfpence and wanted 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces, and putting 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I had given him, asked me for a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—in doing that his hand came near to where the half-sovereign was lying—it was on the same part of the counter—I gave him a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece for the halfpence—he then asked me to give him silver for the half-sovereign, which was then lying on the counter—I looked at it, and it was not the same I had given him—it was a bad one—it was much darker in colour, and had a smoother appearance than the one I had given him—I can swear it wai not the same—I said it was bad—he denied it being bad, he snatched it off the counter and left the house as soon as possible—the Sun and Sportsman in High-street is not more than ten minute's walk from our bouse.</p>

               <p>toward the Drummond-street gate, but he did not go out—he turned by an omnibus—I called out, "Stop the man with the white hat!"—I ran after him—he was stopped at the back of the first omnibus, and in front of the second—the conductor stopped him, with the constable Ings—I found upon him eight sovereigns, a twenty-franc piece, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, a halfpenny, and two rings—I received this purse from the <hi rend="italic">bussman</hi>, Irbey—from the time I saw the prisoner near Miss Lillywhite till I took him I did not lose sight of him once—I am quite positive be is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Captain Brownrigg, of Great Cumberland-street. About four o'clock in the afternoon of the 30th of Aug. my wife came to the house with a small child's chaise—If left it in the area with two shawls in it—soon afterwards the bell rang—I opened the door and found Wilson standing outside in the area—he asked me for relief and said he was in distress—I told him I could not relieve him, and I shut the door—I went to the area again in about five minutes and missed one of the shawls—I got my hat and went in the street, and in a short time I saw the prisoner together—I stopped them and told them I thought they had got something which did not belong to them—each of them said, "I have not"—I said, "I think you have, I shall call a policeman"—in a short time Robinson said, "You have got me into a nice mess," and Wilson said, "Give the man the shawl, and let us go"—I said, "I shall do no such thing" Robinson gave me the shawl—it is mine and the one I missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, employed at the Post-office. On the evening of the 2nd of Sept., in consequence of a message, I went to the letter-carriers' water-closet, and saw Tyrrell, the prisoner, and Craddock, who was holding the seat down, as, when the seat rises, the water in the upper basin flows into the trap—his keeping it down would retain the water in the upper bason—the bason did not contain anything—it does not contain any water at all—I searched the trap, and found these fragments of paper, and two pieces of card, which I handed over to Tyrrell—there was no other paper in the trap—it contains about half a gallon <hi rend="italic">of</hi> water—the paper was floating on the surface—in the ordinary course, unless the seat was pressed down, what was in the trap below would go away—it remains in the trap till</p>

On the 25th of Aug., about half-past four o'clock, I was on duty near Bethnal-green, and saw the prisoners and a woman, the wife of one of them, in Manchester-street—William appeared very tipsy—he was able to walk—the others not so much, but all had been drinking—I saw him jostle his arm against a door—I then told Reuben, his brother, if he did not go home quietly I must take them to the station—I told the woman the same thing several times—I understand she is William's wife—they then went up to the next door, Pardoe's—William knocked with his hand at the knocker, and began kicking—Mr. Pardoe opened the window and desired me <hi rend="italic">to</hi> take them in charge—I said, "Yes, and you come down to the station with me to complain against them"—he then put down the window—I took hold of William to take him away—he immediately raised his hand with hit fist clenched, and struck me a very violent blow on the eye, which knocked me back about two yards from him—I then put on my rattle to spring it—he raised his hand to strike me again and ran away—I ran after him some distance, springing my rattle—Hussey came up—I said, "This man has struck me"—he was then standing against a door—we both ran down towards him—he then ran out to strike us again with his hands clenched—when he came very near us I drew my staff, and as I ran in towards him he was going to strike me—he caught the staff and wrenched it out of my hand—I was about a yard from Hussey, who was going to take him—he struck Hussey upon the forehead—he first attempted to strike him with the staff—the blow knocked him down on the road—he got up in a short time—I did: not see anything happen to him while on the ground—I kept springing my rattle, but in a moment William Bray was on the ground, and Hussey over him—William had my staff—I went to get it out of his hand but could not—Reuben then came behind, collared me, and dragged me from him—no policeman came—I remained there five or ten minutes springing my rattle—I then ran off to the next beat to find the policeman—Hussey's face was covered with blood.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 30th of Aug., about half-past twelve o'clock, I returned home, and saw the prisoner at the street door—I was not sober—we had some words in play, and the prisoner began to be very spiteful—he laid hold of me sud<lb/>denly, and threw me down in the court—we were not at play then—I struck him, got up again, and stood at the door—he went down to the bottom of the court into Drury-lane—I went up stairs to bed—he followed me up five or ten minutes after—we had another scuffle up stairs in the room, and both fell—he began biting and scratching me—I then struck him several times with my open hand—I was going to turn him down stairs, but did not—I then found I was stabbed in my hand—he was going down stairs—I said, "You vaga<lb/>bond,</p>

                  </hi>. I am station-master at the Stratford station of the Eastern Counties Railway. On the 18th of July, I was in attendant there—I have been seven years in the company's service—I remember the arrival of the Ipswich up passenger train that day—according to our regulation that train would have become due at Stratford at four minutes to four o'clock in the afternoon—it arrived as near as I am able to state at nine or ten minutes past four, but I am not able to state positively—I think it was near about ten or twelve minutes late—it consisted of ten or eleven carriages—the hinder one a second class passenger carriage—the time for it to stay in our station depends on whether we have many passengers and luggage to get out—sometimes a minute, sometimes not so long, sometimes two minutes—they were in the act of taking in water at the time of the accident—I should think it had not been there a minute when I looked down the line to rear of the train and saw the engine and trucks coming in between the signal and the passenger train—I saw them come towards me after they passed the signal—at that time the signal was down as it is now on this model—it was painted like this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—that indicates that the line is clear, and when there is anything to stop it you drop it—when it is placed in an inter<lb/>mediate state the train should approach cautiously for 100 yards past the signal—unless an indication is then given by a man there that the line is clear, and then they may come up as far as the station—it indicates that caution is necessary, and that being done they must stop instantly—when I saw the train approaching the signal was down—I did not see it down before the truck-train arrived—it had been down not long before the passenger-train arrived—as near as I can say the train was approaching at the rate of ten, eleven, or twelve miles an hour, but I am not competent to say the exact speed—I did not see whether the steam was escaping—I ran up by the side of the engine of the passenger-train as fast as I could, calling out to the driver, "Go</p>

               <p>on, go on," in order that he might get on the move, and that concussion might not be so great, but that was found impracticable, and the engine with the trucks came on the hinder part of the passenger-train—a great deal of mischief was done, many persons were injured, Mr. Hind among the number—to the best of my knowledge I have known the prisoner about three years, or longer perhaps—I cannot say to a certainty—I have seen him coming from the yard and on an engine as driver.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been at Stratford all the seven years you have been in the employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, during six years—the number of persons stationed there has been reduced, I cannot say precisely when—I think there was a reduction of a man or two about two years ago, but I cannot exactly be positive—I believe one of the men was the clerk, and I believe a porter as well—I am not aware that there has been any reduction since that time—we have had an increase since that, a few months before the accident, and I have always been at liberty to employ an extra hand—I believe the prisoner has been engaged by the company something more than a twelvemonth, but cannot be positive—he drove Mr. Jacksoa's goods-train—that was not on the Cambridge line, but on the Colchester—I cannot say how many times he has driven—I do not know that he has driven only twice before this—I believe he was engaged as an engine-fitter, but I have nothing to do with him—I can see he is a one-eyed man—the regular signal-man was not at his station at the time the passenger-train from Ipswich came up, but a lad, or I may say a man, eighteen years of age, had been appointed by me to attend to the signal in his place—the signal-man was engaged in some other matter, and I sent the lad Unwin to attend to the signal—a few minutes previous to the passenger-train arriving I saw him sitting on the handle which works the signal, with his back the country way, and his face looking towards London—his back was to the country where the train was coming from—I directly requested him to torn his face, and pay proper attention to the signal—I should say that was four or five minutes before the train came up—I will not undertake to swear that positively, but think I might safely—as near as I can say, the train was ten or twelve minutes late—I do not think it was a quarter of an hour—I might have sent the boy to the signal-station about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before—I will swear it was five minutes before—I will not say it was more than five minutes—I must have sent him to the signal-post before the train was due, or else he would not have been there, because when I came out to look for the Ipswich passenger-train I saw him there—that might have been after the train was due.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you send him there <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A few minutes before—I had appointed him to go to the signal to attend to it—then I went into my own office again, came out again to look at the cattle which were being un<lb/>loaded on the opposite side, and saw Unwin sitting on the handle windlass, and cautioned him to pay proper attention to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>signal before four o'clock—I am sure I told him to mind the signal—it was then down, because we had got an obstruction on the line near the junction—the engine had been going across towards the junction—there was coal car<lb/>rying, and so on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the signal was down there was nothing for him to do if he had seen the train coming? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He would have raised one fan to let it pass to come up to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The prisoner was driving this truck-train, was it his duty to stop at this station at all, or was he to go on to the junction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If he was going to London it was his duty to come cautiously by there—I am not aware whether he had any instructions to stop at the Stratford station or not—I do not know that he had not—we have books with rules and regula<lb/>tions in them—I cannot say that the prisoner had one—I do not know whe<lb/>ther there is a signal at the Forest-gate station—that station is somewhere about a mile from the Stratford station—I have my duty to attend to at my own station—when I told the passenger train to go on, the engine-man was standing taking in water—he did not stir that I saw, till he was knocked off—the steam was blowing off, and I do not believe he could hear me shouting—there were several other carriages damaged besides the one in question, but the one next the engine was completely knocked to splinters—it had been put on I think at Romford—it was an extra one—I was not aware that there was a truck train coming up, or that one was expected—it has been the custom if an extra train was coming from Colchester to hang on a red board—I saw none on this occasion—I do not know whether there has been one extra man or two at the Stratford station since the accident, but I think only one—there is a new station signal—that has been put up on the opposite side of the line—there are two now, but the one is not worked—a new one is substi<lb/>tuted for the old one on the opposite side of the line—I believe you can see the new one thirty or forty yards farther than the old one—between the signal and the Forest-gate station there are two bridges, and a sharpish curve from the signal till you get through the first bridge—it is a heavyish bend—I do not know who set the prisoner to drive that day—I merely know Quinlan by seeing him once or twice—he was sent with the prisoner on this occasion as stoker—the trains pass under the two bridges—to a certain degree they would obstruct the sight—the signal is not seen so far, on account of the curve—it was part of Quinlan's duty to look out as well as the man that drives the engine—I never knew him act as stoker before—I believe he it Employed in the shops among the engines, on such work as they might please to put him—that is as far as I know—I do not know that it is the practice on railways when a young hand is put on an engine to take care that he has a competent fireman or stoker—I have no practice at the engines—I should think that was necessary—there was no guard that I am aware of with this truck train—it is the general course to have a guard to the train whether a passenger or truck train—I cannot tell whether the "Firefly has a reverse action—it is more usual in a goods train to have a break at the end of the train as well as at the engine—I cannot tell whether the break behind acts twice as powerfully as the break in front—I am not a practical man—I have trusted myself on an engine on this line, and I hope I shall again—there is no policeman at the Stratford station—we occasionally have a man to show the hand signal—we have the same man to show that that attends to the other signal—that is Green—he was attending to the cattle train—we do not use the hand signal when the regular signal is put out—it is useless, because one signal is sufficient if it can be seen, but in the absence of that if a man cannot get to use that signal, or on any part of the line, where he could not see</p>

               <p>it, he would use his hands—it is not usual on this line to exhibit a hand-signal in addition to the other—I do not think it is necessary—one signal of that kind is sufficient—that signal had been out of order, but I cannot tell how lately before I put the boy on it—it might have been a week—I cannot tell whether it was four days or two—I know it was in working order when this occurred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you went to the boy did you notice the signal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was down as this is now, I cannot say that I saw an alteration made by the boy before the passenger-train arrived—the obstruction on the line which caused it to be down, was, I believe, an engine crossing from the Blackwall coal line, and there might have been some trucks on the main line near the junction—it was of a temporary nature, it was on the London side of the station—we in general, as soon as we see the passenger-train coming, if there is an obstruction above the station, merely use one fan to caution them to approach slowly—there was nothing at this time to prevent the passenger-train coming to the station, but only to show that it was necessary to come slowly, the fan should be dropped directly the last carriage has passed the signal-post—when I looked in that direction, and saw the engine and carriages coming, I am certain it was down—the custom of putting a red board at the end of a train to indicate that a special train is coming, applies to a special train only—we call a train that is going on special business a special train—you may say these empty trucks are within the meaning of that rule, it was an extra train—if there had been a red board at the end of this pas<lb/>senger-train from Ipswich I could not have done more than I did by dropping the signal—no person in my place could have done more than was done.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eighteen years old. On the day of the accident at Stratford I was in the service of the Eastern Counties Railway Company. On that afternoon I had directions from Mr. Richardson, in consequence of which I went down the line to the windlas, and dropped the signal—that was because a passenger-train from Ipswich had arrived—Mr. Richardson did not come up and speak to me while I was at the windlas—as soon as I saw the passenger-train I pulled up one fan, and on the one fan being pulled up the passenger-train passed up to the station—after it had passed I lowered down the other fan, and let the whole fan down immediately after the last carriage had passed the signal—that was before the passenger-train had actually stopped—I noticed an engine come up about a minute afterwards—I had let down the fan before I saw that engine—that engine ran, into the passenger-train—I had not time to see whether it slackened at all while I was noticing it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am out of business—I have been a draper—I live at Stratford—I am quite unconnected with the Eastern Counties Railway—I know Maryland-point bridge, it is the second bridge down from the Strat<lb/>ford station. On the day of the accident, about five minutes past four o'clock, I was crossing that bridge, and could see the signal at the Stratford station quite plainly—I mean the signal on the down side that stops the passenger-trains there—when I first saw it, it was quite down as this model is now—I heard a passenger-train coming up, I waited about a minute, and there was one fan pulled up—the train passed the signal-post, and immediately the fan was let down again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a guard in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway Company. On the 18th July, I was guard of the one o'clock train coming up from Ipswich—the time at London was ten minutes after four, and at Stratford fifty-six minutes past three—we left Ipswich at one o'clock—we got to Romford at forty-six minutes past three, that was thirty-four minutes after the time—while we were there, I saw an engine on the down line—the prisoner was on it—I do not know that he could well avoid seeing my train go up, because we nearly touched—we passed him there, and left him behind us—our next stoppage was at Ilford—we got there at fifty-seven minutes past three—we gained two minutes between Romford and Ilford—we are allowed nine minutes in doing that space—we did it in ten—we left there at fifty-eight minutes past three—we did not stop again till we got to Stratford—before getting there was a signal made—that signal denotes danger when all the fans are down—we must not approach it then—when we passed it, three fans were down—that indicated that we were to approach cautiously, to take great care—we did so—we always prepare for that signal at Stratford, particularly on Saturday, because of there being so much cattle there un<lb/>loading—I suppose that was known to the persons employed about the Strat<lb/>ford station—having arrived at the station, we stopped, and were taking in water—the engineer takes in water there when he requires it—sometimes we take in water there, and sometimes not—after we had been there about two minutes, there was a collision—the prisoner was driving the engine that came into the hinder carriages—I knew his person, but not his name—the collision was principally with the last carriage which had been put on at Brentwood—that is the station beyond Romford, eighteen miles from London—there were a great many passengers at Brentwood—the stoppage to put on the carriage occasioned some delay there.</p>

               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">BROWN</hi>. I live at Tottenham, and was formerly in connection with Mr. Jackson, a contractor—from 1843 to 1845 we contracted for the con<lb/>veyance of goods along this line from Shoreditch to Bishops-Stortford and Hertford—I know the prisoner very well—he was employed by us in 1844 as a fitter for about six months, and subsequently to that he became one of our engine-drivers, and continued so until the contract ceased in Nov., 1845—he was employed daily as engine-driver about nine months along the whole line from Shoreditch to Bishops-Stortford—I very often travelled with him on the engine—I always considered him a careful person—he appeared quite competent to do all he had to perform, and to understand the signals in every respect—I have taken notice of the signals on the line, and that he regularly obeyed them—I never knew the prisoner to disobey them.</p>

The signal there is of the same kind as at Stratford represented by this model—the one o'clock Ipswich train was due at my station on the day of the accident, at forty—six minutes past three o'clock—no other up—train is due at my station till five minutes to six—on the arrival of the one o'clock train, I lowered my signal, as this model is now—while the train was there, and the signal in that state, I observed an engine coming up with some trucks—it blew the whistle, and ultimately stopped—five minutes after the passenger—train had left my station, I raised one of the fans in this manner, as a caution to go slowly, as there was a train in advance—that appeared to be understood, and acted upon by the engine—driver coming up—they came up slowly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At first you said you stopped them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at first, and then after they had remained five minutes after the Ipswich train had gone on I lifted up the fan because the Ipswich train had not long gone on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi>, If you had hung on your red board, would not the Forest—I pate man, when he saw the Ipswich train pass, come out and hold up his I flag? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would have been the case, but we do not do so with ordioajft I trains, only with special, or extra trains—this Fire-fly engine was aa I extra train, but we were not aware that it was coming until it approached I the station—that train and the Ipswich up—train were at the station together I——we did not hang a red board on it, because it is not the rule—I cannot say why it is not the rule—if the board had been hung up, it would have certified at Forest-gate that a train was following, the driver of the second train being at the place at the same time as the first train, would know that there was a I train before him</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the Stratford signal, some time before this accident, reported to you as. being unfit in its position? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well I cannot recollect that exactly—the matter had been talked over, and the new signal was in the course of being fixed, and was nearly fixed on the Cambridge line when this accident happened—I will not say that the drivers on the line have not reported</p>

                  </hi>. I am the resident engineer on the Eastern Counties Railway. I prepared this plan—it is a correct representation of the part of the line where this accident happened—it was prepared under my direction, to show the working of the signals—it does not show the curve—it was made to a scale—there are two bridges before leaving the Stratford station—this signal (<hi rend="italic">looking at the plan</hi>) was about 259 yards from the hindmost—carriage at the station where the train stopped—it can be seen by the engine-driver, if he keeps a proper look-out, at a distance of 479 yards—more than a quarter of a mile—the point A in the plan is the spot from which you can first see the iighal, that is, at a distance of 220 yards from the signal; and from B, where the signal is, to-C, where the station is, is 259 yards—you can see the signal from the windlass.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARXSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you quite sore of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have tried it since the accident—I was not quite certain before—there is a curve between the signal and the windlass of a radius of about a mile, and there are two bridges intervening—the white part shows itself to the man at the windlass—he could only see from the form of the fan whether all the fens were down or not—he could not possibly mistake one fan being down for two—the signal has never been out of order since I have been there—I have been there since the 1st of Jan.—I believe the windlass is not above ten yards from the station, but I cannot speak positively; 1 have never measured it—it has never been reported to me that the drivers have made complaints of the signals at Stratford being dangerous—if it was a subject-matter of com<lb/>plaint to Mr. Scott, he never communicated it to me—I do not consider it a dangerous part of the line? not a bit more dangerous than any other part—I do not consider it safe for a train of trucks to go without a guard, or without a hind break—it may be safe without, because many trains do go so, and no accident occurs; but, in my judgment, I believe that it is inconsistent with safety, or rather, that we run a risk in tending out a train without a bind break.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will a break on an empty truck at the end have much effect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would have very little effect in stopping the train—the effect of a break depends a good deal or mainly dh the weight of the carriages—the weight naturally increasing the friction—two of these trucks contained some iron.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What quantity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not measure; I cannot tell—they were in the centre of the train when I saw it—I should consider it running a risk to send out a tram, either full or empty, without a hind break—this model is a twelfth part of the real size—the Forest—gate station was not completed when this accident happened—I am not aware that it was opened long before it was completed—it may have been open to the public</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184609210082"/>
               <p>about two months before the accident, but I cannot speak to that—I do not know that I swore so before the Magistrate or Coroner—I gave it as a matter of opinion, I rather think—the Forest-gate station was provided with the usual white, red, and green flags—there was, I believe, a man appointed to use them—the station—master has the charge of the station—it is a very unimportant station—the station—master ought to be able to do his duty wholly without the signals—it is so small a station that he would be able to do without, but he has flags—if he bad used his flags on this occasion it ought to have prevented the accident—it would have made it tenfold less likely—if the man at Forest-gate station, when he saw the Ipswich train pass, had held out his flag, he might have prevented this train coming—if there are no signals exhibited at the station, it is reasonably inferred that the line is clear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that is the case with respect to a special train, a train that is not expected? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With respect to any train, I should say it would—if there was no danger signal shown I should think the driver would imagine the line was clear, if he had not seen the train previously at Ilferi, which he had—it would show the line was clear till he came to a danger signal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has not the signal at the Stratford station been re<lb/>moved? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has not—there has been another placed in another position—the old one remains, but is not used now—it was the intention of the directors to do so before the accident—they considered it better to have a uniform signal than to have a variety—that was the only reason—I was not in Coart when Scott was examined—I do not know that the alteration of signals has been on account of the repeated complaints of the drivers—I consider tke position on this side safer than the other—the signals are the same as 01 other lines—some railways have adopted the same signals, and some have not—it is becoming pretty general—men from any other line would understand the signals—it is one arm, a semi—colon—we had three different sets of sigoalt including this—that is enough, if they are perfectly understood—I do not know any mode by which a man may understand them, if he has only beea on the line twice before, and had no book of rules and regulations given him—the driver of an engine would be discharged if he did not obey orders.</p>

                  </hi>. I am captain in the engineers, and am attached to the railway department of the Board of Trade—on the Tuesday after this ac<lb/>cident I went down to Ilford, and took the engine and train—I first examined the station and signal at the Stratford station—the windlass which works the signal is within a few yards of the station—that is the correct mode of work<lb/>ing it—the signal can be seen from the windlass—I did not take the measui ments myself, but I had them taken at the time and reported to me—tto measurements given in evidence are correct—the signals on the Ilford lio be perfectly seen for 200 yards—it was with a view of testing whether a sufficient distance to enable a person of competent skill to stop the train</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184609210083"/>
               <p>that I went with the train—I went with the "Fire-fly," and I understand the same trucks, that had been used on the Saturday—I rode down to Ilford station on the opposite side of the rails, and then I tried the train on the up line, and gave the engine-driver his directions, as we were going under a bridge, to proceed without any previous concert—I directed him suddenly to stop the train—at that time we were going at the rate of twenty-fire miles an hour, as near as I can judge—I noticed the point at the time I gave the direction because it was while passing under a bridge, and I measured the distance from the bridge to the point when the engine came to a final rest—it was 445 yards from the bridge—the inclination was rather descending—it waa unfavourable for stopping—it was done simply by applying the break—I then proceeded on my journey—I had stationed a man with a red flag, as a mark for myself—at the time we approached him, we were going at the rate of about thirty miles an hour—when I got opposite the man, I shut off the steam again, and gave the engine—driver directions to stop the train—I stopped it by the break alone—at the time the steam was shut off, we were descending slightly; but before the engine came to a final rest we were ascending slightly—we stopped at a distance of 468 yards, then returned to Ilford, and came on from Ilford towards London at the rate of not less than thirty miles an hour—rather ex ceeding that when we came near Stratford—I saw the Stratford signal, and knew exactly the distance I was coming, and stationed a man—we did the last half mile in fifty—eight seconds—on seeing the signal, I shut off the steam, stopped the engines, reversed it also—it stopped from ten to twelve yards short of the station—we were then going at the rate of upwards of thirty miles an hour—I was going at full speed at the time I saw the signal—we stopped twenty or thirty yards before coming to the Angel-lane-bridge—we stopped within a yard or two of the same place we stopped at before—the engine stopped directly under the bridge—the inclination is ascending at the Stratford station—we were going a little faster then than the last time we stopped, and a shower of rain came on in the interval, which gave less adhe<lb/>sion to the rails—I believe the exact inclination is I in 330—it is a slight inclination—the curve slightly favours the stopping—when I applied the break I watched its effect on the wheels, to ascertain whether it was acting properly—it was sufficiently powerful to lock four of the wheels out of the ten, and the other six were revolving very slowly—the four were at a dead lock—on the last of these occasions I reversed the engine—the reversing gear acted—I watched to see while the driver's head was turned in an opposite direction, and it did act at once, and applied instantly—I am sufficiently an engi<lb/>neer to draw an inference from a plain fact—I am acquainted with the acting of locomotives, and the arrangements of railways—I have been two years an inspector of the Board of Trade, and was sent down for the purpose of making this examination—if the train had been going at fifteen or twenty miles an hour it would have stopped in a very much shorter space—the signal cannot be seen farther than 240 yards—it makes its appearance under the bridge—it is hidden by the masonry I think that an unfavourable circumstance—the line curves round.</p>

CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who was the engine-driver that went with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—there were five on the engine—Mr. Samuel, the resident engineer of the line, was one, and a person, I am not sure whether it was Mr. Scott or not, the fireman, and myself—while the engine was going at the pace I mention I was on the look-out to see where I could get the first sight of the signal—I was not driving—my attention was directed to seeing the signal—I did not stoop down to see it—I did not stand erect—I stood about so, for the rays were very strong, and I had my hand</p>

               <p>up to ray face, and then I saw it unxter the briflge—it was on the left hand side—I had to look to the left side of the line, not exactly straight before me—I think a break is of use in stopping a train—I have seen many other ling—it depends on the extent of the train whether they send out one or two guards—I think the competency of a driver ought to be ascertained—when a man is sent on a strange line I think they ought to send a competent engineer or fireman with him—he should have the assistance of a competent person until he becomes acquainted with it—I should not expect a man to he acquainted with a line 100 miles long in three drives—I should not be afraid to go on a line of twenty miles length after three times—I should not like ta undertake to drive an engine at all—it is not my business—a great many lines have figures as signals of danger, and also fans—they are to be put into the hands of the engine-drivers—there should be a book, not only with written instructions, but with coloured representations of the signals—that is quite necessary for safety—they have hand signals to use in case of danger—they ought to be used at every intermediate station if a train has just gone by—they are generally used as supplementary signals—if they have no othei means of communication, they should present the hand signals to the ap<lb/>proaching train to stop it for five or ten minutes, according to the Company's regulation—I afterwards went to Forest-gate station—it is a mile from Strat<lb/>ford—if the man at the Forest—gate station had presented the green flag wben he saw the truck train coming I do not see that it would have prevented the accident—I think the man at the Forest—gate station neglected his duty in not throwing out a signal.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would that necessarily have prevented the accident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, there was another signal before the man arrived at the Stratford station—if he had seen the signal, and attended to it, the accident might not have happened—I should consider twenty or thirty miles an hour a very unusual pace for a train of this description.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. Is it a matter of economy to go slower? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is, and for Ail reason, upon railways where they do not want to go fast for passenger-trains, they go slow—an increase of speed is a considerable increase of cost to the company—thirty miles an hour would be much dearer to the company thai fifteen—it is a general practice among companies not to adopt great sped when it is not wanted.</p>

I missed from a drawer in my bed-room a silver watch—I had seen it safe at half-past five o'clock in the morning—it belonged to John Crew, a friend of mine—I had been commissioned to have a glass put to it—this is it—I know it by the name of Griffiths on the dial and on the plate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of the late Thomas Parker, and live in Whitechapel-road, and keep a beer-shop: On the 15th of Aug. I saw the prisoner at our house—I cannot tell the time, for since this happened my memory has been much impaired—it was between breakfast and tea-time—Yates was in the shop at the time—the prisoner had two baskets, one with herbs, and the other with black-coloured berries and a few nuts—I think there were nearly two gallons of black-coloured berries—they were round like black currants—they were like these now produced, but were quite fresh—when they are broken they are full of small seeds—I asked him what they were—he said they were, as I understood, nettle-berries—whether he said "wortle" or "nettle I cannot say—I said I had never seen them before, although I had lived u the country—he told me they were beautiful for eating, for tarts, puddings, or wine, better than black currants—I bought a pint for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and picked the stalks</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184609210093"/>
               <p>off them in his presence—he said sometimes he got them from the Surrey-hills but these he had fetched a long distance—he entered into conversation with Yates—I made a tart of them next day, of which both me and my husband partook—my husband very soon became drowsy—he went into the bar parlour and sat down—I made him a cup of tea—he took a very little of it—this was not more than half an hour after dinner—I experienced the same effect myself—my husband was taken up stairs—I afterwards heard him moaning—I went up, and his mouth was foaming—I sent for a doctor—I was afterwards taken ill myself—we were both taken to the London Hospital, but I was insensible—my husband expired the next morning, about ten o'clock.</p>

I was acting as apothecary at the London Hospital when the deceased was brought there—he appeared to be labouring under the effect of narcotic poison, and the symptoms were as if he had taken <hi rend="italic">airofa-belladonna</hi>, as he had a remarkably dilated pupil and was frequently catching at objects, and his pulse was much accelerated, his face congested, and he was somewhat comatose—these were symptoms of his having taken <hi rend="italic">airopa-belladonna</hi>—I made him vomit, and found from twelve to a score of the <hi rend="italic">atropa-belladonna</hi> came from his stomach—the berries now produced are of the same description—he died in the hospital, and I have not the least doubt from the effect of that poison.</p>

I was at Mrs. Parker's beer-shop, and saw the prisoner there—it was after my dinner, but I cannot state the hour—I thought it was between two and four o'clock—I usually dine at one o'clock—I consider it was half an hour after dinner or three-quarters—he told me these were hoccle-berries, that he got them about sixteen miles from London—I asked him if they were sweet—he said they were perfectly sweet—he said they were fit for making wine, or tarts—I said, "I am a countryman, and never saw such berries, but I will take one"—he gave me two—I ate part of one, and the other next morning—it produced a very nasty bitter afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Newton, a butcher, at Hackney. On the 5th of Sept., my little boy took out a goat's-chain to play with—I heard that there had been a dispute between him and the prisoner about the chain—I went to the prisoner's house—he was not at home—when he came home I asked him for the chain—he said I should not have it—he should not give it up till my little boy had given him a book which belonged to his boy—I said I had not seen a book, but if there was such a thing I would give it up when I got home—I have never seen it—he told me to get out of his house—I was standing in the passage of the house at the front door—he only occupied two rooms—other persons have a right <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the passage as well as he—I was not in his room—I said I should not go till I got the chain—he laid hold of my arms, put his nails into my arms, and pushed me against the wall twice—he then threw his arms round my neck, threw me against the wainscot, and then kicked me in my back while I was on the floor—Mr. Hockley's sisters were there—some one rose me up by my gown, and some one said, "Get up you b—, you are not hurt"—Hockley put his arms round me, and took me to my door—two females put me out of the door, not the prisoner—I was thrown down a second time by the prisoner, and kicked in the body, but I do not know who by—I was senseless—I was carried home, and a doctor was sent for.</p>

On the 5th of Sept., about ten minutes to one o'clock, I was coming out of my house, which is in the same street as the prisoner lives—I saw several people, and heard a cry of "Murder!" I went, and saw Mrs. Newton standing against the wainscot in the prisoner's passage, crying and moaning, as if she was seriously hurt—I had scarcely been there a minute when the prisoner came, took her by both arms, and gave her a severe shaking—he threw her down and kicked her several times in the lower part of her stomach—that was the second attack—I did not see the first—a man was heard coming down stairs, and the prisoner then caught hold trf her, pushed her out into the street, took her about two or three houses off, and left her there—I saw the prisoner talking to two or three persons afterwards—he smiled, and seemed to make a deal of fun about</p>

On the 5th of Sept., by Sergeant Hockley's request, I went to Mrs. Newton—she wasjnst recovering from syncope, from excess of pain—on examination, I found on the left side of the abdomen great tumefaction—her arms appeared as if a person had nipped them with his nails—it is most likely kicks or blows produced the wounds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a glass-blower, and live in Rosemary-lane. On the night of the 5th of Sept. I was at the Nag's Head, on Tower-hill, between asleep and awake—I had been drinking, bat was not the worse for liquor at all—I had my head on the table—I had two half-crowns in my pocket—I felt a person's hand in my pocket—I awoke up, and saw the prisoner not more than two yards from me—she moved to the other side of the room—I had not seen her there before I went to sleep—I saw two half-crowns in the prisoner's hand, I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my money—I spoke to the prisoner about it—she used very abusive language, and would not give it up—she made for the door, and said she would call a constable—we both walked together out of the house, and met a constable at the corner of the Minories—neither of us called him—I have seen the prisoner at the house before—there was another girl or two there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 78, Chiswell-street. The prisoner has been in my service nearly four years—on the 10th of Aug. he gave me notice to leave my service, for some reason about the housekeeper—I said I would endeavour to make all right, but he insisted on leaving—on the 19th of Aug., in consequence of information, I told him I was fearful matters were not altogether right, and I wished to know whether he had anything belonging to my stock, which he had not accounted for—he said all that he had had he had accounted for to Mr. Norris, my foreman—Mr. Norris was present, and said he had no account of anything that he had had from the stock—I said to the prisoner, "Have you a watch?"—(I saw he had one wearing in his waistcoat—pocket)—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Let me see it"—he produced it, and I recognized it as one taken from my stock—I said, "That watch is a portion of my stock; you had better give it to Mr. Norris"—that was all that transpired with reference to the watch—I asked Norris if he knew anything of the prisoner having the watch—he said no, there was no account of it at all—the prisoner remained perfectly silent—I told him I could not suffer him to be in my house another night, to go home, and return with his father the following morning, and we would examine the various articles in his presence—on the following day he did not come, but his father came two or three times—on the 21st his father came again, but still without the prisoner—I sent Norris to the station, to get an officer, and go to his father's house—they returned that afternoon with the prisoner—I told the prisoner I wished his box to be searched, as there was an officer present, was he agreeable to it?—he said, "Yes"—we went up to his bed-room, where there is a chest of drawers, one or two drawers of which he occupied; and there was a small box in the room be<lb/>longing to him—in the box we found a pocket—book, containing some du<lb/>plicates and a few odd papers—I saw the pocket-book opened, and saw the duplicates—when goods are redeemed, we are required to indorse the amount of the interest on the duplicates, and I see on these duplicates the amount of the interest is indorsed—when goods are redeemed, it is the duty of the per<lb/>son in my employ to deposit the duplicates first in a drawer in the shop—in the evening an account is made up of the business that has been done, which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184609210112"/>
               <p>is done by looking at the amount on the duplicates—one of these duplicate is for a gold guard, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; another, for Wellington boots; and another, for a ring; and here are the corresponding duplicates with them, which denoted the redemption of these things—here is one single duplicate of a shawl, for 5s,—after the accounts are made out, it is the person's duty to mark off the redemption in the book, and to file the duplicates; they are kept in case we want to refer to them, and to show that the articles have been redeemed—neither of these duplicates have been filed—I do not recollect that I said anything to the prisoner about these duplicates When they were found in the pocket—book, and I think he did not make any remark—we then looked amongst his clothes in the drawers—we found a cigar-case and a waistcoat, which were mine—there was another box belonging to him, in another port of the house—I saw that forced open by the policeman, and in it were several books, a sheet, a small case of teeth instruments, a parallel pen, a ruler, and several other articles—he said he placed the sheet there for the purpose of getting it washed; and two of the books he spoke of, as having picked them up in the parlour or counting-house—the value of these things, exclusive of the duplicates, is about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to the prosecutor—in consequence of some suspicion I entertained, I made a communication to Mr. Sowerby on Wed<lb/>nesday evening, the 19th of Aug.—I was present when he asked the prison if he had had anything from the stock that he did not know of—the pri<lb/>soner said, "No, I have not"—I heard him asked if he had a watch in his pocket—he said, "Yes," and produced it—Mr. Sowerby asked me if I was conscious of his having it—the prisoner said no, I was not—I was not con<lb/>scious of it at all—Mr. Sowerby told him to give up the watch to me, and he did so—Mr. Sowerby then desired him to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> home, and come the next day with his father—his father came the next day, and on the third day, and Mr. Sowerby desired me to accompany an officer to his house—I went there and</p>

I have been in the Grenadier Guards—I left on the 15th of Aug., and on the 17th, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in St. Ann's—street, Westminster, with three or four persons—one woman was with me, and one with another man, close by me—I was talking to the woman in the middle of the street—the prisoner Toy told us we could not stand there—I said I always understood we might stand in the public street or highway, and I thought the public street was the same—she insulted my friend, and called her a dirty w——she came out of the door—I caught hold of her by the arm as she was coming towards Goldsmith, who was in my company—then the prisoner Brown came—I caught hold of him by the arm—he closed with me, threw me, and began kicking me—I did not see Adams at that time—there were others came to their assistance, they ill—used me and kicked me—Adams and Murden came up afterwards while they were beating me—Brown took my watch out of my pocket and gave it to Adams, who ran away with it to the public-house—they were beating me at the time—Toy took my handkerchief off my neck—she bit my eye, and cut me with a poker alongside the face—there was another female, who is not in custody—the prisoners were all present—some people came to my assistance, and I got from them—I ran to the public-house door after my property—the door was slammed in my face—I was then knocked down again, kicked, and jumped on—I was sober—I received a cut on the back of my head, and my loins were hurt—I was ill for some time, and am not well now, and never shall be—I was very severely injured.</p>

I am married, and live in St. Ann's-street—the prosecutor Deane does not live at the house now—he did at that time—on the 17th of Aug., about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in St. Ann's-street talking to Dean, opposite the house where Brown and Toy live—Toy came out and used bad language, and asked what we were standing talking in front of her door for—Dean said he thought anybody was allowed to stand in the King's higway—she then made a blow at me, and asked me to fight—Dean put me on one side and her on the other to keep us away—he did not strike her—Brown then ran and struck Dean—I saw Dean knocked down several times and kicked and ill-used, and Toy ran out, laid hold of the hair of his head, and dragged his handkerchief off his neck, and I took it out of her hand—I afterwards saw Adams going towards the Elms with a black rib<lb/>bon belonging to the watch in his hand—I did not see the watch, but I knew the ribbon—I had seen it on Dean's watch several times—I gave the hand<lb/>kerchief I took from Toy to my son John Harding—after I saw Adams going away with the watch I saw Murden in the mob, but did not see him strike or kick—there was a great deal of confusion—I could hardly tell who was striking and who was not—both Brown and Adams were on the ground with Dean—they were near enough for one to hand anything to the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father and mother in Great St. Ann-street. On the 17th of Aug. I was looking out of the window, and saw Dean come by, talking to two females—Mrs. Goldsmith went on, not above half a yard from him—he was talking to the other young woman—the prisoner, Toy, called the woman very bad names, and said, "Go along from my door"—Dean said he would not, he was allowed to stand and speak on the highway—Toy stood up to Mrs. Goldsmith, and said, "Do you want to fight?"—Dean said, "No, she is not in the humour for fighting"—Toy said, "If you are not, I am;" and struck her twice—the second blow knocked her down—I did not see Mr. Goldsmith there at the time—when Mrs. Goldsmith was down, Toy was on the top of her, beating her with her fist—Dean went to pick her up—he was keeping Toy off with his hands, and while he was stooping, Brown ran out, and said, "Will you strike her?" and before Dean could answer him, Brown knocked him down—he rolled on his back, and Brown and Toy were beating him; Toy at his head, and Brown at the lower part of his body—he rolled over on the curb—Jane Wisdom, who is not here, twisted his handkerchief off his neck, and held it up—Mrs. Goldsmith stepped in and took it from her—Harding came up, and said, "Mother, give me the handkerchief"—Wisdom went in to where she lived, next door to me got a poker, and struck Dean with it—Toy took it from her, and used it as well—she beat Dean with it—it was not Toy, but Wisdom that took the handkerchief, from what I saw—I am sure of that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, and live in Park-terrace, St. John's-wood, Marylebone—my shop has two counters, one on the right side and one on the left—I have a glass door between the two. On the 26th of Aug., between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked for a gold watch—I put out three gold watches, with gold dials, on the glass-case on the left hand counter, for him to look at—he took up one—while he had it in his</p>

               <p>hand he said he did not like gold faces, he wanted a white face—the white-faced watches were on the other side of the counter, in the window—he could have seen that from the street—I went round to the other counter, and took three white-faced watches from the right hand window—the prisoner crossed over towards that counter—in doing so he passed the glass door—I had left two of the gold-faced watches on the glass case, and he had one in his hand—he crossed over to me—I did not observe it in his hand then—while I had the white-faced watches in my band, and before I showed them to him, another person came in, with a coat or cloak on his left arm, and asked if I could take a stone out of a pin—I said, "Yes"—he stood close by the prisoner, who was at the right hand counter—I walked back again with the tray in my hand, with the gold watches in it, and when I came to the left side of the counter, there were only two watches there—the person who asked about the pin had gone out before I got back to the other side—he went out in a moment before the prisoner came to the other side—he could not reach the watches where the prisoner originally stood—they were on the left hand side—when I got to the other side I missed a watch—I told the prisoner, "I put three gold watches on the glass-case here"—he never said anything—I mentioned it twice, and the third time I had the tray in my hand I walked round and said, "You have got a watch of mine, and I will have it; if you have not got it your friend has"—he did not say anything—I sent for a policeman—before I gave him in charge, he said, "I remind you you roust know what you are doing"—I afterwards saw Taylor, the witness—the passage between the two counters is two yards wide—it may be more.</p>

I was piling up some bricks in New Ox<lb/>ford-street, near some buildings—my master came and told me to employ a man to do a job for him, and to find two men to assist me—I said I did not know where to find them—he then said, "There is a lazy man standing there that wants a job"—I said, "I did not think you wanted a lazy man, you want a man to work for you"—the man was standing behind me—he was like the prisoner—I told him I did not think he understood the business he was about to do—I did not hire him, or speak to him again—he was not employed at all—I was at work and felt something strike my side—I stood up and recovered myself, and asked why he served me out in that manner—I saw a knife in his hand—I had not felt him stick me with it—he said be would do it again, and my master came between us—I bled, and went to King's College Hospital—I never said, or did anything to him.</p>

                  </hi>, Sen. I am a horse—dealer, and have carried on business at Greenwich many years. I have had dealings with the prisoner, but all dealings had ceased between us—I did not owe him any money in Aug. last—on the 28th of Aug. he came to me at my stable in the neighbourhood of the Horse Shoe—he saw some horses in the stable, and suggested that he could sell three of them to Mr. Wigram, for the Calcutta market—I told him he must excuse me, but I could not entrust him with them—he said, "Why?"—I said from the way he had obtained sixteen guineas from my wife during my absence in the country, and put it to his own use, and from other transactions I had had with him, I had come to the conclusion not to trust him again—he said, would I let my son William meet him at Mr. Wigram's with them the following morning at nine o'clock—he was the first that suggested that—he said, if I would do so, he would introduce the property as mine to Mr. Wig-ram, and inform him my son was authorized to sell them, and my son should receive the money—he solemnly declared he would take no advantage of the boy, if I would trust the horses with him—upon that, I next day gave them to my son to take—I should not have given him the horses if the prisoner had not made that promise to me—they were three geldings—I have never received the money for them.</p>

               <p>from Mr. Wigram—the prisoner has handed it over to Mr. Dixon, to induce him to become his bail—I did not pay Mr. Dixon the money, because I understood he had encouraged the prisoner to keep my money—I gave a bill—this is it now in your hands—when it came to maturity I did not pay it—the prisoner had not been charged on the 9th of Sept., but I had heard that he had handed over the money to Dixon—the money was paid on the 4th—the prisoner did not get Mr. Dixon to trust me—I have heard Mr. Dixon say be would not trust him—I have no doubt about owing Mr. Dixon 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

On the 15th of September two persons came to me about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and I went to the station—I there saw some lead—the prisoner had been in my service for a week previous to that, as a plumber—he was laying the gutters of houses—the lead was such as would be used for that purpose—it resembled a piece which had been cut off that day—it was mine—I had seen it safe between one and two o'clock—I went to the roof of a house the next morning at six o'clock, where the lead was that resembled mine—I compared the lead, and it fitted the place—I had other lead like it on my premises—two pieces were missing, and some more remaining.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Richard—street, Portman—market. I am in the employ of Mr. Marshall, who is building some houses in Camden—town—the prisoner Stammers is building some houses adjoining Mr. Marshall's—before the 22nd of Aug. I had seen bricks drawn to Stammer's premises by Mr. Perkin's carts, which excited my attention—the carts were driven by Unwin and Fisher, and Stammers was there to receive them—I cannot say how many times I had seen the carts deliver bricks, and Stammers there to receive them—I saw Unwin driving a cart of bricks there on the 22nd of Aug. in the morning, and Stammers was there to receive them—he was always there—I went up to the wharf in the Hampstead—road—it is on the side of the canal—I do not know the name of the wharf—I believe it belongs to the Birmingham Railway Company—I saw Unwin and Fisher at work there, loading the bricks in the carts and driving them away—they each took one cart—they drove them towards the road where they always did, but instead of going towards Chalk—farm, they went down another turning right down to where Stammers and our master was building—I went and got my victuals, and when I came out they were by the side of Mr. Stammer's buildings—I saw Mr. Stammers there—he and Fisher walked together, Stammers gave him something, but what I cannot say—Unwin went away with the carts, and Fisher staid behind—the bricks were out of the carts—they had been shot out and laid on the ground—I saw Stammers before they van shot—I saw him point to where they were to be shot, on some more bricks—I had seen the other bricks shot—one load was shot in the morning—I know good bricks from bad ones—the usual mode of taking bricks out of carts it handing them from one to another—shooting them out would be likely to damage them, without they were good hard stocks, and then it do not hurt them—they are counted into the carts—they are very seldom counted when they are taken out—I saw Stammers give something out of his hand to Fisher—I heard it chink, but I do not know what it was—Fisher then went away—I had some conversation with Stammers after this—I was telling him he had a good deal of stuff brought home there, and I asked whether he was aware where it came from—he said he did not know where it came from—I said to him the next day (that was on the Thursday, I think)," The bricks do not seem to come in to—day as they used to do, "and I told him they belonged to the Railway Company I believed—he said he did not know, be bought them, he did not know where they came from—I told him if he was not aware, I knew he never bought them fairly—he said I was to mind my own business, he did not know where they came from—I told him I believed they were stolen property—he said he did not know, and to mind my own business.</p>

Fisher and Unwin were in my employ on the 22nd of Aug.—on that day they were employed to cart bricks from the wharf to the station, Fisher for half the day, and Unwin for the whole day—it was their duty to take them to the Camden station—they had no authority to go anywhere else with them—I do not know Stammers—I never had any dealing with him—the other prisoners had no right to be at all on his premises on that day—it is from 500 to 700 yards from the wharf to Stamraers's premises—it is not above a minute's difference between that and the Camden station—Stammers was bailed on the first examination—after he had been bailed, he called on me at my house one morning—I walked into the parlour, and there he sat—he said, "What is to be done in this little affair?"—I said, "It is not a little affair, I think it is a very serious affair; you don't take it in a right light; don't say anything; don't tell me anything; I can say nothing;" and he walked out—bricks are sometimes shot out of a cart—we generally stack them.</p>

Between three and four last Thursday afternoon, I was going from Gracechurch-street towards Fish-street-hill—I saw the prisoner take Mrs. Wightman's dress up, and put his hand into her pocket—I went up to her and asked if she had lost anything—she said, no—the prisoner was then walking before her—he made rather a start and walked pretty fast till he got to the corner, he then made a run—I hallooed "Stop thief!"and the police, man caught him—I saw him take the purse out of Mrs. Wightman's pocket, and he dropped it when we detained him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Patrick Ford, of Upper Chapman-street, Ratcliffe-highway. On the 5th of Sept. the prisoner lodged at my house—I served him with a written notice that morning, to quit that day week—he seemed very much displeased—he had lived there five weeks—he said he would have revenge for such actions—he returned about half-past one in the day, and had scarcely entered his own room, when he made use of very indecent language towards me—he said he would let the Irish w——know soon, the old sow—I stepped towards the street—door, hearing the expressions, and beckoned to a neighbour's boy to fetch a policeman—on my return to my apartment I said, "My good man, you had better mind what you are saying, or you may get into trouble"—he said, "What, you b——w——, have you got any boiling water to throw over me?"—I said, "Yes, I have; and if you interfere with me, you shall have it"—I went into my own room and shut the door—I heard a scuffle in the passage—it was his wife wanting to keep him away, but he forced my door open and struck me with his fist as I stood at the table—I turned round towards the fire-place, where there was a saucepan with some slops in it—I took the saucepan off the hob, and threw the water towards the door, where he stood—he rushed in on me, took the saucepan out of my hand, and knocked it about my head—some of the water reached him—it was not boiling, it was only warm—there had been no fire since half-past twelve—he closed the door when I threw the water—he struck me three times on my head, and it streamed with blood all over—(I went to the station-house, and Dr. Stock was called in)—the prisoner's wife dragged him out of the room, but he made his way in again, took an iron plate which hung before the fire, and made a blow at me—I put up my hand to save my head—he struck my hand, shoulder, and arm with it—it made me quite senseless—when I recovered I found myself alone, but the witness was calling "Murder!" in the passage—he kicked me on the thigh when his wife was trying to pull me away—that made me unable to move from the spot.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in the same house as the prosecutrix. On the 5th of Sept., about half-past one o'clock, the prisoner came home and used I very bad language to his wife, and swore if he could catch the landlord how I he would serve him—he then said if he could get hold of the landlady be I would serve her out—he asked her whether she had got any hot water to throw I over him—she said, "Yes, if you dare to insult me I will"—she went in and I shut her door—he jumped out of his own window, which is on the ground floor, I opened the door, and followed her into her room, he struck her in the face as soon as he opened the door, and then she threw the water over him which she I had to wash the plates and dishes with—he took the saucepan and beat her I about the head with it—she fell backwards towards the fire, as she had run I towards the fire while he was beating her—as she fell, he took up the iron I hanger that was before the fire—she had not the hanger in her hand—I do I not know where he got it from.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Henry Dewsbury, at No. 1, Upper Gore, Kensington—it is his dwelling-house—I went to bed at eleven o'clock at night on the 31st August—I was the last person up—I am sure I shut all the windows and doors safe—the drawing-room is on the first floor—the front win<lb/>dow looks into the main road and the back into the back garden—I saw that the windows of that room were down, and I shut the door myself between ten and eleven o'clock—I got up in the morning between six and seven o'clock—it was after six, but I cannot say how long—I found the policemen at the door—it was their ringing the bell that awoke me—they came in, searched the house, and there were two large pictures gone from the drawing—room, also two chimney-ornaments, a card-dish, card-cases, and a number of other things—they have all been found, and are here—they are all my master's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gatekeeper of Kensington-gate. On Tuesday morn<lb/>ing, 1st September, about five minutes after five o'clock, I was opposite Mr. Gray's nursery, and saw the prisoners Moore and Jackson—they were close to<lb/>gether, and appeared in company—Moore had two pictures, similar to thete—they walked together to the end of Park-house, and there I saw Jackson take one of the pictures from under Moore's arm, and they walked into the meadow by Park-house—they were coming in the direction of London—I came on to the Halfway-house, which is about 150 yards further—I unlocked the gate and turned back—I then saw Jackson and Moore again standing at the end of the wall of Park-house, without the pictures—they came out into the main road just opposite me, and walked on towards Kensington—they then met the other three prisoners, who were coming in a direction from Mr. Dewsbury's house—they were nearly opposite to it—they stood together about a minute, and then they all returned towards the meadow—I went to my own house at Kensington-gate, I unlocked the carriage-gate, and went into the high road to see if I could see the prisoners any more, and I saw the five coming back again towards Kensington-gore—I could not tell whether they had been to the meadow—I think they had hardly had time to have done that—they turned down Kensington-lane—I found Dunbar, and told him—he and I went to the meadow—we found nothing—we went to the station and got another officer—we all three returned to the meadow and found these two pictures, under a large mortar board with a quantity of tiles on it, we also found this ivory work—box—we took the property to the station, and the box was opened—I am sure the prisoners are the persons—I afterwards found one of these chimney-ornaments in Hyde—park, and the park-keeper found the other—I afterwards found this holland in the plantation of the park-the gita were locked, but they might get over, or they could put these in by potting their hands through the railing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the firm of John Stevens and Son, of Southwark-bridge-road. The prisoner was in their employment—on the 21st of Sept. I had information that metal was missing, and stood at the gate as the prisoner left the premises, and took him into custody—he was taken to the station—these cuttings were there produced to me—I missed sucb, and feel confident they belong to Stevens and Son—they are gun-metal borings—the metal screw produced was found at the prisoner's house—I havem brought another one—they fit each other.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 41, Arbour-street, New Kent-road. On Monday morning, the 31st of Aug., about ten minutes after two o'clock, I was going along High-street, Southwark, near Falcon-court, with the witness Cook—we were overtaken by four or five persons, who attacked me without any cause whatever—they began by jostling against me—one of them, not in custody, struck me a blow on the cheek with hit fist, and knocked me down—it did not make any bruise—I got up, and the prisoner Evans seized roe again—he sparred up at me with his fist, and struck me on the jugular vein, under the ear, and knocked me down—I caught hold of him, aod he fell on me—then there was a cry that "the <hi rend="italic">crushers"</hi> were coming, meaning the policemen, I believe—I did not see where Cook was at that time—I caught hold of Evans while I was falling, and he fell on me—some person then attempted to kick me, but kicked over me—I got up, and found my waistcoat open, and my watch hanging by the guard—it had been inside my fob—I am not prepared to swear it was dragged out of my pocket, because I do not recollect feeling it come out—it is rather a deep pocket—I cannot say it might not have come out in the fall—it was quite safe before I was struck—I was rather fresh—I have no recollection of giving them any provocation—I knew Evans by sight before-when I got up they ran off—I saw no more of Evans till after we passed the Mint—Stand ley was then in custody—I turned round, and saw Evans walking behind—I seized him and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to William Quelch, who lives in South—wark. The prisoner was in the habit of coming to his shop to sell artificial—flowers—he came there on the 27th of Aug.—I was serving a lady with some ribbons—I pushed the box on one side; but previous to doing so, I counted the ribbons—there were twenty pieces of them—the customer left the shop—the prisoner came and offered to sell me flowers—I said we did not want any—he put his box on a chair in the shop, and the box lid partly over the box of ribbons on the counter—I said we did not want any—I went into the midd<lb/>le opf the shope and then towards the parlour—in three minutes after I came I to the shop again—he had then left—I counted the ribbons, and found there was one piece gone—I am sure no one else had been in the shop—I went after him—I overtook him, and said I wanted him—he came back—I told him—I overtook him, and said I wanted him—he came back—I told him to open his box, Which he did, and I found this ribbon in the box—it is William Quelch's—I said, "I have found you out at last, having missed goods before, I suspected you"—he said it fell into his box—from the situation in which the ribbon was, it is impossible it could fall into his box without his knowledge—it had been in a box, and could not roll out without being pulled out.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a carrier at Godalming, in Surrey, and am a farmer. I had a person named Edwards in my employ as a carter—on Thursday, the 10th of Sept., it was his duty, with Wiggins, to take the cart to town—on Sunday, the 6th of Sept, I saw a sack containing corn in my hay—loft, which excited my suspicion—my stable is at the bottom, and is about fifty feet long, and at the top of that is my corn—loft and hay<lb/>loft—you go through the hay—loft to get to the corn—loft—for the last two or three months I have given out all the corn myself—the corn has been pad<lb/>locked up—the padlock has been on perhaps for twelve months—on the Monday and Thursday, Edwards, the carter, had four horses up, and he had two sacks of corn and one of chaff—the sack which I found on Sunday in the hay—loft was covered with a little bay—the constable saw it—he has had access to my stable for the last month—on the Thursday morning I saw there were two lots of corn, one in the corner of the stable, and one in the hay—loft—the sack was lying in the same situation as on Sunday—I did not mix anything with the corn in the sack—I have seen the corn that Bid—decombe found in London on the Friday—I believe, to the best of my knowledge, it is my corn—mine consisted of white oats, black oats, and split beans, and this consisted of the same—something had been mixed with it, but I did not do that—apart from that I believe it to be my corn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a law stationer, and live in Castle—street, Holborn. On the 21st of Aug. I played "Richard the Third", in a private theatrical performance, at the Bower Saloon in Stangate—street—I believe it is a licensed theatre—when I went to play I took one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and six 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, which were in my pocket, and transferred them from my own clothes to my theatrical pantaloons, which I had on—the prisoner acted as prompter—I lost my property that night—I took off the pantaloons about ten o'clock that night, and threw them from the dressing—room, in which I had been dressed, into another dressing—room, and my impression is that I omitted taking the money out of the pantaloons—one of the notes has been traced—the prisoner was with me part of the time when I undressed—I do not know what became of him when I threw the pantaloons over—if I see the notes I can identify them—here is one with the name of "Butcher and Son" on it, in my writing—here is another with the same writing on it—these are two of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and this is the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which is also mine.</p>

I was up at a quarter to four o'clock—I looked out at the window, and after a little while I saw the stable door open, and a man brought a sack—he stooped as he brought it—I could not tell the man—he carried it into Simpson's stable, and put H down, then brought another sack from White Hind<lb/>alley—he pitched that down in the stable, then went back and brought another—he did the same thing with that—the sacks appeared to be full—I then went to another window, where I had a view into Cann's-alley—I saw King—he was in the stable—I saw Simpson about a minute after the first sack was delivered, and before the second was delivered—he was at the door of the loft of the stable—he could see what was going on—he could see both ways—he was not doing anything—he remained there during the time I saw the other two sacks pitched—I do not know whether he remained there after that—I did not take any more account of him—I saw him distinctly—I have no doubt of his being the person—he was able to see what was going on—he could see each way—by taming over the loft door he could see into Cann's-alley—he looked out two or three times after the sacks were come—there is a gas—lamp at the corner, which was alight at the time—after the first sack had been delivered I saw. Simpson come from Pye—gardens, and go into the stable, and afterwards I saw him looking out of the door of the loft.</p>

I must do justice; I must call Mr. Kennard, the clerk"—I called him up, and made some communication to him—Mr. Sells was called—before he was called Jacobs told Mr. Kennard be was very sorry for what he had done; it was the first offence—when Mr. Sells came, we went into Simpson's stable—we there found a large bin, full of corn—we did not find any sacks of corn in the stable—I took a sample of the corn in the bit—we went back to the prosecutor's—Jacobs then said, before Mr. Kennard the others, that he was very sorry, and that they were not sacks; they weretkee cotchells—there were a few oats in the sacks when they were returned—I produce a sample of oats from Simpson's stable, and from the prosecutor's.</p>
