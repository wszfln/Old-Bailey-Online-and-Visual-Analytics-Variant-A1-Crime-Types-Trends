I proposed to my friend, Mr. Martin, to ride in company with the next carriage we saw. We then walked our horses till we were overtaken by a chariot with two gentlemen.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170003"/> We rode in company with that carriage till we came to Shepherd's-bush. I then stopped for about a minute, and Mr. Martin walked his horse gently on till I overtook him. We rode on a little way, and saw, as we thought, two men coming from the chariot. They passed us, and said something to us, which I did not rightly understand: but my friend informed me that they wished us a good night. We rode up to the carriage. One of the gentlemen asked us if we had seen two men go by. We told them we had. They said they had been robbed by those two men. We turned our horses, and pursued them. When we came to the White-horse, at Shepherd's-bush, we enquired if they had seen the two men. They informed us they had. We turned our horses heads towards Acton, and I saw the two men stop a hackney-coach.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - Between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was it light then? - It was rather dusk; but it was light enough to distinguish them. I rode up to the man on the right-hand side of the carriage, which was the prisoner, and made a blow at him with a stick which I had in my hand, but missed him. He immediately turned himself upon his horse, and fired a pistol at me, which missed me. He turned his horse about, rode a few paces, and then threw his pistol away, and rode off towards London. I pursued him for near half a mile. I believe, when I saw two men before us upon the road: I called out to them, Stop thief! knock him down! or something of that sort. One of them struck him on the head. He rode about a hundred yards, and then sell off his horse. He was never out of my sight from the time he shot at me till he sell off his horse. My horse being in full speed, I could not immediately stop him: I passed him; but returned, and found him in custody.</p>
               <p>How near was you to him when he stopped the coach? - About a hundred yards. I am very certain the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Had he a pistol in his hand at that time? - He had.</p>

               <p>On Sunday, the 26th of August last, I dined about two or three miles beyond Uxbridge. I left that place at about half after five o'clock, on my return to London, in a single-horse chaise. I was alone. I drove pretty fast. I stopped at Acton, to give my horse a little hay, and some water. I passed a hackney-coach, a single-horse chair, and a post-chaise. These carriages were all, I suppose, within 300 yards of each other. I was within sight of <placeName id="t17811017-2-crimeloc7">the White-horse, at Shepherd's-bush</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17811017-2-crimeloc7" type="placeName"
                          value="the White-horse, at Shepherd's-bush"/>
                  <interp inst="t17811017-2-crimeloc7" type="type" value="crimeLocation"/>

                        targets="t17811017-2-off5 t17811017-2-crimeloc7"/>. That was at about a quarter before eight o'clock. The prisoner came about four or five yards before my horse's head, and halloa'd out, Stop! Being then within sight of the carriages behind me, and of the White-horse, I so little expected being robbed, that I asked him what he wanted. He then came near me, and took a large horse-pistol out of his great-coat, which was a brown one. He put something over his face, which I thought was a crape. He said, D - n your eyes, stop! My horse was rather upon his mettle, as I had been driving pretty fast, and he would not immediately stop. The prisoner said, Blast you, if you don't stop, I will blow your brains out. I stood up in the chaise, and had the reins and whip<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170004"/> both in one hand, in order to pull out my watch. The horse wanted to get on. Then the prisoner said, D - n your eyes, stop; or else I will blow your brains out. I said, I would, but my horse would not let me. At that time another man came up, with his face also covered. I then got my horse to stand still, and gave him my watch, or rather throwed it to him; for he was half a yard from the chaise I believe, looking at the carriages that were behind him. He attempted to catch my watch, but it fell down upon the ground: his companion got off his horse, and took it up. The prisoner then said, Your money! I took out all I had, three guineas and some silver, and gave it him. In giving it him, a shilling dropped upon the ground. The prisoner said, D - n you, what is that? I said, It is silver, I believe. He said, Blast you, it is gold.</p>
               <p>Do you know how much silver you gave him? - I cannot say exactly; three or four shillings, I believe. When the shilling dropped on the ground, I think the prisoner got off his horse, and picked it up; but I will not swear that: but upon searching the prisoner afterwards, when he was taken, we found a single shilling loose in his coat-pocket. They left me, and went towards Acton. When I stopped at the White-horse, at Shepherd's-bush, Mr. Ireland and Mr. Walker asked me if I had not been robbed.</p>
               <p>Were they in one of the three carriages you had passed? - No. Soon after, I saw the flash, and heard the report, of a pistol.</p>
               <p>How far was you from it? - May be 500 yards from the White-horse. I was looking that way, in consequence of their telling me two young men were gone in pursuit of the men. Soon after I had heard the report of the pistol, the prisoner rode upon full stretch, as fast as he could, by the White-horse, in his way to London. I knew him then: I said to some of the people about the house, That is the man, I am sure, who robbed me. Mr. Butler and his companion were in pursuit of him, galloping as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Had he the crape, or thing, over his eyes? - He went so fast, I could not observe that; but I observed his great-coat, and his hat.</p>
               <p>What colour was his horse? - I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>How far was he taken from Shepherd's-bush? - I believe best part of a mile; it was not above a quarter of an hour, at farthest, after robbing me. They brought him back, covered with blood and dirt. He had been knocked off his horse: he had a violent blow upon his forehead. I immediately said he was the man that had robbed me, it was so recent in my memory, so short a period had elapsed in the interval of their pursuing him; and I had given a description of him at the public-house: I said he was a short, thick, well-set fellow; he had a brown coat; and his voice was remarkable; which made a very strong impression upon my mind. We searched him, and found some gold and silver upon him, and one shilling loose in his coat-pocket.</p>
               <p>You said his companion picked up your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Miller produced a horse-pistol, about fourteen or fifteen inches in the barrel.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Catmur. It was such a sized pistol as this; I observed it was mounted with brass, as this is. When he was examined at the White-horse, I observed there was a little pocket inside his brown great-coat, which, upon comparing, this pistol fitted.</p>
               <p>What do you say as to his being the man? - I am sure he is the man; I have not the least doubt of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>The man that robbed you had a greatcoat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And something over his face? - Yes, over the best part of his face, that I could not see any of his features: it covered all his face.</p>
               <p>You could not see any features the man had? - No.</p>
               <p>This man, by his size, I believe, you thought was an acquaintance of yours? - I will explain that, if you please. That alludes to my going up, on the Monday morning, to appear against him, the day after he had robbed me. On this side of the public office, there is a public-house: the window was open. A man bowed to me, who was in company with five or six at a box. I seeing the man bow to me, went in, and asked, Is the man come up? What do you mean<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170005"/> by that? said they. I said, Because I was robbed last night, and I thought he might be here. The man, who had bowed to me, said, You do not recollect me, Sir; I am James, who was servant to Mr. Edmonds. I said, I thought that probably the people here were some of them that had the custody of the man who robbed me; and that man went and told the prisoner that I had taken him for the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>There was nothing remarkable in the great-coat? - No; only having a pocket: and I saw the prisoner take the pistol out of that side-pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On which side was the pocket? - I am not certain. He held the pistol in his right hand: he took it out of his left breast pocket.</p>
               <p>There was no pistol found on him, when he was searched? - No. There were found upon him six or seven guineas, I believe; I don't exactly know.</p>
               <p>Court. When first he bid you stop, if I understand you, he had nothing over his face? - After telling me to stop, and as he was coming to the chaise, then his face was covered, and he took out his pistol. When he first called, Stop! I had so little suspicion, I thought he was coming to tell me I was in danger of being robbed.</p>

               <p>I was in a hackney-coach. Immediately upon my being robbed, some gentlemen came up, upon my calling to them, that I had been robbed. They rode past the coach, their horses being in full speed. The highwayman at the coach-door turned round, fired a pistol, and rode off. I saw the pistol flung away: I saw it in the air; and I picked it up: this is it I have just produced. The person who threw it away, and who had robbed us, rode off as fast as he could towards town. We were a very little way beyond the White-horse. We came on in the coach, towards town, and passed the White-horse. We met the people who had taken the highwayman. We then returned back to the White-horse.</p>
               <p>What time might there be between your being robbed and your seeing the man carried back? - I believe it was all within a quarter of an hour. I was robbed of three half-guineas, and some silver.</p>
               <p>Were there any half-guineas produced out of his pocket when he was searched? - There were before the justice.</p>

               <p>How long was it from the time they robbed the hackney-coach that they were out of your sight? - Not above a minute.

               <p>After he had fired his pistol, he rode as fast as he could, towards town, by the White-horse? - He did: I could have passed him; but I chose to keep behind, fearing he had more fire-arms: I was never above a hundred yards behind him.</p>
               <p>What became of his pistol, after he had fired it? - I saw him throw it away, after he had rode a little way. I am very positive the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>I was robbed about half an hour after seven, or a little more, on Sunday the 26th of August, coming to town in Mr. Walker's carriage, at Shepherd's-bush. We were attacked by two highwaymen. The man on my side the carriage, the right-hand side coming to London, robbed me of two guineas and a half. I believe the person who robbed me was the prisoner's accomplice.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of the prisoner? - This is the man, I believe, that robbed Mr. Walker; but I can't swear to him. After he had received Mr. Walker's money, he threatened his life, for concealing his watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170006"/>Had he any thing over his face? - I believe he had; but I cannot say whether it was a crape, or a hat; nor can I swear to the prisoner. The moment they left us, I put my head out of the carriage-window, and saw Mr. Butler and Mr. Martin coming on to London. I asked if they had met the people: they said, yes. I said, they are highwaymen; they have robbed us. They pursued them. I observed the man's dress: he had on a brown beaver coat, which was on his back when he was taken. I saw him when he was taken to the White-horse.</p>
               <p>What distance might there be between the time you was robbed and the time he was taken? - He dropped off his horse a little nearer to town than where he robbed us. I suppose it to be about a quarter of an hour after he robbed us that he was taken. He had robbed Mr. Catmur, I understand, before he robbed the hackney-coach, after he had robbed us.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was coming home, towards London, between seven and eight in the evening. We heard people crying out, Stop thief! knock him down! I went in the road, and struck at a man with a cane, and hit him. He went about twenty or thirty yards, and then tumbled off. I went and catched hold of him. I am certain the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>How was he riding, when you knocked him off his horse? - As hard as ever he could ride. He was taken back to the Whitehorse, and there searched; but I did not particularly observe what money was taken from him.</p>

               <p>You saw and heard the pistol fired? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long was he out of your sight after he fired the pistol? - I cannot say: I galloped after him, but did not gallop fast; so that he might be out of my sight a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Can you say that the man who fired the pistol was the man you saw taken? - I can't be positive, because he was a few minutes out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Mr. WALKER sworn.</p>
               <p>I was with Mr. Ireland. I was stopped by two highwaymen, a little on this side Shepherd's-bush, at about twenty minutes before eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>On which side did you sit in the chariot? - On the left side. The prisoner, who robbed me, came to my left hand.</p>
               <p>Did the same person rob you both, or each rob the man that was next him? - Each robbed the man that was next to him. The man who came to my side I think to be the prisoner. Before they stopped us, they rode past the carriage a few paces: they had then no covering upon their faces: they seemed to be riding a brisk trot. They turned about, and cried to the coachman, Stop! or they would blow him off his seat. Then the man turned his horse round, and came up close to my side the carriage. I thought he was a very bold man, to rob me in such a road, when so many people were round about. I observed he had a brown greatcoat, a little shabby; a hat flapped over his face; and had something over his face, which at first I took to be a crape. He robbed me of a guinea and a half, and 2 s. After he had taken my money, he demanded my watch. I answered, I had no watch. He said, You have; I will blow your brains out, if you don't give it me. He pushed the pistol close into the carriage to me, against me, and so as to oblige me to throw up my head against the back of the carriage. I told him I certainly had no watch. Mr. Ireland then said, I know the gentleman has no watch. The highwayman then said, Upon your honour? Mr. Ireland said, Upon my honour. Then they immediately left us. I recollected we had passed a great number of carriages, and people on horseback and on foot. I thought they could not escape. I was going to leap out of the carriage. Immediately I saw two men coming up. Mr. Ireland got out on his side, and I jumped out of the carriage, to speak to Mr. Butler and Mr. Martin. I told them we had been robbed. Mr. Butler immediately turned back, and pursued them full gallop. I ran along the road till I came to the White-horse, which is 100 or 200 yards perhaps. I got to the White-horse,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170007"/> and mentioned I had been robbed, and two men were in pursuit of the highwaymen. Before I had told them this, I heard the report of a pistol at some distance upon the road.</p>

               <p>What time was it between the pursuit of Mr. Butler and the man's coming back? - Within two minutes after I heard the pistol fired, I suppose, two men repassed me on full gallop, the latter crying, Stop thief! I turned round, and joined in the pursuit, on foot. They were presently out of my sight. I ran along the road till I came up to a crowd of people, just by my own carriage: there the prisoner was standing in the road, bleeding. He had on the coat I thought he had on when he robbed me: it was thrown open. His hat was lost in the road somewhere. From his being so much disguised when he robbed me, I could recollect nothing more than that he was the same size, and the same sort of person.</p>

About a quarter past seven o'clock, within about sixteen yards of Newtoner's-lane, I saw the prisoner with something in his apron. I called to him, to know what he had got in his apron. He said, Wood. He ran back to the building as fast as he could. I followed him. I saw him near a cellar, and then he had nothing in his apron. We went to the place I had seen him at, and there we found 18 lb. of lead.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mrs. Baker. The prisoner came into Mrs. Baker's shop, on the 15th of September, and asked to look at some cloaks. We shewed her several. She desired to see more. She looked upon one in particular. She objected to it, because it had a black lining, and asked to see some with white linings. Afterwards she asked to see some childrens' bonnets. Mrs. Baker observed that she stooped, under pretence to tie her garter, or something of that kind; and she observed, at that time, that the prisoner drew up, under her petticoats, a silk cloak; upon which she charged her with it. She denied it totally. Mrs. Baker said she would search her; but the prisoner said no one should search her: upon which Mrs. Baker insisted she should go into the parlour. She sent for a constable, but could not find any constable at home: but we searched her; and this cloak (producing it) was taken from under her petticoats. I know it, by the mark, to be Mrs. Baker's property: it is one she objected to on account of its not having a white lining.</p>

The prisoner went to the carter, and brought him to the place, where I saw the carter deliver some bricks, I suppose about 200, out of that loaded cart. The cart immediately drove away in great haste, so hastily as to run against the wall, and shake it. I thought there was something odd in this transaction; and therefore, that I might know whose bricks they were, I followed the cart, which went on with the rest of the bricks down to London-wall, where I saw the bricks delivered. I mentioned the transaction to some persons, by which means it came to the knowledge of Mr. Scott.</p>

               <p>When I took up the prisoner, I asked him how he could receive bricks from such a man as Baldwin, and why he did not apply to the clerk properly? He denied having had any at all. When Baldwin was brought and confronted with him, and he insisted he had received the bricks of him, the prisoner then admitted he had received them, and had paid 1 s. 5 d. to the carter in part; but the carter said he had paid the whole to him that he was to receive.</p>

               <p>On the 23d of August, I saw a cart unloading with bricks, four doors below my dwelling-house. I was coming by with a cask of beer. I asked the man if he was coming again with this job: he said, he should know when he was unloaded. He came up to my dwelling-house, and said he was coming again on the morrow. I told him, if he came again to that job, to bring me 150 bricks. He said, What sort? I said, It made no difference; but the commoner they are, the better they will suit me; for they are for a necessary, for a gentleman who has built a house two doors higher. He said, he should come on the morrow, without fail. I said, If you come, bring 150, but bring a receipt. He said he would. I had never seen the man before. The following day 150 bricks were brought. The bricks came in a cart, apparently full. He asked me where they were to be set down. I shewed him. He put down 150 bricks, and said, Master, where is the money? I said, Where is the receipt? D - n your blood, said he, I brought no receipt; you don't mean to pay for them, I suppose. I said, Bring a receipt to my house when you will; there is the money. I never saw any more of the man till a warrant was obtained of Justice Wilmot. On the Monday following, one of the witnesses brought a warrant in, and said it was for stealing 200 stock bricks. I thought it was for taking more than I agreed for; that made me deny the fact. I said, The man left no more than 150 bricks here. He said, What did you pay for them? I said, I had not paid for them. I was taken down to the watch-house: I was continued there all night. The next day, when I was before Justice Wilmot, he would hardly hear me or my friends speak; and so I kept these words to declare on my trial.</p>

Knowing Mr. Burland, I called at his house, on a Friday afternoon. He directed me through a little passage, by the side of his garden, to walk there: I might see something that might suit my friend. I went down. The houses were to be sold, instead of lett. Coming back, just by a gate, I saw Mr. Burland and a man, that had a cart, talking together. It struck my attention, because there was something of words about some bricks lying there, and a receipt. The man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170010"/> was drunk. The first thing I recollect was, Mr. Burland said, My friend, have you brought a bill and receipt? The man said, No. He said, Then I shall not pay you, without you bring a bill and receipt for them. But there was something given to him; but what it was, I cannot tell; whether to drink, or for the bricks. The man drove away.</p>

While they were in the shop, a person knocked at the private door. I turned my head that way. When I looked towards the prisoner again, I saw him in the act of taking the waistcoats off a chair: they had just come home from the taylor's. I went to him, and took him by the coat, and held him fast till a person came in; and I pulled them from under his coat. The other man ran away.</p>

               <p>How do you go into it? - Out of my yard. My yard is fenced round, part with brick, and part with wood. I locked this hovel about six o'clock over-night, on the 5th of October. I was called up the next morning by my neighbours. I found, upon examination, that this place had been broke open; and I lost four geese. The lock had been wrenched off, but was hung on again; and the door was shut-to afterwards. The two prisoners were apprehended; and there were four geese brought to me, which I knew to be the geese I had lost.</p>

               <p>I was alarmed by the barking of my dog. I saw two men in a turnip-field. I got up, to see what they were about; but I saw no more of them. Afterwards I saw two men coming along the road, towards me, from the way that the prosecutor's house stands. I observed that they had with them three geese. One had a goose under his arm; the other had a goose in a bag, and had another goose under his arm: I could just see that in the bag, as the bag was not close at the top. I had a gun: I bid them stop, or I would blow their brains out. They dropped the geese, and ran away. I followed them into a field: there I lost them. I went and alarmed the neighbours. We searched the field. There we found a parcel of fowls. Some time after that, a man in a foul-weather waistcoat, which was the prisoner Garment, passed by. He talked to a waggoner going by, and asked some questions about a timber-cart. Afterwards, he came back again. I am sure he is the same man that I saw with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170011"/> the bag, and having a goose under his arm. We secured him. Afterwards, Branson was taken by another man, and brought in. He had then the great-coat on which the prisoner Garment wore when I first saw him with the geese.</p>

There was a dispute between my mistress and them about some bad money. Garment offered first a bad half-crown. When my mistress refused it, he gave her a bad shilling. She refused that, and told him she thought he dealt in bad money. Then he gave her good money. I saw no more of them till next day. Then I saw Garment brought to the door of my master's house, dressed in a foul-weather waistcoat; and I observed there was upon it fresh goose-dung. I was sent to find out who was the owner of a parcel of fowls which had been found in a turnip-field. As we were going along the road, we met the prisoner Branson, in a great-coat. I saw something bulky on one side, in his pocket. I suspected him. I let him pass me. Then he entered into some conversation with a man who was coming by in a straw-cart. I followed Branson, and secured him; and I found a dead goose in his pocket. He at first said he found it; but when we told him we would carry him to the house where Garment was, he said, I will tell you the whole truth; I have a wife and three children: Garment drew me into this.</p>

As I continued to look out of the window, I saw a head come out of the one pair of stairs. I thought it was Mrs. Caulfield's brother,

The man then looked up, and said, D - n you, you b - h; another word, and I will blow your brains out. He then took hold of the lamp-iron, and went down by it, and went down Buckingham-street. I called the watch, and told him which way he went. In a little time after, he was brought back. I knew him to be the man I saw out of the window, by his voice, when I heard him speak. He had no hat on when he got out of the window, and none when he was brought back. There were some bird-cages thrown down under the window, which were brought in after the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I lodge in the one pair of stairs, at Mr. Slater's. My brother is sometimes with me, and was the night this happened. I slept in the bed-chamber adjoining to the dining-room: it is the back part of the house, but looks into an alley, which is a thorough-fare. About one in the morning, I was alarmed by a noise in the street. I got up, and looked into the alley, but saw nobody. I then heard the noise repeated, and hearing the birds flutter (there had been three in the dining-room), I concluded it must be in our house. Mrs. Jackson came down stairs, and called me, to open the door. The watchmen came up. I gave them the key of the dining-room. They went in, and I followed, and found every thing in the room as I left it, except the birds. I left the dining-room windows down over night, but they were not fastened. One of the window-shutters was to, but not fastened. I put the side window up, where the birds were, but don't recollect putting it down again. I frequently left that window up. There did not appear to have been any violence used, not so much as a pane of glass broke.</p>

               <p>I lodge in the two pair of stairs room, at Mr. Slater's. I got up, on hearing a noise, and saw two men in the street. One of them turned up Off-alley. Then I saw a man get out of the dining-room window, and get down by the lamp-iron into the street. I saw him run down Buckingham-street, and turn up George-street. My sister called, Watch! They pursued him, and the man was brought back. I am sure the prisoner is the man. There was a light in the lamp he got down by, sufficient to distinguish his person.</p>

               <p>On Friday last, in the afternoon, I called at Mr. Steward's shop, in <placeName id="t17811017-12-crimeloc60">Fetter-lane</placeName>

While I was talking to my wife at the door, the prisoner, who was in the shop, ran to me, took me round the waist, and carried me by force into the back-shop, threw me down upon a chair, tore my waistcoat open, and said she would feel my bubbies. I thought she was in joke at first. She sat down upon my knee, and asked me what money I had. I said I never carried any about me; but if she would let me get up, I would treat her.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170013"/> She then barred the door, and set her back against it. I got up, and made to the door: She prevented me, by feeling in my pockets. She took my watch with her right-hand, and my money with her left. There was a guinea, and one shilling. I did not see her take the watch; but she took it in such a manner, I should not have perceived it, but putting it into her pocket, she struck the watch against the door, and broke the glass. I asked her for my watch; she denied having it. I called to Mr. Steward, and said she had got my watch: upon which he demanded the watch of her. She denied it before him, and lay struggling on the ground for two or three minutes, till she was quite faint: then she said, if I would let her get up, she would give me the watch. I let her get up: she laid hold of my hair very violently. I threw her down, and insisted she should not get up till she gave me the watch, for I knew she had it. After she had struggled as long as she could, I said, if she did not give me the watch, I would charge a constable with her. She said, if I would let her get up, she would give it me. I let her get up again: she took the watch out of her pocket, and threw it through the window; saying, Blast your bloody eyes, take your watch. She laid hold of my hair again, and made many endeavours to injure me in my private parts, as much as possibly a woman could. Upon which I desired Mr. Steward to send for a constable. They sent all over the parish, and could not get one. She continued that behaviour for an hour. Then I went to the Compter for a constable: some people got her from me, and held her; and she said, Blast your eyes, if I cannot do you now, or to that purpose, I will do for you the first night I meet you. I at first thought she meant some fun with me: I took it quietly, till she attempted to get my money out of my pocket. I thought she was a lodger at Mr. Steward's, or else I should have used more violence. I thought she wanted a game of romps, but she made use of such indecent language, my wife and Mrs. Steward left the shop.</p>

               <p>I am a hair-dresser. I dressed the prisoner a year and a half. I knew her during that time: she was apt to drink, and when in liquor, extremely riotous and quarrelsome. She was very much in liquor at this time. When I returned from dressing, I found Mrs. Phillips, and my wife, in the shop together. Mr. Phillips came in very shortly after me. The prisoner came from the back parlour into the shop, and began talking to Mrs. Phillips and my wife: she laid hold of Mr. Phillips, pulled him into the back shop, and threw herself into a chair, and pulled him upon her lap. Mrs. Phillips said, That was enough to make her jealous. The prisoner used so indecent language, that my wife and Mrs. Phillips left the shop; but the room-door was open all the time: I was in the shop all the time. I heard them fall down, and I heard both of them struggling and laughing: immediately after they fell, he called to me, and said he had lost his watch. I went into the room, and they were both down: she was under him: she still denied having the watch, but immediately after said, she would give it him, if he would lift her up: he did so, and then she laid hold of his hair again, and he threw her down again, and at last she threw the watch through the window.</p>

I asked him where he was going with it: first he said he took it for his own use: then he said a man hired him to carry it: then he said he took it for fun: afterwards, that he took it to exercise himself. As we were taking him to the Mansion-house, he took out a knife, and swore, he would rip every Englishman up like pork. He tried to make his escape three times, but we hindered him. It was about fifty yards long: we call it a pulley-rope: we have a piece of yarn through all our rope: I know it to belong to the Vintners Company: we catched him with it, four doors from where he took it up.</p>

Grace asked to look at some handkerchiefs; Pottin was at the other end of the shop: I saw her take a a piece of handkerchiefs into her hand, and wink at Grace. Grace asked the price of something in the window. I looked round to the window, and gave her an answer. I turned back, and observed that a piece of linen which had been in Pottin's hand was gone. Grace said to Pottin, Well, now you may go. She was going out. I called her back, and said she had got something which did not belong to her. She was going to take something out of her pocket, but I would not let her, but put my hand into her pocket, and took a piece of handkerchiefs out.</p>

               <p>I live at Kingsland. On Wednesday last, my wife and I were returning home from Cheapside. I called a coach. I ordered the coachman to drive to Kingsland Turnpike; he hesitated, and said he lived at Hatton-Garden. I said then he might take us to Shoreditch-Church; but however, he did not stop at <placeName id="t17811017-15-crimeloc73">Shoreditch-Church</placeName>

               <p>What time was it? - A little past two in the morning: it was as light as day. Mrs. Allen tapped me on the knee, and said, My dear, here are thieves. I jumped up, and saw a cutlass at the window. I clapped my hand into my pocket, to save my gold; but one of the fellows immediately opened the door on my side, and jumped into the coach with a cutlass; and, before I could get my hand out of my pocket, the other door was opened, and one jumped in on that side; one stood on each side the door; and the coachman told me that one stood before the horses heads, but I only saw four. I thought to save my gold, but the man was as quick upon me as thought. I put my hand in my other pocket, and gave him some silver. He then asked for my watch. I said I had none. I believe they were in the coach altogether ten minutes. Then one said to the other, D - n him, do him: upon which he catched hold of my wrist, and gave it a twist, and I let all the gold fall to the bottom of the coach.</p>
               <p>He did not cut you with the hanger? - No; he held it close to my face. When he took the hanger from my face, on the money dropping, the handle hit my forehead. The prisoner, Harford, behaved genteel to me; he called me by my name, and shook hands with me. He said to his comrade, If you hurt the gentleman or the lady, I will do you. He then asked me what I had lost? I said sixteen guineas, besides the silver. He then said to his comrade, D - n you, if you do not find sixteen guineas, I will do you before night, for I can depend upon the gentleman. In pulling my breeches off, when I went home, a guinea dropped out of the knee, so that I lost only fifteen guineas in gold. They were not content with the money, but one of them searched me from top to toe, my back and sides, and every where.</p>
               <p>Who did that? - I do not know. I think that man is not taken yet. The others were scrambling in the bottom of the coach for the money. They could not make it out. One of them came back, and said, Here is another guinea in the bottom of the coach. The moon shone-bright. They picked up the last guinea, and then they politely desired my wife and I would rise, and sit on the other side of the coach, while they searched over the seats of the coach. The coach-doors being both open, my hat fell off on the ground. Harford took it up. I had a hatband in it, and he felt all round the hatband. Then they shut the coach-door: I lean'd out at the coach-door, and said, Gentlemen, the hat is of little value, I wish you would give it me again. Harford came back, and politely gave it me; and then the other prisoner came back, and said, Madam, we must have your cardinal; and he wantonly pushed the point of the hanger into the pannel on the outside of the coach: I observed, the hanger had a black handle. I said, No, d - n you, you shall none of you have the cardinal, and was going to jump out of the coach. I said, D - n you, if I had my mare, I would never lose sight of you. Upon that Harford said, No, come along. He genteelly bid me good morning, and squeezed my hand, as lovingly as if he had been my brother. As the coach was going away, my wife said, What a likely young man that is that was on my side of the coach! he resembles very much our boy, we have just lost. I said, So<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170016"/> he does. That was Fowler. In less than half an hour after; my own waggon came up with greens, and all my milk-people. The turnpike-man told my waggoner and the milk-people, that I had been robbed. A milkman said he had just met them all five: that he had met them before, and knew they resided about Grub-street and Moor-lane. In the morning, I got some of Mr. Wilmot's people, and took four of them together; the other two I was not so sure of. The prisoners I am certain to: I had them in my eye a long time together.</p>
               <p>(Two hangers were produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Allen. This is the one that Harford had, that was first presented to the outside of the coach; and this other is the hanger which the other wantonly jobbed into the outside of the pannel of the coach.</p>
               <p>Fowler. What mark do you swear to me by? - When he robbed me, he had a brown great coat on: it was as light as day. I saw him as plainly as I do now. The other prisoner brought me the hat open; and I likewise saw his face as plainly as I do now: they had nothing over their faces.</p>
               <p>And you have no doubt in the world about their persons? - None.</p>

               <p>I took Fowler. I asked him where he lodged; he said at No. 12, in Honey-suckle Court, Grub-street. I told Wade it was necessary to go and search, as Mr. Allen had made mention of some hangers. Accordingly we went. I was searching the bottom of the closet, and Wade put his hand on the shelf, and found these hangers. I found two brown coats in the house, which Fowler claims to be his. We took two more besides the prisoners: they were very much intoxicated. Mr. Allen could swear to only the two prisoners, therefore the magistrate discharged the others.</p>
               <p>To Allen. Were the persons who robbed you, much in liquor at the time? - No: they appeared perfectly sober; so sober, that they told the money, and found that a guinea was wanting; and they came back to pick that last guinea up.</p>

               <p>Harford. When I was taken on the Wednesday morning, that man asked Mr. Allen if he knew me: he said he thought he knew my voice. I was taken to Mr. Wilmot's: he was asked if he could swear to me. He only said, he believed he could swear to me. They trembled so, the court took notice of it. I was remanded, and the next day, he positively swore to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Allen. The first day, I swore positively to him.</p>
               <p>(The information taken by the justice, was read in court, and exactly corresponded with the evidence now given by the prosecutor.)</p>

            . The prisoner, Vining, had been to Hounslow. She asked me to let her go up stairs, and sit down. It was a little before tea. I asked her to drink a dish of tea. I went to the Life-Guards to my husband, with a bason of tea. She said she would stay till I came back. I looked at the watch when I went out: it wanted a quarter of six: when I came back, she was gone. The watch was missing. I left nobody in the house, but herself. She had left the street door open. The watch was taken from the chimney-piece. I made enquiry after her: I found her yesterday was week, at an alehouse, in Middle-Row, St. Giles's, and she owned she had stolen the watch. My husband lodged her in the round-house. She blasted her eyes, and said she was done over, for Roby was come about the watch. I asked her, what possessed her to steal the watch. She said, she believed, the devil.</p>

               <p>Did you make her any promise, that it would be better for her to confess? - No: I told her I would go to her father, and hear what he would say. At the justice's, she said the watch was at the person's who stands at the bar with her, and that she and the other prisoner took it to a cloaths shop at Westminster, and sold it to a Jew.</p>
               <p>Did you ever get the watch? - No.</p>

               <p>I am wife of the prosecutor. On the 27th of last month about four in the afternoon, the prisoner, North, came into my shop first, and enquired for half a yard of very rich silk. I shewed her a piece she did not seem very well satisfied with. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170018"/> reached her a second piece. In the mean time the other two prisoners came in together, as I believe. Cook I am very positive to; the other I am not so clear to. They asked for a piece of velveret to make a little boy a waistcoat. I reached down several pieces. They found fault with them, and said they were not rich enough; they were too thick; and asked the quantity that would make a boy a waistcoat, about eleven years of age. I said I could not tell, as Mr. Haines was out; he would be at home about six. At that instant North went down to the bottom of the counter, where there were some brown Hollands, and said she wanted some of those brown Hollands. I desired she would chuse out what she thought would suit her, as I was serving the other persons. She said, No, Ma'am; if you please to look. I stooped down to look. At that instant the other two made a courtesy, and wished me a good day, and said they would come again at six o'clock, and went out. The moment after they were gone, I cut her a yard of Holland, at 15 d. I crossed the other side of the counter, to give her change. She observed the other women had behaved exceeding rude to her, and snatched every thing out of her hand. She said she looked upon them to be sailors wives. I said I was sorry; and then she took her change and left the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any appearance of these women being acquainted, when they were in the shop? - Not at all; the other two came in together, and seemed to be acquainted. I went to put the things in their places, and missed a piece of silk. I went to the door. I thought I could have overtaken the last woman, but I had nobody in the house but a little child, and could not leave the house; and I thought the other two must have taken it, because the other was not at that end of the counter. It was black Florentine silk, between fifteen and sixteen yards. It is worth 5 l. and upwards. I could not follow them, having nobody in the house. They were taken up ten or twelve days after this affair, but not on this account.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure Cook was one of the two women that came into the shop? - Quite sure. The other prisoner I verily believe to be the other that was with her.</p>
               <p>Did you see that piece of silk on the counter after North went to look at the Holland? - Yes, I did: There were but two pieces on the counter when she went to look at it.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday, the 3d of this month, about four in the afternoon, the prisoner, North, came to my shop. She desired my boy to shew her something for a waistcoat: he reached her several Manchester silks, and silk and cottons; the piece I lost he in particular recommended to her, as a handsome pattern. While he was shewing her these things, Davis and Cook came into the shop. I immediately went to them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170019"/> to know what they wanted. They asked for some brown linen. I reached them some brown cotton; I cut them half a yard. They then asked me if I sold flannel; I told them I did. They desired I would shew them some; I went to the other end of the shop to shew them some flannel. In the mean time, while I went to the back part of the shop, North fixed on a pattern that was in a book; and the boy came to the back part of the shop where he was to fetch it, and the prisoners were all three left together during that time. I returned to Davis and Cook with the flannel, and he followed me with the piece which Mrs. North desired to see. The counter being rather full, I desired Davis and Cook to walk to another counter, which they did, where I served them with the flannel they wanted, leaving North and the boy together. As soon as I had served Davis and Cook with the flannel, and they had paid me for it, and the brown cotton I had cut them, and they were gone away, I returned to the boy, who was then serving Mrs. North with half a yard of stuff, and likewise a yard of dimity. She paid for what she had cut off, and I was talking to her for some time concerning a piece of silk that lay on the counter, for which we could not agree; she told me she would consider of it, and went away. The instant she was gone out, the boy began to put the things in the window. I believe the fourth piece he had occasion to put in the window was the piece he recommended to her, and which was lost. He called to me immediately, and said there was a piece of silk lost; that was within three minutes after Mrs. North had left the house. There was no person came into my house during that time, but a person I was very well acquainted with, whose name is

It a little surprised me. I did not know what he said. He shoved me and hustled me about. At last, I catched hold of his hand coming out of my waistcoat pocket. He broke his hold, and ran across Moorfields; and he took 5 s. I pursued him, and went down a lane. I cried out, Stop thief! When I followed him down this lane, he turned back again, and came to me, and said, Hush! here is 2 s. for you. I said, You rascal, what do you offer me 2 s. when you have taken 5 s.!

               <p>I am a watchman, employed by the prosecutors to watch the craft. Upon Sunday, the 30th of September, about nine in the evening, I went down to look at the craft. I saw the three prisoners in a lighter of my master's, moving the staves. I told them they were too fine for them. Rutt said, D - n your eyes, how can you tell that? Then they came on shore. I went afterwards to the Watermen's-arms. The prisoners all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170024"/> came in together. They continued there some time, and abused me very much for what I had said before; and two of them gave me a slap on the face. After that, I went to the craft again, and saw Currant carry off two men in a boat. He came back again. The other two prisoners were looking-out at Shadwell-dock stairs. Rutt said, D - n my eyes, we will have some staves now. Accordingly they came into the craft. Each of them had a boat. Currant took twenty-six staves out of the craft, and put them into a boat of Mr. Bowler's, of St. Olave's: I sat in the lighter, and counted them. Wellings stood on one side of me, and Rutt on the other. They d - n'd my eyes, and said, if I made any oration, they would be the death of me. I went, after that, and informed the gentlemen the staves belonged to, and then went over London-bridge, and found Currant putting some staves down the cellar of a public-house. On seeing me, he ran off. I cried, Stop thief! but he was not taken. I am sure the prisoners are the three persons.</p>

I have you! there are twenty-six staves there: he said that to my father: upon which I ran directly a-shore. I said, Very well; there I am. I turned my dark lanthorn round: I said, Who have you? He said, he had been robbed of twenty-six staves; there were three of them that had robbed him. He said he believed he knew one of them; and he went and got Grimes, and another watchman came and took the staves out.</p>
               <p>When you held up the lanthorn, he did not say it was you took the staves? - No: I believe he did not think it was.</p>

               <p>(The other two prisoners said, in their defence, that they had committed another felony the same night, and were in custody before the time they were charged with committing this offence.)</p>
               <p>(They called two witnesses, one of whom swore that they were taken by half after twelve, and were in the watch-house either ten minutes before or ten minutes after one; the other swore that they were in the watch-house about twelve.)</p>

On the 4th of September, about twelve o'clock or a little after, while I was at dinner, the prisoner came into the shop, and said he wanted to buy some watches. He spoke it very well in English. I got up as quick as I could, and went to the window where the watches were. He said he wanted a good watch for his own pocket. I gave him one out of my pocket. He took it, examined it, laid it down, and asked the price of it. I told him it was five guineas, and I should give him a brief; that was, that I would warrant it. He laid it down, and said it would do, and he wanted half-a-dozen more. I told him I had not half-a-dozen ready, but if he would call in two hours, he should have them. He said, No; he could not call in two hours; he must have them then; he had the money in his pocket to pay for them. Thinking him a customer, I endeavoured to make up the half dozen for him, and sat down to get them ready. While I was getting them ready, I saw him put his hand on the show-glass, and take up something; I did not know what. Then I let him stand about five minutes, to see if he would put his hand in his pocket, that I might be a better judge if he had stolen any thing. I asked him what he had in his hand. He put his hand in his pocket, and said it was his tobacco-box. I told him I was certain he had taken something off the window, and I must see it. He then put his hand in his other pocket, and took his tobacco-box out. I told him that was not what I wanted, that I wanted what was in his other pocket. He then took out this watch-case, and threw it down on the board. He asked me then what I wanted with him, for he had nothing of mine. I sent for an officer. He told the officer I had put the case into his pocket: he said that in very plain English. He was taken into custody, and searched at a public-house in East-Smithfield; and this watch was found tied up in the flap of his shirt, between his legs. Before I took up the watch, I described the marks upon it.</p>

On Friday last, I was in company with two or three acquaintances, and drank very freely, till between eleven and twelve o'clock. I was then very much in liquor. I was not able to get on board my own vessel, which then lay at Shadwell-dock. I went out to get some lodgings. I went into <placeName id="t17811017-28-crimeloc132">Elbow-lane</placeName>

I said a friend: they asked me again: I told my name: then they let me in. As<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170027"/> soon as I came in, they asked me for something to drink. I had two sixpences in my waistcoat pocket. I gave them that to drink: then Mary Plack asked me to go up stairs. I went up with her: then she asked me for some money. Upon which I held up my purse, and said, There is money enough to pay you, in the morning, when I can get it changed. She said, That was very well. We then went to bed: I laid my breeches under my head, and fell fast asleep. At about four in the morning, M'Lane came up, and asked for money to buy purl. I had some loose halfpence, I gave her four-pence. She came up again, and said, they were bad half-pence. She laid them on the mantle-piece. There I found them. I slept till about six. I then got up. I felt for my watch first. I found that: then felt for my purse. Instead of the gold, which I had in my purse overnight, I found five half-pence. I will not swear positively, what I had exactly, but I am sure I had thirteen guineas and an half. I received ten guineas, and had three guineas In my pocket before. I am sure I spent none, because I had silver enough to pay my reckoning; and it was only gold, I had put into my purse. I am sure I never put halfpence into my purse. I am sure I had thirteen guineas and an half, when I was sober, that night. When I complained to

On the 22d of September, between nine and ten in the morning, I was alarmed by a person ringing at the bell of my garden-gate, and was told that my house, or garden, had been robbed. I found a print of dirty feet, and the window was open: from thence, I concluded some person had been in that room, and that I had been robbed. I looked out, and saw four people upon the road. I immediately went in pursuit of them. When I got into the road, I saw but three: there were four at first, and then the other three separated. I soon came up with one of them, and with the assistance of a man I called to, I laid hold of him, and asked him, Where his comrades were gone? He said, he had none. After having secured this man, I went into the fields after the others. There was a heavy dew upon the grass, in consequence of which, the track of persons crossing the field, was extremely visible. I followed the track, I suppose, for a mile and a half, towards Hampstead. There I had intelligence from another person, that a bundle had been seen lying in the track. There was a man in the field, one Palmer, a chimney-sweeper. Supposing he might have picked it up, I sent Jones to him, and Jones found a bundle upon him, containing a coat and waistcoat of mine, which had been taken out of that room where I had seen the print of dirty feet. When I went home, I found the two prisoners in custody.</p>

After the man in black came out of the parlour, that man went across the fields on the left-hand side of the road, which is the side next Hampstead. Coleman went down the road, and Smith went up the fields on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170028"/> right-hand side of the way. Where the man in blue went, I cannot take upon me to say, I am sure they are the same people, but I did not take notice of their faces; I only knew them again by their dress.

               <p>I was upon the road, and assisted Mr. Alderton to secure Coleman. I was working at a dunghill of Mr. Alderton's, at Kilburn, a quarter of a mile from his house. That morning, about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner, and two more young men, in company, towards Kilburn. I saw them in half an hour returning towards my master's house. In about half an hour after, the alarm was given, my master came running down the road, and a man was in the field pursuing. My master bid me stop that man in red: that was Coleman. I secured him. After Coleman was thus secured, I went into the fields, with my master, in pursuit of the others.

               <p>I pursued over the fields, above a mile towards Hampstead. I saw two men running very fast; one in green, the other in a dark coloured coat: he ran towards a hedge, and went over a gap. I came up to the same place, and went over. As soon as I got over, on the right-hand side, near the gap, within three or four yards, I saw a bundle. The two men separated: one went into a turnip-field, the other I supposed went on the other side the hedge. I was running on the other side. I could not get over to the turnip field. I turned back, and saw the man in green, (Smith) coming up the side of the hedge. I secured him: he was sweating. He appeared to have been running hard. I have no doubt he is the same man, I saw before in company with the other man. He denied he had been running, and denied he had any company. I mentioned to the prosecutor, that I had seen a bundle at that gap. He sent Jones to a chimney-sweeper, and found the bundle upon him; and when the bundle was found, the prosecutor and I were standing near the gap, where we saw the bundle first.</p>

               <p>I saw two men running over the field. One of them was in a green coat. He in green, had a bundle under his arm. This was on a Saturday, between nine and ten o'clock. They went from towards Mr. Alderton's house to Kilburn: the other was in darkish coloured clothes.</p>
               <p>SMITH's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming a-cross the fields. The prosecutor accosted me. He asked, which way I was going? I said, to Paddington, to see my sister. He said, Was you not running a-cross the fields just now? I said, No. He said he thought I was, but I must go back with him. I said, I was very willing to go with him. Immediately he called a man or two to his assistance, that were catching birds. I made no resistance, but went quietly to the house, and there nobody knew any thing of me, till I went to the justice's.</p>
               <p>COLEMAN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been ill, and was going down the road. This gentleman came by, and said, Young man, come and hold my horse, till I get over the ditch. I went down to the ditch. He said some thieves had been robbing a house. I got up upon the road again. I had not got two hundred yards upon the road, before a gentleman came riding down, and said, Young man, stop. I said, For what? He said, Some people have been robbed, and I suspect you are one. I stopped. A gentleman came up, and then the prosecutor came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170029"/> up, and called to the boy, Did you see him? He said, yes; he saw me go down the road after the men. I came back, and was taken to the prosecutor's house; was carried to Paddington; then taken before a justice, and committed. The boy said he did not know any body: then he said afterwards, we were two of them.</p>

The prisoner came into the shop, last Thursday morning, about eight o'clock, as she had done a morning or two before; and desired to look at some silk handkerchiefs. I shewed her some. She bid me considerably less than prime cost, and by her behaviour in shuffling the things about on the counter, she gave me reason to suspect her. I looked the handkerchiefs over immediately, and missed a piece; upon which the prisoner went out of the shop, without saying a word. I followed her into the street, and brought her into a back-room, and found a piece of handkerchiefs concealed under her petticoats:

I stopped instantly, and missed an umbrella, out of the head of the chaise. I saw a man run: I pursued him, and called, Stop thief, but I lost him. About a quarter of an hour after that, I was in Holborn, in the phaeton: I saw a mob; I went to know what was the matter. I found the prisoner in the custody of a constable. I went up to the prisoner, to look at him. He turned about, and said, Sir, they say I have stole your umbrella. I was informed the umbrella was in a shop in Holborn. I went and saw it.</p>

               <p>On Tuesday last, about half after three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my shop, and desired to look at some printed cotton. My wife shewed her some. I was standing by, serving some other customers. After shewing her different pieces for about ten minutes, she said she wanted some of a pattern she had had three weeks before. She said she would come in two or three hours, and bring a pattern. She went out of the shop. As soon as she was gone, a person came in, and said she had taken something. I went to a stable-yard, and found her at the top of the yard. I laid hold of her, and I immediately saw the cotton in a little area just by. She was much confused, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>(The cotton was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>(The prisoner, in her defence, denied the charge, and called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.)</p>

I saw the prisoner in my apartment. I thought he was my friend's acquaintance, that came to help me, and my friend thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170031"/> he was my acquaintance. He was very busy packing and carrying things away. He was quite a stranger to me, though I find since he lived just facing me. The next day I went about among the neighbours, to ask if they had any goods of mine brought to them from the fire. The prisoner came to me, and said he had three arm-chairs in his room, and did not know who they belonged to; I might go up, and look at them. I went up. Two of the chairs were mine; the other I did not know. I said, If you have any thing else of mine, I shall be obliged to you, and I will satisfy you for your trouble in taking care of them. He said, I have nothing more, that I know of, of yours; but you may look over my room, if you choose it. I said, No; you certainly know if you have any thing more belonging to me: I can take your word. I had a friend with me, and we took the two arm-chairs. When I was in bed at night, I thought, as I had lost a great many things, where the chairs were, there might be more of my things. I got a warrant in the morning. I went with the officers of the justice, and called the prisoner by his name, and said, I had a suspicion he had some goods of mine. He said, No. I said, Friend, be honest; you shall not be hurt, if you will deliver my goods which you have got; for I have a search-warrant with me. He said I might go and search the place; for he had nothing at all. I desired him to shew us the way up stairs. He went before us; and I went into his room, and found all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them).</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say? - He began scolding his wife, and said he would bang her for suffering these things to be brought in.</p>

I saw the prisoner and another man follow the carman's cart,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170032"/> on the 6th of this month, between six and seven in the evening. I saw the prisoner and another man step at the cart. I had a suspicion of them, and followed them. When they had got a little way, I saw the prisoner get up into the cart, and take a piece out, and go away with it up a place called Stewart-street. I went back to our shop, and told the foreman and one of the men. I heard no more of it till Monday. Then the carman coming by, the shopman asked him if he had lost any thing. He said two pieces.</p>

She asked me to walk up. I told her I would not: I was going home about my business. Coming down a little farther, she walked along side of me. About half way down the lane, she desired me to stop, and go home with her. We crossed over the way, and I stood four or five minutes in a dark entry, talking with her. She asked me to go home. I told her, I would not, I had got no money: she said, Yes, I had. I said, I had money, but not for her use: it was two large pieces; I had no change. Oh my dear, she said, never mind that, and put her hand down to my pocket. It rattled, being loose: I desired her to keep her hands off my pocket. She asked me to go home, and see her room. I went, but I do not know the name of the place: it was in a court. Murphy followed us all the way. I asked her the reason of that girl following us. When she came up to the door, she called to her for the key, as the door was locked. She brought the key, and opened the door, and Spencer and I went in. She did not shut the door. I shoved it to with my stick. She took the candle, and put it in the chimney: it was a room on the first floor. I took the candle out of the chimney, and looked in her face, and set it there again. She got her hand somehow into my pocket, and called the other girl in, and Spencer ran out, and slapped the door to, and left me in the room. I was in the room, about five minutes. I clapped my hand to my pocket, and cried out, I was robbed. Murphy said she knew nothing about it; it was Spencer, and not her. I got between Murphy and the door, and stopped her, till I got my cane and hat, and then took hold of her by the hand, and brought her to the door of the entry. She rather resisted a little, but came quietly at last. I called the watch, and in ten or twelve minutes, the Bow-street officers came down. They took Murphy in charge, and took her to the watch-house. Spencer was taken two days afterwards.</p>
               <p>What money had you in your pocket? - I had three thirty-six shilling pieces, and four guineas in gold.</p>
               <p>When had that money been in your pocket before, to your certain knowledge? - When I was standing in the dark passage with her,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170033"/> I shoved a piece of paper close down upon it. I had three half Joes, I suppose eightteen months, in one pocket or the other.</p>
               <p>You missed it just after this girl went out of the room? - Yes, directly, before I lost sight of the tail of her gown.</p>
               <p>Had you been on the bed with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you search, to see if the money had fell out of your pocket? - Yes; I felt on the bed, immediately as I missed it. I took the candle in my hand, and looked all over the bed.</p>
               <p>Had you been in such a situation with her in the entry, that the money might drop out of your pocket? - No. I put my hand to my pocket, to keep it in. Murphy was never near enough to me, to take any thing from me.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing pass between them? - No.</p>

               <p>On Tuesday night, the 16th of October, coming home, about half after twelve, or near upon one o'clock, in the morning, I saw Guy lying upon a bench, at the corner of Bentinck-street, insensibly drunk. I gave a person sixpence, to fetch a coach for him. He was put into the coach, by the help of the watchman. Some time after he had been in the coach, the prisoner, who was the coachman, went into the coach, and I saw him take Guy's watch out of his fob, and put it into his breast pocket: that was before the coach went on. I stood on the step, upon the pavement, at a public-house door. I challenged the prisoner with it, and he gave it me from an inside pocket of his great coat. He drove his coach to the watch-house, and willingly gave himself up into custody.</p>

He said, No, I have not robbed the man of his watch: if you are his friend, here it is. I said to Mr. Witty, If you mean to swear to his robbing the man of the watch, you had better charge the watch with him. He said, So I will. The coachman said, Where will you have me go to? He said, To the watch-house. He drove directly to the watch-house. I followed him. He got off his box, and came down, and stood by his coach-door. When Mr. Witty came up, he said, You are the man that robbed the man of the watch. He said, Very well; I am here to answer to it: I did not rob the man of the watch; I meant to deliver it where I delivered the man. I saw half-a-crown and a shilling taken up in the bottom of the coach, that had fell out of the prosecutor's pocket. His clothes were so loose, his shirt was hanging out of his breeches.</p>

               <p>To Witty. Did you see the prisoner so perfectly as to be able to swear whether he took it from the prosecutor's pocket, or off the bottom of the coach? - From his right-hand pocket. I saw him perfectly plain.</p>

Last Sunday, about eight at night, I was coming out of a cook's shop, and ran full-but against this woman. I was going towards the Borough. She said, Where are you going in such a hurry? I asked, What that was to her? or not quite so harsh. She asked me what countryman I was. I told her. She challenged me, and then I knew her. Said she, I have got a lodging by here, you may lie in the same room. Being up all night, and tired, I went to bed, and to sleep.</p>
               <p>And in liquor too? - Not so much in liquor but I knew what I did.</p>
               <p>Was you sober enough to know who was in the room with you when you went to bed? - Nobody but she: it was her room: she had the key in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Did she go to bed too? - No. I fell asleep, I suppose, in a very short time. In the morning, I waked. I looked, and had lost my breeches, and all my clothes, except hat, shoes, and buckles. The prisoner was not there when I waked. She had left the key. As I went down, I found the stockings I had worn, bundled up. She had dropped them. I missed every thing but my hat, my buckles, my shoes, and shirt. The door was open. The stockings were tied up in a twist. In the morning, the woman of the house said, She dared say I might find her at a public-house in the Tower.</p>
               <p>Who did you find in the house? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Is it a ground-floor? - A chamber: it went up a passage to the place. There was some mutton there.</p>
               <p>Did she sup? - I took one potato out of the dish. We sent for a pot of beer. After she was gone, I took fast asleep; and when I waked, I missed all my things.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the door was locked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170035"/> when you went to sleep? - No. I found the prisoner along with this man she keeps, or he keeps her, in the Tower alehouse, the next day: they were in a settle together. When she came before the justice, she told him she pawned the stockings and neckcloth in the Strand. We went there. She only made game of us. But I am a little beforehand in my story. In the morning, I called a poor man, and told him I was naked there. Just as I was going to send the man for some clothes, an old woman brought my own coat, waistcoat, and breeches, which I had lost. She said she had been at the Tower, and the man said, D - n it, I don't mind robbing a man, but don't leave him stark naked. When the woman returned them, she said, You are not to hurt me, but to give me sixpence. Poor old woman! said I, I have not any: all my money is gone. I lost my clothes, and 15 s. in money. I took her to the justice. There was a pair of new cotton stockings I had with me, to put on, which she kept. The prisoner made several low courtesies to the justice, and always thanked him, and made a good deal of fun; and he told me he would be here.</p>
               <p>Did you never find your neckcloth, your stockings, nor your money? - No; only what was brought back. If I could have got only the neckcloth and stockings, I would have let her off about her business: but the justice would not let me; he said he would come and seize 40 l. upon me, if I did not prosecute. The woman that brought the bundle, brought it in a confused manner, and may-be she might have dropped it out.</p>
               <p>Was you sober enough to be quite sure that this was the woman you was in the room with? - Yes; but she looked better by candle-light than she does now by day-light.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding that small difference, are you sure it is the same woman? - Yes, I am positively sure of the woman; but then the old rag-woman might have had the money as well as her.</p>
               <p>Then, if it was not for this 40 l. you are not very angry with this woman in your heart? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. She is your country woman? - Yes, I had known her before.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Coming along St. George's fields, this gentleman overtook me: said he, I think I know something of you; where are you going? I said, over Westminster-bridge. He said he lodged in Westminster. He said, I have been having my supper, and had some pig; I should like you to have some. Said he, Did not you live at Maidstone? I said, No. I told him where I had lived. He said he knew me very well. He came with me. When I came over the bridge, I said, I wish you good-night. He said, Oh! I live a little farther. I said I did not know any thing of him. He still followed me home. When I came home, I went up stairs. He fell a-eating my victuals. I said, Instead of eating my victuals, I wish you would go about your business. He said he was tired: he pulled off his clothes, and flung them out of window; he hit me a slap on the face; and I went away much frightened. I never saw any of his clothes or money. I threw his clothes out of window, and told him, if I had strength, I would fling him out too. He said, Then I shall go about my business. The next day, he came to me, and said, Some old woman has brought the clothes; I don't know whether it is you or she. I will not tell lies; there was no woman in the room but me at that time.</p>

I saw them come out of Grub-street. Billings made a stop in Chiswell-street; the other said, Blast you, go on. I asked her what she had got there; and the other woman said, It was only an old blanket used at that parish chapel, and they found it there. When I was going to take Billings, the other prisoner was going away. Billings said, For God's sake, do not let that woman go away. I took them both to the watch-house. At the watch-house, Billings began to cry, and was very willing to tell how she came by it.</p>

Several things were missing, which her mistress charged her with taking. Her box was examined, but nothing found. I paid her her wages, and discharged her, and heard no more of her till last September, when I was informed she was taken up on another charge, in consequence of Mrs. Deacon coming to our house. The prisoner's box was searched, and a silk gown found.</p>

               <p>While the prisoner lived in my service, I lost the things that are mentioned in the indictment. Her box was searched, and she was discharged, upon nothing being found. My sister found the gown. When she was taken up, it was brought to my house by my sister. I was told the petticoat was found in the prison. I saw it at the Mansion-house.</p>

               <p>I am sister to Mr. Cayley, and live in the same house with him. Mrs. Deacon came to our house the day the prisoner was committed, and said the box was open; that if I had a mind to see if there was any thing of Mrs. Cayley's, I had better go. I went. The box was open in the cellar. The first thing that lay uppermost was Mrs. Cayley's gown. I brought it home, to shew Mrs. Cayley; and it was sent back to Mrs. Deacon's house, and the constable took it before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>- DEACON sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep a green-shop, No. 4, Camomile-street. The prisoner lodged in my house. She was with me a fortnight. She was taken up on suspicion of robbing me. Her box was in my cellar. I would not let her keep it any where else. She lay along with me. I am a widow. The box was not locked, nor the cellar; but there was nobody else in the house, except a girl of ten years old. I took her up on suspicion, on the 17th; and a constable examined her box.</p>
               <p>Was you present? - Yes. The box was opened, and that silk gown lay on the top, upon two more silk gowns. After her examination, she owned to the petticoat, in the Poultry counter, and she pulled it off her.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Young. I lay in the shop. On the 22d of September, between two and three in the morning, I thought I saw a light in the parlour. I sat up in my bed, and looked through the parlour-window, and there I saw a man, with a dark-lanthorn, dressed in a lightish coloured great coat, and a round hat. I got up softly, and went up stairs, and called Mr. Young. He called a watchman, that was passing by. We then armed ourselves, and went down stairs. There were two plates taken out of the sky-light which looks into the parlour, and a ladder let down into the room. I then went, and opened the door. Two watchmen were at the door, with the very man I had seen in the parlour. I knew him by his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170038"/> size, his great coat, and his round hat. I had not an opportunity to observe his features, but I know him by those circumstances. I then believed, and still believe, from those circumstances, that it was the same man I had seen in the parlour. Another watchman came out with a silver mug, and candlestick, and said he had knocked down the prisoner, and taken them out of his hands.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. About half after two o'clock, Mr. Young called Watch, three times. As soon as Mr. Young drew in his head, two men rushed out of an empty house, next door to Mr. Young's. The prisoner was one. I pursued, and kept sight of him, by his light-coloured coat, (he described him in his dress, exactly as Ord did.) I overtook him in Ave-Mary-Lane, and knocked him down with a staff. I found this mug, and candlestick, (producing them). I gave him to two more watchmen. I then carried the things to Mr. Young's, who owned them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing at all about it. The man said, he knocked me down. I asked them all at the watch-house, to look at me, to see if there were any marks of my having been knocked down.</p>

               <p>Was you present when the prisoner was taken? - I was the first next to Frogley, that laid hold of his collar. I saw Frogley lay hold of him.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you see the prisoner before Frogley laid hold of him? - I saw a man running before Frogley. I was running in pursuit of the man. Frogley was running before me. He called out, Stop him!</p>

               <p>You did not see Frogley strike him with his staff, and knock him down? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor take any thing from him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was it possible for him to knock him down, and take a mug and candlestick out of his hand, without your seeing it? - I should think not.</p>
               <p>How far were you from him? - About five or seven yards.</p>
               <p>You did not hear him say he had found any thing upon him? - Not till he got into Mr. Young's house. The prisoner was dressed in a light-coloured great-coat, and round hat.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was coming up Ludgate-hill, and I saw a mob. I asked what was the matter. They said a house-breaker was taken. I stood among the mob, as the rest did. I saw a tallish man come up; he said, Here it is! here it is! and they had a youngish man in custody; who he was, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Look if you see the man in court. - I cannot say I do: he was a man, tallish, like me.</p>
               <p>Court. What had he in his hand, when he said, Here it is! - I can't say: it looked like silver.</p>
               <p>Where did he come from? - Out of some house; but I cannot say whether it was a dwelling-house, or an empty house; and they took him, and carried him round St. Paul's church-yard. They went away, and I followed him.</p>
               <p>What house did the man come out of who said so? - I can't say what house in part ticular.</p>

               <p>Court. Was it a house upon Ludgate-hill? - It was a house upon Ludgate-hill.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A plumber.</p>
               <p>How came you here to give evidence? - I was talking of it in a public-house at Billingsgate. There is a poor fellow, said I, taken about house-breaking, and carried to the watch-house, upon suspicion. A certain person happened to be there: she said, I will take care you shall come to tell the truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>How came you or this woman to think that what you have said now should be material for this man - that you should say you saw somebody come out of the house, and say, Here it is! here it is!? - I spoke it inadvertently: a woman gave me a subpoena, that I must come, or should not work any more at my trade, nor any thing else.</p>
               <p>But how did that woman, or any body else, know that you could say any thing for the prisoner? - All I know, I have told.</p>
               <p>Did you know what the watchmen were to say? - No.</p>
               <p>Where did you first say any thing of this? - At the Rising-sun.</p>
               <p>Who was it there that said she would have you upon the trial? - A woman that buys oysters.</p>
               <p>Do you know who that woman was? - Her name is Nancy, I believe

               <p>What is she to the prisoner? - Nothing that I know of.</p>
               <p>And she said you should come upon the man's trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was this after the affair happened? - On Monday, I think.</p>
               <p>When did the affair happen? - It was on a Saturday.</p>
               <p>And this was last Monday? - Last Monday, when she brought me a subpoena.</p>
               <p>To Ord. Have you any certainty that the man that was brought back by the watchmen was the man you saw in your master's parlour? - He had the same dress, and appeared to me to be the same; the transaction was almost immediately after: it was all done in a quarter of an hour, I suppose, or less.</p>
               <p>To Frogley. Where did you first seize the prisoner? - Coming out of the door of the empty house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170040"/>What did you go back for to the empty house, after you had delivered the prisoner to the watchmen? - To see if any body else was concealed in the house. I searched from the top to the bottom of the house.</p>
               <p>Where did you find this plate? - In his own hand.</p>
               <p>It was after you had been in the empty house, you went with the plate to Mr. Young? - I went to the door, and saw the door open; that was before I went into the empty house.</p>
               <p>You said, that when you had taken this man, you delivered him to the other two watchmen, to carry him with them, and then ran immediately to the empty house, to search it? - I did.</p>
               <p>How, then, came you now to say you took the plate to Young before you went to the empty house? - No: I went to the empty-house door first; they were so thronged with people, they went in before me: then I went to Mr. Young, and asked him if this was his property; and then I went to the empty house.</p>

He was let in, and came up stair, and asked me if I had not received a letter out of the country. I said I had not. He said he had walked thirty or forty miles. I asked him to sit down, and gave him some refreshment. I had occasion to go down out of the kitchen. Going up again, I met him on the stairs. He said he was rested enough, and would go; and wished me a good day; and so did I him. About five minutes after he was gone, I missed a silver spoon off the shelf. On the Wednesday following, he came again, and asked me if I had received the letter. I desired him to sit down, and have a dish of tea. I sent for a constable, and charged him with the prisoner. He denied the fact.</p>

               <p>The prisoner brought the spoon to me, on the 27th of September. He said he had come a journey, and wanted money, and asked me to buy the spoon of him. I said I did not want it.

Every thing was safe and fast. I got up between five and six in the morning. I found a back-door, in a back-kitchen, which opens into a field, wide open; and found the casement in that room open, and several panes of glass broke: the shutter, and the bar which fastened the shutter over-night, were down upon the ground. It appeared to me somebody had entered that way. There was another window in the same room, which had been attempted; but that was too strong: they did not, I conceive, get in that way, but the other, and got out at the door. I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them): they were afterwards produced before the justice: I know they were what I lost. The prisoner Wood lived with me about five years ago.</p>

               <p>I am a mason, at Homerton. That morning, about half after six o'clock, I saw the two prisoners going by, at Homerton, which is four or five miles from where Mr. Twydale lives: each had a sack. I observed one of the sacks rattled. I suspected them. I got some neighbours to assist. After following them a considerable way, they dropped their sacks, and ran away. Wood, after some time, owned that the property which was in the sacks belonged to Mr. Twydale, of Nightingale-hall. He said, there were some other things left behind; and they took us to the place where three copper saucepans were left; and they were found accordingly in a hedge, near Mr. Twydale's house.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Collins and Mr. Aikin deposed, that they saw the prisoners throw down the sacks, and run away; and that they followed them till they were taken.)</p>

               <p>The justice begged me to tell the truth: I did it absolutely. I have good friends in London, but have not applied to them. I was going down to Hertford: Wood was before me. He stooped down, and picked up this property. He said, There is something; will you help me carry them? So I did. I told him I had been a land-steward, and brought up well: but I have not sent for my friends.</p>

               <p>How old are you? - I shall be fourteen next Christmas-day.</p>
               <p>Do you know the nature of an oath? - Yes: if I take a false oath, I shall go to hell. To take a true oath is what ought to be.</p>
               <p>What happened in your father's house on the 4th of September? - About eight or ten minutes before four o'clock in the morning, on the second day of Bartholomew-fair -</p>
               <p>How do you recollect the time? - I heard St. Andrew's clock strike four just after. A dog, that lay under the bed in my room, barked, and waked me. I looked about, and saw a man sitting on the sill of the window, with his feet on the top of a chair. It was a lightish night, but not very light.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough for you to discern what this man was about? - Yes: he came from the dining-room window, and walked round the room where I lay.</p>
               <p>Were your curtains drawn? - No: I had no curtains. We have a Beauset in the corner of the room. I heard the man go to it, and rattle something like china. Then he went round one side of the room, and went to a slab between the two dining-room windows.</p>
               <p>Could you see him all the time? - Yes; I kept looking on him while I could see him.</p>
               <p>Did he look at you? - Not at that time. He took something from the slab, and gave it out at the window; what it was, I cannot say: it was not light enough for me to see, as his back was towards me. He came round the dining-room again, and he came to my bed, and stood up and looked into the bed.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity at that time to look at his face? - Yes, all the time. I was very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of his face? - I took as much notice of him as I could. He went from my bed out into the passage, and shut the door; and I heard him go into the kitchen, that is opposite the dining-room. He came into the dining-room again. He walked round it. He went out then, and shut the door after him.</p>
               <p>He said nothing to you? - Not a word.</p>
               <p>What became of the dog; did he continue to bark? - No; he never barked after the man was in the house. What became of him, I do not know. In the morning he was below stairs. Then the man went down stairs, and I heard him unlock the shop-doors. The iron bar, that goes across, fell down. After that, I heard him lifting up the shew glass. We had two on the counter. In lifting up the shew-glass, the flap fell down, and made a great noise. After that, I heard the found of the plate on the counter. I got out of bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170044"/>Did you dress yourself? - No; I did not. As I was getting out, I heard the found of the man coming up again; upon which I went into bed; and the man came into the dining-room, and went round the room again.</p>
               <p>Did you cover yourself with the clothes? - They were not over my face; but they were so high, nobody could see me.</p>
               <p>Did you see him, when he came into the room again, so as to know whether it was the same man or any other? - I did: it was the same man. He went out again, and shut the door after him.</p>
               <p>You thought he did not see you? - I thought he did not and could not see me.</p>
               <p>How do you account for it, that your face not being covered, you could see him, but not he you? - Because I lay in the dark, and the light was fronting me: there are two folding-doors.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay in the room? - Not long: he only walked round the room, and went out, and shut the door after him.</p>
               <p>I suppose you did not stir in bed? - Not an inch: I lay as still as I could. After I heard he was down stairs again, I attempted to get up; but I heard him come up a gain. I went into bed, and covered the clothes over me. He came into the dining-room, and walked round it a third time, and then went out and left the door open.</p>
               <p>Did he come to the bed again? - No; he only looked, as he walked round, to see, I suppose, if I lay still: upon which, after I thought he was down stairs, I got up, and ran up stairs, as the door was open, and alarmed my sister and the servant-maid. As I was going up stairs, I heard the street-door shut. I thought, then, they were gone out of the house. I alarmed the maid and my sister, and told them, There were thieves in the house, and I thought the shop was stripped, and desired they would get up. We opened the garret-window, to give the alarm out of doors. We looked out, but there was no person going by at the time.</p>
               <p>Who opened the garret-window? - I will not be positive; I think it was me. They dressed themselves; and we came down. I thought, as my papa was out, I had better go to the beadle, and get him to go with me to my father, at Islington. I did so. The shew-glasses were open, and all the plate was taken out.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this window was fastened over-night? - I believe it was; because, if it had been open, I should have heard the carriages and the people very plainly in the street.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the magistrate, and give a description of this man? - Yes; I told them it was a tallish man, in a brown great-coat. They asked me if I thought I should know him: I said I should.</p>
               <p>Can you say, from what happened that night, that you could point out that man again? - Yes (looks at Todd); that is the man that entered the window, and sat on the sill of the window. I went to a house along with Jellous, and some of Sir

               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Had you been fast asleep when you first heard this man? - I had: I was waked by the dog.</p>
               <p>Can you tell how long you had been asleep? - I cannot: I went to bed, I believe, about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>You went with the justice's men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many? - I believe five.</p>
               <p>You knew them? - Not all: I know Jellous, Clark, and that other man (pointing to Prothero.)</p>
               <p>Who was in the front-room when you went in? - Only the master of the house and this man.</p>
               <p>Did you know upon what you were going to that house? - Yes; they said, Perhaps I should see the man. I knew him directly, as soon as I saw him.</p>
               <p>You was waked, by the barking of a dog, out of a sound sleep? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning? - Eight or ten minutes before four o'clock.</p>
               <p>How came you so certain to the time? - Because I afterwards heard St. Andrew's clock strike.</p>
               <p>You said it was lightish, and not dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170045"/>What is your idea of lightish? - It was so light that I could see.</p>
               <p>Court. There was, then, a moon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any light burning in your room? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner any lanthorn, or light? - Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>I take for granted you was under some terror of mind? - I was.</p>
               <p>Were you greatly frightened? - I was, when I saw the man.</p>
               <p>Did not that fear take off your observation? - It did not.</p>
               <p>You was in perfect recollection? - I was; because I thought I should come to see the man again.</p>
               <p>How came you not to get up, when you heard the noise? - Because there are generally noises in the street. He was sitting upon the fill of the window, with his feet in the chair.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation as to the person of this man, before you saw him? - No.</p>
               <p>Because I understand the description you gave of the man was, he was a tallish man, dressed in a brown coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that all you was to know the man by? - No.</p>
               <p>What is there particular about that man, that you should know him again? - Is it not likely, if I saw a man five or six times, that I should know him again! I took observation of him on purpose, because I thought what it would come to.</p>
               <p>Did not you hide yourself under the bedclothes? - I pulled the clothes up so that it was impossible the man should see me, though I saw him. I kept my eyes fixed upon him all the time.</p>
               <p>And you now positively and roundly take upon you to swear that is the man? - I can, and do.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Did your father go out of the house that evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At what time? - I believe, past nine; for I went to bed directly as he went out. I believe I was undressing me while he was in the room, and he went out directly. I believe I might be in bed before the door was shut.</p>

               <p>What quantity of plate might you lose? - I suppose somewhere about 200 l.; but I can't speak positively; I do not know my own loss.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you ever been able to recover any of it? - No, none.</p>
               <p>Did you go with the officers and your son to the house? - No, not where he was taken. On Tuesday morning, the 4th of September, I had a message brought me, to Islington, that my house was broke open, and the greatest part of my property taken out. When I came home to my house, at Holborn-bridge, I looked round; it was a dismal aspect to behold, indeed! I endeavoured to recollect, as well as I could, some of the principal things I had lost. I put them down upon paper. I thought it was expedient to go directly to Bow-street. I took my son, and the beadle of the parish, with me, and laid an information there of what I had lost, as near as I could then recollect. My son described the person to the officers, at Bow-street. They seemed to have some kind of an idea of the persons; I don't know how they gathered it; but they said, if I would come again about eleven o'clock the same morning, they would endeavour to get me all the intelligence they could as to my property and the persons.</p>

               <p>How did your son describe the man, at Bow-street? - To be rather tallish, in a dark brown coat. I was there in the morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I believe, at Bow-street. At eleven o'clock I went back again. They said they had heard nothing about the property, and gave me no encouragement. The affair happened on Tuesday, the 4th of September. On Saturday, some of the officers of Bow-street called at my house, and begged of me to let my son go along with them. They said they were going in quest of the persons that had robbed me, and they would take him to some of the public-houses where they suspected some of them were. I consented to his going.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170046"/>Had your son said any thing to them, that he should know the man again? - At the office he had before said he should be certain to the man whenever he saw him, or to that purpose. I consented to his going with the officers. They had him out for some time. I learnt, when he returned, that, after going to some public-houses, they had carried him to that where they had lit of Todd, at the house of one Claxton, in Old-street.</p>

I did not go into more than one house with them. They went to a good many houses, through Grub-street, Whitecross-street, Barbican, and that neighbourhood; and they told me not to come in till they bid me.</p>

               <p>I was one of the persons who apprehended Todd. I was at the office when Mr. Sharpe came to give information of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Was the child with him? - I can't say. We called upon Mr. Sharpe, desiring the son might go with us; for we understood by the father that he could give information of the person. The first house Clark, I, and Prothero, went to, was in Golden-lane. The son stood outside, while we went in. We came out there, and went to a house in Old-street. The little boy was then left outside the door. We went in, and sat down there. Mr. Clark desired the son might be beckoned in. It might be at that time two o'clock or after. He came in. Mr. Clark desired him to look round, and see if there was any body there he knew. He said, There was; and that the man he knew was reading the newspaper; which was the prisoner Todd. I searched him immediately, but found nothing of Mr. Sharpe's upon him. The son went home to his father, and then came to the office after us.</p>
               <p>How many of you were there? - Four of us, the prisoner at the bar, and another. The man of the house was there; he went backwards and forwards; but I believe at that time he sat down; and I think, before the prisoner went away, two more came in.</p>

               <p>I know both the prisoners. On the 7th of September, I was in company with Underwood, at the Angel, Mr. Fitzpatrick's, at Hoxton, between nine and ten o'clock. I took up the news-paper, to read it: I saw an account of the robbery at Mr. Sharpe's house: I told him it was a great robbery. He said, Yes, it was. I was amazed, I said, who could do it. After some conversation we had, he said he was one concerned in the robbery of Mr. Sharpe. I asked him how it was done. He said it was done upon the jump, in the one pair of stairs window. I asked him how many were with him. He said, Only one more besides himself; which I suspected to be one Brockley, who was then in company with him; and Brockley having plenty of money, made me suspect it was he that was concerned with him. I asked how much it might fetch. He said, about 78 l.</p>
               <p>What did you do in consequence of this? - Some time after that, I spoke to Justice Blackborow about the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170047"/>Did you go to Mr. Blackborow yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you there? - I was a prisoner there; and after I was cleared from that charge, then I told this to Mr. Blackborow, and he took my information down.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A smith.</p>

               <p>Whereabouts? - Where I live now, the greatest part of my life.</p>

               <p>Where the other part? - Some time out of town.</p>

               <p>What is alledged against me is false. I had not had this coat ten minutes, when they took me: I had lent it a man for three weeks. They said I had a brown coat on, at the office. When the little boy was asked, he fell a crying, and said, To the best of his knowledge I was the man. The justice said I must go back till Saturday; that a gentleman was coming out of the country; and with the boy's evidence I must be committed till October sessions next. When I came up the Saturday following, there was no gentleman there, only the boy, the same as before. When they came to swear the boy, he fell a-crying, and said, To the best of his knowledge I was the man.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Mounsey. When I came down stairs, at seven o'clock in the morning, I found the dining-room door and the window open. I was the first that came down stairs. I looked into the dining-room; and on the chair by the window there was a a bason and a sugar-basket: the basket was silver, the bason was glass. On the chair, or on the table or window, I don't know which, there was the handle of a punch-ladle; the bowl was broke off, which was silver. On the table there was a plated candlestick. On the floor there were three more plated candlesticks. I looked into the beaufet, and all the plate was gone. I went up stairs, to look into the back-parlour, and a little clock was gone, that stood over the fire-place. I looked into the fore-parlour: my mistress's hat was on the floor; the cloak, to which it had been pinned, was gone. The next thing I saw was, that the house-door was open: the chain lay on the mat, by the door. I went down again into the kitchen, and missed the salts from the salt-closet. None of the things have been found.</p>
               <p>Was there a coffee-pot among them? - A coffee-pot and silver waiter. I went up, and called my master.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any appearance that enabled you to judge what way the persons got into the house? - I can't say, without they got in at the dining-room window.</p>
               <p>Were there any marks of feet? - I did not observe any.</p>
               <p>Was it shut the night before? - I can't say; I was not in the dining-room all the day before.</p>

               <p>On the 11th of September, you went to search Harris's house? - Yes; the house was searched; and I came down, with some of the gentlemen, into the kitchen. One of the gentlemen, I believe Mr. Blasson, brought the cane out of the cellar into the kitchen. I looked at it, and said, I am certain this is my cane. Harris said, Your cane! I have had it these five years. His wife asked me, Is the string yours? I said, No, the string is not mine: for there has been a hole bored through it: my cane had no hole through it: and there has been a new ferrill put upon it; and it seems a good deal shorter than it was. Says I, It is very extraordinary, a cane that you have had five years, that you should have never used it; for the ferrill is neither soiled nor dirty. His wife said, the reason he had never used it was, that the first Sunday he had it, he struck at her, coming from Hoxton, and she swore he should never use it again. He said, He could prove, by several people, it was his. I said, I was positive it was mine, and gave it to the constable, and desired the constable to take him into custody. The next day he was brought before the alderman, and I saw him there. He called a person, who, he said, had been his servant, who pretended to say it was his cane, that she had beat the carpet with it. He was questioned when the alteration was made in the cane: he said, about a fortnight or three weeks before. He said he bought the ferrill at a stall in Moorfields, and put it on himself. He was then asked, If there was a hole through the cane, for the cane-string to go through? I believe they call them pipes they put in for the string to go through. He said, There was. Then he was sent by the alderman, to shew the place. I am perfectly sure it is my cane. I described the marks on it.</p>
               <p>(The prosecutor described the marks in court with great particularity.)</p>
               <p>(Mr. Miller, who was present at the finding of the cane, confirmed the prosecutor in the account he had given of what passed concerning it.)</p>

Harris was at home. He asked my authority. I pointed to the city constable, and he produced the warrant. He requested that one person might make the search. I did; and, going down into the cellar, I found the cane standing behind the stairs. When Mr. Mounsey described the marks of the cane, and said it was his, Harris insisted it was his cane.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Underwood's lodgings were searched? - Yes, both times. We had some difficulty to find out his lodging. We found no property of Mr. Mounsey's there.</p>

               <p>I live by Moorfields. On the 7th of September, the prisoner Harris brought me this cane. I made this hole, and put this pair of pipes in a new string, cut it shorter, and put on a new ferrill. He came for it in the morning of the 11th, between ten and eleven o'clock. There were two men in company with him when he brought it; Underwood might be one: there was a person like him; but I cannot be certain it was Underwood. The second time there was none but himself. I sold one of them a supple-jack for sixpence: he would not have a ferrill upon it: we generally ferrill them when we sell them.</p>
               <p>Is it more likely to be able to swear to that, with or without a ferrill? - There is nothing remarkable in it.</p>

               <p>I am a turnkey. I have the watch. It was given me last Wednesday morning by one of the debtors confined in the gaol. He turned his back to the gate, and somebody gave it him; he said he did not know who. The prosecutor complained to me he had lost his watch, and went with me to the gate, and pointed out the prisoner. There is the name, Sweet Hart, upon the watch.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>TOWNSEND's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am totally innocent of the affair. Fletcher was not at home the ensuing morning after the watch was lost. The man came to enquire for the watch, and said, if it was delivered to him, he would not go on with the prosecution. I knowing nothing of the affair, went and enquired about it. I could hear nothing of it; but soon after heard it was given up. Fletcher had the animosity to me on account of a dog: he told me he would have revenge of me, and persuaded these people to do this for the lucre of the reward upon conviction. O my unhappy body! After we had been drinking together, I was in the yard, with my watch in my hand, winding it up. His brother came up the yard, and said his brother had been robbed of his watch.</p>
               <p>Blakey. I leave myself to your Lordship and the jury.</p>
               <p>To Fletcher. Had the prisoner a watch of his own? - Yes: the prosecutor described him as a man with a watch, and a single iron on. He was the only man in that yard that had a watch.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. When you saw your watch in his hand, did you observe his own in his pocket at that time? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>How do you know the watch he had in his hand was your watch? - I saw the chain: it had four seals to it; and mine was a long chain, with one seal. When my friend hauled the blanket off, I had my eyes upon him immediately.</p>

               <p>Timms. The prisoner's watch had round seals; this is a flat seal. He was standing by the fire, talking to him about his garnish-money, and I took particular notice of it.</p>

             was then gone to bed. I let my master in then: I had shut up the shop that night at about eight o'clock; there are inside shutters to the counters; the shutters were all done up in the windows; there were shelves to put the hats upon; we kept in the window hats loose and in boxes, and there were hat boxes about under the counters: it is a very small shop. My master went out about eleven in the morning, and had not been home all day; upon my letting him in at eleven o'clock, we went up to bed. My master went down into the kitchen, but came up after me immediately; he undressed himself, and got into bed; I was undressing myself. I heard a kind of cracking noise; I said, Here is our old man a coming, (for we had frequently heard a noise before, and we had been used to say, the house was haunted;) I heard it more and more: my master said, Put out the candle; he was got into bed; I said, God! here it is coming, (for it seemed nearer, as if it was coming up stairs;) then I jumped upon the bed; I was frightened, and meant to get my breeches off as fast as I could, to go into bed with my stockings on. As soon as I got my breeches off, and was going to put them under the bed, I heard a knock very hard against the street door; my master jumped out of bed, and took the candle up, and cried out, I am ruined! I am ruined! he said that before he went out of the room, and at that time he could not see the light of the fire; but there was a great noise in the street, and I had not heard at that time the cry of fire: he took the candle, ran up stairs, and cried out, Fire! Fire! and called out to Mrs. Crawford. Our chamber door was, I believe, shut; my master had shut it after him; I had not perceived any smoke, but directly as the room door was opened there was a smoke almost enough to strangle one: I got out of a back window, and made my escape from the fire. I gave an account to Mr. Saunderson, a neighbour, when we were going to be examined, at the White Hart; he seemed very angry with my master: my master said to me, Sure you have not been saying any thing to Mr. Saunderson? I said I have told him you had been down to wash your hands. My master said, Why did you say so? Why did not you say that we both went up to bed together?</p>

               <p>Had there been any material alteration either in the quantity of houshold goods, or of the stock, since you have been in the house? or have they remained nearly the same? - There were, I believe, more hats in the house at the time of the fire than there had been for a great while before.</p>
               <p>Upon his cross-examination he said,</p>
               <p>'That</p>

My master came home afterwards, to some of his company who were waiting for him; he supped, and went out. Claxton came in at eleven o'clock; I went to bed, and left him to sit up for his master. When I let Claxton in, every thing appeared safe in the shop. I had not got into bed when I heard my master come home; I got into bed, and put out my candle: in a quarter of an hour's time my master burst open the door, took hold of me, and helped me out of the window. I left the house in nothing but my shift and cap.</p>

I asked him who was the person last up in the family? he said, the Old Woman. I had not any suspicion that the fire was occasioned otherwise than by accident.

               <p>On the Thursday subsequent to the fire, I heard the prisoner, at Mr. Talboys', give an account of the fire: he said he returned home about eleven o'clock; that he and his apprentice went up stairs to bed; that after they had been some little time in the room they heard a cracking noise, which was immediately succeeded by an alarm of fire, upon which they both left the room, and went up to the Old Woman, whom they called, and all three together made their escape over the tops of the houses. Mr. Talboys asked him who was the last person left up in the house? and he said the Old Woman.</p>

               <p>About half after eleven o'clock I came through between the New Church and Holywell-street to the Talbot Inn; some little matter of curiosity attracted me; I went down a passage about seven or eight yards. I passed the house of Mr. Ballard; I then saw nothing of the kind. I staid in the passage about three or four minutes; then I heard a girl squall. I ran out; before I had well got to the top of the passage a watchman swung his rattle; that was repeated by several more, and before I had well got across the way five or six people were at the door. There was an amazing cry of fire before there was any pummelling at the door. The watchmen came up, and with their staves beat at the door, and some women with their pattens, and there was a very great cry of fire. I stood rather within the middle of the road. The fire was in the left-hand side of the shop: it appeared to me just as I came, which was momentarily from the first cry, as if it was the light of a strong candle; and it seemed to be very near the wall, because the smoak in particular I saw at the top of the cieling, before I saw the flames come; it encreased in a most amazing manner in half a minute; the smoke seemed to bear very strong towards the door. There were, I think, holes in the shutters, and a light over the door. When they broke open the window shutters, the first burst of the flames reached as high, I believe, as the two pair of stairs window: just at that time I saw two or three people come out of the garret window, in their shirts or shifts, and go over the houses: it then wanted about twenty minutes of twelve. It was not above two minutes and a half from the time of first seeing the light till I saw the people come out of the window. I was yesterday in conversation with Claxton, at the Swan with two Necks, St. John's street; he told me there, that he believed his master was innocent.</p>

I bought five guineas-worth of them, and carried them to Newbury. The parcel contained 7 l. 10 s. worth of halfpence: while I was putting them off at Newbury, there was a noise in the town, and I was sent for to the mayor. I told him where I got them, upon which an officer was sent with me from Newbury to London, to find out the man. I was taken to the Solicitor of the Mint; he directed me to go and buy five guineas-worth more, and that Mr. Clarke, and some officers, should be in waiting to take the man. Accordingly I went to Mr. Pengree's: I saw Jones, and desired that he and Holder would bring five guineas-worth of halfpence to the Three Tuns, in Fleet-market: at six o'clock Holder came, with a parcel of halfpence under his arm, and was secured by the Bow-street officers. Jones came when Holder was in custody, and was likewise secured.</p>

The prisoner said, I live in the court, just here. I went out of curiosity as far as the door. A girl came out with a candle. I gave one of the girls twopence-halfpenny, to fetch some gin. The prisoner began to feel about my pocket. I thought of my watch, took it out, and held it in my hand a little time; and then, to secure it, I put it loose in my coat pocket. She saw that, put her hand in, and took it out. She blew out the candle, whipped round the door, and pulled it to, and shut me in. I put up the sash, and got out, and took the girl that went for the gin. I called the Watch. When the watchmen came, they brought the prisoner from another house, and asked me if that was the girl. I said I did not know then; I was in a flurry with losing my watch. On Monday morning I went into the court. The prisoner looked out of the window, and I knew she was the girl. We took her to Justice Girdler's: there she owned she took it out of my pocket, and had sold it to a Mrs. Mealing, in Turnmill-street, for 8 s. I have never seen it since.</p>

He went out of town, and desired me, in his absence, to have an eye to the conduct of his servants. Arnold was to have access to his house. I had some reasons to suspect he had made an ill use of Mr. Walker's library. On some things being missed, the prisoner Wright, who I understood had acted in the capacity of Arnold's man, coming to me, I charged him with taking things from Mr. Walker's. He then said, It is too true: we have taken a great many things out of the house. He specified what things, and I wrote them down in the list. He told me where they were pawned: that there was a violin pawned at Mr. Dobree's, in Oxford-road, upon which they had borrowed 15 s. a very large telescope, which he said was pawned in Princes-street, for half-a-guinea; that two very large books were carried to a pawnbroker's at Exeter 'Change, where they had 4 s. for them. That is all, I believe, he mentioned at that time. I asked the manner in which they managed to get the things out of the house. He told me that it was done in an evening; that he waited below in the passage, with the street-door a little open, and Arnold brought the things to him, and then came after him, and they went together to pawn them. I asked where Arnold was. He said I should find him at a milk-cellar, in a passage in the Hay-market. I went, and found him in bed. I took him before a justice, and he owned taking these things.</p>

I called out for the watch, and cried out, Murder!</p>
               <p>Did you represent your case thus when you preferred the indictment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you no conversation with any one of them? - No: they all came upon me together.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of them? - No; I never saw them in my life. I catched the prisoner's hand in my pocket. I did not loose her hand. Another woman took the money from her. They said, they would cut my hand off, to make me loose my hand. At last, a watchman came. One of the women went to him, and, I believe, gave him something; upon which he said, It was out of his beat, and he would not assist me. I kept hold of the prisoner till another person came and secured her.</p>
               <p>Was you sober, or in liquor? - As sober as I am this minute: I had only supped with my landlord, and drank part of two pots of beer between five of us.</p>
               <p>Did you see her give the money to the other woman? - Yes; it was a very moonlight night.</p>

               <p>To the Prosecutor. Are you sure you never loosed her till you called the watch? - I am sure of it. They beat me, and kicked me; and when the watch came, the others ran away.</p>

I saw it put upon the wharf. About ten minutes after, I was informed, by the ship's company, that it had been cut open, and plundered. Two pieces were found behind an hogshead, close to some hops. I had those two pieces taken up, and carried, with the remainder, on board the ship.</p>

               <p>I am a carman. I passed by the prisoner, when he stood upon the keys, with another man, and his back against this bale. I went on board Capt. Johnson's ship, who was going to Hull. When I came back, while I was tying the rails of my cart, I turned my head, and saw the prisoner, with one or two pieces of green stuff in his hand, within two or three yards of the bale. I jumped out of the cart, to secure him, and he made a run. I turned round, and saw two pieces more, that lay behind the hogshead. The prisoner got clear off, and I don't know when he was taken. I am sure he is the same man.</p>

I had a box, with four guineas: I took one out, and left the other three in the box. I put the box in a drawer. I locked the drawer, and my room door. I put both the keys in my right-hand pocket. I went again to the public-house. In about half an hour after, the prisoner, who sat on that side on which the keys were, went away, and said he would call for me when he had got the hat ready. I waited for him about two hours, and then missed the keys out of my pocket. I had felt them in my pocket while I was in the house. I went to see after the prisoner, but could not find him. I went home, and found the door upon the single lock. The drawer was not locked at all. I found the box in two pieces, lying open, and the money gone. On the 20th of September, I found the prisoner at the Red Bull, in Long-lane. He skulked behind the box when he saw me. Upon my bringing him out, and saying he was the person that robbed me, he said there was another person as guilty as he was of the robbery. I got the key of my room again of

               <p>I am an engraver, in Fleet-market. I saw the prisoner, as well as I can recollect, the first time was in June last. I met him accidentally at a public-house, in Fleet-market, where I used to go to read the newspaper. Finding he kept an academy, I shewed him some specimens of my work, as an engraver, which the prisoner seemed very much to approve. Soon afterwards, he applied to me to engrave a bank-note: I then positively refused, and told him the consequence, which would be fatal to us both; I conceiving at that time it would be a capital offence in both of us. Then it passed on. I did not see him again till the middle of

             falling into conversation, and renewing his acquaintance with me, he said he hoped I was not displeased with him for what he had asked me to do before; and then he asked me again if I would engrave the bank-notes, and offered to pay me 100 l. for the engraving; and, if that was not sufficient, I should have half of the first 500 l. worth that should be negociated. I, upon this second offer, said it was a matter of consequence, and would require some time to consider. I immediately went to Mr. Alderman Sainsbury, and asked his advice what to do. From that time, I having given him this uncertain answer, he used to call on me almost every day, from the middle of August till the latter end of September; and at last, on the 27th of September, he called about noon; and said he was going for a note, to the Bank. He asked me which way he should obtain a note. I told him the method. He went; and I met him again, as he returned. He told me he had got the note; and at three in the afternoon he brought to my house a bank-note for 10 l. He then desired me to take the measure of that note, for a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170059"/> plate. I took it rather less than the note, at first. He observed that, and said it should be the full size, because there was no mark of a plate upon the bank-note; and then I took the measure exactly. He gave me half-a-crown, to pay for the plate. I ordered the plate, and was to have it the next morning; but it did not come. The prisoner called in the afternoon, and he sent my maid for the plate to

I had then laid the note upon the plate, which was the first step prepara tory to engraving it, and I went to work then in the prisoner's presence. As often as my servant came near the window, the prisoner held up a sheet of paper against the work going on, in order that it might not be seen what it was. I engraved the outlines then, and the word Ten, which expressed the sum, was engraved white upon black. I finished this plate on the 4th of October. The prisoner came for it that day, and he was taken up about three quarters of an hour after.</p>

               <p>About the hour of three o'clock, on last Sunday was fortnight, but I cannot say what day of the month it was, I heard words between the prisoner and the deceased. The deceased said, as I understood, What business have you upon my beat? how came you here? I heard Watch! cried by the deceased. I went from my stand to the place of destinanation. In the way, I met the prisoner, crossing right against me, with his stick in his hand, broke in two parts. I asked him what the matter was. He replied, D - n the old scoundrel, I have broke my stick over his skull: he has affronted me three or four times before. I retired to my stand. Presently I went down to the prisoner's stand, which is not a great distance from the place where I stand. He complained against the man, and said, I am sorry my stick was not shorter, I would have given him more; he has insulted me so often. Who is to put up with these affronts? Between the hours of three and four, the prisoner went up to the watch-house, with his stick in his hand, and repeated what I have now told you.</p>

               <p>I was calling the hour of three o'clock, at the back part of my beat, by Hyde-alley, Whitechapel. The deceased holloa'd out to me, Pearce, what is the matter you did not come to my assistance? Your assistance! says I; for what? Says he, Come up to me. I kept calling my hour; I did not think what happened; I knew nothing, and heard nothing. I came up to him. Says he, Feel of my head. I felt his head, and felt a knob. I put up my lanthorn, and saw a scratch, hardly enough to stain an handkerchief. I thought nothing of the blow; and he cried the hour of four and five after that. Then he called to me again, and said, Pearce, have you got any money in your pocket? I said, I have the price of a pot of beer: you say you are not well, and want to drink. So we went and had a pot of beer. We staid about five minutes. He came away, and threatened to serve a copy of a writ on the prisoner. That is all I know. He went home. I saw no more of him. I never saw the prisoner all the time.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the deceased tell you, when he first saw you, who gave him the blow? - Yes; he said Evans gave him the blow.</p>

               <p>I saw the deceased a little after three o'clock. He desired me to look, and see how he was served. I said, By whom? He said, By Evans. I went up to Evans, and Evans began to tell me the affair. He said he heard a noise, and went across the way to his brother watchman, and asked what was the matter: that the deceased replied, What is that to you? you have no business here; keep to your own stand: and the deceased pushed the prisoner three times off the pavement. With that, the prisoner acknowledged he with his stick struck him a blow.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon, and assistant to the London-hospital. The deceased came by himself, and walked into the surgery, on Tuesday the 2d of October. He desired me to examine his forehead. He said, he had had a blow. I examined his forehead, and could find nothing the matter. There was no external appearance of any blow, nor any swelling on the forehead.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170061"/>Nor any extravasated blood? - None that I could see. I dismissed him, and heard nothing more of him till the Friday following. Then the beadle of Whitechapel came and said he was very bad. Mr. Blizard ordered him to be brought into the house. Mr. Blizard took off the scalp, and examined the scull, and found a fracture extending quite down to the hollow of the eyes, through both the plates. I have no reason to doubt but that the blow was the occasion of his death.</p>

               <p>I had been, the day this happened, at Leadenhall-street, to see my sister. The deceased lit me home that morning. One of the watchmen's rattles, in Whitechapel, was swung: the prisoner came over to the deceased, and asked what was the matter. The deceased gave him a rough answer, and pushed him three times, with his hand, off the paved stones into the road-way, and struck him with his hand three times. The prisoner turned his back, and prayed for peace. The deceased held up his staff, to strike him. The prisoner held up his staff. I saw the blow, and one of the staffs broke; which it was, I can't say. Then both the staves were laid down: they struck one another with their hands.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner likewise called a great number of witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

               <p>THE practice which has of late obtained, of giving in most of the news-papers accounts of the Trials at the Old-Bailey, has so reduced the sale of the Sessions-Paper, as to occasion me a considerable loss by that publication; I am therefore obliged (though not without some reluctance, having been employed in that business from almost my childhood) to decline printing any longer the Trials at the Old Bailey: And I request leave to embrace this opportunity of making my unfeigned acknowledgements to the Public in general, and to the Gentlemen of the Law in particular, for that candour to which I am in some measure indebted for the degree of estimation in which the Sessions-Paper has been constantly held for its accuracy.</p>
