                  </hi>. I carry on business as a dealer in stamps at 11, Queen Victoria Street—I have seen the prisoner about three times—he called at the end of July or the beginning of August, and produced what he called a V. R. stamp, similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was a black penny English stamp, with V. R. in the two top corners—the ordinary black English stamp of fifty years ago bad Maltese crosses—I looked at it without examining it much, and told him it was a forgery, and that I had seen it that morning—I recognised it; it had been sent to me by someone else to ask if it was genuine—when I said it was a forgery I referred to the letters V. R., the Maltese crosses being erased and the letters V. R. being printed in place of it—the prisoner was rather indignant about it—he said ho had bought it from someone; I believe he said an old gentleman at Wimbledon, and that he knew it was genuine—I returned it to him, and he took it away—about a week or two afterwards ho showed me an Indian stamp similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it purports to be a four-anna Indian stamp, with the Queen's head inverted—I told him it was a forgery, or rather, that it had been altered, making it a forgery—either the head or the frame had been erased; the stamp was printed in two printings; one had been taken out by some chemical means, and the forged one was printed the wrong way—this was a very few days before 28th August, 1890, and I believe it was a Saturday afternoon—this stamp (No 7.) is a 12-cent. green Mexican stamp of 1868, the colour of which has been by some means changed to brown—that was shown to me at the Police-court; not by the defendant—the green stamp would be worth about 3d.; the brown would be worth from 30s. to 40s.; the ordinary black 1d. stamp, with the Maltese cross</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189202080004"/>
               <p>would he worth 2d.; with the Y. R., from £7 10s. to £8—the ordinary value of the four-anna would be about 2s.; the other might be about £20.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stamp dealer, of 38, Leicester Square—on 12th August, 1890, the prisoner came to my place and produced a black old English 1d. stamp with V. R. in the corners—the ordinary black stamp with Maltese cross is very common, and could be bought for one penny and twopence, but those with V. R. are of the value of £8 now; the price rose last year—I purchased it from the prisoner for £4—subsequently I ascertained that it was forged—that the Maltese cross had been done away with, and the V. R. printed in—on 18th August he brought me this Mexican stamp, which I bought for £15—it is coloured brown—there is a green stamp of the same appearance exactly, except the colour; that is worth very little—I believed it was a genuine brown stamp at the time, and in that belief I bought it—afterwards I examined it with a genuine brown, and ascertained that it had been coloured—I think I saw the prisoner once afterwards, and I told him all about it—when he sold me the black 1d. stamp he said he got it from an old gentleman who had had it in his collection for about twenty years—I intended to return them to him, and wrote him some letter of the kind, but I thought afterwards I had better keep the stamps, and I did not return them.</p>

               <p>I had no stamp to compare with it—you gave me your address, and arranged to give me back the money if the stamp was bad; I always reserve such things if I am not certain—I asked you to bring or send me other stamps; it is my business—you sold me with the Mexican stamp an unused English stamp for ten shillings; that was genuine—I never parted with the Mexican stamp nor with the black V. R. stamp—I found they were wrong by examination, and by showing them to customers—I am not a chemist—I wrote you a letter in which I said I returned you the stamps; I intended to return them, and wrote the letter, and then, on consideration, I thought I had better keep the stamps till I got the money back, and I swear I did not return them—I forwarded the letter without enclosing the stamps purposely—I must have sent the letter in a hurry; it was a mistake. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Buhl interpreted another letter written in German by the witness to the prisoner, in which he said that he must make inquiries about the Mexican stamp, as he believed the colour had been chemically made, and that he had already sent away the black V.

R. stamps; afterwards I did—if stamps are sent to me and I have no similar ones to compare with them, I ask other people—these were rare stamps—about two years ago I bought stamps of Mr. Hart; I had no other business with him, because I heard he was dealing in forgeries—I did not know Mr. D'Arenberg more than a week before this case began—Mr. Theodore Buhl sent him to me, as he could give me information in this case—I had not spoken to him before—I had done no business with him before—since, I have bought some old Indian stamps of him—about three, on the day of your arrest and before it, I saw D'Arenberg in the street at Moorgate Street Station—we arrived at the station together—after you were locked up I went with him and the police-sergeant to your rooms—I was interested in what we could find—we were there from perhaps about half-past six to eight—we watched the sergeant searching for forged stamps and dies; I did not search, but simply looked on—there were papers on your table—we looked in your boxes and cupboards—D'Arenberg helped the sergeant to open the boxes and so on, and I looked on—we were always together in the same room—the sergeant was there all the time; we went with him from the station—on the way I stopped to tell Mr. Phillips of your arrest, and that we were going to search your rooms, and he said he was very pleased that forgeries would. be stopped to a certain extent—I produced the black V. R. stamp when the summons was applied for and the warrant issued—I think I took it back with me; I had it in my possession afterwards, and produced it afterwards at the Police-court on 3rd December—I did not produce the Mexican stamp at the same time, because I did not think it worth while, as I thought the other was quite sufficient to convict you, till the solicitor told me to put it in also—I did not keep it back intentionally; I did not think of putting it in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller at 2, Harris's Place, Oxford Street; I do not usually deal in foreign stamps—on 2nd December, 1890, the prisoner called on me and showed me this, which purports to be a four-anna Indian stamp, having the head inverted—he said he had a very valuable and scarce stamp to offer, and showed me this—I replied, "I am not a buyer of stamps; I do not understand stamps"—he said it was worth £20 or £25—I asked him how much he wanted for it; he said £8—I asked him whether it was a good one—I said, "Will you leave the stamp on approval?" he said, "Yes"—I asked him to reduce the price to £7 10s.; he did so, and left the stamp—I took it the following day to Messrs. Stanley Gibbons and Co., stamp dealers, of 8, Gower Street—I there saw Mr. Phillips, their secretary, and sold him the stamp for £15—the following day, December 3rd, the prisoner came and I paid him £7 10s. for the stamp, and took his receipt—I certainly believed it to be a genuine stamp when I took it—a few weeks afterwards the prisoner called on me and snowed me this blue penny Cape of Good Hope stamp, and said he had another very valuable stamp, and I asked the price; he said something about £3 or £4—I asked him who the stamp belonged to; he said to him and his brother—I asked him to leave it on approval, and to call the following day—I went to Stanley Gibbons and Co. and offered it to them—they said they wished to keep it for examination, and afterwards I received this card from them with pencil writing on the back, "Received one Cape changed to represent a penny blue; detained by us for further inquiries"—I sent the card to the prisoner—the same evening I wrote to Stanley Gibbons and Co.—I never saw the prisoner again—he has never asked me for any more money—I have not paid him anything for the Cape stamp; I did not purchase it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have no knowledge of stamps—if Mr. Phillips had not bought the stamps I should have gone elsewhere—he examined the stamp and then said he would have it—he asked for a guarantee, but I declined giving him one, as I could not say anything about the stamp—I asked him £15—Mr. Phillips bought it on his own risk—I did not sell that stamp on commission for you—you said you were very hard up and had some stamps, and you offered it to me—tin's stamp is the same that was produced at the Police-court, because I looked at it through a glass; it has two water-marks and the inverted head; and I should say it was the same stamp that I sold to Mr. Phillips—I should say the Cape stamp is the same I sold him; there is a gloss at the back of it—on the Wednesday, when the proceedings were taken out, I knew for a fact that the Indian stamp was bad—the sergeant called on me and said I should have to attend as a witness—I made the acquaintance of Buhl and Giwelb in the Court; they did not write to me—I have not paid the £7 10s. back to Mr. Phillips, he has not asked for it, and I do not feel obliged to pay anything back, because Mr. Phillips bought it on his own risk.</p>

               <p>22nd December he called again, and showed me this blue 1d. triangular Cape of Good Hope—I examined it, and noticed that it was a chemical change of colour; it had been originally a 1d. red or carmine—in consequence I wrote this pencil note on the back of one of our cards, "Received one Cape, changed to represent a 1d. blue; detained by us for further inquiries"—I never saw the prisoner—after his arrest I was shown in a pocket-book by the sergeant two Indian four anna stamps with inverted heads, similar to this one—in consequence I submitted the one I had purchased to Major Evans, the expert—I can swear positively that these two stamps, the four anna and Cape of Good Hope, are those I received from the last witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am both secretary and managing director—we have a very large trade—I have ten years' experience—I did not find out this four anna stamp when Reya offered it; I used an ordinary glass, not a microscope; I daresay I spent five minutes over it—sometimes I spend a longer time over a stamp—I believed this was genuine—I sold it a week or fortnight afterwards to Mr. Douglas Garth for £20, and he says he had the stamp in his possession the whole time till he gave it back to me in December, a week or fortnight after this case—I asked him to give it back, and I paid him the money back—we guarantee all our stamps to be either genuine stamps or reprints, according to which they are—Mr. Garth was entitled to believe a stamp bought from us was genuine; that, no doubt, would be his impression—clerks have access to our stamps; we do not lock them up—we publish the <hi rend="italic">Stanley Gibbons Stamp Journal;</hi> Major Evans is editor—we use blocks for illustrations; they are at our printers at Plymouth—we also issue a catalogue with 3,000 illustrations—imitations of stamps could be printed from those blocks, but they would not deceive anyone; possibly four anna and Mexican stamps could be printed from our blocks; the printers are the only other people who have access to our blocks; they come to me, and I send them to the printers—I detected at once that the Cape stamp was bad—it was engraved on and printed from a copper or steel plate, and such a stamp does not exist in blue; the only one printed in blue was printed from a wooden block, and differs from this in every respect—I believe the stamp is altered in its colour—the genuine stamp printed from the wood block would be worth £25 or £30—I have no knowledge of chemistry, but I know the colour is altered from the blurred appearance, and because I know that such a stamp did not exist—Mr. Garth was the first person to whom I showed the Indian stamp—I kept it in my pocket—I did not show it to Major Evans—we fix our catalogue price by the supply and demand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I examined the Indian stamp under a microscope afterwards, and have no doubt it is a forgery, and can give my reasons; the" red portion of the stamp is printed over the post-mark—the shape of the letters in "India" and "anna" is different from those in the genuine stamp—the paper is different; it is very much softened and of more porous nature, and the post-mark is of a brown colour instead of jet black, as it ought to be; it shows the action of an acid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed in the Controller of Stamps Department, Somerset House, and for some years I have had considerable experience in English stamps—this black stamp, with "V. R." in the corners, was originally the same as this other one with the Maltese crosses, which have been removed, and the "V. R." printed on—the genuine stamp, which properly bore the "V. R.," was an official stamp, intended to be used for official postage instead of franking letters; but it was never carried out, although some "V. R." stamps have passed through the post—the value of such genuine stamps ranges from £6 to £8—I should say the black stamp produced by the last witness had originally the Maltese cross, and had been treated in the same way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> To find out such an alteration you would have to get the stamp under a good light—I should think a big dealer, in the business for many years, would find it out—these are not the same types as those on the original; this type might have been used—it is possible to remove the Maltese crosses and to print the "V. R." with these types or with others.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 78, "West Hill, Sydenham—I have been a stamp collector for a large number of years, and have had considerable experience from having stamps before me—the sergeant submitted a large number of stamps to me, and I went through thorn all—I found over 800 stamps either forged, or altered, or tampered with—the Baden stamps sent to Bright are entirely forgeries; very good imitations, likely to pass with any unskilled person, and requiring very close examination—the four-anna Indian stamp is in part forgery; the head has been removed, and a forged imitation of that part replaced in an inverted position, I consider—if it were genuine it would be worth £20 or more—I saw three of them altogether—the colour of the blue Cape of Good Hope stamp has been changed by some chemical process from red—the genuine blue would be worth from £25 to £30, and the red is worth about 1s. 6d.—only one of those had been altered; the others were forgeries—I found a large number of Bavarian and Mexican stamps completely forged—I saw a twelve-cent Mexican stamp, the colour of which had been altered from green paper to brown, which would be much more valuable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should not buy a quantity of Baden or Indian stamps without careful examination—I should have found out that they were bad—I think if Mr. Phillips had examined them as carefully as I did ho would have found them out—I don't think he has had as large an experience of stamps as I have had—I think the Roumanian stamps were good—I have no knowledge of chemistry, but I know it is possible to alter the colour of stamps, and I am quite sure the colour has been altered—it is very easy to do it without knowledge of chemistry—I have altered the colour of stamps with acids, as experiments—I have not got so far as to change a red into a blue one—I know it is easy to take colour out of paper and to recolour it with other colour—the Baden stamps exist in different shades—there are not different kinds of these</p>

I have been merely a collector, and have done a little business in stamps; but I don't understand it so well as these big dealers. Why should not I be deceived if those gentlemen of large experience have been deceived? I have no witnesses to call here."</p>

On 23rd January I received information of the loss of this rope—I made inquiry of Saunders, and was shown three large bundles of rope, weighing about three hundredweight; it was fresh cut and wet—on the 25th I went with Mr. Beechy to Saunders' shop, and he identified about ten fathoms of rope in several pieces—on the 26th, from a description given mo by Saunders, I arrested the prisoners on suspicion, also a brother of Crawford's—they were placed with twelve others, and Saunders picked the two prisoners out without any hesitation—I charged them with stealing and receiving the rope—they denied all knowledge of it.</p>

I now live in Brick Lane—I did live at 4, Old Nicol Street, and occupied the front room, second-floor—up to the 2nd December the prisoner occupied the back room on the same floor with the deceased Abigail Sullivan—the prisoner is a shoemaker—Sullivan used sometimes to work as an ironer—I am a single woman, and live by myself—I did not see much of the prisoner and Sullivan—they were in the habit of drinking—I have heard them quarrelling—I have heard him threaten her, and once or twice he said he would kill her—I have heard noises of quarrelling in their room—once I went in and saw her lying on the floor, and the prisoner standing over her with his fist clenched, and he appeared to be kicking her—I asked him what he was doing, and told him to leave her alone—he said if I did not go out of the room he would serve me the same—I went out—that was about the beginning of December—I remember the deceased, in the prisoner's presence, showing me marks on her arms and face; that was about a week before I went into their room—I only knew them for about six weeks—he gave up his room about a fortnight before 16th December when she showed me the marks upon her, she said that he had said now that he had disfigured her he was going to leave her—the mark on her arms seemed like a cut—I could form no idea what the marks on the face were from, I did not take much notice of them—the morning he left he came and knocked at my door and brought</p>

               <p>the deceased's bonnet and some other things in a handkerchief, and said, Will you take care of these things? she might come to you, and I am going to give up the room"—she had been out all the night, that was the reason he gave up the room; it was a furnished room, there was nothing in it belonging to them—these were all things belonging to her—she came up to me the same morning and said she had nowhere to go, and she lived with me after that—on Monday, 14th December, I went with her to the place where the prisoner worked; he was called out from his work to speak to her; she asked him for some money—he said he would give her some after Christmas—she said she would remain round there till he had finished work—he said, "You must not stop round here; if you do, I shall stick a knife in you"—he then went back to the shop—I persuaded the deceased to come home with me, and she did—on Wednesday, 16th December, about six in the evening, I went out, leaving my baby with her—I came back about 10—she was not there then, but the prisoner was there, he was looking out of the window; there are two windows to the room, with a table between them—I asked him what he was doing there; he told me to ask <hi rend="italic">Abby</hi>—I went out to look for her—I came back in about a quarter of an hour, and as I went up the stairs I met the deceased coming down with the child in her arms—she turned and went with me into my room—I found the prisoner still there, standing in the middle of the room—the deceased said to him, "How did you come here?"—he said, "You ought to know"—she used bad language to him; she had the baby in her arms—she gave the baby to me, and said, "Take your child, I have been your servant long enough"—I said, "What do you mean?"—she made no answer, but walked over to her husband and took up the table to strike him—it was a small square table standing in the middle of the room—she lifted it up with both hands from the ground; she was going to raise it, but I told her to put it down, and she put it down; she then walked towards her husband, as if to strike him—I saw her lift her hand to strike him; she did not strike him, because he lifted his hand to her, as if to strike her, and she dropped her hand; then I saw her stagger towards the foot of the bedstead, away from him—I turned to him and asked what he had done; I thought he had only struck her—he made no answer; he said, "I am going to have a drink," and went out of the room—I turned round and saw that she had sunk on the floor at the foot of the bedstead—I went to raise her up and saw blood coming from the side of her chest—she said, "Oh, Selina!" and that was all—I got assistance, and sent for the police—later on that night I saw the prisoner at the Police-station; I was there shown this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is my property. (<hi rend="italic">It was like a shoemaker's knife, with a long blade, not a clasped one</hi>)—I used it for cutting wood; I had used it for that purpose that afternoon, and left it on the table with the other knives when I went out at six; it was on the table between the windows, where the prisoner had been standing—it had not been sharpened when I left it there—when I saw it at the station that night it looked as if it had been sharpened—I did not use it for cutting bread, I used it for other things, but not for cutting bread—this steel is my property—I used it for a poker; it was left in the fender—I had not seen the prisoner pick anything up when he lifted his hand as if to strike her; he was not near enough to the table to pick anything off it—I am quite sure he did not pick anything up.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 2, Spital Square—I am assistant divisional surgeon—on 16th December, about twenty minutes to twelve, I was called to 4, Old Nicol Street, where I saw the body of Abigail Sullivan—in my opinion she had been dead about half an hour—I found a wound on the upper portion of the right side of the chest—I subsequently made a post-mortem examination—the wound had divided the cartilage of the second rib on the right side—it had pierced through the edge of the right lung, and penetrated the pericardium, wounding the aorta about an inch from the heart—that caused hemorrhage, which was the cause of death—the wound was the cause of death—it was such a wound as might have been caused by this knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was only one wound upon her—the clothing had apparently been opened—the chest was bare—she had on the body of a dress and a petticoat bodice—I think there were stays on; I am not sure—there must have been a considerable amount of force used to divide the cartilage of the rib and cause the wound—there were scars upon her, but no recent ones.</p>

I can clear the goods for you"—the South-Western Railway does not run to St. Pancras—I requested him to call again that morning, and in the meantime I got a constable, and then told the prisoner he must go to the station and give an explanation, and he was then given in custody—he then said if I would go with him to St. Pancras directly he would clear the goods; but if I chose to cancel the transaction he would return the £4—I parted with my money on the faith of the representation he made of being an agent, and having authority to deal with the goods—I would not have parted with it if I had known that only 13s. 6d. was claimed by the railway company—I saw him write an I O U, and to the best of my belief this telegram (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his writing.</p>

Townsend's employ, and he replied, "This is the first time I have heard of my dismissal," and that the railway company would have accepted his signature if they had not received a letter from Messrs. Townsend to the contrary. He denied ever receiving the letter of January 7th, and stated that his telegram related to a letter of January 6th.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a retired merchant and J. P. for the County of Cardigan—I live at 6, Wickham Gardens, Brockley—on Monday afternoon, 25th January, I was at the corner of the Union Bank, opposite the Mansion House, just crossing cautiously to the Globe to catch a London Bridge omnibus, as there was a good deal of traffic—I was surrounded by three or four young men, and hustled and pushed in a</p>

               <p>very peculiar manner in the middle of the road—I said to them, "You need not be afraid, nothing will hurt you"—I got loose, and just as I got to the Globe I saw my watch-chain hanging down, and found my watch had been stolen—I went home, and the next morning I was in the City again, and went to the Mansion House—I was going to give information, and a person spoke to me—after that I went to the Police-court, and then to the station, and gave information—my watch was worth about £20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This was about 4.30 p.m.—there was a line of omnibuses in front of the Mansion House—my watch was safe not five minutes before—I had taken a Liverpool Street omnibus instead of a London Bridge one, and I got out at St. Paul's, leaving several people in it—the ring of my watch was broken, not the swivel—I felt no tug as I was hustled, nor did I hear anything, it was very cleverly done—my coat was open or they could not have done it.</p>

On Monday, 25th January, about 4.10 p.m., I was in the road at the Mansion House, directing the traffic, and saw Mr. Evans in the centre of the road—the two prisoners and a man not in custody hustled him—I drew the attention of my Sergeant, Blean to them—we moved towards them, and they separated and ran in our direction, one in the road and the other in the footway—they met again just by the west gate of the Mansion House, and got on top of an omnibus—the third man ran in another direction—the sergeant went round in front and up the ladder at the back, following the prisoners; I went to the near side and Byron jumped from the driver's seat into the road and ran away; I called, "Stop thief!" and pursued him up the Poultry, and saw Perry arrest him—the prisoners were both sent to the station together—I was there when the charge was read; Hercombe said, "You can't charge me with stealing, for he had nothing in his pocket"—next morning I was on duty at the same place and saw Mr. Evans; I recognised him before he spoke to me; he complained of his loss, and accompanied me to the station—I never lost sight of the prisoners.</p>

I am a clerk in the pension branch of the Admiralty—on 3rd February, 1891, a pension was granted to George James Marsh, of 50, High Street, Poplar, on the usual petition, which was accompanied by this letter, which was signed "Thomas De Mouleynes, M. D.," addressed from Tait Road, Silvertown. (<hi rend="italic">This certified that the bearer, George Marsh, had been under his charge for epilepsy</hi>)—the pension would be forwarded once a quarter—it is necessary for the pensioner to send a life certificate to the Admiralty—we sent him the form in blank, and he returned it filled up, signed by a Minister of religion or a Magistrate, upon which we forward a post-office order for the amount, and when the pensioner, applies for it at the post-office he has to produce a certificate of his identity with the person named, which we also forward to him—a post-office order was forwarded in March and October for £2 8s.—on 4th December I received this life certificate, purporting to be filled up by Marsh, and to be certified by Michael D. Lines, Acting-Chaplain of the Poplar Sick Asylum—it certifies that he has seen Marsh—upon that the money order for £1 4s. 8d. was sent on January 4th, and it purports to be signed and receipted by George James Marsh—it is necessary for the pensioner to attend personally at the post-office, unless excused by medical certificate.</p>

I am a retired civil engineer, of 116, Grosvenor Park, Camberwell—on 25th January, a little after five, I was in the King's Road, and saw the two prisoners and three other men, who shammed that they were drunk—the prisoners closed on me, got hold of my arms, and clung round me, and the others followed up—they pulled me about, and then struck me over the eye and in the ribs, which are sore now, and pulled at my watch, but did not get it off the chain—my head is not well; it is marked, and my body is not well—I called out "Police! and as soon as the men saw a constable coming they ran; the prisoner; ran into a public-house, and out at another door in the next street, and I</p>

               <p>saw them go into the next house—I only lost sight of them from the time they went in at one door to the time they came out at the other—a policeman went into the house after them, and then Fell came out and said to me, "I did not hit you, did I, Sir?"—I said, "We will see about that"—he said, "I am going to run for it"—he ran up the street, and I after him, as well as I could, calling "Stop thief!" but no one stopped him—the constable came out with Walsh, who was taken to the station.</p>

I did not try to get his watch, and if he had wanted me why did not the policeman take me when I was coming down the street? when I got outside I saw the old gentlemen again, and he started to run after me; I ran down Edith drove"—I was at the station when Walsh was brought in—the prosecutor had a severe blow over his left eye, and his under lip was cut through in Walsh's hearing he said, "They tried hard to get my watch, which I value at £11; there were four of them altogether, two in front and two behind; the two behind did not hit me"—Walsh said, "Oh, I D 2</p>

I am a pensioned City constable, and live at Walthamstow—I know the prosecutor and his son—on 9th January, about 8.45, I saw them in Forest Road, in front of me, with their arms linked together, and I had a hard matter to get along, as they were staggering—on the next night I saw them in the Essex Arms, between eight and nine o'clock—the son was showing his knuckles, and said, "I have loosened some of their teeth, but I have got this for it, "pointing to a swelled lip—his father came in a few seconds afterwards and said, "Yes, I have got this for it, but I think they have got the worst of it"—he had a lack eye—he said, "They rubbed me down: they thought of getting something, but I had nothing for them."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know whether the prosecutor and his son had already made their complaint; I did not hear that—perhaps the remark, "I have got this for it," was not taken down at the Policecourt—the Magistrate asked me if the prosecutor was drunk, and I said I never saw him sober—he never was sober, to my knowledge, till this case was pending; I have been in the force over twenty years, and I should not have lent myself to it—I was not asked before the Magistrate what the father said, I stated it to the solicitor—I went to the Police-court on the remand, to give evidence; I did not know who the party was who was supposed to have struck these two—I saw nothing that occurred after the prosecutor and his son got into the Standard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in the employment of the South-Eastern Railway Company, at Maze Hill Station—on 4th January I was on duty there, as a night-watchman; about 2.45 I heard a noise in the booking-office; I went towards the office, and saw a light inside—I could see into the outer office—inside the outer office there is the ticket-office—I looked in through the glass door, and saw two men come from the inner booking-office, the ticket-office, and one standing in the middle of the outer office—I can't say who the two men were—the three men then came out of the booking-office on to the platform; they came through the door where I was—I was standing close to them, about a yard off—the door was open; they passed me, and walked out quickly—it was light—there was a large lamp on the platform, just above me and them, and the gas was burning in the booking-office; they left the gas burning—I could tell then who two of the men were; they were John and Samuel Milligan—the third man came behind John Milligan; I did not happen to have such a good look at him as the others, but to the best of my belief Martin is the man; I am not quite so sure as I am to the other two; I did not see him quite so well—before they came out I said, "What game now? come out of it"—Samuel Milligan made an indecent remark, and then they came out and went towards No. 2 station, called the Subway Station; I followed them about half-a-dozen steps—I did not see Martin then, only as he came out of the door—one of them, I do not know which, said, "you had better go back, or it will be worse for you"—I then went to call the station-master, whose house was about two hundred yards off, and before I got there I heard the police-whistle blowing from the direction of the subway, the direction in which the prisoners had gone—I saw the station-master, and made a communication to him, and then went back to the booking-office; I heard, a scuffle and a call for help;. I then went again to the station-master, and told him to hurry up, and then I went through the station to the subway booking-office; that is on a lower level, under the railway, about eighteen or twenty steps down; I did not enter it; I did not notice anything about. it at that time—I went back up the steps to the down booking-office—I then noticed that the safe had been removed from the cupboard, and the till had been forced—about half-past eight that morning I went to the police-station, and in the charge-room I saw about seven men—I was asked to see if I could identify the three men who I had seen; I looked, and picked out Martin—I afterwards identified the two Milligans; they were put among other men; they were not among the first lot that I saw.</p>

About four in the morning of Monday, 4th January, in consequence of instructions from Inspector Weidner, I went to 51, Addy Street, where the Milligans lived; I waited there till about six, when I saw Martin come there; he was going towards 51—on my approaching him he said, "I am not one of the Milligans; my name is not Milligan"—I was about three or four yards from the door, watching the house—I did not speak to him first—I said, "What makes you say that?—he said, "I thought the Milligans was in trouble"—I said "what makes you think that?" he said, "I don't know"—I said, Where are you going now?"—he said, "To call the Milligans up to go to work"—I said, "When did you see Milligan last?"—he said "I saw Samuel in the Broadway, Deptford, at nine o'clock Sunday evening"—he afterwards said, "Eight o'clock"—I said, "I shall take you to the station on suspicion of being concerned with the two Milligans in assaulting the police at Maze Hill"—he said, "You can't bring it home to me, as I was in bed at the time"—he was then taken to the station—at the station he said, "I can prove that I left Samuel Milligan in the Broadway, Deptford, at eleven o'clock on Sunday night"—I had seen Martin on two occasions before this in Samuel Milligan's company—I had received a description of Martin from Inspector Weidner before I saw him on the 4th.</p>
