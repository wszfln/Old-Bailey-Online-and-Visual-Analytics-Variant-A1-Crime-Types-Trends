               <p>Q. Did you lose any money out of your house any time - A. Yes, on the 19th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did you lose - A. Twelve pounds in notes. The silver I cannot say how much she took: thirteen and sixpence was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it kept - A. Up stairs in our bedroom. I had seen the money and the notes on the morning of the 19th. The door of my bed-room was locked, the notes were in a drawer, and the silver was on a table.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you miss it - A. Between five and six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know whether the prisoner took it or not - A. My wife went to buy some sugar. The prisoner was in the bar before my wife went out. She went up stairs into this room to get what she wanted. She came down stairs, and hung the keys of the room by the fire place in the bar. The prisoner was then in the bar; after that I missed the prisoner out of the bar, immediately after my wife went out. My wife came in again in about half an hour. A woman that lodged up stairs, said your door is open. My wife ran up stairs immediately, and coming back again she catched the prisoner going into the kitchen window from the yard; she pulled her back. She heard a noise as she was going down stairs. I went and found the key of the room in the yard. I was present when the silver was found: ten shillings were picked up in the kitchen, and three shillings and sixpence outside. The prisoner acknowledged that she had taken the money, and said that the girl that lived with us before that encouraged her to do it.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On Saturday night, the 19th of December, I went out to the grocer's. I left this girl in the bar. When I came home my husband said, where is Nell. I said, I did not know; I left her here. He said, he had not seen her since she was gone. When I came back a woman came down stairs, and said my room door was open. I ran up stairs, and found it just to. I came down stairs, and was speaking to the woman, I heard a noise in the yard. I went to it, and catched this girl going into the kitchen window. She was almost in. I took hold of her legs. I asked her where she had been. She said she had been to Mrs. Neale's with half a gallon of beer. I asked her where was the money. She said in her fright she had dropped it from her hand in the yard. She then said, give me the candle, and I will pick it up. I gave her the candle. She picked up a three-shilling piece, and gave it me. I said, I will go with the change of the half gallon of beer, and know what kept you so long. I went into the kitchen and found thirteen shillings and sixpence. It lay on the kitchen floor.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought your husband stated that he found three shillings and sixpence in the yard, and ten shillings in the kitchen - A. No. I picked the money up in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. I understood you that you picked up three shillings and sixpence in the yard - A. I picked up nothing but the key of the room in the yard. My wife did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the money was picked up in the kitchen - A. Yes; I thought it was ten shillings. I do not know rightly where it was picked up.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I picked up thirteen shillings and sixpence in the kitchen; the prisoner picked up a three-shilling piece in the yard and gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been out with any beer - A. No. She said she had, but she had not. I asked her, where she got that three-shilling piece. She said, she picked it up on the stairs. Then we went to look for the keys, and found them in the yard, and then my husband went up stairs and missed the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know how much money was there - A. No. I knew there was money there. I did not know how much it was. She did not own to taking it until the next day at the watchhouse. In the watch-house, the next day, I asked her whether she had any money. She said, she found the thirteen shillings and sixpence on the stairs. I asked whether she had any more with her, and where. She told me she had, it was up the chimney; she did not know how much it was. She said, when I got home I should get it. I had Lae, the officer with me. He put his hand up the chimney into a hole; he found ten one-pound notes, and one two. They were all bank notes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him on the 8th of January last - A. Yes, in the evening, at the time he was leaving his work. I took from the prisoner a quart bottle of gin, as he was going off the premises of his employers; he had the bottle of gin under his smock-frock, near his breast. I had before locked the door, and stopped him from going off the premises. From this discovery I asked him for the key of his corn bin, which he gave me. I then went to his stable where his corn bin was; he wished to go with me. I would not suffer him. I went to the corn bin alone. I found it locked, and the key I took from him unlocked it. I found in the corn bin a wooden can, containing about a gallon of gin. This is the can. I also found a quart bottle nearly full of gin, and one empty bottle. We sent for a constable, and after he was taken in custody he acknowledged that he had been robbing his master for the last two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Sinfield by his directions - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Sinfield - A. A publican, living in Wood-street, Westminster, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutors premises. At Sinfield's we discovered about twenty gallons of rectified spirits, concealed in a box, in stone jars, in his bed-room up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Sinfield on the premises at that time - A. Yes. I saw Sinfield and saw him go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What become of Sinfield - A. He escaped while the officer was in the house. The officer stated to him what we had come about. He absconded.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this spirits such as the prosecutors had - A. Yes. The prisoner stated that he had been selling to the publican, Sinfield, for the last two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell whether these spirits were your masters - A. No, not to swear to them; they were such spirits that we had.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, with respect to this corn him, the key of which the prisoner gave to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any other person access to the corn bin except the prisoner - A. No other person.</p>
               <p>Q. In searching at Sinfield's, did you find any casks of the prosecutors - A. Yes, there were two casks concealed in the bed-room, in the same room where the spirits were. They had not been sent out of the house in the regular course of trade.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found that quantity in the corn bin did you tell the prisoner what you had found there - A. Yes. He said the bottle of gin was for his wife, and he said that he had drained the pipes and collected this gallon of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that gin in the can - A. Strong rectified gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the draining of pipes - A. Most likely it was the draining of the pipes. Our men are not allowed to take the draining of pipes for themselves. In consequence of that we are obliged to allow many customers for short measure, which this circumstance accounted for.</p>

It was 44 per cent. It must be sent out at a lower strength than that; 20 per cent under, or 20 per cent. over.</p>
               <p>Q. On your examining that at Sinfield's could you undertake to say it was yours - A. The strength corresponded to the spirit then in our house. I know it by the flavour in particular, and the strength corresponded. It was very strong.</p>

               <p>Q. After you had apprehended the last prisoner did you go to the house of the prisoner - A. Yes; he lived about an hundred yards from the distillery. The constable knocked at the door and demanded the key of his corn bin. I desired the constable to ask for the key of the corn bin. While we were waiting at the door, which I thought a considerable time, I heard a noise as if bottles were being removed. I thought I heard a bottle break. When we got in I desired the constable to search the house, and in one cupboard he found four quart bottles full of gin; in another cupboard he found three bottles, two of gin and one of rum. The constable then proceeded to search the bed. At the bolster of the bed the constable found two bottles of gin. The constable desired the wife to get out of bed. She got out. He discovered six more bottles in different parts of the bed. We took the prisoner to the distillery, and placed the bottles before him. He said he must confess that he was an old rogue, and that they were his masters property. The constable had the key of his corn bin. He opened the corn bin. We found one bottle nearly full of gin. We told him of it afterwards; he said that he had taken a bottle for his own drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. I need not ask you whether your servants have the liberty of taking gin for their own drinking - A. None whatever. I have examined the whole of it; I believe it to be our property.</p>
               <p>Q. You give your servants a bottle of spirits at Christmas I believe - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Chamberlain gave me a bottle of gin at Christmas, and these were the savings of three Christmas's.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, Russell-place, Bow-street, Covent Garden. I am a widow.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you out on the 8th of February last - A. Last Monday week I was, from a quarter to half past eleven in the evening. I was coming from Whitechapel. I was in the <placeName id="t18130217-5-crimeloc30">Strand, near the bottom of Newcastle-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18130217-5-crimeloc30" type="placeName"

                        targets="t18130217-5-off27 t18130217-5-crimeloc30"/>. I was going along the Strand quite alone. I heard some persons come after me; I turned my head, I looked, I saw three men follow me. I had no sooner put one foot before the other, I received a blow on the back of my neck. I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell by whom the blow was struck - A. I could not. I was knocked down. I saw two men run before me. I arose up immediately. Another man I found by my side. I had my pocket handkerchief twisting round my hand. I found the prisoner by my side; he was trying to take the handkerchief out of my hand. The moment the handkerchief let go I laid hold of the man by the skirt of his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. He succeeded in getting your handkerchief from you - A. Yes. I laid hold of the skirt of his coat, and called out, watchman, stop thief. The watchman and patrol came up, and took him. He was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watchman and patrol came up had he got away from you - A. No; they came up before he got away from me. He was taken to the watchhouse, and the handkerchief was found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose anything else - A. Nothing else than the mantle and pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your mantle again - A. No, sir. I lost the mantle the instant. I was knocked down. It was only pinned. They took hold of the hood, and it was gone instantly. It was not tied.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say anything when he was struggling with you for the handkerchief - A. Not a word, as I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be out so late - A. Sometimes I am out as late as twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You are usually out late of nights, are you - A. Not always, sometimes, generally within these two months.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of business are you - A. Sometimes I take in needle work, sometimes I go out washing, and if I do not get enough to pay my rent I go out. I have a ready furnished room at four shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been out - A. All day almost.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light night - A. It was lamp-light; whether the moon was up I cannot say. It was near the bottom of Newcastle-street. It is not a light part. I cannot swear to the two men, nor can I swear that this man was going with the other men. I can only speak to him as the person that I found by my side, I was knocked down. I was a good deal alarmed and flurried by the blow. I soon recovered. I arose up, and found the men were gone from my shoulders. I saw two men running away. I found this person by my side.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you say you lost your mantle - A. When I was knocked down. It was only my handkerchief that was found upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use any violence to get the handkerchief from you - A. Not as I perceived. He over-pulled me to get it from me. The watchman came up in two or three minutes after he got my handkerchief. I keeping hold of him he did not endeavour to get away as I perceived. I was in a flurry at the time.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 8th, I was out; I heard a cry. I got up as fast as I could. I saw the prosecutrix had got hold of the prisoner by the skirt of his coat. She said she had been knocked down and robbed, and the prisoner was one of them. She said she had lost her mantle. My partner and me took him to the watchhouse. Mrs. Ryan said he was one of them that knocked her down and robbed her. He told me she had knocked him down. I said, come to the watchhouse and settle it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the appearance of being down - A. Yes, he had. As we were going to the watchhouse I observed him busy with his hand under his coat. I said, what is this you are at. He said, it is only my handkerchief; so I took the handkerchief from him. He made no objection to my taking it. The prosecutrix and my partner were before me. When I went in the watchhouse I said I found a handkerchief. The prosecutrix described the handkerchief. She said there was a burnt hole in it; it had been darned up. I said she had described the handkerchief pretty well. I have had the handkerchief in my custody ever since. This is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my handkerchief.</p>

I went after her, and overtook her in Grafton-street, about fifty yards from the shop. I told her that she was wanted in the shop where she had gone out of. She asked me what I wanted. I told her she would be told when she came back. She came back with me to the shop, and produced the articles out of her apron. She had twelve papers of pins in her apron, one pound of thread, a quarter of a pound of cotton thread, and half a pound of thread besides, and two pieces of tape, they were worth eleven shillings, the selling price was fourteen shillings. She then said these articles she got for half an ounce of thread. She said she asked for half an ounce of thread, and got these articles for which she paid eighteen shilings, that she gave a pound note, and received two shillings out of it, and that asked for half an ounce of thread, and had these articles besides, and by her account she paid eighteen shillings for these articles.</p>

            , handling one of the parcels of cotton thread. I made what haste I could back to the place, and by that time she was going out of the door. I asked the witness that spoke last, if he had been serving her with anything. He said, no. I then mentioned the circumstance of the cotton, and said she must have stolen it, and requested him to go after her, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not she given you a note - A. No; I had not spoken to her, nor had she given me a note. I received no money of her at all. She returned back to the shop with the young man I sent in pursuit of her. She opened her apron of her own accord, and took out a quarter of a pound of cotton thread that was missing, twelve papers of pins, and a pound of thread. She was taken into the warehouse, and then she took out half a pound of thread besides. She said that she bought that thread, and gave me eighteen shillings. That was not so. She said nothing respecting the other articles. She said that she gave me a one-pound note, and I gave her two shillings in change. She pretended to have bought only the thread; the price of that thread would be two shillings. I said she had not given me a note. She persisted she had. These are the articles; they are my master's property. I saw her handling the thread, but I did not see her move it from the counter.</p>

               <p>MR. COLNATTY. I live at 23, Cockspur-street, Charing-cross. I know Mr. Merigot, the prosecutor. On the 26th of January last, I purchased two hundred and eighty-four prints at Mr. Dodd's auction in St. Martin's-lane; I knew them to be Mr. Merigot's property. I shewed them to Mr. Merigot; he claimed them. These are the prints that I bought at Mr. Dodd's sale.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Dodd, an auctioneer. Mr. Colnatty purchased prints of me. On the 20th of January last, the prisoner brought me four hundred prints of different descriptions, ancient and modern; he left it to our best judgment to sell them for him. Mr. Colnatty bought a part of them four hundred which the prisoner brought to me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The whole of the prints were in my possession, and all that are not coloured are mine. They are worth five pounds.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

He removed a gown that was hung up to dry on a line; he took it down. My servant was going up stairs about a quarter before seven in the evening, in order to change her clothes. She found the prisoner in the back-room. She ran down stairs, holloaing out, murder. The prisoner followed her very rapidly. He was stopped in the passage. We sent for an officer, and had him taken up. I never saw the prisoner before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the house to get a pint of beer. I asked the boy if I might take the liberty of going into the privy, and as I was just bracing myself up the girl came down stairs. I never saw the club-room, nor did I ever see the gown until it was produced before the Lord Mayor.</p>

I followed him, and still kept my eye on him, and after looking at him some time I tapped him on the shoulder, and told him that I would thank him for a pocket-book that he had on him that did not belong to him. His answer was, that he had none. A gentleman that was standing by the side of him said he had dropped a pocket-book. I picked it up, and saw it was my own pocket-book. This is the pocket-book.

He stood a little while in the shop, and the dog barked at him, and as the prisoner returned he knocked some halfpence out of my hand. I ran after him down Houndsditch, and halloaed out, stop thief; and just as he got by Mr. Groves's, the oil shop, I saw him drop the case. He run on. I lost sight of him before he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was he stopped - A. In little better than a minute afterwards. I am sure he is the same man that passed me, by having an oil-skin on his hat. I observed the oil-skin on his hat as he stood in the shop; it did not fit his hat well. I am sure he is the same man, and a great coat he had. A young lad at Mr. Groves's picked up the case.

            . On Saturday, the 23d of January, I was watching four or five people, near upon six o'clock in the afternoon, in Aldgate High-street, opposite of Three Nuns Heads. I followed them as far as Fenchurch-street; being out of the ward, I left them. I then returned down Houndsditch. I went down to the bottom as far as our ward went. On my returning up again I heard the prisoner crying out, stop thief, and before I could get up, a man had laid hold of him by the collar. I laid hold of him and this gentleman gave me the miniature case.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my miniature case and my miniatures. They are fancy articles. The worth of them depend merely on fancy.</p>

I ran the same as other people did. I saw a short man with a parcel under his arm; I knocked him down. He made his escape. I ran after the man down Houndsditch. A gentleman said to me, you are the thief. I said, no, he is gone down Duke's-place. I was stopped for it.</p>

My fowls were in my yard. I saw the prisoner in the yard just by the privy door. The prisoner was in the habit of buttoning his small clothes up. He had got one fowl in his breeches, and one in his apron. I saw him with another fowl, one he put his head under his wing; he put that under his jacket. I saw him do this. They were all alive. I opened the window, and called out to John Hall, a man that belongs to the docks. The prisoner then bolted himself in the privy. I called out to the ostler to bring me a pitchfork. The prisoner said, do not break open the door, I will open it. He opened it, and there were three fowls then on the bottom of the floor.</p>

            . Mr. Hodgson called me as I was standing at the yard gate, and said a man was stealing his fowls. I immediately looked down the gateway, and saw the prisoner pick one of the fowls up from off the ground. He put it into his apron and walked with it into the privy, and bolted himself in. I went and stood at the privy door, waiting for the man coming out. I looked through the hole at the top of the privy door, and saw the prisoner in the act of putting one of the fowls into his smallclothes. I called out to him, and told him not to kill the fowls. He then threw that fowl on the ground. I then saw him take another from behind his coat. He had two coats on. He threw that down on the floor. He then pulled another fowl somewhere from his person; somewhere under his coat. Immediately upon that Mr. Hodgson came down. He held that fowl in his hand until the door was open. Mr. Hodgson was going to break the door open with the pitchfork. The prisoner then said he would open the door. He at first refused to open the door. The prisoner opened the door, and immediately he let that fowl go out of his hand, the fowl flew into the yard. He still remained in the privy, until we requested him to come out. He came to the door. We took him in custody, and took him into the house. A constable was sent for; he came and conveyed him to the watchhouse. The prisoner told us he was a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they game fowls - A. I believe not. He said one of the fowls was his own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the habit of fighting and feeding a few cocks for some gentlemen. That morning I was taking my fowl for a little walk. It got from me and went into this yard. I went in the yard and catched it. I was not going to take these fowls away. The other fowl was my own property.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your house broken into on the 13th of January last - A. Yes, about ten minutes past six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What part - A. The shop window; the third pane from the door was broken; the lower pane of all.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in the shop at the time - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed that pane to be whole in the course of the day - A. Yes, I had, two or three hours before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What articles do you expose in the window for sale - A. It is a corner window. One window watches and clocks, and the other window more particularly jewellery.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at home at the time - A. I was in the upper room, in the first floor. I was at tea at the time, and in returning from tea to the shop, on my entering the shop I went to that window to turn a lamp. I heard a rattling noise in the window. I perceived a man's hand in the window, and one of the silver spoons in action. I immediately opened the door, and in opening the door he drew his hand back and ran away. I immediately pursued him. I overtook him about an hundred yards from my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him - A. No, never from the time that he had his hand in the window. I brought him back to my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find anything on him - A. Not of my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of your property taken away - A. Yes. I never got it again. I do not know what became of that property.</p>
               <p>Q. What was taken away - A. Four silver caddy-spoons, value one pounds two shillings the selling price. I gave eighteen shillings for them; three tea-spoons, about three shillings and sixpence a piece; the selling price five shillings each; a pair of sugar-tongs, ten shillings and sixpence or eleven shillings; one desert spoon, twelve shillings; and one plated table-spoon, six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out of the shop was the prisoner running - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person running - A. Not any. I do not know that anybody else was near the spot. When I took the prisoner he asked me what I wanted with him. I said, you rascal you are the person that robbed my shop. He said nothing to that. I collared him and brought him to my shop, but I did not find any of my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see when he was running whether he threw anything from him or not - A. I do not think that he had time. I did not perceive that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear the window break did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you came down was it before you saw his hand in the window - A. It was immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams. The last time you observed this window whole, was two or three hours before - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For anything you know or perceived the window might be broken while you were up stairs - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard no breaking. If the window had been broken when you came down stairs you must heard it, must you not - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For anything that you know the window might be broken while you were up stairs - A. No doubt it was.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170013"/>Q. You cannot say that the prisoner broke it - A. Yes, by his hand being in.</p>
               <p>Q. You also say you found no property upon him - A. No property of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. For anything you know the things might be taken away while you were taking of tea - A. No such thing. I do not imagine they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not possible that the window might then be broken - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, of course, if the window had then been broken it is also probable that the person that broke it might take the things away - A. It is probably. I do not believe that the window was broken. I believe it was cut.</p>
               <p>Q. It might be cut while you were up stairs - A. Yes, no doubt it was.</p>

            . I am a parish constable. I know nothing more than taking the prisoner in custody. I searched his person, and as I was searching him I found the fore finger of his right hand bleeding. It appeared to have been cut with glass. I asked him how that was done. He said, that was an old wound. I am sure it was not an old wound. There were a few drops of blood on the floor where he stood. I found nothing on him but his own property.</p>
               <p>JURY. Was there any blood on the glass - A. I did not see that. The prisoner's finger was cut length-ways.</p>

               <p>Q. What were the words - A. I asked him, what brought him there. He said, you need not say anything at all about me, my crime is heavy enough. I said, what have you been at. Why, said he, I have been breaking a window at Pimlico.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to prosecutor. Which way did the prisoner run when you came out of your house - A. Towards the Queen's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, when you came out, look the other way to see whether anybody was running, or not - A. No, I did not. I did not lose sight of him after seeing his hand in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his person until you got out of the door - A. Yes, I saw his person, but not so as to distinguish the features of his face. I saw his body.</p>

            . We both live in one and the same house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose a pair of pantaloons on the 19th of last January - A. We did, about six in the evening. I was at home. I lost them out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your shop fastened up before that time - A. It was. I had seen it fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine afterwards to see how it was broken - A. It was not broken, only the latch turned. The shop door is an outer door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you tried the door in the course of that afternoon to try whether it was fastened - A. I saw the door shut before I went in to tea. It was not bolted. The latch had caught, I am certain. An alarm was given. I pursued the man, and took him and the property. My lad informed me. I overtook the man in Charles-street, Covent Garden, about two hundred and fifty yards from my house. He had the pantaloons under his great coat, on his left side; they were concealed. When I overtook him he was walking. I perceived something bulky under his left arm. I laid hold of him. I asked him to let me see what he had got; I suspected it was my property; a pair of pantaloons. He said, what do you want. I pulled back the breast of his coat, and took the pantaloons out. I knew them to be mine. I took the prisoner directly to Bow-street office. The prisoner was delivered to the officer. I have had the pantaloons ever since. These are the pantaloons; they are my property, and William M'Master's.</p>
               <p>- . Q. Were you at Mr. M'Masters shop that night - A. I was; I had shut up the shop. I latched the door; I tried it, and the latch had caught. Nobody could come in without lifting up the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before any body came in - A. More than a quarter of an hour after I had shut up the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had shut up the shop did you leave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170015"/>it, or not - A. I staid in the shop. I was at work in the shop behind a partition.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other person that came in during that interval - A. There was not. As I was sitting at work I heard the door open very softly; as I was getting off the board I heard some one move, and when I came to see who it was, there was no one in the shop, and the door was left open. I immediately alarmed Mr. M'Masters; he went out directly, and I pursued after. This was about six o'clock. I had not heard the clock go six; I had heard the clock go five. The postman generally goes by at half past five, and he had gone round, and I believe he was coming round again. I know the pantaloons. I had seen them in the shop that afternoon, about two hours before. When I came into Tavistock-street I took towards Charles-street. I saw this man. Mr. M'Masters came up to him. I told him I suspected the man. I saw Mr. M'Masters take the pantaloons from under his coat.</p>

            . I live at 55, Curtain-road Shoreditch. On the 14th of January last, on my returning home, near twelve o'clock, from the Crown and Magpie tavern, in Whitechapel. It was very near twelve. When I came out I came down Houndsditch as quick as I could; I turned to my right along Bishopsgate-street. I came along Bishopsgate-street until I came to the corner of Union-street, on the right hand side of the way. I then crossed from the right hand side to the left hand side in the same street, Bishopsgate-street; just at that time there were several persons at the corner of Angle-alley. I had not gone many yards further; I perceived a man by the side of me. I turned round to look at him, and then I saw two more behind me. I kept walking on as fast as I could down Bishopsgate-street. He kept close to my arm, and spoke to me two or three times. They spoke about the night. I seemed in an hurry; I gave them a slight answer, and took no notice. I went on until I came to the bottom of Hog-lane. I was thinking of turning down there, but as they followed me I kept straight on, and went down <placeName id="t18130217-23-crimeloc143">Norton Falgate</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18130217-23-crimeloc143" type="placeName" value="Norton Falgate"/>

I suspected then what they were after. I then said, you must not come that with me, my lads, it will not do. Recollecting there was a watch-box a few doors lower down Shoreditch, I was then thinking to find the watchman in this watch-box. When I came to the watch-box the watchman was not in it; he had gone his round. The watch-box stands at the corner of <placeName id="t18130217-23-crimeloc144">King's-head-court, Shoreditch</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18130217-23-crimeloc144" type="placeName"

These two pulled me, and the third put his hand to my mouth. They pulled me about twenty-five or thirty yards up the court, and the other man held his hand over my mouth. They shoved me behind. They then throwed me down, and all three fixed upon me; the one at my right shoulder kneeled on my right breast, stopping my eyes. He held my head down, stopped my eyes and mouth; he thrust something dirty into my mouth. My mouth was very dirty when I got up. He put his knuckles to my eyes,; my eyes was very sore the next day, and for two or three days afterwards. He thrust something into my mouth; my mouth was thrusted open, so that my jaw was sore for two or three days. Another one was at my right side, lower down; he was kneeling upon my ribs, and rifling my pockets. At the same time one on my left side, kneeling upon me likewise, just by my side, near my goin. In that situation I felt one on my right hand put his hand into my breeches pocket. At the same time I felt the one on, my left feeling for my pocket-book, and I think, at the same time I heard him on the left hand, say, d - n him, kill him. He repeated that twice. I felt myself agitated in mind. I struggled as much as I could. I was very much alarmed in consequence of my family. At that instant the one that was kneeling on my breast sprang up, and the other one on my right side too. The watchman came past, crying the hour of twelve. At that time, I was struggling very hard. I catched hold of the third man's leg. I saw the other two run away out of the court, the same way that they took me in.</p>

               <p>Q. And the left hand man, you laid hold of his leg, did you - A. Yes, and his hand was at the same time in my right hand breeches pocket. I took hold of the ham of his right knee, just here. His hand was in my pocket, and as I rose up he drew it out, and the silver dropped on the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pull the silver out of your pocket - A. I can hardly distinguish that. He drew his hand out of my pocket, and I heard the silver drop upon the pavement, and I saw it at the same time. I saw it in consequence of my laying hold of him by the leg. He drawed me over on my face. I saw the silver, and I picked up a three-shilling piece with my hand, that had come from my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you - A. I cannot say. I had been out collecting that day. I had, I dare<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170016"/>say, about seven or eight pounds of silver in my pocket. I can only swear I lost a five-shilling-and-sixpenny-dollar, and a three-shilling bank-token. I cannot say how much more, not knowing exactly how much I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I had taken a little wine after supper, but not more than did me good. I was collected, and knew as well as I do this morning. The prisoner, in striving to get away from me, he drawed me a few yards on the pavement. He then fell down. I got him down by the time the watchman came up, and saw him and laid hold of him while I was still holding his leg.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the prisoner at the bar, was it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether you lost more money than a dollar and a three-shilling token - A. Yes, I know I lost more. I cannot say how much. I reckon I lost two pound, as near as I can guess. There was a three-shilling piece found on the prisoner, and the one I picked up. The officer has one. The prisoner had his hands in my pocket. He took it out and put it in again. I suppose he took some silver out, by taking his hand out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any jingling of money - A. I did not hear the money rattle until it fell on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. It was the prisoner that had his hand in your pocket at the time that the silver fell on the pavement - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that more money besides the five-shilling-and-sixpenny-dollar and the three-shilling bank token was taken from you, are you - A. Yes, I know I lost more.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you lost it before they came to you - A. No, I had not. I had seven or eight pounds of silver in the whole, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear you had five pounds about you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you left - A. I cannot say exactly the sum that was left. The officer can tell you. The money was taken out of my pocket directly the man was taken to the watchhouse, and an account was taken of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You then delivered all the silver to the officer, did you - A. Yes, and the notes likewise, and the notes were in my right hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you gave to the officer all the silver that you had left, did you - A. Yes. What makes me know I lost a five-shilling-and-sixpenny-piece, I took three of a person; I had two remaining; one was gone. That makes me swear to a five-shilling-and-sixpenny-piece.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Cumberland-street, Shoreditch. I was going my round, crying the hour of twelve, and Nag's Head-court is the last of my beat. When I came to the corner I found two men upon the ground. The prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner for robbing him. They laid both on the ground. I called out to the next watchman that was coming by the corner of the court, and bid him spring the rattle. The watchman and patrol came to my assistance when he sprang the rattle I took him to the watchhouse. The watchman and patrol lifted the prosecutor up. I took hold of the prisoner. We took them all to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner is the man, is he - A. Yes; I never let him loose. He was searched at the watch-house by the officer of the night.</p>

            . I was officer of the night. I searched the prisoner. I found upon him one three-shilling bank token. The prosecutor brought in a three-shilling token all over mud, which the prosecutor said he picked up on the ground after I had searched the prisoner. I asked the prosecutor whether he knew what he had lost. He said he could not tell, he had a deal of money about him when he came out. I told him I thought he had better look and see whether he might not miss something particular. He then pulled his money out on the table, and trusted to my counting it. I counted it. There was one five-pound note, two five-shilling-and-six-penny dollars, fourteen three-shilling bank tokens, five eighteen-penny tokens, twenty nine shillings, and nine sixpences, and there was ten pounds in notes besides that. As soon as I counted the two five-shilling-and-sixpenny dollars, he said, if there was not three, one was lost; he had taken three from one person.</p>

               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Shirley has said that he had of you four pounds fourteen shillings in all; are you sure that you had more money in your pocket - A. Yes, I think I had about eight or nine pounds in silver in my pocket.</p>

I saw more than that lay on the ground when I was pulled over by the prisoner at the same time that I catched hold of one three-shilling piece. I saw two or three others. I can only swear by the bulk I had in my pocket, and I know it was a great deal lessened. I know I lost one five-shilling-and-sixpenny-piece.</p>

On the night the prisoner is charged with committing the robbery he was coming through Crown-court, in Still-alley, and just as the prisoner got into Crown-court he heard a man cry out, just as if some man was ill-using him. The prisoner went on when a a man and the prosecutor were on the ground. When the prosecutor got up the prosecutor got hold of him and cruelly used him. The prosecutor's conduct was as if he was mad drunk with liquor. The prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner. The prisoner was searched, and on him a three-shilling piece was found, which was his own property. The prosecutor's conduct towards the prisoner will be best proved by the patrol. The prisoner has an aged father and mother, which he supports by his honest industry.</p>

The patrol, when he got me up, said, if I did not loose the prisoner he would break my arm with his stick. I was determined not to loose the prisoner, as the prisoner was the person that was kneeling on me when I caught hold of him. The patrol has called on me, and abused me because his name is not on the bill. Mr. Moser did not think there was any occasion of more witnesses than what he had called, I am determined to indict the patrol at the Sessions for an assault.</p>

I remember the note again by the endorsement of Harrison upon the face of it, and there is the mark of 1 1/2 upon it, I had observed that upon it before I gave it to my husband. I had it nearly a month by me. This is the note produced by Mr. Good and the constable. I went out the same evening that my husband came and said he was robbed by a woman. I went to two public-houses, and the last that I went to was Mr. Good's, I said, very likely it might be changed in the neighbourhood. Mr. Good shewed me the note. As soon as he shewed me the note I told him that was the note. I went to the prisoner's lodgings along with the watchman. I found my husband's knife on the mantle-piece. She said she had got more knives than that; it was not my husband's knife. She said, that she had got the money, if the watchman would go out she would give it me, but she did not. She said she had changed the note, and had taken five poundsworth of halfpence, and when she looked for them under the bed, she said they were gone.</p>

            . I am the watchhouse keeper. I took some notes from one Connor, that lived with the prisoner; a two-pound note and two one-pound notes. He came to the watchhouse, and I took him in custody. He came to see Tilston.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked up this gentleman in the New-road; he asked me if I would go and get anything to drink; he gave me fourpence. I brought out a quartern of gin, and at Baker-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170018"/>he fell down. I picked up his hat and put it on his head, and I picked up this note. If I had stolen it I should not have changed it in the neighbourhood. I did not rob Mr. Hornsby. He behaved very rude.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him - A. I did. About nine o'clock a young man came into the warehouse; he enquired for a porter's situation. I told him we did not want one. The prisoner came in, and took a bundle of cambric muslin; he ran out with it, and I after him. I pursued the prisoner; he threw the muslins into a box-maker's shop, and when I came back a third person took another bundle of cambric. That man escaped. The prisoner is the man that took the first bundle. I never lost sight of him until he was taken.</p>

The head of the bolt was knocked off, and the remaining part was left in. Between eight and nine o'clock, the patrol of Clerkenwell called on me to know if I had lost any thing. At the time that he asked me that question I did not know that the cellar had been entered. I went directly to examine the cellar windows. I found this piece of the bolt broke, and the bar gone. I looked into the cellar bin, where I keep the soap in general, in which I expected to find about three hundred weight of soap. When I looked in it was all taken out; there were none. I found there had been casks in the cellar broken open, to see what were in them. The patrol told me that he had stopped a man at two o'clock in the morning, and that he was in custody at the watchhouse; and when I got to Clerkenwell watchhouse I saw the man, and I saw the soap and two stone bottles containing sheep wash, with labels attached to the bottles with my name on them, by which I could ascertain them to be my own. The prisoner was asked how he came by these articles. He did not give a true account; the place that he gave reference to no person had bought such a thing as the soap.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was going my round about two o'clock in the morning, in St. John-square, Clerkenwell. I met the prisoner with something in his apron. I asked him what he had got in his apron. He said, seven cakes of soap, he had bought it of a Mr. Martin, an oilman; he gave nine-pence a pound. I told him, that was not the price of soap, I did not think he came by it honest. He said, he had, and if I would go with him to Bottle and Hay-yard, St. John-street, I should see it was all right. I told him it was off my duty to go there, but he must go with me to the watchhouse. He told me his name was Thomas Eldridge. When I got him into the watchhouse, he then pulled two bottles out of his pocket, and told me they contained blacking; that he had them where he worked, at Mr. Robertson's, a plumber in Gray's-inn-lane. My superintendant told me to go to Bottle and Hay-yard, to enquire for Mrs. Eldridge, to know whether she had got a son. I did so. I could not find a person of the name of Mrs. Eldridge that had got a son. In the morning I went to Mr. Moore, of Smithfield, seeing his name upon the bottles. I asked Mr. Moore whether he had lost anything. He told me, he could not tell. I asked him whether he did not sell sheep wash. He said, yes. I then went to Mr. Robertson, of Gray's-inn-lane, to know if he knew any such person as Eldridge. Mr. Robertson knew him by the name of Allen, and he had worked there by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170019"/>the name of Allen, and was discharged a twelvemonth before.</p>

            . I am the superintendant of the watchhouse. The patrol brought this man in the watchhouse, about two o'clock in the morning, with the soap. He said, he had seven cakes of soap in his apron. When we came to pull them out there were but six. He said, he had lost one. He said he bought it in Gray's-inn-lane. He told me his name was

A little while afterwards, he said he gave fifteen shillings. I sent the patrol to Bottle and Hay-yard; he went and found out a Mrs. Eldridge, she said she had not got any son, nor expected any thing home with any one. After that, I thought him a suspicious character. I searched his person; I found this screw-driver, and a key, some matches, and a bit of wax taper.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to the watchhouse. I took him into custody. I examined Mr. Moore's premises; the cellar door was over the flap. I found marks on the door to correspond with this screw-driver. I compared it; it seemed to fit the place. I knew the prisoner by the name of Allen; his name is not Eldridge. As soon as he saw me he said, I am done now. This is the soap and the two stone bottles.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The soap I have every reason to believe it is mine; I had such kind of soap. It is a common sort of soap, but made particular. It is soap that is not handsome, but good and useful. I lost a great deal more than is here. The sheep wash is my property; my name is upon them. There were more bottles gone than these two. I found two bottles the next morning, near the house.</p>

I worked for Mr. Robertson, in Gray's-inn-lane; there came a new act up, no man could work except he served a seven years apprenticeship, so I was discharged. On this night I tumbled over a coarse sack; I undid my apron and put the soap and bottles in. I was going home, the patrol stopped me. He said, what have you got here. I said, soap. My mother kept a house in Bottle and Hay-yard for many years.</p>

I asked him who he brought them from. He said, a Mr. Jones, a housekeeper in Fleet-lane; he was not his father; he lived in the same house with him, and Mr. Jones gave him these things to pledge.

             - A. I know him well. I have known him about ten years. He has been a <rs id="t18130217-38-deflabel220" type="occupation">pensioner of that parish</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"

               <p>Q. Has he applied to you lately for that pension - A. On the 15th of January, he applied to me, as he had done many times before. He came to me about half past nine o'clock in the morning. I had just done breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anybody come with him - A. I believe not. My eldest son opened the door to him. I went into the passage where I met the prisoner, nearly three parts down the passage. I have no recollection to any former period that he ever entered my passage at all. On this occasion he had advanced four or five yards in the passage. I went up to him, and enquired his business. He then stated, that he came to know if I was now prepared to do that for him; without saying what. I enquired, what. He replied, to pay me that which is due to me, which now amounted to between six and seven pounds. He said so. I told him, that I had frequently informed him before that his pension was now stopped, in consequence of his being in a good situation, being able well to provide for himself. I then stated to him, that I could by no means, on my own authority, grant him what he applied for. I also expressed myself surprised at him that he should apply to me personally, on a Friday morning, as he knew the officers of the parish met in the Vestry-room every Friday afternoon, at three o'clock. I advised him, if he had any case to state to the gentlemen, it would be better to apply to them at three o'clock that afternoon. I stated also, that I was by no means friendly to his claim, and considered that I should be robbing the poor people, many of whom paid the taxes, if I was to pay him his arrears; yet, if the overseers, when they heard his case in the afternoon, would recommend it to me, what they advised I would comply with. In reply to which, he said he thought it was of no use applying at the Vestry in the afternoon, that he had as little chance of redress from them as from me. I, in reply, said, that there were magistrates continually sitting in the City of London every day to defend the cause of the poor, and if he thought the officers of the parish dealt unfairly with him, he would be able to state the case to the magistrate, who would see that the point of justice should be done. He seemed not to know, at least I thought he seemed to be in a considerable state of agitation, what reply to make. I stated to him, that I really could not spare so much time as he wished I should devote to his case. I had been conversing with him about ten minutes coolly in the passage; finding that he hesitated, I said it was necessary that he should make his election whether to apply to the overseers in the afternoon, at three o'clock, or to the magistrate at Guildhall, at noon. He hesitated again. I shuffled up rather closer to him, supposing that good manners would induce him to retire from the passage. I stood as close to him as possible I could; he then retired towards the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you touch him - A. Not in the least. He retired, stating, that he would come to the Vestry-room at three o'clock in the afternoon. He advanced towards the street door, which had been quite shut until the present time. I followed him with intention of shutting the door after him, supposing he was about to retire. When we came to the street door he took the street door in his hand, as if about to shut it, instead of which he placed it half to. Suppose the door open, leaving half the space of the whole, he stood in the open part, so as completely to fill it up; the wainscot of the passage was so near, when the door is placed half to, there is but room for a person to stand between the door and the wainscoting. When he had placed the door in that position he stood in the open part, and turned himself round towards me, in the passage, who was close behind him.</p>
               <p>COURT. He turned towards you - A. Towards me. He stood in the open part of the door, so as to prevent persons in the street from seeing into the passage, and when he turned towards me he put his hand of the side of his great coat pocket, to the best of my recollection a large brown great coat, and to the best of my belief the same coat that he has on now. I do not know whether it was a pocket; he took the pistol from his side; and while in the act of putting his hand to it, he said, in a low voice, as you will do nothing for me, I will do something for you, and that minute he took his aim. He took the pistol from under his coat and rested it on the other hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how was it with respect to your person - A. It stood about eight inches from my heart, in that direction. I observed him carry his eye distinctly along the barrel of the pistol. He pointed it at my left breast, I think about eight inches at the most from me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had so presented it, what did he do - A. When he first put his right hand behind the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170022"/>lock, his hand trembled exceedingly. At that moment I really thought it was some little diversion of his; after his hand trembled so much I observed almost the next instant that he got a steady purchase. I observed his finger towards the trigger, and when I really saw it really was a pistol, (I at first thought it was not), I uttered a cry of horror, and seized the pistol in the direction that I have stated. I saw his fingers at the trigger. He appeared to be making a great purchase. At that moment I seized the barrel with both hands, and with the greatest difficulty, finding he was a powerful man, I was enabled to turn the nozel of the pistol, so that it would not wound me mortally. I turned it of one-side. After I laid hold of it, it might have grazed my side. I do not apprehend it would have done more. A great scuffle ensued in perfect silence, between me and him. He retained his hold at one end, and I the other. He still kept using all the ability of which he was possessed, counteracting my power, and counteracting my endeavour of turning it away from me. He kept forcing it towards me, and still appearing to make a great purchase with his right hand behind the cock, as if he was disappointed on some account.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you eventually succeed in getting the pistol from him - A. As the struggle was in the passage, and as I could not get it from him, I endeavoured to point it downwards, so that it might hit me in the extremities rather than in the body; at length, I worked him out of the passage into the street, both of us having hold of the pistol, and finding that I had not power of preventing him from pointing the pistol, for fear he should murder me, I cried out, murder, as soon I passed over the threshold, both having hold of the pistol. Several neighbours came up to my assistance, and the pistol was taken from him.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards attended before the magistrate, and produced the pistol - A. I did. I saw the pistol examined; there was priming in it, and a heavy charge of powder in the barrel, and two leaden bullets. The whole charge occupied near three inches of space in the barrel.</p>

            . Q. Were you present when this pistol was unloaded - A. I was. I put the ramrod down first to see if it was loaded; it appeared to be heavily loaded. I then turned the screw down, and drew up with difficulty some paper. I found two leaden bullets and a quantity of powder. It was not primed. The balls appeared to have been rolled up in a cartridge.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Brand says the pistol was not primed - A. I laid it down on the dresser, and in my laying it down a considerable quantity of powder fell out of the pan.</p>

            . Q. You are a marshal-man of the City of London, and you are a working silversmith - A. I am. I went to the house of the prisoner on this day. I went up stairs into the top shop. I went first into the accompting-house. I found the prisoner there. I left Fogg in the accompting-house, to see that the prisoner touched nothing nor any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. In what dress was the prisoner - A. He had his coat on in the usual way. He was in the accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in his working dress with his sleeve<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170023"/>tucked up - A. I think he had his coat on, I am not positive whether he had or not. I then went up with my fellow-servants, thinking I might assist them, knowing the nature of the business. I saw them take the things as they have just mention. I took one dozen of salt-ladles and one dozen of tea-spoons from the top shop, and another dozen of tea-spoons not polished. There are two dozen of tea-spoons. I took from the top shop, and one dozen of salt-spoons The son was up in the top shop. I immediately returned to the accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned to the accompting-house, who was in the accompting-house - A. Fogg and the prisoner. I brought the son down from the top shop to the accompting-house, and we proceeded to search the accompting-house. I took then these spoons from different parts of the accompting-house. There are about eight or ten dozen of tea-spoons, mustard-spoons, and caddy-ladles, and tea-tongs. I found two punches with the initials of the prisoner, in the accompting-house, with an anvil, which is proper to mark this work, and another punch, with somebody else initials; it is so badly done I can hardly tell the letters. There was an anvil, or a test. I found the punch close to the anvill. There was a fork-press that could be used for any purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing that could be used for putting the forged stamp upon plate - A. The fork-press could be used for that purpose better than the test, or anvill.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the fork-press here - A. No; it is a fixture; it is a heavy thing, similar to a fly. That tool is a common tool in the trade, but it would be more useful to put the stamp on than the hammer and anvil.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say anything to the prisoner - A. He seemed to be alarmed, and asked what we all wanted. I said, you must know; you know me; I have a warrant; there is an information that you are marking your own work. He then said, if that was all he cared nothing about it. The table-spoons were shewed to him; they were held to him and he was asked if they were his own make. He said, they were. He said, every thing was right as far as he knew.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You did not find any die for the forged mark or stamp in any place, by which any impression could be made - A. No, I did not expect I should. I looked a long while very minutely and very diligently. It is a small thing; it might be very easily concealed.</p>
               <p>- FOGG. Q. You were with the last witness, we understand - A. I was. I went into the accompting-house; I there found the prisoner; he was sitting at his desk without his coat, with his sleeves tucked up, quite in a working state.</p>
               <p>Q. What was before him - A. This ladle I hold in my hand was laying before him, and one spoon. Hawkins merely locked in, and left me with him; he did not stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anything pass between you and Wintle - A. I do not know that I spoke one word to him.</p>

               <p>Q. And next morning, Friday morning, when you came to work, where did you find them - A. I found them in my box a little after seven in the morning, and I was at work upon them when the officers came.</p>

            . Q. I believe you are the marker of silver plate at Goldsmiths hall - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. When plate is sent by the manufacturer to the hall who receives it - A. Mr. Barrow, at that time, received it. It is delivered over by Barrow to Preston, or to Mr. Labor, who has large work, who weighs and enters it; it is then handed into another office, where I draw an assay of it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, you draw a small piece from each article to make an assay - A. The assay is made, and if found right it is marked by me.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe all plate that comes from the manufacturer must have the initials of that manufacturer - A. It must, sir. We receive from every manufacturer the impression of his own stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce the impression you have of the prisoner's stamp - A. Yes, this is it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, have you examined the punches which the officer found in the prisoner's house - A. I have; two of them correspond with the mark I have.</p>
               <p>Q. The genuine stamp of the hall is, first the lion, then the leopard's head, the variable letter, which is changed every year, and then the King's head, that is the duty mark. You receive the duty at Goldsmiths hall, and pay it over to the commissioners of the stamps - A. We do.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that stamp upon these nine tablespoons - A. I have examined them all before.</p>
               <p>Q. On each piece of plate the officers found at his house, do you find the prisoner's own stamp - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find anything upon them to represent the hall stamp; the four ones that we have mentioned; that is, the lion, the leopard's head, the variable letter, and the King's head - A. I find the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that stamp you find representing the hall mark, genuine or forged - A. It is forged on these nine table-spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the three other table-spoons, is there the prisoner's initial mark upon them - A. There is, and they all apparently have the hall stamps. They appear to be the same forged stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two gravy spoons - A. The two gravy-spoons are a forgery, and the third I believe to be a forgery. There is on them a mark to represent the hall mark. They are every one of them forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, the forks are the prisoner's initials upon them - A. There are, and they all have the hall stamps upon them apparently. They appear to be the same forged stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at these salt-spoons - A. These I am confident, are forgery. They have the whole of them the prisoner's mark as the manufacturer.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these dozen of spoons that are unpolished - A. These are genuine; the twelve teaspoons that are not polished, they are genuine.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these tea-spoons - A. The whole of there are forgeries, containing the prisoner's mark, and the salt-ladles, the whole of these are forgeries, containing the prisoner's mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at these found in the accompting-house, one tea-spoon and a number of salt spoons - A. The whole of these are forgeries. Every thing there is marked by the manufacturer the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, can you recollect the circumstance of the prisoner being taken up on the 16th of October - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were spoken to before he was taken up - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say that none of the goods came from the prisoner either on the day he was taken up or the day before - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You have the hall impression and stamp in your pocket - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me the impression. You are the marker with the genuine stamp - A. I am, and I am confident that no one of these have been impressed with the genuine stamp. When the prisoner was committed I took an impression of the stamp; the whole four is made by one blow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Miles, did you see a fly in the prisoner's possession - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the fly have enabled the forged die to have given the impression on silver plate - A. It would, and without a great deal of noise. The fly is a thing used by the trade.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a watch in February - A. I did, from off the nail in the parlour, where it hung up, just inside of the door that parted the shop from the back room. The house is let out in tenements.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it before it was lost - A. About half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner; do you know him - A. I never saw him before that night. I think it wanted about a quarter to seven at night when he took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take it away - A. I heard him draw it off the nail. I was drawing some beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the room - A. No, I was in my chandler's shop, drawing some beer.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him take it off, did you - A. No. I was stooping at the barrel; I heard the chain rattle and he run out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who run out - A. The prisoner. He came into the shop for some beer. I looked and saw the watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there anybody else there that saw it besides you and him - A. A little girl that is here saw it. I called, stop thief, and my neighbours followed him and stopped him. The constable has got the watch.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in Belton-street. On the 21st of January last, the prisoner came to my house about a quarter before eleven at night; she had two bundles in her apron, and seemed exhausted. She asked me to let her have a glass of liquor to revive her, for she came all the way from Gravesend, and she had not a farthing of money; she was going to lodge at the next door, and if I would let her have a little liquor she would leave the small bundle with me till morning, to secure me for the money for the liquor. What liquor she had that night came to two shillings and a penny. She left one bundle. She came in the morning, she said she was going to part with the things.

               <p>Q. You are sure it was the two men, are you - A. Yes. They came in for two penny worths of beer at different times. They were in five or six times from seven o'clock until the time I lost the cheese. When I missed my cheese, I did not make any enquiry that night about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it - A. I saw it at nine o'clock; it was gone before ten.</p>

               <p>Q. When they came in about nine o'clock was your cheese there - A. Yes, and I missed it before ten. I had nobody in before I missed it but the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss it that night - A. Yes, I did. I went to Mr. Christopher; I told him I had lost a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170027"/>cheese; I asked him if such a thing had been brought into his house. I described the men to him.

On Thursday morning, the prosecutrix came to me and said she had lost a cheese, and she suspected some foreigners had stolen it which used my house. She went backwards into the room. She came in the evening again. She saw the tall prisoner, I took him over to her house. I charged him with stealing the cheese. He said he knew nothing about it, and finding nothing on him I let him go. The next day the prosecutrix came into my house and saw the short one. She told me that was another of them. I took him over to her house, and accused him of it. He denied it. An officer was sent for, and he was taken in custody, and the same afternoon the other prisoner was apprehended.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he lay down on the ground - A. No, on the steps. A young woman and I stopped to see what he was doing of. We watched him, and saw what he did; he took one of the hams off a shelf that was near the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What the man that was laying down - A. Yes, sir. He took it away and gave it to Blade, and Blade gave it to another.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that was laying down - A. Robertson.</p>
               <p>Q. And then the other, Blade, received it of him - A. Yes, and he gave it to another.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Blade standing - A. Not by him within two or three doors of the house. He got up and put it under his coat, and then gave it Blade. Then he went back again and did it again. He went and laid down a second time, and he went and he gave that away a second time, and we stopped him with a ham. There was a young woman with me. He told us if we would say nothing he would give us something to drink. We went and told Mr. Stiles, and just as we went in two patrols came up and stopped him. They brought them into Mr. Stiles.</p>

I have been at a house where the women were common prostitutes. I have four small children, and get my bread by hard work.</p>
               <p>Blade's Defence. On Monday, the 8th instant, as I was going up East Smithfield, I saw a man come out of a door with something under his arm. A man came from the other side of the road, and challenged me with stealing a ham. I immediately ran across the road to the patrols.</p>

Then, after that, the prisoner came running out of Mr. Cohen's back door; he had got something before him. I could not discern what he had got. He kept running on until he almost got out of the tenter-ground; something dropped from him; he stooped and put it into his pocket, and ran out of the tenter-ground, across Aliffe-street into Half-moon-alley, and just before he got out of Half-moon-alley, he stooped and wrapped something up, and after he had wrapped it up, he ran into Whitechapel, into Castle-alley.

             acted as mate.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you - A. I was gunner. Our crew consisted of seven or eight men, besides us three.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you at Gravaileans - A. We laid there a fortnight. We went into the harbour. We laid within line of the batteries. It is a small harbour, and there are jetties. We were within the jetties We laid there a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take anything on board - A. Rum, geneva, brandy, and spirits. We took them in half anchors; that is four gallons. We took upwards of a thousand casks, half anchors.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had completed your lading, did you leave Gravaileans - A. Yes, and were bound to the Lands End.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on what day you left Gravaileans - A. About the 3d of February, 1812. We quitted Gravaileans in the evening, and in the morning we found ourselves off Beechy Head. The prisoner, Denny, was then acting as mate of the vessel, he was then on board.</p>
               <p>Q. He continued to act as mate, and on the morning of the 4th you found yourselves off Beechy Head - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did either of them make a signal to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your vessel answer the signal - A. We answered the Bergee. That is the signal of the Custom-house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170030"/>cutter. We hoisted a flag with a swallow sail. That was to deceive the King's brig.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in the day. Did you lay a considerable time in calm - A. Yes, all day, until about two or three in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. During all this time the King's brigs had done nothing to you at all - A. No. There were three in the morning; they did not meddle with us. About two or three in the afternoon we found a fourth. She reached in the shore.</p>
               <p>Q. On seeing the man-of-war-brig coming near you in the afternoon, what did you do - A. When we found them drawing near us we got out our sweeps: that is, our long oars. The brig made sail after us, and after some time I heard a gun. After firing a gun, as I supposed to bring us to, they put a boat out after us directly. The captain then ordered me to leave pulling my sweep, and to get the guns loaded. I went and loaded one six-pounder and a blunderbuss. He ordered me down to get the magazine ready.</p>
               <p>Q. That was to get more ammunition for the other guns - A. Yes. I heard the carriage gun and the blunderbuss both fire while I was down below.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went below where did you leave the prisoner, Denny - A. I cannot say where he was exactly. When I came up again I do not know whether it was he or some other person that said they had beaten the boat off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the boat had been beaten off, and had gone back - A. Yes; she was gone back, and got alongside of her own brig.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you made all the sail you could, did the brig chace you - A. Yes. We got away as quick as we could. We lost her about ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your chace did you lighten your cargo - A. Yes; we hove five or six hundred half anchors overboard.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had lost sight of the brig that chased you, which way did you go - A. We then kept steering on the southward, to the coast of France, until we came near Lala, and then from there to the Lands End. We there landed the remainder of the cargo.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not make use of any ceremony of going into the harbour of Falmouth, or any Custom-house port - A. No, to the place called the Cow and the Calf, two rocks at the Lands End.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, without paying any duties - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner, Denny - A. Eight or nine years. I understood he was an Irishman. He served his apprenticeship in the sea service at Liverpool, and his family resided at Brighton.</p>

I shewed them some. The woman that was with her bought three yards and a half of print, and paid for it. The woman stood by me, and the prisoner left her and went to the window, and put something under her left bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what she took - A. No, I did not. She took something, and run out of the shop with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow her - A. No. Two women outside of the door saw her take it as well as me. One of our young men came into the shop; he ran after her and brought her back. We sent for an officer; he searched her and found nothing. The shawl has never been found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look in the window and see what was gone - A. We did. We searched the window and we missed a shawl.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen that shawl - A. I had seen it about three days before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many shawls in the window - A. Yes, perhaps twenty or thirty.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether she took any thing or not; you saw her put her hand in the window - A. Yes, and I afterwards saw her put her hand into her bosom; what she took I cannot say. This happened on the Tuesday to the best of my knowledge. I saw the shawl on the Saturday night before.</p>

She crossed the road, stood at a gin shop, and turned round.</p>
               <p>Q. You overtook her in John-street, did you - A. Yes; that is about forty or fifty yards from the shop. I asked her if she was not the person that was in our shop. She said, yes. I asked her to come back with me. She did. She was quite alone. Jackson, the officer, came and searched her, and found nothing on her. She was taken to Marlborough-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see her have any shawl - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what shawls there were in the window - A. There were a great many shawls in the window, of different kinds.</p>
               <p>Q. You, perhaps, do not know that any was gone - A. I examined myself and found that one was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you up or in bed - A. I was in bed; I heard a noise. It was near two o'clock in the morning. In my bed-room the noise was. I listened some time, conceiving it might be in the adjoining room, and after listening some time, I found it was in my room. I got up immediately, and went towards the direction from whence I heard the noise. I seized the prisoner. I had no light in the room when I had seized the prisoner. I heard somebody coming up stairs; I called out for assistance. Several people came in, and a light was brought. Mr. Hewitt came up, whom I understood to be Mrs. Kinnard's nephew. He searched the prisoner in my presence.</p>

            . I am a parish constable. On Saturday night, the 23d of January, I saw two men under the gateway; they were talking together. I took particular notice of them. One of them followed me. I went through Justice-walk, and just about the centre, I saw the prisoner put something under her petticoats. I said, holloa, mistress, what are you at there. She said, sir, I dare say you are a family man, women cannot do as men can; as if she was making water. She had a green gown piece under her arm. I asked her, what she had got. She said, she bought it; she would go back with me, as I seemed to dispute it. Oh, no, said I, good woman, I do not wish to go back with you upon that business. I kept by the side of her, and followed her all the way down the town, and a man and another woman passed her. I kept on until I saw my brother constable. I said to him, there is something going forward. They went on, and this gown piece was brought to me. They said, it was thrown into a butcher's passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her do any thing with it - A. No. I did not. I went and brought the man back, and we took all three before the magistrate. This is the thirteen yards of printed cotton, a pink ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that thirteen yards of printed cotton brought out of the butcher's shop - A. No, I did not. I was going after the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to the shop did you see the woman - A. She had past it. I saw her just near it. She was taken in custody when she had passed the butcher's shop, and the other man and woman too at the same time. I had gone forward to apprehend the man.</p>

I asked nine shillings and sixpence; he bid me eight shillings. I told him I could not take less than nine shillings. In the mean while I was talking about that, the constable brought in Staples.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I saw Staples and Smith together go up Tottenham-court-road. That was before they came to Mr. Lowther's. I saw them together about three o'clock; they went towards Mr. Lowther's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you watch them - A. I walked after them, and when they had got an hundred yards I missed them all at once, and in about three minutes Staples returned back again, running, with something under his coat. I catched hold of him by the collar, and he threw these boots down. I took him back to the shop, and I saw the prisoner Smith there in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him return back running he was running as if from Lowther's, was he - A. Yes. I searched Smith when I went back. He had got about seven or eight shillings in his pocket. I did not take it from him. He told me he was going to buy a pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cantrill. How many doors are there to your shop - A. Two doors.</p>


               <p>Q. Is yours a corner shop - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these boots hang at the door that Smith came in - A. Yes, at the door that Smith came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in sight of you in the shop (the boots) or not - A. They were in sight of me, only Smith was standing before them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if it had not been for Smith you should be able to see them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Smith, the patrol. How long were they in your sight altogether - A. Not hardly a minute. It was not above an hundred yards from where I stood.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cantrill. What is the value of them boots - A. Five shillings. We gave five shillings and sixpence for them; that is the cost price.</p>
               <p>Staples's Defence. I was going up Tottenham-court-road after work; I saw these boots lay between that gentleman's shop and a butcher's shop. I picked the boots up, and carried them openly under my arm.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. My lord and gentleman of the jury, as I am before the Court, and if I may not too far transgress upon your time, I must humbly hope you will indulge me with hearing my case, being placed at a bar of justice, to answer a charge of felony, for the first time in my life. My lord and gentlemen, I have it not in my power to retain able counsel in the law. The candour which marks the proceedings of this solemn Court, whose wise discernment will not let conviction meet upon such evidence which this day appears before your lordship, and do beseech I may be permitted to state that on Tuesday, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I went to Tottenham-court-road to purchase a pair of breeches which were for sale, hanging against the door. I enquired the price. I was answered nine shillings and sixpence. I offered eight shillings, and during the time I was agreeing about the purchase, an officer brought in the other prisoner. The officer searched him, and found a pair of half boots. The officer came there to enquire if they were their property. The shopman said, they were their property; and in consequence of the officer saying he had seen me with the young man, I was taken as an accomplice, whereas I came in the shop to purchase a pair of smallclothes in a fair and open way. The officer insisted upon doing his duty in taking me in custody as an accomplice. I beg leave to state in the presence of the Court, I have no knowledge whatever of the prisoner, Staples, nor to my knowledge had I seen him before. I had left my father's house half an hour before, for the express purpose of buying a pair of smallclothes. Will the officer say that I was in the company of Staples; that I knew that he had the boots. No. He stopped him, and searched him, and found the boots, and the merely saying that we were together, I am brought to a bar of justice. Your lordship's goodness and great capacity I trust will say I am perfectly innocent in this case. I always have borne in life the character of a hard working lad.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any soap on the 23d of January - A. Yes. I was from home at the time. I returned home about six in the evening. There was a quantity of soap then missing, about twenty-two pounds out of the same box that I had assisted in packing it up in the morning. It was sold, but not delivered. It was packed up for the purpose of being sent off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it before that day - A. Yes. I put it up myself principally, or assisted in putting it up, in the morning, about ten o'clock. I went from home about eleven o'clock. That is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the soap - A. The quantity that was brought into our house was about eighteen pounds. We value it at seventeen shillings.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street office. On Saturday, the 23d of January, I saw the two prisoners in company with another walking about the door of Mr. Picard's shop, (it was about a quarter before six), and knowing them, I watched them. The prisoner, Thompson, went in, and stopped in about five minutes; the other two stood on the steps of the door. Thompson came out and crossed the road. The other two followed close behind. Perkins said, go it, here are two pigs. (The thieves call the officers pigs.) I pursued them, and caught Thompson with the bundle of soap in his arms. He threw the soap down, and endeavoured to get from me. I took him back to Mr. Pickard's shop. I gathered up the soap. I had my brother with me; he was running after the other men. When I got the soap back to the shop I tied it up tight, and took Thompson and put him in security. We then took him and the soap to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you shew the soap at the shop - A. To Mr. Morgan. He said, Mr. Pickard packed it up, and he should come down to the office. Mr. Pickard came to the office and owned the soap.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him come out of the shop, did you observe whether he had anything with him or not - A. He had a bundle in his arms when he came out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same parcel that he threw from him - A. Yes. I was not thirty yards from him all the way.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the soap - A. I was ordered to take care of it, and I have had it in my custody ever since. This is it.</p>
               <p>

            . I was with the last witness. I saw the prisoners; there was a third in company with them; they were walking near Mr. Pickard's door. In the course of a few minutes I saw Thompson enter the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop - A. There was no person in the shop as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a shop where they expose their goods to sale - A. Yes, it is. He was in a few minutes; he came out again with a parcel in his arms, and crossed the road. He had something tied up in a blue apron, which he carried in a bundle before him the other two followed him. I observed Perkins to speak, and he and the other ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what he said - A. No. I pursued the two that run, but I lost them. When I lost them I returned back to my brother, and found him scuffling with the prisoner, Thompson. They were in the road. I assisted my brother. The soap was then laying on the pavement. I took up the soap, and carried it back to Mr. Pickard's. My brother took the prisoner back. Mr. Morgan said it was his soap, and pointed out the chest where he said it was taken from. He was then taken to Bow-street, and the soap was delivered to my brother.</p>

            . Who was it that gathered the soap up - A. I do not know. The soap was on the pavement, whether I gathered it up, or my brother, I cannot say. The man was tustling with me to get from me. I had got hold of him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at that soap, and see whether it is your soap - A. I have no doubt but it was our soap. There is no particular mark on the soap. I have not a doubt in my own mind but it is the same soap that I had packed up. When it was brought back I was not at home. I was soon after. The soap was taken from an open chest in the shop, with a cloth over it. The cloth might easily be removed.</p>
               <p>Thompson's Defence. I was coming down Tottenham-court-road on the left hand side, I saw that bundle lay; I picked it up. Mr. Collier came and stopped me. He asked me what I had got. I said, soap. He said, I must come back with him. He said he saw me take it out of the shop. I know nothing of Perkins.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170035"/>4th of February, between six and seven o'clock, I was passing along Long Acre. I saw four boys together; the three prisoners and another. I saw two of them stand at the hat shop, and two at the butter shop, next door to it. I saw two of the least prisoners standing against the window, Foster and Price. I saw Price go up and down, as if he was cutting the putty, which induced me to stop, though they are so little boys. I drew back and watched, and then I saw Foster and Price run to the other two. In about a minute the other two went, and the former two remained behind. The other two went to the window where they came from, and I saw them pull something from the window, as if they were pulling glass from the window; then they started off again, and came back to the window. They then had their hands to the window, as if they were jobbing something at the window. The other two returned, Foster and Price. Then I saw them draw something out of the window. When I saw that, I ran up to them: they ran away as fast as they could. I saw that they had got a hat in their hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Which of them had a hat - A. The little one, Foster. I believe they made a stop in Queen-street. Foster gave Hannan something wrapped up in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see what it was - A. No. That was in Queen-street. Foster gave something to Hannan, and instantly, as it was tied up, they ran into Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. What was tied up - A. The hat. When they got to the corner of Little Turnstile they began to cut the putty away from a cracked window.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that - A. Price. They started from there, and went lower down Holborn, and they sent Foster to pawn the hat. I stopped Foster. I asked him, what he had got there. He said, he had got a hat that his mother sent him to pawn for a shilling. I then took him into Berrison's shop, and detained him there until I fetched the other two. There were three more outside. I fetched the other two prisoners in. One got off. I took Hannan and Price. Upon Hannan I found one pair of new stockings. I asked him how he came by them. He said, they were his mother's. On searching Price I found a bit of a knife that they cut the putty away to get the hat out. I kept them in custody. I told him, I knew where he brought the hat from out of Long Acre.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my hat. I know it by the trimming. It is my own trimming. The hat was drawed through the window, and the stand left naked. The square of glass was broke before, and a paper put over it.</p>
               <p>Hannan and Foster said nothing in their defence.</p>
               <p>Price's Defence. The knife was not to cut the putty. I never cut the putty with it.</p>

            . On the 22d of January, both the prisoners came into the shop together. Smith asked for sprigged muslins. I shewed them some. I asked six shillings a yard; they bid me five shillings a yard. They one asked the other, and they said five shillings was enough. I told them I could not take that price. They left the shop without buying.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a number of pieces of muslin on the counter - A. Yes, there were. After they were gone I counted the muslins over. I missed two pieces. I told one of the young men. He desired me to go after them. I looked out at the door; I could not see anything of them, and after I turned round they came into the shop again. They asked for the muslins they were looking at before. I shewed them the muslins, and while they were looking at them I saw the prisoner, Smith, take something off the counter, and put under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you actually see her removing them - A. I did. They each of them bought, and paid for what they bought. Smith bought four yards at six shillings, and White bought half a yard at five shillings. After they had paid for what they bought they left the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was White to Smith when you saw her in the act of putting something under her cloak - A. She was close by her.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left the shop did you go after them - A. Mr. Kirby left the counter, and went after Smith, and as soon as Kirby stopped Smith, I stopped White. He took the muslins from Smith, and we brought them into the shop. White said, she had nothing at all to do with the other person, and she knew nothing of Smith taking the muslins. They were searched, and nothing was found upon White.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the things that were taken from Smith to be your master's property - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said Smith had only bought four yards - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity that was taken from her - A. Three pieces, from twenty-five to thirty yards in a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of your masters live in the house - A. Mr. Rimington lives there. Mr. Vipond has a house in Ely-place, Holborn.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they appear to behave to each other as companions in every respect - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you serving at the same counter with the last witness, Robinson - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe anything while they were in the shop the first time - A. No, I did not. After they went out, Robinson mentioned his suspicion to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after Robinson mentioned his suspicion to you was it you saw them again - A. About half an hour, not more. They both came in together again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of what Robinson told you, keep an eye upon them - A. Entirely so. My whole attention was attracted by them. While in the act of purchasing. I saw the prisoner, Smith, take three pieces of muslin, and put it under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the other at the time - A. Close by her. They both went out of the shop very shortly after. Smith was going out of the shop first. Smith apparently walked quicker. I got over the counter, and followed her into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then White was behind Smith - A. Yes. I asked Smith if she had not got something that was not her own. She said, me? and seemed suprised, and answered, no. I turned her mantle of one side, and took the three pieces of muslin from under her arm, in the street. I brought her back, and immediately sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her searched - A. I believe nothing else was found.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the worth of these three pieces of muslin - A. They are valued in the indictment at five pounds. That is short of the value of them.</p>

The prisoner and the servant were contending together. I returned out of the kitchen. I did not hear what it was about. He came out of the kitchen. I saw him go down the yard. I never interfered at all. I returned to my employment. In the course of ten minutes after I had to go into Leadenhall-street. I saw the prisoner standing at the bottom of the gateway. As soon as he saw me he drew a sharp instrument, saying, d - n your eyes you b - r, I will murder you. I run towards the kitchen door for assistance. He made after me, and on my opening the kitchen door, he stabbed me on the left arm. He threw me down on the kitchen floor, and bruised my body. He might have cut me again; he did not He had the power of doing it. The boy that was putting on a pair of wheels in the yard, he came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the boy came up he might have done it, might he not - A. Yes, he might. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said anything to him - A. Not a word. I never saw the man in my life before. There were two in the kitchen, with whom he was quarrelling. I was there a minute. I returned momentary, without speaking a word.</p>
               <p>Q. What injury did this do to you - A. He stabbed me in my left arm. I was taken to Mr. Hopkins, and from thence I was taken to St. Thomas's hospital. Mr. Hopkins is a surgeon; he lives at the corner of the gateway, in Leaden-hall street.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the size of the wound - A. He held it in this position.</p>

            . I was chamber-maid at the King's Arms. The prisoner came about eleven o'clock in the day, on the 6th of January; he asked me if he could have a bed. I asked, who recommended him. He said, the coachman he came by, recommended him; but I forget the name of the coach. I shewed him up into a room, and told him his bed was eighteen pence. He paid me in the room for his lodging. He left his bundle in the room. He asked me if he could have any thing to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170037"/>eat. I told him, yes; he could have either cold beef or a beef stake. The waiter was busy, and I laid a cloth for him in the kitchen. He had cold beef, and a pint of porter, and while I went up stairs he had a glass of rum and water, that came to a shilling. He would not pay the girl that served him with the victuals that he ate; he would insist upon my coming down, to pay me for it. When I came into the kitchen I told him it was eighteen pence. He said, he had paid me. He had not paid me. He had only paid me for the bed. He said, he had paid me; he should not pay any more. I went to the kitchen, and I went out for about twenty minutes, and when I returned I met the cook coming to me to shew him to bed. This was eleven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he represent that he had been travelling all night - A. Not to me. I understood so. I was to shew him his room, and during that time he had another glass of rum and water, which was another shilling. I asked him to pay the half-crown before he went up stairs. He refused. He said, he would not pay any more. He desired me to fetch the bundles down from the bed-room, which I did. As soon as I came into the kitchen, he run and met me by the door. He pushed me up by the side of the fire place. He bent his fist, and swore he would murder me if I did not give him the bundles. Two young men saw him; they pulled him back. They saw him going to strike me; they pulled him backwards. He asked me what was in the bundles. I asked him, if he thought I had robbed him. He said, he did not know. I told him, I would shew him the contrary. I untied his bundles in the kitchen, and told his things out one by one on the floor, to convince him that I had taken nothing, and this instrument fell out of the bundle. The constable has got the instrument, and a sheath of razors. The razors he picked up instantly, and put into his pocket. The sharp instrument, he said it belonged to nobody but him. He tied up his bundles, and bid me defiance to touch them. He said, any body touch them if they dare. Then he went to endeavour to get to the bar, and my mistress had been ill for some time, she came down that day for the first time, and I held the door, and the porter held him to prevent him from getting in. I said to the porter, now, if you do not mind, he'll go away without paying. I was in the kitchen all the while. I was going to take the bundle again until he had paid his reckoning. He was going to strike me. The porter interfered, and would not let him strike me. In the scuffle the prisoner fell down. The prisoner holloaed out, murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the porter strike him - A. No, he did not. The porter put him out of the kitchen door into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other men in the kitchen that assisted in turning him out - A. No; there was only the porter, none of the other men touched him. This was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon when this happened. The prisoner run down to the gateway, and I saw him stand there about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take his bundle with him - A. No; that was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he his hat with him - A. No. I believe that fell in consequence of the scuffle; during that time I went into the bar, and the next thing I heard the cook say, was knife or knives. That was about five minutes after I saw him at the bottom of the gateway. The next thing that I saw was Joseph Eades standing by the tap door, bleeding in his arm. I saw two men take

            . I am porter at the King's Arms. The first I saw of this business was, when I saw the prisoner holding the girl up against the mantle-piece. He appeared to be using her rough at the time. I did not interfere in it then. My young master and the bookkeeper they pulled him back; then he went up to the table. He said he wished the chamber-maid to bring the bundle down. She fetched it down, and counted them on the floor before him, one by one, and as she counted them this instrument fell out. He said that belonged to him, and nobody else. He put it into his pocket. What it was I do not know. I saw it after he had stabbed the man. After he tied up his bundle he held his bundle in one hand, and bid defiance to any body touching it, and the chamber-maid made to get hold of his bundle, because he had not paid his reckoning. He strove against it. He began, as I thought, to ill use the girl. I interfered to take the bundle from him to assist her. I took the bundle from him with her assistance. We told him he should have his bundle if he would pay his reckoning. Then he strove to get to the bar. My mistress was in the bar, and the chamber-maid held the door. He appeared very violent in his manner. It was the first day my mistress had come down from her illness. I held the prisoner to prevent him from getting to the bar. I only held him; I did not ill use him at all, because I thought he was in liquor. In the scuffle he fell down. There were no blows from me. He fell down in the struggle, and as we were struggling, some person at the door said, porter, the best thing you can do is take him into the yard. I took him into the yard, and left him there. As the prisoner was down he got hold of my legs, so I walked out into the yard. When I got him into the yard he ran to the bottom of the gate into Leadenhall-street. I followed him down the yard, and went to St. Mary Axe. I said nothing to him, and in the mean while I was gone to St. Mary Axe he stabbed this man. When I returned,

He had hold of the porter's legs, and after he came out of the kitchen he said he would go and get a constable. He ran down to the bottom of the gateway. He remained there without his hat, and his waistcoat was unbuttoned. Then I went to my work.

             was in the middle of the yard. I saw the prisoner run after Eades with this instrument. It is four square, with two springs at the end. Eades was going into the kitchen then, and as soon as the prisoner came against the kitchen door it came open, and then the prisoner stabbed Eades on the left shoulder, and as soon as I saw that I went and laid hold of the prisoner's ears, and pulled him down to the ground. A coachman took the instrument from the prisoner, and I tied the prisoner's hands behind him.</p>

            , I am a surgeon. I live at 123, Leadenhall-street. On my return home the prisoner was brought into my house by the Woodford coachman. I found he had received a punctured wound about three inches from the top of his shoulder. The wound bled freely; but upon examining it, I did not see any of the arteries were wounded. I believe the man was under the influence of fear and alarm. He was bleeding when he was brought to me. While he was with me he might have lost four or five ounces of blood. I first of all brought the edges of this wound together; it appeared to me to be done by an angular instrument. It was very likely this instrument had four sides or four edges. I stopped the bleeding, and dressed the wound. I recommended the man to go to the hospital. He said he had no one to take care of him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner. I took him in custody. I produce the instrument.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been over to my own country to settle some private business of my own, and I had sold all my tools that I had, and this instrument is a chissel that I made to fit up some brass work, and the springs were made to fit up some brass work. I turned the brass, and was bringing it with me in order to give it to my serjeant-major. I brought it and my shirts and things with me, and came to London. I put up at the sign of the Grapes, in Ratcliffe Highway. I had two one-pound bank notes. I had a bed there, and was very well accommodated. I asked the landlord what I had to pay. He said, a shilling for my bed. I had one pint of beer made warm, with a little purl in it. I desired the landlord to give me change. This woman said I was at their house at eleven o'clock. I do not know whether their clocks might he right; it was dinner time when I was at the Bunch of Grapes, Ratcliffe Highway. I paid a shilling to an hackney coachman to draw me up to the India house. The coachman said it was about half past twelve. I attempted to go my journey. A man asked me if I was a Lancashire man. I told him, no; I had worked in that country a long while. I told him, I never had been over since July. He asked me to go and drink with him. I do not know the sign; he pointed to the entry, saying, go into the house, and in a few minutes I will come in. I had not been long in this house before a man came in, and asked me if I would go for a sailor. I had two glasses of rum, I asked the girl if I could have a bed. She took me up stairs and shewed me the bed. She charged me eighteen pence. I came down to my liquor. I had not been long there before this young man asked me if I would be a sailor, I thought I was in a wrong place. We hear of kidnapping in the country. I insisted upon my clothes. She fetched them, and said I had not paid my reckoning. I asked for the landlord. She said he was not in. I asked for the landlady. She said she was in the bar. I immediately attempted to go to the bar door. They tore my coat right down my back, and the young man struck me in the face. I received a violent punch on my private parts; I cannot tell by whom. The surgeon knows, ever since I have been in prison it has been a great injury to my health. The man tore my bundle open, and took out a pair of pepper and salt stockings, a sermon book, and a Ready Reckoner. These have never been returned to me. The charge she lies against me is two shillings and sixpence. I sent a friend for them, this gentleman. The officer brought me them. I had my breeches pocket tore, and I lost a one-pound note. I am quite a stranger. There never was one of the name before a bench of justices in the world.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it you lost the shoes - A. On the 18th of January last. I cannot say exactly what time of the day they were taken. I found them on the prisoner. About nine o'clock in the morning, I was going up St. James's-street, I met the prisoner with something under his arm, and as he had been drinking the week before, I asked him how he could keep drinking for a week without working. I took the shoes from under his arm. He used to assist me in opening my shop of a morning. I gave him in charge of a constable. He acknowledged that he had taken them. These are the shoes. They are mine. I had only had them on the Saturday before from Northampton.</p>

The prisoner came to my shop on Thursday the 18th of February, about three in the afternoon; she asked to see some silk handkerchiefs. I shewed her a paper of Barcelona handkerchiefs, of different colours. She looked at them for some time; then she said there were none of the right sort. She opened one, and spread it over the others to look at it. She then said she wanted to see some Belcher handkerchiefs. I shewed her a paper. She desired me to cut her one off, and she would call for it in half an hour with another article, and then she would pay me. Upon her not buying anything I was rather suspicious of her. She went out of the shop. I looked over the handkerchiefs, and I missed a piece of silk handkerchiefs. I clapped the handkerchiefs on the counter, and looked on the floor. There were no handkerchiefs there. I went to the door, and saw the prisoner five doors off. I seized her, and as I seized her some of the handkerchiefs fell from under her clothes. I instantly said, you have robbed me. She said, no, ma'am, I have not robbed you, child; I have paid for every thing I have got. I brought her back to the shop, and shook her, and nineteen handkerchiefs fell from her person. These are the handkerchiefs; they are mine. My husband's name is

The prisoners all were in discourse with us; the subject of the discourse was concerning a dance that was to be the next day. When my husband finished his pint of porter, he put on his hat to return home. and feeling for the violin, he found it was gone. I had put it down by the side of him. I made every enquiry, but could get no intelligence of it whatever. It was gone. On the next day, I found the violin at a pawnbrokers in Whitechapel. There were other persons in the room, but there were none that were in discourse with us. I did not see it taken. Whether it was taken while I went for the pint of beer, or afterwards, I cannot say. I sat my husband down on the box, and put the violin by the side of him.</p>

            . I am shop boy to Mr. Needes, pawnbroker, No. 7, Paternoster-row, Spitalfields. On the 14th of January, the two men prisoners came to our shop; they brought a fiddle with them, and asked me if my master was at home. I said, yes, he was at breakfast. I called him. They said they were sorry to give him so much trouble; they would be glad if he would tell them the worth of the violin. Master looked at it, and said he thought it was worth about a guinea, but he said it was according to people's fancy. They said they were much obliged to him; they had bought it for fifteen shillings. Master said it was cheap. They went out of the shop. That is all I know. I am quite sure they are the same men; I took particular notice of them.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Fleming, Whitechapel, a pawnbroker. On the 14th of January, about nine o'clock in the morning, a young man brought me the violin to pledge. I believe it to be Kemp. He had a blue apron on. I lent him nine shillings on it. On the evening of the same day, Mrs. Nichols came to our shop to know if we had taken in a violin. I told her I had taken one in in the morning. I shewed it her; it was her's. At Worship-street office, the blind man swore to the fiddle by the crack in it, and to the bow.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my bow, and this is my violin. There is a particular edge to it, and it has a particular tone. I have had it two years.</p>

            . The prisoner came in took up the boots and never spoke to me. They laid on the floor. A little boy had been playing with them. Our house is a private house. It was in the parlour where the little boy had been playing with them. The man came in and put them in his bag, and went off. He never spoke a word to me. I am sure he is the same person. The prisoner came in a few days after that. My mother said he was come upon the same occasion. He asked where the little girl was; he pulled out sixpence. He then offered eight-pence for the boots. He said I had sold him the boots for eight-pence. I had not.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw the prisoner in two or three days after this. When he came, I asked him where my boots were. He said he had come to pay my little girl for them.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they worth - A. I had not agreed to sell them. I would not sell them for eightpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Wedensday, the 13th of January, I was calling clothes in Noble-street, Goswell-street; his daughter said, master, my father has got some clothes to sell. I went up stairs. He sold me to the amount of three shillings and sixpence. I called again on the Friday. The girl said, her father was not at home, She said a clothes man offered her nine pence for the boots. She said, you take the boots and bring me the money as you come by. On Monday following, I went again. I said, Mr. Davis, I come to pay you nine-pence for the boots that I bought on the Friday. He said, I want my boots back. I said, how is it possible for me to bring them back, when I have sold them. Mr. Davis said I will not take a farthing less then five shillings. He charged an officer with me. A little while after he came into the public-house, and said, young man, you had better settle it before you go into custody. The officer said, no, I will not settle it; I have got charge of him. I said I would sooner go to jail than pay him five shillings for the boots.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On Thursday, the 4th of this month, I was called up by one of the patrols of Bow-street to go to the Duke's Head, in St. Martin's-street, Liecester-fields. I went there, and as I was going along I had some information give me. I went into the house. I searched the prisoner, Watson, and in Watson's right hand breeches pocket I found a one-pound bank note. I asked him where he got this note. He told me, that he had given change for it to a fare that he had carried. This was about a quarter to three in the morning. I found some silver. I took that away from him. I then asked the landlord, where was the man that came in along with Chaffy; meaning Watson. Watson goes by the name of Chaffy. Breze was pointed out to me. I went to Breze; he was sitting seemingly asleep, by himself; and on searching Breze I found this pocket-book in his pocket. I then said to Lewis, search the remaining part. Breze said he got that pocket-book from Chaffy.</p>

            . On Sunday the 24th of January, I was in Hyde park about four o'clock. I was walking with two or three gentlemen to Hyde-park-corner, towards Stanhope-street gate. When I got to <placeName id="t18130217-65-crimeloc382">Stanhope-street gate</placeName>

I immediately went towards him, and immediately I saw the man give the handkerchief into the hand of another man almost close to him, I immediately seized him by the collar. I looked on the ground, and saw my handkerchief drop from under his coat. I picked it up and held him by the collar. Eaton was the man that I laid hold of. I never quitted him until he was taken into a public-house. I sent for a constable, and he was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of the other man - A. He went away some where. He was not apprehended till the next morning. I am sure I saw my handkerchief in Eaton's hands.</p>

            , Mrs. Henry, and myself. One of her boxes was locked, the other had no lock. The prisoner unlocked the box herself, and as the things were taken out of the box she said they were given to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in either of the boxes that belonged to any part of your brother's family - A. Certainly. There were a great number of shirts, and two fine muslin handkerchiefs, which I recognised to belong to my family, and some tablecloths and dusters, which she confessed to have taken away. After having searched her boxes, I searched the prisoner's drawers, and found two shirts. She told me all these things had been given to her.</p>

             is a visitor at Mr. Sultana's, from Spain. On the 30th of January, at half after eight o'clock in the morning, the cook was cleaning the door; she went out to change a pail of water; she left the door wide open. As I was coming out of the parlour into the lobby I met the prisoner with the coat. I said, holloa, sir. He said, holloa, ma'am, and whipped the coat on his left arm. He walked from the lobby, and directly he got into South-street he ran. I ran after him, and called out, stop thief; with the coat under his arm. He dropped the coat before he was stopped. I am sure he is the man.</p>

I was in the kitchen very busy; a boy came in and said, you have lost your beef. I went and saw it was gone. It was hanging up in the house. I turned out of doors as fast as I could. I catched the prisoner with the beef about half way from there to Old Brentford. I brought him back, and charged a constable with him. He had the beef and the hook too. I believed it to be my beef.</p>

On Wednesday evening last, about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening, the two prisoners came into my shop together; they asked for some sprigged muslin. I shewed them some muslins myself; at the same time I was shewing another customer some handkerchiefs. I left the customer to shew them the muslin, and while I turned round to fell the price of the handkerchief, Jones took the muslin. I missed the muslin in about five minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity of that piece of muslin that was missed - A. Five yards. That was sprigged muslin. I asked them six shillings a yard for it. Jones went out of the shop, telling Williams that they were cheap.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you perceived that any muslin was missing before Jones got out of the shop - A. Mrs. Barker told me Jones had got a piece of muslin, and had taken it away, but I did not miss it myself. By that time Williams was going out. I saw Williams go out. I followed her. I stopped Williams, and brought her back. I told her she might have the muslin. I then asked her who the other woman was. She said she did not know the other woman. I told her I must detain her until I got the other woman. In about half an hour, Jones came in again. She asked Williams what was the reason that she staid. She said she had heard that Williams was kept a prisoner. I sent for an officer. They were both searched, and nothing but money was found upon either of them. I have never seen the muslin since.</p>

Mr. Shilds leaving me and serving them, made me look at them more than what I should have done. They looked at several pieces of muslin; they did not like any on the counter. Mr. Shields turned round to get some more muslin to shew them. I saw

Williams said, I am here for a piece of muslin that you have taken; this woman says you have taken it. Jones said, search me then, if you think I have got any thing. I said, it is not a time to search you, when you have been out of the shop, and may have got rid of it. She put herself in a posture to strike me. I am certain I saw her take the muslin.</p>

I told him, I was an officer, and it was my business. He said, I should not see it. He threw it into Aldgate-church-yard. I seized hold of him. I got the copper out. I asked him, how he came by it. He said he could not tell. I asked him, what he was going to do with it. He said, he did not know. He said, he wished I would shoot him. I told him, I had no authority to do that.</p>

The prisoner then drew a yellow silk handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket, and they all ran off. I followed the prisoner and lost him. On the Friday following, I saw the prisoner again with the gang about eight in number. I then followed him and took him. I searched him, and found these two handkerchiefs on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the handkerchief that you saw him take out of the gentleman's pocket - A. I lost him on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. You do no know that he stole them two handkerchiefs, did you - A. No.</p>

He threw it down, ran away, and I followed him.</p>
               <p>MR. WADMAN, SENIOR. I saw the prisoner out of the back room, passing out of one loft into another. It is an open door that looks into the yard. I ran directly to my son, and told him there was somebody in the loft. I know what was in that box; seventy-four capillaire bottles. I saw him with the box in his hand. They were empty bottles.</p>

            , junior. On the 5th of the present month, the patrol came and told me that a man had rolled a barrel out of the yard. I went with him to the watchhouse where it was lodged, and looked at it. I saw it was my employer's cask. I went down to the brew-house and told the clerk. We examined it together, and found it contained beer grounds. I went in the yard, and fastened the men in the yard. I questioned the men upon it, and one of the men confessed.</p>

            . I am a patrol. A little better than half after five in the morning of the 5th, I was going past the gate of this yard. I saw the prisoner rolling this cask out of the gate, and I saw him rolling it down Drury-lane. He rolled it into the coal-yard, and he placed it behind a cart. I then watched him. He went to the top of the coal-yard and looked about, as if he was watching somebody. I and my partner took him to the watchhouse. He at first said he bought it at the other end of the town; at last he said he bought it of Combe's stock. I saw him come out of the gate.</p>

               <p>ROBERT HOPKINS I am a lighterman employed by Messrs. Browning's. They had ten floats of Swedish timber, each float, containing eighteen pieces. It was under my care.</p>
               <p>Q. On Thursday the 4th of this month, did you examine the timber - A. I did, about eight o'clock in the morning. At that time it was all safe in there, at Sandy Dock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine it the next day - A. No, I did not. I was passing and repassing the wharf on the next day; I did not miss any of it. On the next morning, I missed six pieces from the outside. That was about eight o'clock. On the Friday, they were fastened with four ropes, three single ropes and one double. The ropes were cut. I have no hesitation in saying they were cut; it plainly appeared so. In the forenoon I enquired about London. In the afternoon, I went towards Brentford. In my passage up, I received information that a barge had passed by early in the morning, belonging to Mr. Watkins, with some timber a stern, which answered the description of that stolen. I got that information about half after four o'clock on the Friday. In consequence of that information I went up to Robinson's wharf, on the Brentford cut. On his wharf, I found five pieces of timber that I had lost, fastened to a ring on the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that the timber that you found at Mr. Robinson's wharf, was the timber that you lost from your master's premises - A. Yes, I am perfectly sure it was. I went to Mr. Watkins's house, and there I found the prisoner was his <rs id="t18130217-88-deflabel524" type="occupation">bargeman</rs>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, when he was charged with this, say where he got the five pieces of timber - A. Before the magistrate he stated that a man had brought him the timber, within Battersea reach, about three o'clock on the morning of the Friday. The magistrate told him it was an unsatisfactory account; be should commit him. He said that the man told him to take it to Mr. Robinson's wharf, Brentford-cut, and leave it there for Pool's boats. Pool is the owner of boats employed for the inland navigation.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 5th of February, did the barge arrive at your wharf - A. He arrived at my wharf on Friday, about nine o'clock. On Friday, in the morning, he had nothing in the barge, nor to the barge. When he came to my wharf, he told me that he had some timber for me. I understood him that it came from Bow-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not at that time employed him to bring any timber had you - A. No, I had not. The raft was five pieces; the boy was upon the five pieces. He brought it along side of my wharf, and made it fast. He said it was for Pool's boats. I asked him for a note. He said he had none, but the person that gave him the timber would be at my wharf about the time that the barge arrived.</p>

            . Q. You worked on board this barge under the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 3rd and 4th of February were you at White-friars with the barge - A. Yes; we left Whitefriars on Thursday, between five and six in the evening. The timber was brought to the barge at White-friers, about ten o'clock on the Thursday morning. It was brought by a small boat. I don't know the man that brought it. At that time there was not water enough to bring it up to the barge; it was fastened to some coal barges that lay outside.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces were they - A. Five pieces. I saw it in the morning, at day-light. Between five and six in the evening, we came out of White-friers. We took the timber astern, and went to the Temple, and there lay for the tide turning. On Friday morning, we went up to Brentford with the timber.</p>
               <p>Q. This timber you brought from London and took down to Brentford - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Then is it true, that about Battersea reach this timber was delivered by some man, and fastened to the barge - A. No, sir, it was not delivered within the reach at all.</p>
               <p>Q. to John Browing. What is the value of these five pieces of timber - A. About forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man brought this timber to me in Whitefriars, to my barge. He asked me whether I worked for Mr. Robinson. I told him, I did. I asked him, whether he had got a note with the timber. He said, he had not, but a note would be there as soon as the barge. I took the timber in the barge to Brentford, to Mr. Robinson's wharf. He asked me whether I had got a note. I said. I had not. I am innocent of this felony you may depend upon it. I did not know of the timber being stolen. I took it up as carriage.</p>

On the 9th of February, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came up to the door and enquired the price of some handkerchiefs. The boy told her the price of the handkerchiefs. She stepped a few paces back, returned, and took the flannel. I pursued her, and saw the flannel under her cloak. I brought her back, and when I put the flannel on the counter, she made her escape. She escaped four times, and I took her again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the flannel - A. It stood against the door-port, part inside, and part out. I am sure the prisoner is the woman. This is the flannel; it is mine.</p>

After I had missed it, one of my neighbours came and said, Mrs. Wilcox had taken a pail out of my yard, and she would shew me where the prisoner lived. I went to her house. I knocked at the door; nobody came. I went in. I said, one of my neighbours said you took a pail out of my yard. She said, no such thing. I took a pail up. I said, this is my pail. I told her I had missed a tablecloth. I said, I shall be obliged to you to give it me. I said, I saw it under your petticoats. Oh, no, she said, that is my ragged smock. A constable came.

            . On the evening of the 17th of this month, I was in Clement's inn, coming out of the gate, towards the Strand. I saw the prisoner making towards Clement's-lane. As soon as I got out of the gate, I stepped across, and stopped him. A second person came up and laid hold of him by the other side. He said, what do you stop me for; I have done nothing. I said, my friend, if you have done nothing, you can have no objection to go back. Thornton came up, and said, that is the man that robbed me.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street office. On the 13th of this month, I stopped the prisoner in Hackney-road, about half past seven at night. It was then dark. He was driving the pig towards Shoreditch church. I crossed the road to meet him. He turned, and went as if he was going towards Hackney. I then ran up to him, and asked him how he came by that pig. He said, he met a man, and the man said he would give him sixpence to drive the pig to Shoreditch church. The next day Mr. Cooper owned the pig.</p>

            . Q. Were you in the public-house - A. Yes. I saw Mary Flemming bring the prosecutor the beer. The prosecutor gave her a shilling to change. I saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket; he took out four one-pound notes, some silver, and halfpence. He ran out with them.</p>

               <p>"Stretham, Surry. Mrs. Curtis will be oblidged to Mr. Eyles to send me by the carrier, twelve yards of strong bombazeen; likewise will thank you to send two patterns of double twilled sarsenett. I think I paid you four shillings and sixpence per yard for some bombazeen, am not certain." I gave directions for the bombazeen to be cut off, and it was cut off, as many yards as were ordered, twelve yards. The prisoner represented herself to be the carrier. The bombazeen was delivered to her.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the worth of that bombazeen - A. Two pounds seventeen shillings. I think the note speaks of her intention to pay for it very soon. I never was paid for it. In consequence of my not receiving the money at Christmas, I sent the bill to Stretham. No person could be found answering that description. There was a Mrs. Curtis living at Stretham, in very low circumstances. It could not possibly be for her. She disowned having sent for them. I packed up the parcel myself, and delivered it to the prisoner. I have never seen the silk or the money since.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see this woman again - A. I saw her at Guildhall, on her examination, about three weeks or a month ago, just after the last sessions.</p>

            . We went in about half past five or a quarter to six in the evening. We remained there until six in the morning. About five minutes past six in the morning, I heard a key or a pick-lock enter the lock of the warehouse door. I proceeded from the place we were concealed to the door, and placed myself where in such a situation as to be behind the door it opened. I heard the bolt of the lock distinctly forced back twice. I observed when I got to the door that I had left a light burning. I sent Mr. Pratt to put it out. Before Mr. Pratt could get to the light, I saw the door open. I saw a person enter the warehouse about three feet. There were some packages all round the door, so that it did not open immediately. I saw a person enter about three feet in the warehouse. He stood and looked round him. to see if all was safe, as I supposed. I could see that he had a dark coat on. I attempted to lay hold of his collar, and at the same time to close the door, but I could not succeed in either. I found the door was held fast It was held tight by somebody, that any person that I attempted to seize might run out. He ran out. I followed him close across the street. He turned the corner of Mitre-street. I recovered sight of him immediately round the corner.</p>

               <p>Q. The same person that you followed was the same person that came out of the warehouse - A. I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same body that was moving before you, that you caught sight of immediately you turned the corner - A. It was. He ran down Mitre-street, (it is very short) through a gateway, into Little Duke's-place, down a narrow passage into Great Duke's-place. He turned the corner into King-street. I there caught him just recovering from a fall, as I supposed. The moment that I laid hold of his collar, he said, I am not the man; he has run that way; pointing down the street, in a different direction from the person I pursued. I kept fast hold of his collar. I brought him back the same way that we run. He said nothing. There was a person came up in a light drab coat. He said, all is right.

No, I said, we make no abate meat at all. She then asked for a quire. I gave it her. She gave half a crown. My sight not being so cleaver, I took it to Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones said, it was a very base half-crown. He came with me, and asked her where she got that half-crown. She said she found it in the street. He said, he would send for a constable, as she had bad money about her. When the constable came, he took her backwards and searched her. The constable has the half-crown.

I accordingly did send for a constable, and in the interim my son came into the shop, and in the passage leading to behind the counter, he picked up a something, and gave it me. It was a paper, containing six counterfeit shillings. When the constable came, I gave him the half-crown and the six shillings. The six shillings were picked up by my son after I said I would send for a constable, and charged her with being a bad woman of that description. He picked them up about two yards distance from the place where the prisoner was standing. I delivered precisely the some shillings to the constable, as my son delivered to me.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, I went and apprehended the prisoner. I searched her in Mr. Jones's accompting-house. I found on her person this pocket-book; inside of it was a new two-penny stamp and some duplicates. I found in her pocket, besides, ten-pence in copper. I asked her, how she came by that half-crown. She said, she slept with a gentleman; he gave her that half-crown, and she knew nothing of the shillings. I produce the half-crown and the six shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that half-crown, is it base or good - A. It is a counterfeit. It is merely washed. There is no silver in it; and the six shillings, they are all counterfeit.</p>

I gave him half-a-crown, and in about half an hour after the young man picked up these six shillings, several people came in the shop.

He borrowed three oranges of a brother Jew, and made up a dozen. My brother offered him sixpence for them. The prisoner said to me, if you will give me a three-shilling piece, I will give half-a-crown change. I gave him a three-shilling piece. He gave me an eighteen-penny piece and a shilling. I gave the whole of the money to the constable. A boy came up and said something, and in consequence of what the boy said I went back to the corner of the bank, and from there I went to the side of the Exchange. The prisoner was there selling oranges. I told him he had given me bad change. He offered to change them. He said he was very sorry for it. I said, no, if I let him change them I should be as bad as he was. I led him along as far as the counter. A parcel of Jews kept round him; they said I was no constable, I had no right to take him. Then I let him go. He ran up the Old Jewry as fast as he could run. I ran after him, and my brother. I cried, stop thief. A man stopped him. Mr. Fenner came up and took him to the Compter. I went with him.</p>

We told him, yes, and gave him one. He gave us an eighteen-penny piece and a bad shilling. My brother took the shilling, and afterwards gave it to Fenner. After we brought the oranges we went on to the Bank, a boy stopped us, and told us something.

We took him as far as the Compter, and then he ran away. I ran after him and halloaed out, stop thief. He was stopped. A constable came and took him to the Compter. He was searched, and a few halfpence was found on him, perhaps enough to buy him a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>- . I was walking past. I saw the prisoner dealing with these gentleman. I was going towards Cheapside. I had seen the Jew selling oranges before. One of the gentlemen offered him a sixpence. He said, I do not think this sixpence is a good one. The gentleman then gave him an eighteen-penny piece. He gave him a shilling; it had a black circle round it. He had a great deal more silver. I dare say he had two pounds worth. He selected this shilling, took one out, and gave it him. He had more shillings marked in the same way as that was. The other gentleman wanted a dozen oranges; he had only nine left; he borrowed three of another jew. He gave him a sixpence. He refused that. He said, give me a three-shilling piece, I will give you half-a-crown. I went to these gentlemen and told them the Jew had given them bad money, and pointed out the prisoner at Sweeting's-alley. I said, the Jew is selling there. I am positive he is the man. I have known him for two or three years.</p>
