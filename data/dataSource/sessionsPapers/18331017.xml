            . I live at No. 8, Gardener's-lane, York-street, Westminster. On Sunday, the 6th of October, the prisoner came in between eight and nine o'clock, and asked if he could be accommodated with a lodging for the night; my wife said, Yes; he sat down and took off a pair of boots, which he said hurt his feet - he said he would sell them and get a pair of shoes in exchange; he asked me to go with him, but I refused - he asked me to let one of my children go; I refused, but told him where to sell them, and he said he had a parcel of things he had brought from hopping - he left two parcels with me, containing seven forks and other things; he left them on my shelf - one was wrapped in an old blue handkerchief, and the other in a piece of stuff - my wife had occasion to move them; she did so, and she spoke to me, and I took the parcel from her hand, shoved the cloth back, and the prongs of the silver forks came out - I did not open them; I sent my son-in-law for a police officer, and while he was gone I went to where I had sent him to sell the boots, and cautioned them not to buy them - he came down with me from the place he was selling the boots at, to my house, and I kept him till I gave him to the officer; the two parcels were delivered to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The person told me, if I gave the property up, I might go about my business, or something of that sort. Witness. I did not hear it said.</p>
               <p>ALLEN CHAMBERLAIN (policeman B 57). I went with Fox to his lodging, and saw the prisoner; Fox pointed him out to me - the prisoner then had two bundles in his hand; he gave them to me - I examined them, one contained seven silver forks and a small gravy ladle; the other five silver forks and two table spoons, and he had a pair of boots and a pair of stockings in his hand - I searched him, and in the left side of his breast, found a large soup ladle, and in his left-hand waistcoat pocket, I found a silver tea spoon, two knife rests, two purses, and a silver knife, a caddy ladle, and other things, as stated in the indictment - I produce them - on returning to the lodging, Fox gave me a cap and needle case, which had been left on the mantle shelf.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. His evidence is correct; I have nothing to say to him further than I delivered the things up.</p>
               <p>ALLEN CHAMBERLAIN re-examined. Q. Did you propose to him that it would be better to give you information? A. No; after finding the property on him, I asked whose they were, and where he got them, but I neither threatened nor made him any promise, and he voluntarily said at first that it was immaterial to me where he got them - I said it was no matter whether he told me or not; he then said, "Seeing a gate open, I went down an area, and put my foot against a shutter, and shoved it open; I thought there would be a turning into some street which would take me home, but seeing the plate, it looked very tempting, and I took it."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him I took the first gateway to be a turning, but when I entered the house I took it to be a house to let, and when I entered the window I clapped my hand on the boots.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 6th of October, my servant alarmed my son, and I came down stairs into the kitchen, in consequence of what he told me - I found a large piece broken out of the kitchen shutter, which was done with force; the piece of the shutter is here - it was broken so as to enable a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170004"/>person to get in - I lost a pair of boots, those produced are the same; these articles of plate are also mine; this handkerchief does not belong to me - the silver is worth 20l. odd, perhaps it would cost 30l. to buy it new; I am certain it is much above 5l. in value - the knife rests are not silver; the spoons and forks are all silver, and the two ladles, one alone is worth 5l.; the twelve forks are worth 11l.; the eleven tea spoons are worth about 4l.; and two table spoons worth 1l. - they are very heavy; I consider them worth more than 5l. - I had these articles in use previous to the loss - I do not know how the kitchen was left over night - the watchman who ought to have watched my house is here.</p>

               <p>JOHN REEVE re-examined. I observed the area of this house about twelve o'clock at night, when I went round the court and saw all safe; there is a gate to the court; I locked it after twelve o'clock, and I opened it at five o'clock in the morning to go round to call the half-hour; I left it open to let the lamp-lighter in; I saw nothing of the prisoner - a few minutes before six o'clock, in the morning I saw the prisoner behind the gate inside, and asked what he did there; he said he had just looked in to see a place to sit down in out of the cold; I said, that was not a place to sit down in; he turned about, and went away while I was opening the other half of the gate; not seeing him with anything, I let him go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I ask all the mercy that can be had, as the things are brought back, and it is the first thing I ever did in my life; I am very sorry I have done it; I was rather oppressed in my mind, and if you will look over it, I will never do the like again, and go to the workhouse till I can get work - when I entered, I took the house to be to let, by a paper in the window, which was a broken pane of glass - as I have been so unfortunate as to take the property, I hope you will show me every mercy; I will never do the like any more as long as I live; I deserve punishment I know.</p>

               <p>Delaney. Q. Did I not tell you as I was passing by, I picked up the watch, and when Mr. Jones laid hold of me it fell out of my hand? A. No; you did not say that.</p>
               <p>DAVID JONES. These chains are decidedly my property? they are worth sixteen guineas; the gold watch I did not take notice of; some small things were picked up by a female neighbour, and brought in to me, and several things were missed.</p>
               <p>Delaney. All I have to say is, to beg the mercy of the Court; distress and want of employment drove us to do it; we were in a state of starvation.</p>

             (policeman). I was on duty on the 29th of September, in Brydges-street, Covent-garden, between six and seven o'clock. I saw the prisoner go across the street with a bundle on his back, towards Russell-court; I went over, stopped him, and asked what he had in his bundle - he said some wearing apparel belonging to his woman - I asked him where he brought it from; he said from Phoenix-alley - I asked him why he did so - he said he owed his landlord some rent, and he was afraid he would detain the articles for it - I took him to the station-house, and he there stated that he brought the bundle from Short's-gardens, and then from Queen-street, Seven-dials, and then from Henry-street, Waterloo-road - I detained him, examined the bundle, and asked him what marks there were on the articles; he said he would not tell me - I then searched him, and found two keys on him, one of which exactly fits the prosecutrix's parlour door - I afterwards shewed Mrs.

             the property, which she identified - I went to the premises and examined them, and found the thief must have got in at the area; he must have got down into the area, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170007"/>pushed back the kitchen door, and got up to the staircase door, out of which a pannel was cut, and a bar was broken off the parlour door.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you conclude that he entered in below? A. He got in at the window; I cannot say whether the window was fastened or not - from the window he could go to the kitchen door and open that easily - he then cut out the pannel of the stair-case door; I found the shop in confusion, and some clocks packed up in a blanket - the property seemed to be removed, and ready to be taken away; I have the property here which I found on his person - I took him between six and seven o'clock; I have a coat which was afterwards found on the premises, and the prisoner had not coat on when I took him - there is a handkerchief in the pocket of the coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time did you take me? A. It was half-past six o'clock when I took you to the station-house; it was not exactly dark - you made no scruple at going with me; you carried the bundle to the station-house.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BOWMAN. I live at No. 4, Bevenden-street, Hoxton, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch; Mr. Jones's dwelling house is in the same parish; his Christian name is Thomas. On Sunday evening, the 29th of September, about half-past seven o'clock, I was at my own door, and saw two men in the street, occasionally talking together, close to Mr. Jones's house, but on the opposite side of the street; they separated three or four times, and came together again and talked - I don't know either of them; they repeatedly passed Mr. Jones's house one at a time, and then one of them pulled out a watch to see the time, then immediately crossed over to the other side where the other man was, and met him by Jones's door; they were then within five yards of Jones's door - they were both at the door about a minute conversing together, one with his foot on the steps, and the other off the steps - they then parted; the one who had pulled his watch out walked away, and the other entered the house; I saw him put his hand to the door, and he went in, and shut it again- I am sure the door was shut; my house is directly opposite; I afterwards saw a light in the house, in Mrs. Harlow's front bed room, which is on the first floor - this was five or six minutes after I saw the man go in; I could distinctly see one person in the room, holding a light; I directed my son to go over and inform Mrs. Jones, who was in the premises attached to the house, but not where I saw the light; I went myself over to the front door, and knocked gently, and the prisoner came to the door - he had no candle; I said nothing to him; he directly rushed out past me and got from me - I laid hold of him - he hit me a violent blow on the chest, and his hat fell off - he got away; I pursued, and overtook him about an hundred yards off in the street - he was stopped - I was not twenty yards behind him; he ran into a baker's shop, but the crowd was so great round, that I could not get into the shop - I went back to Mr. Jones's house, and saw Mrs. Harlow's apartments - I never lost sight of the prisoner from the time he came out of the house, till he went into the baker's shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not rather dark in Jones's house? A. There were two lamps lighted in the street, and it was as light as possible - it was dark in the house; the person inside made a sudden rush very quick - I did not try the door before the man entered, it appeared to me to be shut.</p>

            , JUN. I was in the street with my father - he sent me to Mrs. Jones's - he knocked at the door when I came back, and the prisoner came out; I am sure of him - I saw him hit my father, and he nearly knocked him off the pavement - I saw the prisoner's hat knocked off; he left it behind him, and ran away into Mr. Lloyd's the baker's - I am quite sure he is the man - the street was very light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from the door when the man came out? A. About the middle of the pavement on the same side of the way, there was no crowd then - there was a crowd round the baker's shop.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Brookes'. On the Sunday night in question, I was near Jones's house with three more young lads - I saw Bowman go up to Jones's door and knock, and I observed two men come out - the prisoner was one of them I am quite sure; they walked out quickly - I am sure the prisoner was one; I saw him struggling with Bowman; the prisoner's hat was knocked off, and I picked it up and took it to the station-house, and gave it to the inspector; there was one shirt in it marked Kain, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170008"/>separate letters - I marked them before I gave them up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from the door when Bowman was struggling with the man? A. On the curb, about a yard from him - I always said the prisoner was the man - I never said I thought he was the man; Bowman's hat was not knocked off; no crowd came up while he was struggling - Bowman hallooed "Stop thief," and several persons ran.</p>

            . I live within about a quarter of a mile of the place; about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was passing the street, and saw the prisoner and another man talking together in the street Jones's house is in - which is Bevenden-street, they were about an hundred yards from Jones's house; I then went on - I am confident of the prisoner from having known him eight or nine years in the neighbourhood; I returned about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after seven o'clock; (Jones retails beer:) as I returned down the street, the prisoner followed me up very close - I stood and let him pass me, then I went to Jones's to have a glass of beer, that is sold at a back door which goes to the brewery; while there, in consequence of an alarm, I followed young Bowman out as he came and gave an alarm - I went to the front door, and saw a man just come out, and strike Mr. Bowman, and then I saw another come out - I saw the prisoner's hat fall off; the other man got away- I pursued the prisoner after he got from Bowman, and never lost sight of him till he got into the baker's shop - I there gave him into custody; he said,"I am not the man, I was only running as others were;" I said, I was positive he was the man who came out of the house, and that I knew him before, and could not be mistaken - he had no hat on at the baker's.</p>

            . I am a baker. On Sunday, the 29th of September, a little before eight o'clock, a mob of people burst into my shop door, the prisoner was one of them; he had not hat on - I did not know him before; he asked me to let him out at my back door - he could not have got into any street without scaling the walls; I made no reply, and he did not go; I found a policeman at my door - he came in, and secured the prisoner, and took him away; at a quarter after eleven o'clock on the same night, I found a red silk handkerchief concealed between two empty sacks on the top of a full one in my shop - I had seen the prisoner standing there for about a moment; there were six table spoons in the handkerchief, and three castor tops - I took them to the station-house, and left them in the custody of the policeman, No. 21.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the upper sack empty? A. The two were empty - there were seven sacks, and these two were placed on a full sack; they were merely put there out of the way.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). About six years ago I was convicted at the Old Bailey, and sentenced to be transported for life, when I was sent to New South Wales, at which place I arrived about five years and a half ago: when I got there I was taken into the service of Mr. Bodman, an auctioneer, resident there; I continued in his service only a few weeks, and after that time he gave me a little liberty, for this reason - as I was in my bed I was awakened by a noise in the back kitchen which was occasioned by two men breaking into his house, I got up and alarmed the master and the rest of the family; my master's clerk fired at one of the men out of the window, when they ran off, and were seen no more. In a few days afterwards I had occasion to go out upon some business for my master, when I was stopped by two men, who threatened to take my life away if they caught me going about after dark; when I returned I acquainted my master with it, and he told me he would see if something could not be done for me: on the Sunday following he gave me a new suit of clothes, and told me I might have a little liberty; I was afterwards persuaded by a friend to go on board of the New Zealand schooner bound for the River Thames, at New Zealand; when I got on board I went to work for the captain, who told me, if I would sail with him he would give me £3 current money, per month, which offer I accepted; when we were cleared out I answered to my name at the custom-house, and I considered that my master had done something for me, as there was no objection to my going away in the New Zealand. I was away from Sidney about seven weeks, when I returned with a cargo of flax and Indian corn. I remained at Sidney about thirteen days, and was paid off there; and then I joined the New Zealand schooner again, when we went to a place called the Bay of Islands, where the crew left her. When I left the schooner I went into the service of Mr. Fishwick, a settler of New Zealand; after I left the service of Mr. Fishwick I then shipped on board the ship Thetis, of London, sperm whaler, bound for the Coast of Japan, Captain

I remained in China about three months when I shipped on board the Tremont, of Boston, Captain Russell Sturgess, bound for England and from thence to Germany, there I remained, by my own request, about six weeks, and then I returned to England again, where I have remained ever since; and when the people took me into custody, they found me at work in the stable belonging to the master that I have been working for ever since I came home. I have always considered myself a freeman, as I was cleared out of the Customs and Police at Sidney twice, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170010"/>likewise, my master, Mr. Bodman and my brother, who was at that time living as second coachman to his late majesty

            . I live at Fulham. I was working in a field near the Bishop's-walk, on the day in question, and saw two men running in a place called Devil's-lane, which leads out of the Bishop's-walk to the Putney-road; I was near enough to see them when they first ran - the prisoner was one of them; I did not know him before - I am quite sure of him; he was about half a mile from the gate of the bishop's palace - it is a lane which comes right into the main road, across Fulham-fields - I am quite sure the prisoner was one - it was exactly at half-past four o'clock; I had seen him twice before that day - he pulled his hat off his head, and put his hand into his hat, and he gave the tall man some money; I was not near enough to see the money, but I heard it - I saw no bag - I saw nothing more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you in a field? A. Yes; there was nothing between the field and the road - I was near the path; there was a hedge to the field - the Devil's-lane is a good distance from Bishop's-walk, upwards of half a mile - Bishop's-walk leads into Devil's-lane; it is close by.</p>

            . I live in Fulham. On the 6th of September I was at Mr. Steel's, about four o'clock, and saw two men come out of Devil's-alley running, about twenty yards from me - I did not look at their faces - I cannot tell who they were - after they had been running they stopped; the little one pulled off his hat, and gave the big one some money; I did not then look at their faces; I cannot tell who it was - the little one snatched a red purse away from the tall one; I did not see whether any money was taken out of a purse - after the short one snatched the purse, he put his hand into his hat, pulled out some money, and put it into the purse, then put it into his hat and ran on - I had seen them once before in the morning of that day, up by Mr. Steel's - I am sure they were the same men; it was about eleven o'clock in the morning - I cannot say whether the prisoner was one of them or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the last witness your mother? A. No - we were gathering beans together, she stood up and looked at them as we were going along - she was two or three yards from me - I was about twenty yards from the men - their backs were towards me, and she was following me - their backs were towards her.</p>

On the 6th of September I was returning home between nine and ten o'clock, when a man passed me very close - it was near the church - it was not moonlight; but sufficiently light for me to see his face - there was a lamp by the church where he first passed me; he passed me and turned round and looked at me - he was going the road I was going to take up to Old Brompton - he crossed to the public-house, but did not enter the house - he went up the Old Brompton road, on the left hand side of the way by the wall - I walked to the public-house - and I did not like to stop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170011"/>there, but passed to the other side of the road, not liking his appearance, when I saw two persons going down the road, and I followed down the road - I had not gone many yards down the road, when he came from the right hand side of the road before me - it was the same man I had seen before - I am sure - it was dark at the entrance, but there was a light lower down - he came across towards me and began to speak, but what he said, I cannot say, but he snatched my reticule, it was not fastened to my hand - it was round my wrist, and round my fingers - he got it away; he snatched it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it require force to pull it from you? A. Yes, he broke the string - he took my shawl off, and parasol and knocked me down on the ground, and ran off - he took them altogether - he did not knock me down first - when he took the shawl he pushed me down, and ran off towards town. I saw him again directly after - my shawl and parasol were returned to me by somebody, and I saw my reticule at Queen-square, next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This "knock down" was a push, was it not? A. I don't know what you call a push - he threw me down with his hand - he did not give me a blow - the reticule, shawl, and parasol all went from me - somebody picked up the shawl, and parasol, and gave them to me - my shawl was pinned.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him at the police-office, did you not at first refuse to swear to him? A. I hesitated to swear on account of the disagreeableness of going through this unpleasantness, not that I doubted whether he was the man - I did not tell the magistrate I doubted whether he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the magistrate give you a quarter of an hour to make up your mind? A. No - I hesitated, but not so long as a quarter of an hour - perhaps it was ten minutes - nobody but my own relatives whispered to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did they whisper? A. If I was certain he was the man to say so, and I was certain of him - I did not say to the best of my belief - I said he was the man - I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not say in the hearing of a gentleman, "I say it is now to the best of my belief?" A. I am certain he is the man - what I swore at the office was not read over to me - I signed some paper - that signature is mine (looking at it), I was not asked if it was corect it was read over at the prisoner's desire and I heard it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of a lamp was there in the place where the attack was made on you? A. It was at the entrance of the Old Brompton-road - there was a gas lamp on the right hand side - there was a lamp on Brompton Chapel, and one just beyond the Grammar School - the lamp was about ten feet from where I and the prisoner were together.</p>

I took him to the watch-house, searched him, and found on him three half-crowns, and a piece of green ribbon, a tailor's thimble and a small box of snuff which he said was thirty-six - I went to the spot where Mrs. Sugden was robbed, to look about, but it was too dark as the lamp did not afford light enough to discover anything on the ground, there were marks of scuffling on that spot, but the dirt had covered over anything which might be there - I went in the morning as soon as it was light, which was near five o'clock, and found a steel purse, two half-crowns, one shilling, a piece of black ribbon, for a reticule apparently, and a pair of gloves.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is that the reticule you produced in the last case? A. Yes; it belongs to this case - the constable who found the black reticule which I have is sick, but I saw him find it over in a garden - his name is

I am the housekeeper; I went out on Thursday, the 12th of September, between five and six o'clock in the morning, and left my wife at home - between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I left my work and called at my mother's, and my wife was there; I went from there to my club, and on leaving my club, I met my wife, and we both went home - when I got home I found the front door locked as usual, and on going through the house to the back premises, I found the back door unbolted and ajar - I made no further inquiry that night; the back door opens into my own yard - next morning I went to my work, and on returning, between seven and eight o'clock, my wife was up stairs; she gave me information, and I examined, and missed a coat, waistcoat, and trousers, a violin, and some more things - the prisoner has worked for me at different times, and so has Rayner - I was in debt to them nearly 9s. between them on the day of the robbery; they both came to me the day after the robbery and asked for money - they were both still working for me - I told them I would pay them as soon as I returned from breakfast, having no money with me - I had not at that time missed my goods; when I returned from breakfast they were gone - I did not see them any more till they were in custody; they never came back to ask for their money - I made inquiry after them directly, suspecting them - I have since seen my things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You say they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170013"/>were in your occasional employ? A. Only employed now and then - I am a bricklayer, but I have a gravel-pit of my own; I sometimes make bricks of the gravel - the prisoner was not employed by the week, nor by the day, only by the hour, as he took it into his head - he never worked a whole day together for me - I am sure of that; I can swear it - he never worked a whole day for me throughout; he was a poorish lad - he had no other way of getting a living that I know of, but through me; I did not know he wanted his money before the morning; he never asked me for his wages before - I said I would pay him when I returned from breakfast, and when I returned he was gone; that was the morning after the robbery - Rayner was with him then, and asked for money as well.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you never was asked by the prisoner before for his wages? A. Not for the whole of it; I always paid him what he asked, but it was his father's particular wish I should not pay him his wages, for he never brought any money home - I was the only person who would employ him, and he agreed before his father to work, and I was to pay him on Saturday night, but he said he had no means of getting victuals - I said,"Suppose I go with you to your father, and I will pay all that is coming to you" - on the day before, he came to a boy, and gave him money to work for him, saying, he could live much easier than by work - Rayner has been in my employ two or three months, at different times.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Parker. The prisoner and I worked together on Thursday, the 12th of September, at Mr. Parker's - I went away from my work at six o'clock in the evening, and after working, I and the prisoner went to a cook's shop, and as I was sitting down to get my supper, Isaacs said to me, "Mr. and Mrs. Parker are out; there is a gift, will you go?" - I told him no I would not go - he did not say what I was to go for; I did not know what he meant by a gift - no person joined us on that occasion - after that, he said he had been up in the room on Tuesday night and got a coat - a person named Alburn came past the cook's shop while we were there; he looked in at the door, and Isaacs went out and spoke to him - Isaacs came in again, and told me to make haste and eat my supper, and go along with him - I consented to go - me, Isaacs, and Alburn went - there is a place called Globe-lane chapel; it is twenty or thirty yards from Parker's house - when we got there the prisoner told me to wait there to see if Mr. or Mrs. Parker came out of the house they were in - that house was not twenty or thirty yards from the chapel - if I saw either of them come out, I was to go to the end of Mr. Parker's street, and Isaacs said he would be there- if I saw them come out, I was to go and tell him, and if not I was to go in twenty minutes time against Bethnalgreen church, which is about five minutes walk from Parker's house - Isaacs said he would be at Bethnal-green church in twenty minutes - I waited twenty minutes; I did not see Parker, or his wife come out - I went to Bethnalgreen church, and saw Isaacs, and he gave me a waistcoat - he did not give me anything else; he told me to go and pawn it - it was just dusk - I pawned it; I don't know the name; it was the first pawnbroker's - he pointed with his hinger and told me where to go - I pawned it with the witness Rubey for 1s., in the name of Smith I think - I came out and offered the money to Isaacs: he told me I might keep it, and he gave me another shilling going along - he said nothing then - a minute or two after this Alburn came up and told me how Isaacs got in at the window; the prisoner was present; he did not say how they got out again - he said it was Parker's up-stairs window and they had got into with a ladder - Isaacs abused Alburn for telling me how he got in; after that I heard Isaacs say he had laid the plan before and let it be to watch an opportunity of Mr. and Mrs. Parker's being out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Pray how long had you worked for Parker? A. Two months; the prisoner had worked with me, on and off, I don't rightly know how long; I think about six weeks off and on - he very seldom worked for a week together - I don't think he ever did three or four days together - Mr. Parker is a man we could get no wages of; he owes me some now- the prisoner had not applied from time to time for his wages; he owed him some - the prisoner was in want of victuals sometimes, as he told me - I have known him for a day together without being able to get any - he has told me two or three days he could not get any - I have known him without a meal for two or three days - I don't know whether Parker knew that he was without victuals during that time - he had asked Parker for money and told him he was starving; I heard him ask Mr. Parker; but Parker did not have the money at present to give him: he said when he got some he would give him some - that has not occurred more than once; that was about a week before the robbery - he was represented that the reason he asked for the money was to buy victuals - Parker has told him frequently that he had not money, but when he had he would give him some - I was myself in want one or two days before; I was without victuals at that time; Parker was in my debt - I went three or four Saturday nights; he was not able to give it me; he gave me 6d. one Saturday night; 1s. on another - he owed me for three or four weeks - I was almost starving for want of victuals, and not able to get money to buy it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner tell you he could not live without victuals, that he was kept starving, and his master would not pay him, at the time he said he had planned this? A. No; he had represented it before; the coat was taken, on the Tuesday preceding - the waistcoat was not a very good one - I have often heard Parker say his father had told him, if he did not give him the money, he should not have any victuals at home - I will undertake to swear that Parker has been without the means of giving it to him, and could not pay - Alburn was working there, and he was half starved as well; he was not at work at that time - my father is living; I had made no arrangement<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170014"/>for my father to receive the money - he owed me about 5s. 4d., and Isaacs 4s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On the night of the robbery, when you were at supper, had the prisoner been eating supper? A. Yes, with the 8d. that was left at dinner-time.</p>

               <p>JOHN GEORGE (policeman). I apprehended the prisoner on the 28th of September, close by the Mansion-house; I had been looking for him before - I was on the opposite side of the way; I crossed over and said, "Isaacs, I suppose you know I want you;" he stopped directly, and said, "Ah, but you can't take me in the city;" I told him I did not want any bother with him, if he would not come quiet I would call a city officer, and then he went with me; we walked along together, and he told me he did not think I should have had him that morning; he then pulled a small knife out of his pocket, and asked if I thought that would go against him; we still walked on, and he presently said, "Do you think I shall get fourteen years?"</p>

            . I was on duty at Mile-end, as a policeman, on Sunday morning, the 8th of September, and observed about four o'clock the three prisoners; Marryatt was standing at the prosecutor's window, with the shutter slipped on one side; it had been forced on one side over the other one - Wood was standing by the side of him taking things from Marryatt, and Green was standing on the other side of him; Wood seemed more towards the curb, looking out; there was plenty of light shone on the house, but I was standing in the shade of the wall - I saw it distinctly; Wood at last perceived me, as I suppose, and they moved off up the road on the same side a few yards, when they came to the grating of a drain; I saw Wood and Marryatt step over the grating, they seemed putting things down the grating and trampling on the things with their feet; I then moved across towards them; Marryatt and Wood were on the grating, and Green a little further down the road; I immediately went across towards them, and after a sharp run for a few yards, I laid hold of two of them - Green was the first who ran; they all three ran at a pretty sharp pace for a few yards - I laid hold of Wood and Marryatt, and Green was then standing under a gas lamp at a very short distance from us - sergeant Harrington came up and laid hold of Marryatt from me; I then pulled out my rattle and sprung it; another officer came up, and I saw Green run off - I pointed to him, and the other officer followed him up the road; he was taken to Mile-end station-house - I found him there in about a quarter of an hour; I found two snuff-boxes on Wood, and one in his breast coat pocket; and on the place where Green stood, I picked up two or three more snuff-boxes, and a cigar case; and on the grating, I found this piece of broken china pipe;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170015"/>I marked two of the boxes; when I laid hold of Marryatt, he said, "It is all right Bob, let us go;" I have known him some time; he said, "Let us go, we have only got a few boxes;" Green said as we were going to the station-house, that he had got into a mess, and must get out of it as well as he could, and he should answer no questions to criminate himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was anybody else present when Wood was searched? A. Yes; I never had any quarrel with either of the prisoners - not the slightest; I never had any transaction with them, except when on duty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ARNOLD. Q. You were standing in the dark shade of the wall? A. Yes; I was the width of the road from them - not exactly opposite them, but within a very few yards of being opposite; it was less than an hundred yards - I will swear it was not seventy yards; I did not measure it; Wood and Green stood with their faces towards me - I did not stay long to look at them - perhaps it might be two or three minutes - it was about as much as a minute, but then, mind, I never lost sight of them - it was Green said, that he had got into a mess; I did not say I believed he said so - I said, he said so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any doubt he said so? A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Marryatt. Q. When you conveyed me and another to the station-house, how many boxes were produced there? A. Three; I saw three taken from Wood - two were in his coat pocket, and one in his breast coat pocket; I cannot say how many were put down on the paper as being taken from Wood by the night officer - I did not put it down; only one was taken from you, the prosecutor could not identify it, and it was given back to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think this one is it? A. I think it is - I did not search you at all.</p>

             (policeman). I followed my brother-officer - it was about five o'clock - I saw three men at the shop window; in front of the shop window - I kept my eye on two of them, they walked away very fast - I never lost sight of Marryatt and Wood till they were taken into custody - I don't know anything about Green - immediately after they were taken, on the way to the station-house, I saw Wood drop this box from his left hand; Marryatt directly said, "I am all right, you will find nothing on me;" and just before we got to the station-house, Marryatt said, "We are hard up," or words to that effect - immediately after they were taken, I brought them back close to the house - I observed the shutter pulled out, and forced on one side - a pane of glass was broken; I noticed the window inside, it was lined with paper, and it was cleared as far as a hand could go in.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see Wood searched? A. I did; I saw one or two boxes found on him; I am not positive whether there was anything else found on him - Saunders searched him - he attempted to drop two in the street - I cannot say whether it was a foggy night; it was not very dark - it was not dark.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there any gas light? A. Yes, a pretty strong one.</p>
               <p>Marryatt. Q. How did you know the robbery was being committed? A. I had information of it - I saw Mr. Unwin there - I was with Saunders when I saw this.</p>
               <p>ISAAC UNWIN. These boxes are my property; I have no private mark on them; I have had them a long time in the house; I have had some of them ten years.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you buy them from any manufacturer? A. It was a long time since; there would be time for similar boxes to get into circulation.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the price of them? A. I sometimes sell them for one shilling each; this one would be eightpence.</p>
               <p>Green's Defence. I leave it entirely to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Marryatt to HARRINGTON. Q. How many boxes were produced to the magistrate? A. I don't know; I produced all I found; I found none on you - there was a tin tobacco-box, which you said belonged to you, and the magistrate ordered you to have it again - I cannot tell how many boxes Saunders told the magistrate he found on Wood - he did not tell the magistrate to my knowledge that he saw you throw a box away - no property was found on you.</p>
               <p>Wood's Defence. I leave it to my counsel.</p>

On the 25th of September, between five and seven o'clock in the evening, I missed two large silver table spoons, eleven silver tea spoons, a pair of sugar tongs, and a caddy ladle; I had not seen them that day myself - I made a search, and found the child's bed stripped of its sheets, and counterpane; two chests of drawers in the same room had also been stripped - I missed a variety of articles, worth nearly 30l. - the prisoner had no business in my house; I do not think he was in the habit of frequenting it.</p>



               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Had you seen any of the articles shortly before they were missed? A. I saw the child's bed that day - I had not seen the spoons for some days - they were kept in a chest of drawers in our bed-room.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any single article of the value of 5l.? A. Not one; I saw the drawers full in the morning, but not to notice any article in particular.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who had the care of it? A. My wife locked it up; no force was used to the lock, that I am aware of - the value of the whole plate I have found is about 5l. together.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How did you become acquainted where you could find the things? A. The prisoner himself gave the officer information; I was not present - two other persons were in custody; Mrs. Riddington and a lad who had carried a bundle - the prisoner made no statement in my presence - I know his relations are very respectable - he was a total stranger to me - the other two persons were discharged - I had not seen any of the plate perhaps for weeks before - the officer who took him was not bound over.</p>

            . I am groom to Mr. Call, of Hornsey - I saw the prisoner with Shepheard, opposite Mr. Bradshaw's house, sitting on a chair, about half-past one o'clock in the day - I saw Shephered pull off his shoes and stockings - the prisoner took the shoes under his arm, and the stockings in his hand, and walked away with them over the New River bridge, which is about forty yards from Mr. Bradshaw's house, and there he stood watching for Shepherd, who I saw go into the house - Shepherd came out and I took him directly he passed the prisoner over the bridge; he did not give him anything - I did not see him speak to the prisoner - I took him about a hundred yards over the bridge - the prisoner walked gently away when I took Shepherd, the same way as Shephered went, and I took him also - all the property was found on Shepherd.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you in any service or business? A. No; I had been over the water, and was coming home - I lived in Butcher-row, Ratcliff-highway then; that is about half a mile from Thames-street - I lived with my mother and father there; I had been at home that day - I had been to my grandmother's, and was coming home; it was ten minutes before nine o'clock at night - I never saw the prisoner before; I was before the Lord Mayor - there is a man named Barnes here; he was not with me, but he spoke to me about the robbery - I met him there; it was darkish - I saw nothing taken from the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not go up to the gentleman and tell him what you had seen? A. Because he was coaxing him along - there was about twenty or thirty persons there; there had been a fight; I stood and looked at it - there was a mob, perhaps about a dozen persons were round the gentlemen; the prisoner was the innermost of them; he was behind the gentleman - there were a great many about him - I was coming down Thames-street, and so were they; I overtook them; the prisoner was the nearest, and he had his arm on his shoulder - I was looking at the gentlemen; I got before them - I was in the road walking along; they were not quite sober - one was quite sober, and the other was not - the gentleman who was sober is not here; the sober gentleman was the companion of the drunken one; he was much nearer to the prosecutor than I was - he had hold of his arm; he did not see the watch taken out; he had a much better opportunity of seeing what passed than I had - he did not go to St. Mary's-hill; they stopped, and then the prisoner went away - I followed him up St. Mary's-hill; he walked, and I followed him, because I was told by Barnes that he had stolen a watch - I said, "Let us follow him," and we did; there was no constable in Thames-street; I did not see one - when he was given in charge there was another man by the side of him; he was about the same height as the prisoner - I saw him run away after the prisoner was taken into custody; I heard the prisoner call out to him to stop; I think he called Bill - I saw them both there from the beginning of the transaction.</p>

            . I was in Thames-street, on the 21st, and saw the prisoner take the watch away from Mr. Cookson; he had hold of Mr. Cookson with his left arm, and took the watch with his right hand; then walked along Thames-street, up St. Mary's-hill, into Tower-street - I spoke to Vaughan, and we followed the prisoner; he was given into custody in Tower-street, by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170019"/>Vaughan - I was not in Vaughan's company, I merely fell in with him accidentally.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where had you been? A. I lodge almost opposite where it happened - I was not in any service at the time; I am out of service - I saw a mob in the street and went out - I think Vaughan had as good an opportunity of seeing all that passed; I have been out of service about three months, but get sixpence now and then with steam-boats, and doing little jobs - I did not get any thing for this - I have been in the service of the Earl of Litchfield - I left him a few months ago.</p>

            . On the evening of the 21st of September, I was in Thames-street, a little before nine o'clock, in company with another gentleman - we met two porters carrying logs on their shoulders, which they would have brought in contact with our heads, had we not raised our arms, and pushed them aside - on doing that they became abusive, and a number of persons came round us - somebody at the same time crying out, "Go it, go it" - a regular attack was made on us; we were struck by various men, and I received blows both before and on the back part of my head, and so did the gentleman with me - we were both knocked down and thrown down, and had no opportunity of seeing any transaction concerning the watch; we had enough to do to take care of ourselves - I recollect somebody having hold of me, and saying, "Go along, go along;" I lost my watch, but did not miss it till I was free of the crowd - I was about leaving London; I had taken leave of some friends, and had drank freely, and it took effect on me more than I expected - I had not drank a great deal, but it had impaired my recollection - John Thompson produced my watch before the Lord Mayor; it was a silver watch, with a ribbon, seal, key, and gold ring, and a guard which was broken; part of it had been left, part was gone - the ring of the chain remained.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the watch must have been taken from you with some degree of violence? A. The guard was very slender, and very little force would break it - I recollect the attack that was made, and I felt the blows severely next day - my friend is not here; he was not called on to give evidence; he knows nothing about it; he had enough to do to take care of himself in the row- the attack was made on us in Lower Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your recollection so impaired that your being knocked down might be all imagination? A. I could not have my clothes soiled as they were, without being in the dirt - I was knocked down and recollect it perfectly - it was directly I got up that I heard a man cry "Go it" - I do not know whether the watch was taken before I was down or after; I did not miss it till I searched to see if I had lost any thing; as soon as we got clear of the crowd - we went into a house there; I do not recollect whether it was a very large crowd - there were more likely ten than one hundred persons - the gentleman who was with me accidentally heard a man was taken, and he went to the station-house and identified the watch.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the night of the 21st of September, I was in Tower-street about ten minutes before nine o'clock; Vaughan and Barnes came to me and asked if I was on duty; I said Yes, he pointed to the prisoner, and said he had robbed a gentleman of his watch - I asked if he was certain he had done it; he said, "I am certain, and he has got the property on him" - I directly stepped behind him collared him, and said, "I want you;" he said, "What do you want of me, I have done nothing;" he directly called to somebody across the road twice, who was dressed in a fustian jacket, and I think fustian trousers, and that person made his escape directly - I took the prisoner towards the watch-house, and about ten yards from the watch-house I knew him, and thought he was going to strike me in the face; I saw his hand rise, and he thrust it into his side pocket; I seized his hand and kept it in his pocket, and took him to the watch-house; and there Thompson said, "Joe, what are you here for?" he said,"I don't know what it is for, unless it is for this," handing this watch forwards - this is the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he point out a man? A. Yes; he called to him twice - he did not describe the man's dress; I saw it myself - he did not say to me, or in my hearing, that that man had handed him the watch a minute or two before to look at, to see if he would buy it - I have known him as a waterman three or four years; I cannot speak to his character one way or the other.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what manner did he call out to the man who went away? A. I think he called "Jem," twice, but I am not quite certain that was the name, he was on one side of the way, and the man on the other, and the second time he called to him he made his escape as quick as he could - I think he said, "Jem, here Jem, stop."</p>
               <p>JOHN THOMPSON. I am constable of the night of Tower-ward watch-house. I produce the watch which the prisoner gave into my hands - I questioned him, knowing him personally - I said, "Halloo Joe, what are you brought here for?" he said, "I don't know, without it is for this;" he put his hand into his jacket pocket, and pulled out a watch and put it into my hand - I asked how he came by it; he said he had met a man on St. Maryat-hill, who asked him to purchase the watch - I asked if he knew who the man was, or how he came in possession of it; he said he knew the man slightly, but could not describe him to me; but he had no doubt he should be able to find out who it was - I detained him; and about ten o'clock a gentleman, a friend of Cookson's, came to the watch-house - I saw Cookson the following morning, and he claimed the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have not you known him about twelve years? A. Yes; I never knew or heard anything wrong of him before; he has lived about the neighbourhood for the last ten or twelve years - Blow the inspector had hold of him by the hand, holding his hand in his jacket pocket.</p>
               <p>DANIEL COOKSON. This is my watch, and seal, and key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing more to say - I leave myself entirely in the hands of the gentlemen; they have told the truth as far as I know.</p>

When he got to Tower-street, I heard him say to the man, "I wish they may go home safe" - I had not seen that man in Thames-street that I recollect - he was not near enough to the man to receive anything from him; he walked before him, and not near enough to hand the watch to him.</p>

My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I most humbly submit my case to your humane consideration, and throw myself on the mercy of the court.</p>

            . On the evening of the 6th of September, I was at Bartholomew-fair, near Richardson's booth, and saw the prisoner there, he spoke to me, and described the characters to me in the booth - I thought he spoke in the broad Yorkshire dialect: he asked me to walk round the fair with him, which I did - he showed me the different booths, and when he came to Giltspur-street, he pointed to a second floor window of a coffee-shop, and wanted me to go in, as he said, he had had neither dinner nor tea - I did not go in with him, we came on to Newgate, and he pointed to another coffee-shop, and wanted me to go in - I said I was not in the habit of going to such places - he complained of wanting tea - I said,"Come home to my lodging, and I will give you some tea;" I took him to my lodging in <placeName id="t18331017-20-crimeloc116">Tower Royal</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had you been in town before this? A. I came to town in June; I was in the employ of Fpy and Curtis, of Thames-street - I am not so now; I left them on the Saturday before this happened - I had never seen the prisoner before; he spoke to me and described the characters to me; I did not tread on his toe and beg his pardon - he began to talk to me, and described the characters, and asked me to walk round and see the shows, and I went; when he pointed to the coffee shop and wished me to go in, I said I was not used to go to such places - and that is true, I never go to such places - I have done it at times, but never do it promiscuously - I have not been to more than two, since I have been in London; the pin was found in his breast, where it would naturally be if it was his; the ring was found in his pocket, the handkerchief was found in his coat pocket; I never took a stranger to my lodging and left him alone for twenty-five minutes before - I have lodged there since the 2nd of July; I did not say to him, "I have a friend coming, be so good as to go;" he was on the sofa when I returned to the room - the sofa stood on the opposite side of the room - I had walked with him all this way; I had not pressed him to go home with me - he went of his own accord; he went to Queen-street - he complained then of being hungry, and I said I would give him some tea if he came to my lodging - it did not occur to me that it would be better to give him tea at a coffee shop; I am a Yorkshireman; I knew we should be quite private at my lodging - I have no wife or children; I noticed my bureau, and missed the things after I returned up stairs -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170021"/>I had not the key in my pocket; the bureau was open, and the key was lying inside - the sovereigns were left in it; there was no servant in the house and therefore I thought it safe.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Pickering was called for, did he charge you with taking indecent liberties with him? A. He did; there was no truth in that - I never had such a thing happen to me before - I have been in St. James's park many times; I was once accosted there by a gentleman; I had stopped in Sloane-square and took supper one Sunday evening, that was not with a stranger - as I returned, I was coming along, they told me I could not get out of the park except by the monument - I was going along there, and a gentleman came up and spoke to me, and wanted to take my arm; I said I was not in the habit of talking to people I did not know, and begged him to keep his distance, or I should give him in charge; and when we came to the steps, he went away from me; I did not give him in charge, he left me; that was some weeks before I was at Bartholomew fair - this happened at ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. But at the fair you walked round with a stranger and heard his explanation of things? A. Yes; I took him home to tea because he said he was a Yorkshireman, and was hungry - I did not ask his name - I am doing no business now; I have not a fortune, but I have enough to support me at the present time - my employers and I did not agree - they did not turn me away - I did not desire to go; since that, I have been doing nothing - I have been living at Hampstead occasionally; I did not ask the prisoner what part of Yorkshire he came from - he asked me what part I came from; I said, "The north;" he said his grandfather was a Scotchman, and he a Yorkshireman.</p>
               <p>Q. When Miss Pickering came into the room, did you desire her to shut the window shutters? A. Yes, when she brought the candles - (it was half-past six o'clock, or nearly seven o'clock, when my friend called) - that was after I had been down to my friend; he was gone then; he was to call again in a quarter of an hour, and he came again; but I did not go to Vauxhall - the prisoner made this charge against me immediately anybody came that he could make it to.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you been up in the room when you called Mrs. Pickering? A. I should think five minutes the very uttermost.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you in the habit of wearing that ring? A. Yes; one ring, with a red stone in it, I wore that very day; that was the ring found on the prisoner; the other was found by the staircase window.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you have it on your finger at the fair? A. Yes; I took it off in the room at the table; he asked me to allow him to look at it, as he never had one on his finger; and I left it on the table when I was called down - when I returned to my room, I went to get the key of the cupboard, to get a bottle of spirits; I was going to give him some spirits, and I missed the key; and I accused him of robbing me, as I missed two sovereigns, a seal, and a ring - the key of the place where the spirits were was in the bureau drawer, where the other things were; and on going to get the key, I missed the things; I said, "I have been robbed since I have been down stairs," and he must have robbed me; he said, if I said so, he would knock me down; and I opened the door, and called out to Mrs. Pickering, "Thief, and a bad character;" and he pushed by me towards the stairs, I caught hold of him, he got hold of my handkerchief and dragged me along - I suppose tea was about a quarter of an hour getting ready, and we were about a quarter of an hour having it, and it was about half an hour before my friend called.</p>

            . My brother lives directly opposite Mrs. Pickering; she called my attention to her house between seven and eight o'clock I think; I went in directly - I found somebody standing in the passage; I took a light from her, and went up stairs; and on the landing I saw the prosecutor and prisoner struggling; the prisoner was trying to get away, the prosecutor had hold of him, and appeared very much exhausted; he said the prisoner had robbed him - the prisoner said, if I would go up stairs he would explain all to me; he went up, the prosecutor followed him, and I followed him - when we got up the prosecutor accused him of robbing him of two sovereigns, and two or three rings - the prisoner said he had given the rings and things to him for taking a liberty with him - he was charged with taking sovereigns; he said he had not got any sovereigns, and knew nothing about them - I found the pin in his shirt; I took it out myself; he was endeavouring to take it out, I assisted him; - I either took it from his hand or his shirt, and gave it to the prosecutor; and he took the ring out of his waistcoat-pocket himself, it had a red stone in it - I saw a sovereign found just at the head of the bed, going out at the bed-room door; it dropped from the head of the bed - and one on the bed clothes, just by the bolster and pillow - the sovereigns were found in a situation a person could have placed them in going out of the room - the head of the bed is on the right-hand side of the door, and close to the door; anybody passing might take and put them there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found them struggling together? A. Yes; from my observation I supposed the prisoner was endeavouring to get away - I don't know whether there is a door leading to the staircase or not, from the front room; I think there is; and if so, and that door was not locked, he could get out without going by the bed- one sovereign dropped from the bed clothes or pillow, one dropped on the floor, and the other was looked for and found just under the bolster; they might have been put there in a hurry, and one not so far as the other - the red stone ring was found in the prisoner's pocket, the pin in his breast, and one ring on the staircase window - the prosecutor might as well have placed it there as the prisoner, if he had it in his hand - the prisoner described the offence that he charged the prosecutor with in very plain terms - I went for an officer - I knew nothing of the prosecutor before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you get into the room? A. Through the bed-room door - the prisoner and prosecutor went through the same door - I should not think the prisoner had time to place the sovereigns there at that time; the bed was near enough for him to do it; his left hand must almost have touched it - when I first saw him he was about half way down the stairs close to the window - I should not think he could have put the rings there while the scuffle occurred - the staircase was not very wide; his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170022"/>back was to the balustrade, and the prosecutor had got his hands round him and the staircase post.</p>

            . My attention was drawn to Mrs. Pickering's - I found my uncle there - the prosecutor accused the prisoner of robbing him; the prisoner immediately replied, that he had the things given him for taking improper liberties with him - I found the ring on the window of the stairs, and I found the two sovereigns; the ring was placed close against the edge of the sill of the window - another person was standing by at the time I found the sovereigns; they appeared to have been put there very hastily; one fell down, and the other would have fallen I have no doubt - I went into the room through the bed-room, the door of which was open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went in with the last witness I suppose? A. No; I don't suppose he had been there long - I found him standing just inside the room door; one sovereign dropped from the bed, the other was a small distance from the bolster; I did not notice whether the staircase window was up or down, it had a large sill.</p>

            . The prosecutor, Mr. Haw, lodged at our house from July, and lodges there now; he goes backwards and forwards to Hampstead two or three times a week, but keeps on his lodging - I recollect the time of this affair - the prosecutor and the prisoner passed the parlour window; Mr. Haw went up stairs with him, and came down and said, "I will thank you to make tea for two;" I sent out for a small loaf, and the tea was ready in about a quarter of an hour - my daughter took it up; a young man afterwards called to see Mr. Haw; I went up to tell Mr. Haw a gentleman wanted him in the parlour; he said, "Let the gentleman come up;" I said, there was a light in the parlour - and my daughter had shewn him in there; the prisoner was then on the sofa, and he rose from the sofa and went towards the window, which was half open at that time - the prisoner was laying on the sofa with his hand over his head at the time I went up, and the window on the side of the sofa was open, it was opposite the door; Mr. Haw, said, "Let the gentleman come up;" I said, "There is a light in the parlour;" I waited there to let Mr. Haw pass, and I went into the kitchen and said to my daughter,"Take up a light to Mr. Haw's friend;" she said, "Oh no, not till Mr. Haw goes up;" and I said no more about it; after Mr. Haw's friend went out, my daughter followed him up stairs with the candle, and brought the tea things away; and Mr. Haw came down and said, "Miss Pickering, come and shut in the windows;" she turned back and shut them down, and came down; and immediately I sat down in my chair, I heard a tremendous hallooing - "Mrs. Pickering - a thief - a bad character;" I went out, and Mr. Haw had the prisoner holding him on the stairs; I ran out at the door, and called, "a thief, a thief;" and the witnesses came; I followed my daughter who was quite motionless - I took her into the next house - I then considered as eight or ten run into my house, that my property was all exposed; I went up to my own bed room and found it all safe - I came down, the prisoner stood at the top of the stairs; I was much alarmed; he said, "I will not hurt you;" they got him into the parlour, and requested me to leave the room while they searched him; I said,"Mr. Haw, what could induce you to bring a thief into the house;" the prisoner said, "I am not a thief, I am as respectable as you, and my friends are as respectable as your's;" the prisoner said, "You don't mean to give me in charge;" I then went out of the room, and I saw him on the top of the stairs again, when I came into the house with my daughter.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prosecutor state at that time what he had lost? A. I don't know, for I was too much flurried; I lost nothing - nothing was done to my apartments; I had not observed the ring on Mr. Haw's finger that morning, that I remember, but the morning before - he had been very poorly for a fortnight, and staid at home a good deal.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The prosecutor desired you to shut the window, and bring candles? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an officer; I live in Watling-street; I went to the assistance of the parties at a quarter before eight o'clock; the prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him of two sovereigns - I was searching him for them, and the prosecutor brought forward the seal and two keys, and shortly after he gave me a ring and key; and after that, a third person brought me a second ring - the prisoner said, "If you will come in, I will tell you all about it; I have not robbed the man at all - he is a scoundrel for accusing me of any such thing - he gave them to me for an indecent liberty which he took with me; when I said I would raise the neighbourhood and give him into custody - he said, 'Don't do so for God's sake, take these things and say nothing about it;'" one sovereign was tucked into the bolster; a person going out could not place them there unless the door was shut, because the door opens against the bedstead - folding doors open from the bed room to the sitting room - I found the handkerchief in the prisoner's pocket - the prisoner said, "He touched me on the thigh and said, what an old handkerchief you have got, I can give you a better than that;" and gave it to him; he said his parents were as respectable as his - a person, before they opened the bed room door to go out, would certainly be able to place the sovereigns there - the sofa is in the front room; if a person passed from the sofa through the bed room, and out at the bed room door, they could put them there before the door was open, but not in any other way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there a door to the sitting room? A. Certainly there is, facing the stair-case; I went in at the bed room door and passed through the folding doors - I found no other door open; no door was locked; while I searched the prisoner, they were searching for the sovereigns; the prosecutor was among the persons; one dropped from the bolster, and the other was taken from the blankets under the bolster.</p>

Certainly he might; or the prisoner in trying to escape, might do it - I should think a minute and a half elapsed while I was searching the prisoner, before the sovereigns were found; and in the meantime the prosecutor was in the bed-room - the prisoner made this charge against the prosecutor - the prosecutor said,"It is no such thing - I did no such thing - I did not give them you - you robbed me of them."</p>

               <p>JAMES HOLLAND. I am a cheesemonger, and live at No. 107, Drury-lane; on the 10th of September, the prisoner came to my shop and brought a large bundle of paper, which he offered for sale - it was tied up in a green baize; I asked where he got it, he said it was given him by a person in Chancery-lane, but I do not remember the name he mentioned - I examined it and found it was lawyer's papers, and the address on part of them was Sutcliffe and Birch, which was not the name he mentioned, I told him I did not think it was right, and I would send a person with him, - he began to murmur about that and said he would take it somewhere else; I then called in the policeman - this is part of the paper; he bought about 60lbs in all, worth about ten-shillings.</p>

             I am beadle of St. Mary-le-Strand - I was called into the shop; I took the prisoner and found 9s. on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not give it up as soon as you asked me? Witness. A. No, I had some trouble to get it from you; you would not open your hand till I pressed it, then you dropped 7s. and the other two remained in your hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I entered the shop of Mr. Cameron, pawnbroker, in the Strand, with 9s. in my hand, having not a minute before changed a half-sovereign at a liquor-shop; I went into the shop with the intention of pledging the waistcoat; I was stopped with the property of Mr. Ager. On entering the shop I hesitated in pawning the waistcoat; I had nine shillings in my left hand, and was considering whether I could not manage to do without pledging it - when the shopman turning round, said he had seen my hand in the till, and jumping over the counter immediately stopped me, and sent for a policeman to take me into custody. How is it possible I could have taken this money from the till when the shopman declares he caught my right hand in the till and the money was found in my left hand? besides it is not to be supposed that he seeing me would allow me to take 9s. without stopping me the moment I commenced. I again declare, so help me God, that I never had my hand in the till, and that the money found in my possession actually belonged to me; my intention on first entering the shop was to pledge the article I had with me, but on second thoughts I altered my mind.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it not the custom of your trade, that to certain customers you sell your music at half-price - to others at full price; to certain customers you sell at a price between the two, and to certain other persons you give it away? A. Yes; what we give away to professional persons, we generally,(but not always,) write their names upon - what we sell always goes out in the same state it is in the warehouse - it cannot be sworn to.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you any means of knowing how many of this you had sold but by your books? A. No; the books are not here- I cannot tell whether this one had been sold, but we lost one of them.</p>

I have known the prisoner twenty years; I married his wife's mother - I allowed him and his wife to live in my house without paying rent; he had lived there four years and three quarters - he is a gardener by trade - he brought some furniture of his own to my house, but the articles he took were not in the room he occupied; they were in one of my rooms - I missed them before he left my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. Is your wife alive? A. No; the prisoner's wife looks after my house, and I let them live there for that - the prisoner is not in regular employ, he is only a jobber - I went out of town for fifteen or sixteen days - I left two pounds with the prisoner's wife to pay incidental expences - I did not pay them any wages - I don't think the prisoner was in employ when I went out of town; but I heard that he earned money while I was away, from Mr. Batson - the prisoner's wife is still looking after my house, I left her at home ill this morning - I never ordered the prisoner off my premises, but I have said to other persons that I should be glad if he would take his wife and go off.</p>

On the 8th of September I fell in with the prisoner Healey in Praed-street, about eight o'clock in the evening; I followed him three hundred yards; I then stopped him - I found this tea tray under his arm - I asked where he brought it from? he said from No. 12, Cambridge-terrace - while I was talking to him, his wife came up, and said,"Give him the bundle, and let him go" - I took him to the station - he there said, if I would go to No. 12, <placeName id="t18331017-42-crimeloc236">Cambridge-terrace</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did he not say he had had it from Mary Devereux? A. Yes, and that turned out to be correct - I did not find anything on him, nor at his lodging.</p>

            . I live with my mother, her name is Mary. Devereux was her <rs id="t18331017-42-viclabel237" type="occupation">cook</rs> - she came on the first week in June - this tea tray was taken from a press in the kitchen, and these other things from the wardrobe in the back kitchen, where she slept, which was broken open - when the officer came she said some person wanted to speak to me; I came down, and saw the officer - I was frightened, and desired Devereux to remain there, but she went down stairs - my mother then came down, and we went into the parlour, and I heard a noise in the kitchen; we then found that Devereux was gone off without her bonnet or shawl; she was out all night, and came back the next morning, and I let her in myself - I had seen the prisoner Healey about there in the landlord's employ, but I never saw him in our house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he is a bricklayer? A. Yes, in the employ of Mr. Pounsford our landlord.</p>
               <p>Devereux. This bit of calico was given to me by Miss Miles. Witness. It is almost impossible to swear to calico; but I did not give her this book, nor this tea tray, I can swear to that, it was brought from India by my brother.</p>
               <p>Devereux. I took the tray to pawn as I had not sufficient to live on; I had pawned the last article of my clothes before I took it. Witness. She never wanted for any thing in our house; we were about to part with her as she was much more expensive than we wished.</p>
               <p>Healey's Defence. This girl told me she was going to leave her place and asked me to take her box for her, I called at eight o'clock in the evening for it, she said the box was not ready; but she told me to take these other things, the officer stopped me and I told him I did know what I had got, but I would take him to the person I had it from.</p>

               <p>Joseph Payne's Defence. The witness said, that from the first of our entering the shop he had suspicion of the female, and he saw her fumbling among his goods; I should have thought that he would have stopped her, but instead of that, he said, he saw her pass the window with something, and then he put on his coat and hat, and came after us - he accused me first, and said, he was told that I knew something of a waistcoat piece; I said, "I will go back with you" - he then said, he saw this prisoner drop it; now if he had, would he not have taken it up and not have given another man time to have crossed and taken it up? while I was in the shop, I thought I heard a bustle, and I saw a man's arm going out of the shop; I was at that time at the other counter looking at some buttons; he had but four, but he said he should have some more the next night.</p>

             (police-constable N 85). I was on duty about one o'clock that morning, I heard some persons coming under a wall - I went up and saw three or four men who had a bag loaded with something; I followed them across the field; they dropped the bag; I follwed the last, who I believe was the prisoner knowles - he went on to a gate and got over it, and got among some trees; I then lost sight of them - I went back and secured this bag; these four rabbits I caught, there were others but they got away - I thought Game was one of the men, and we went and took him the same morning; his boots were very wet, there were nails in the soles of them, and two nails are out of the toe of one of them - they exactly correspond with the marks I saw in the clay.</p>

I was about a hundred yards off; the last time I heard him say it, he was about two feet off; he said so two or three times - I could not see them the first time it was said - I might have heard it said three times - he was about three feet off the last time I heard it said - if the deceased had chosen he might have gone away instead of returning to the prisoner - he was older than the prisoner, and a great deal larger and stouter - it was said in the voice of a person, who was in great anger - I did not hear the prisoner say he had hit him in the eye with a tobacco-stopper - I am sure the deceased walked towards him.</p>

            . I am sixteen years old. On Saturday night, about a week ago, I was with the prisoner and another sweep named John Potter, at a quarter before seven o'clock - I was quite sober; I don't know how the others were - we had been to a sugar-house, we had not been to a public-house - the deceased met us; there were two more boys with him; they were doing nothing - as they passed by, Emmett said, "He is a gone off" - he did not point to any one in particular - the deceased had gone on about ten yards before he said that; on the prisoner's saying that, he came back, and hit him in the face - it was a smart blow; I was near him, and the blow almost struck me; I heard the blow - the prisoner fell down from the blow and cried out - when he was on the ground the deceased kicked him on the thigh; I saw that - he only kicked him once; he did it with violence - Emmett began to cry, and then called the deceased a twopenny-halfpenny thief - the deceased went towards his companions, and the prisoner told him if he came back he would stick a knife into him; he said that immediately - the deceased came back in a minute or two, and was going to hit him; he lifted his hand up - then the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, and took something out - I don't know what prevented the deceased hitting him; his hand was cleanched when he lifted it up towards him - I did not see the knife in the prisoner's hand, but he put his hand into his pocket as if to take something out - I did not know the prisoner before; we are not under the same master; but the other boy knew him - I am quite sure I saw the deceased strike him the first time, and afterwards kick him on the ground, and afterwards he offered to strike him again - it was not so much as three minutes between the first blow and his coming up the second time - I knew the deceased by sight before; his name was George Ashton.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did it appear to you that whatever the prisoner did was in defence of himself, when Ashton was going to strike him? A. Yes.</p>

I saw him immediately he was brought in; he lived five or ten minutes - I afterwards examined his body - there was a wound between the third and fourth ribs on the left side; it had entered the heart, and was about two inches deep; that, no doubt, was the cause of death; it had pierced the heart - I saw the knife before the Coroner; such a knife would have inflicted that wound.</p>

               <p>Q. About the latter end of August, did you go from your house to Margate? A. I did; on Saturday, the 31st of August - the prisoner accompanied me; she remained at Margate with me till the following Saturday, and then she asked leave to go up to town - I gave her leave; she was to return on the Tuesday - she returned on the Wednesday; her not returning on the Tuesday, and from other circumstances, I was suspicious of her, and in consequence of that, her boxes were searched in my presence, by Mr. Tufnell; in consequence of what transpired, the prisoner was taken in custody at my lodging; the first question I asked her was, "Have you paid Madame Follet the £100?" she answered, "I have not, I wrote the receipt myself."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where is Colonel Hampton? A. In India; I don't know whether he is coming home shortly - I have written to him to request he would come home; I do not expect him shortly - I don't expect any suit will be instituted by him when he does come home; I don't understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a gentleman named Tufnell? A. I do; he is no relation to me; I got acquainted with him fourteen or fifteen years ago - it was not before Colonel Hampton went to India; I don't understand you; Colonel Hampton has not been in England for upwards of thirty years; I was married in India - I came from India six years ago; I knew Mr. Tufnell before I was married; I was acquainted with Mr. Tufnell in London; I have been home twice; he is an examiner of accounts, in the Audit office - he is not married; I have been on intimate terms with him - I have been in various parts of the country with him - I have been at Dover; we lived in the same house at Dover, and dined at the same table - we did not always breakfast at the same table, because I did not get up to breakfast; we always dined at the same table - we were there twice - eight or ten days each time; about two years ago; I don't exactly recollect whether that was the first visit - it is about two years since my first visit to Dover, with Mr. Tufnell; I only went once with him to Dover; he came when I was residing there; we travelled together the first time - Mr. Tufnell took the apartments at Dover; the prisoner was living in my service at both those times, and had an opportunity of observing the extent of my acquaintance with Mr. Tufnell - I considered her a very confidential servant.</p>
               <p>Q. May I ask what the extent of your means of living were in London? A. £700 a year and more; it is uncertain what my husband remits me, sometimes I have more, and sometimes less - at this present time, I have £700 a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever employed the prisoner to pawn articles of very considerable value? A. Yes; to the amount of £200 at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mrs. Hampton, we have gone through the Dover residence, how long did you live at Margate? A. Three weeks; Mr. Tufnell also lodged in the house part of the time; eating at the same table; he took the house at Margate at my request - I did not pay his lodging; I paid my own - he had a bed room in the same house for which he paid separately; that I swear; I paid bills for his diet at Dover; very much through the hands of the prisoner - I have been at Tunbridge-wells with Mr. Tufnell - it is some time ago; I think I staid there seven or eight days; I was at an hotel part of the time, and part of the time in lodgings; I went first to an hotel - Mr. Tufnell was with me - lodgings were taken, and I remained there, and Mr. Tufnell left me; during the time he staid there, I paid for him - he never came back there after he left; I don't recollect that he took the lodgings - I might have been with him when the lodgings were taken; I went to Cranford-bridge with him three years ago - we travelled in the same post chaise; my daughter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170034"/>was with me - my daughter was with me at all the places I went to with Mr. Tufnell.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What age is your daughter? A. Fifteen or sixteen; but she is imbecile.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Well, she is not capable of making much observation? A. I don't know - I suppose not; she had not sense enough to observe what was going forward; I had a quarrel with Mrs. Atkins a lodging house keeper at Dover, about a postman - on no other subject; Mr. Tufnell had - mine never amounted to a quarrel, nor a difference; she asked me for money; I don't remember her sitting up on the stairs one night - I know she stated she did do it; we had a difference of opinion on that subject; am I obliged to enter into this?</p>
               <p>Q. What other parts of the country have you been to with Mr. Tufnell; you have mentioned Dover, Margate, Cranford-bridge, have you been to any other parts of the country with Mr. Tufnell? A. Yes; to Boulogne, four or five years ago - Mr. Tufnell was not with me, he came and paid me a visit there - he dined with me, but he did not sleep there; he staid at Boulogne ten days on that occasion; he did not dine with me every day - I believe I have mentioned all the country places I have been to with him - I cannot swear I have not been to any other places in England with him - I don't recollect that I have been to any other places - I have certainly not been to any other place in England for a fortnight together with him, if you will bring it to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live in town? A. No. 14, Princes-street; I lived at No. 6, Conduit-street, before that, and I lived there a year; Mr. Tufnell has been in the habit of visiting me at both those houses, and that to the prisoner's knowledge; she has been in my service upwards of two years; Mr. Tufnell generally went home to his own residence about ten or eleven o'clock - he has staid as late as twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Never longer? Witness. Am I obliged to answer that question?</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to object to tell me how long he has staid? A. I don't object.</p>
               <p>Q. How many different pawnbrokers have you sent the prisoner to to pawn for you? A. Three; Dobree, Cotterell, and Gray; no others, I am sure of that; I have not sent her to pawn at any other pawnbroker's that I recollect; I have gone with her to other pawnbroker's, but not sent her; I make a distinction between going with her and sending her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? A. To Graves'; it is somewhere in the city; I don't know where - it may be in Fleet-street, but I am not in the habit of going into the city - it was a street on the other side of Temple-bar - I know the Strand, it is a continuance of that street; I have gone with her to Graves's, three or four months ago; I did not pawn anything there - I went to pawn some diamonds; I asked £200 on them; I did not buy the diamonds in London - they were my own; I have had them for years, they were my mother's.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Barnes, a silversmith? A. I do; I have not bought property of him to a very considerable extent; one bill was £50, another £50, and a slide for £15, and some other articles which I have not paid for; it may be £15, but I have not had the bills - I have not had a tea-pot of him; if I have sent my servant to pawn articles that I bought of him, they were paid for - I have sent her to pawn articles bought of Mr. Barnes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Tufnell in the habit of intimacy with you up to this moment? A. Yes; I don't know whether he is in Court or no - he did not come to the Court-house with me to-day; nor to the Old-Bailey; he accompanied me part of the way - to the coffee house in Cornhill; I don't know where - perhaps it is Ludgate-hill - he came with me yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told my Lord this woman said she had signed the receipt? A. That she had written it; that it was not Madame Follet's hand-writing, but she wrote the receipt herself - I told the magistrate that she said she wrote it herself; that I swear positively - what I said before the magistrate was taken down, and read over to me, and I signed it - I told the magistrate that she said the milliner did not write the receipt, but she wrote it; I told the magistrate so, and it was taken down - I said to the prisoner herself, that it was written in a very slovenly manner, and did not look like Madame Follet's handwriting, and I said so to the magistrate, and I said that the prisoner told me that if I doubted its correctness, I could send and ascertain, as Madame Follet only lived in the next street, and the apology she made was, Mr. Follet did not keep a clerk; that he was a foreigner, and wrote the receipt himself - Madame Follet lived in Conduit-street.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing to prevent your sending to Madame Follet? A. I sent and requested her to come, but she took care I should not see her - Madame Follet wrote to her; she opened all Madame Follet's letters, and prevented my seeing her - I seldom go out - I had better health when I travelled.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you went to Gray's with her to pawn the things? A. Three or four months, I do not exactly know; it was not in July, it was before July; it must have been in April, May, or June.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand that it was illness kept you from going to Madame Follet's? A. No; she said Madame Follet was not satisfied with one bill being paid, and insisted on my paying the other - I was not able to pay it, and did not go to her - I was unable to go out at times, but not every day - Mr. Tufnell was present when she said she wrote the receipt herself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I believe a gentleman came to the door of the court with you and retired? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was that Mr. Tufnell? A. No; I left Mr. Tufnell this morning at the coffee-house; I left him in the street at the door of the London coffee-house; I did not see him go in - I did not get out of the coach; he did not come in the coach with me, he came with some other witnesses - I am sure Mr. Tufnell was present when the girl said she wrote this herself - Mr. Tufnell was examined before the magistrate, and I told the magistrate that Mr. Tufnell was present when the girl said she wrote it; I do not know whether it was the writing of the receipt, or the payment of the money. I distinctly swear that I told the magistrate that Mr. Tufnell was present when the girl said she wrote the receipt; I do not know what was taken down - what I swore was read over to me, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170035"/>I think that was in it; I have no doubt but it was read over; I am sure it was read over; I am quite satisfied of that - it was when she was taken up at Margate that she told me she wrote the receipt - the officer was not present who took her up, I think he had left the room - the receipt was in London.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When she was taken up at Margate she told you she had written the receipt? A. Yes; it was the first question I asked her on her being taken up.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She was then in custody? A. She was at our house - I do not know whether the officer was present, or whether he had gone down stairs when I asked her the question.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. She had been taken by an officer? A. Yes; whether he was present at that conversation I do not know - I think it was before he came - Mr. Tufnell said he should give her in custody.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then she was not in custody? A. I think not; Mr. Tufnell said he would give her in custody - the constable had gone to get a warrant to search her boxes, and during that time I think she said so - I do not know whether the constable had been sent for or whether he had left the room; I do not know whether he had been sent for or not - I said I thought the officer had left the room, because I think he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell me you thought it was before the officer was sent for? A. I do not know whether it was before or during the time he was gone for the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Had this woman power to pawn any property of yours when she chose? A. Not when she chose without my orders - I had not given her a carte blanche to pawn goods whenever she wanted money - I accused her of having done it without orders - I kept her in my service afterwards - I know Mr. Cotterell, a pawnbroker - I never told him I had given the prisoner authority to pawn, or any thing of the kind - I know Livermore - I have never but once gone to Cotterell's shop myself - I never said any thing to that effect to Livermore - I never authorised Ann to pawn things without my consent; I did not tell Livermore that I had given her a general authority to pawn things, nor to that effect - it is two or three months ago since I went to Cotterell's shop; I walked there - I was compelled to go there when she told me she had pawned things without my consent; she went with me - I pawned things when I went to release the diamonds; I have never had these diamonds in pawn through the hands of Ann Vickers but once, that was done without my consent - they were given her to pawn for 200l., instead of which she pawned them for 120l. - the things I pawned to release the diamonds are so numerous I cannot mention them - she had taken them prior; she confessed to me she had pawned them, and to release them had taken some goods, and it was not sufficient - she did not say she had pawned them at Cotterell's; she said they had been pawned at Cotterell's, and when it was found out, she fell down on her knees and said, "They are not at Gray's, they are at Cotterell's;" and I thought it necessary to go myself to Cotterell's - when I went to release the diamonds, I pawned one or two gold chains, an Indian shawl, and other articles; she had taken them there before by my desire - I kept her in my service six or seven months after that - I had not enough to make up the money, and I said if he would send the diamonds the next morning to my house, he should have the money - I did not mention Ann Vickers's name; I have only one servant, that is

Yes; I did not say, I did not say so - I had no servant but Ann Vickers - when I referred to my servant, I meant Ann Vickers - she was present at the time I gave the pawnbroker that direction.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe on this subject you made an accusation against a Mr. Barnes, a jeweller, on the subject of pawning - you charged Mr. Barnes with a crime? A. Yes; and preferred a Bill - I was sworn and the Bill was thrown out.</p>

               <p>Q. Now I will ask you one question. You have stated now that Mr. Tufnell was present when the prisoner said she wrote the receipt - is there any thing you know of to prevent Mr. Tufnell's being called as a witness for the prosecution? Witness.. Am I to answer?</p>
               <p>Q. Now instead of applying to my Lord about it - it is a question no honest woman need object to answer - is there any thing you know to prevent Mr. Tufnell appearing as a witness? A. Am I to answer the question, my Lord?</p>
               <p>COURT. I see no objection to your answering it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know anything to prevent his being a witness? A. No; he is in health - it was in the drawing room at Margate, in Mr. Tufnell's presence that the prisoner told me she had written the receipt - it was in the early part of the morning before breakfast - Mr. Tufnell was present when I first questioned her on the subject - he was present at the commencement of the conversation - I dont recollect whether he remained to the end of it - the prisoner and he left the room together I believe; with the constable - she confessed to the constable herself, that the only thing she was afraid of was the forgery - that was not in my presence; the constable said, she said so in his house - there is nothing to prevent his being here - there was nothing to prevent my subpoening him; but I thought there was sufficient evidence without him.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Schofield the officer sent for to your house to search the prisoner's boxes? A. He was; I do not know the day - we had been three weeks at Margate - I was not present when he searched the boxes - some were in a room down stairs and some up stairs - I had no other servant.</p>

            . I am the attorney for Mrs. Hampton, in this prosecution; I was present when Schofield was sent for to search the prisoner's boxes, on Friday, the 20th of September; I had returned from Margate with Mrs. Hampton, that morning - I found two pieces of paper in the box, in the presence of the officer(producing them).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How did you open the box? A. The boxes were open - the large box was corded; the lock had evidently been broken; I did not find a box entirely open; the large trunk was open; the paper was not found in that trunk; it was in another box in a cupboard - that box was not locked - I should think there was nothing to prevent anybody either putting paper in or taking goods out of it - at that time I understand the prisoner was in Dover Gaol - the landlord and his family were in the house at the time - Schofield and Mr. Tufnell were present when these were taken out - I have not seen Mr. Tufnell to day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it he that introduced you to the prisoner's room? A. He told me certainly that was the prisoner's room; and I went down with him and Schofield, and in that room I found the box unlocked; several things were in the box - I did not try whether the lock was in order; I found no property there of value, except some books; and things belonging to Mrs. Hampton, of trifling value.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find valuable property of Mrs. Hampton's in the large box? A. Yes; the various articles which are in the other indictments - there were towels and things; but the large trunk contained nothing but clothes - there were several articles of value in the smaller box.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has employed you on this occasion? A. Mr. Tufnell wrote to me from Margate, but, I consider Mrs. Hampton as my client - I received my retainer from Mr. Tufnell: the person who wrote to me I considered my retainer.</p>

            . I live at No. 49, Conduit-street. My wife is a milliner - she was in the habit of supplying Mrs. Hampton with goods - in July last Mrs. Hampton was indebted to Mrs. Follet - there was an account this year, and the year before (looking at a bill) - this bill is mine, but the receipt is not; that is her bill, the receipt is not my hand-writing, nor my wife's.</p>
               <p>Q. Has anybody in your house authority to give receipts, but yourself, your wife, and Mr. Atkinson? A. No; it is not Mr. Atkinson's hand-writing - I never received from the prisoner two notes of 50l. and one of 10l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been in the habit of calling at Mrs. Hampton's to get your money? A. Yes, lately; I have been several times in August - I could not see her - I have seen her, but I could not see her when I called; I have seen her since this affair occurred, but not before - I called several times in August to see her - I cannot recollect whether I called in September; she was not in London, I believe, then - I have called at Mrs. Hampton's before August; I cannot say exaclty when - I did not see her often; I never saw her when I called at her house for money; Mrs. Hampton was rather backward in paying, and I called for the money; the bill was promised to be paid several times.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who did you seen when you called in July and August? A. Miss Ann Vickers always; it was by her that Mrs. Hampton was denied to me during August; I went particularly one day to see her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have called before August for money? A. No, I cannot exactly say I did call; I have called for payment of a bill before August - there were several appointments to pay the bill, that it would be paid at such a time.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you ever called at Mrs. Hampton's house at any time before August, for the purpose of getting it paid? A. I called in consequence of these promises not being performed; every time I called Ann Vickers gave me the message, that Mrs. Hampton could not be seen; she was always the person who told me that she could not be seen.</p>

Yes, and Schofield; and in those boxes the papers in question were found; and that was in Ann Vickers' room down stairs - the papers were left in Ann Vickers' room, and when I went to Bristol the box was sealed up; the packet of papers were sealed up; and when I came back I looked for the papers - I wanted to find them, and I certainly did find them, tied up with an immense number of bills and papers; and I gave them to Alkin, and knew them to be the same - I don't know what was to prevent Alkin or Schofield, or myself from keeping them after they were first found - I was not searching for them - I said when I found them, "Here is something which corresponds with the receipt" - I intended to take it away at the time; I don't know why I did not take them away; I certainly saw them there - I omitted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you omit it if you intended to take them away? A. I swear they are the same papers that were found - I was in such a hurry I was not there at the sealing - I did not seal them myself; they were not sealed in my presence; let me recollect a few moments; I think it must be from half an hour to three quarters that I staid in the house after the papers were found; I was at Marlborough-street after seven o'clock in the evening - I had several things to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you, as you intended to keep the papers, it was just as important a thing as anything you had to do? A. It did; it struck me afterwards; and - let me see; just let me recollect myself - I was anxious to see that the writing-desk was safe - I omitted taking the papers away at the moment; it slipped my memory; I was in a hurry - I went up stairs to see if the other places were broken open; then I came down again and went out above half an hour after - there was certainly plenty of time to take the papers - these papers were not sealed up - there was a bundle of papers sealed, but not these - I afterwards found these in the kitchen - on the dresser I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. The very place you swore before you did not find them; now I ask you was it not on the dresser? A. No, decidedly not on the dresser; they were in the kitchen; not in her room; they were taken away from there and tied up with a bundle of old papers.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sworn to me, that you found them on the dresser? A. No, I did not - I spoke to the servant-maid, Sarah Yarnold, to know where all the old papers had been placed; she said they were tied up together - they were brought ot me in a bundle, and I myself took them out of the bundle in the kitchen - I cannot tell what parot of the kitchen; I intended to take them away, and forgot it - I have not been in Court during this trial - I have not spoken to anybody about the trial; I have been waiting a long way from here on purpose to be sent for when wanted - not a long way off; I was with some friends at North, Simpson's, &amp; co. - nobody has told me anything that has been sworn to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. You conducted Schofield and Alkin to the prisoner's room? A. I did - on my word I cannot say whether I did or did not; I believe I did certainly in the backkitchen - I have now a distinct recollection that I went down myself and said, "Good God, here are the locks open."</p>
               <p>Q. It astonished you to find the locks open? A. I knew they were open before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to make that exclamation,"Good God! hereare the locks open," A. Why it was my own exclamation; I did not know the locks down stairs were open, but the locks up stairs were - I knew the locks in Mrs. Hampton's house were open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you said, "Good God! the locks are open," but you knew they were open before; Mr. Tufnell was it not to convey to the officer and Mr. Alkin, that you were perfectly astonished at finding them so, that you made that exclamation? A. No; I don't know why I made the exclamation - I certainly knew from the letter of Mr. Thompson, which I received at Margate, that the locks had been picked.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you exclaim, "Good God! her are the locks open," when you knew they were open? A. Oh! but not these locks I meant the locks were open up stairs, and I decidedly did not mean these down stairs; I had no reason to think any locks but those up stairs had been opened; decidedly not - I used that exclamation, because I was astonished to find all her own locks picked too.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been to Princes-street before that day; when had you been there, before you took Schofield and alkin there? A. On the Saturday three weeks; not afterwards, decidedly; I was close to the trunks, certainly, when I made the exclamation; there were three I think; I don't think all were picked; I exclaimed about two; the large trunk had the lock open; I saw that when it was open.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was that trunk corded or not? A. It was corded, and very heavy.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How did you discover the locks were open immediately, on going into the kitchen? A. When we uncorded it, I think it was then I made the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170038"/>exclamation; it was just after we went into the kitchen; the trunk opened of itself when the cord was taken off; I think I went into the front kitchen first, and in the other kitchen afterwards, and when I got in I saw the trunk uncorded.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was not uncorded when you went in first? A. Yes, I saw it with the cords on; the prisoner at that time was a prisoner at Margate; Schofield went into the house with me at the time; she was at Margate or Dover; we had come up to town together, for the purpose of making a search; I did not ask her for her keys, decidedly not, because I had them before; they were taken from her at Margate - her keys were in her box at Margate, and those keys I have now; and those keys I brought up from Margate to town.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there the least mark of violence on the trunks, were they not opened as a gentleman who had the keys might open them? A. Decidedly not, the locks were taken off evidently; I think one was totally off; I have no notion how the locks came off; I was there the whole time at Margate that she was there; there were a large quantity of empty jewel cases in the trunk; I can form no idea how they came there, I was absent the whole time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there no valuable property in the boxes? A. There was linen, towels, and a vast quantity of empty jewel cases, but no jewels; there were some clothes; some Indian towels.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You say you have known Mrs. Hampton thirteen years, have you been on friendly terms with her? A. Very much so; occasionally I have visited her house; I have been to Dover with her; Mrs. Atkins was the landlady at Dover; I have not seen Mrs. Atkins since I was at Dover.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you on good terms with her? A. She was very angry at my finding out that the postman had been defrauded of 1s. 6d. out of 2s. 6d. his Christmas box, which was to be given him; she was very angry at my finding out he only received 1s.; she had certainly the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you angry at her finding out anything? A. I was; I was at Boulogne some years ago with Mrs. Hampton, and at Tunbridge Wells; I was at Dover I think a fortnight or three weeks at one time; I took the lodging with Mrs. Hampton; on my word I cannot say whether she was with me when I took them, it is two years ago; I dined at Mrs. Hampton's while I was at Dover, and so I did at Margate, at Boulogne, and at Tunbridge-wells; one day at the hotel, and another day at Mrs. Hampton's; I am not related to her; not at all related; I think I have not been to any other places with her; not that I recollect; if you will mention to me, I will tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't forget the trip to Cranford-bridge? A. Oh! I was certainly at Windsor; I went in the same chaise; I had entirely forgotten that; we went go Windsor; Mrs. Hampton always paid for the journey, she paid me again if I paid it; when I went out of town she always requested me to settle the bill, and then she gave it me back again; it was repaid to me; I did not pay Mrs. Hampton's expences; she paid my travelling expenses; I never had any expenses paid by Mrs. Hampton which concerned me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Concerned you solely you mean? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Don't you think when you travel with a lady in a post chaise, at least half of it belongs to you? A. Yes, but she would not allow me - I mean to swear; when she was staying at her lodging I did not pay; she said for my dinner; I was on a visit to her at all the different times.</p>
               <p>Q. That being the case, of course, she paid for your bed-room? A. Except at Margate, where I paid for the bed-room myself - I went to Margate on the day of the storm, and the house was occupied, and had not sufficient room - Mrs. Hampton paid for my bed-room at Dover to my knowledge; it was the same house - Mrs. Hampton paid for it; I do not recollect that I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you say the prisoner said she wrote the receipt? A. She did, she was just taken into custody at the time; at least, the constable had not got her; it was before the constable came - I had her in my possession in the room - nobody was present at the confession but Mrs. Hampton and myself - I am not quite sure whether I told the magistrate of that confession or not; it was not that I took her up for - I was examined before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you a witness in a case against Mr. Barnes brought by Mrs. Hampton? A. Yes, I went before the Grand Jury - the bill was ignored - sometimes I and sometimes Mrs. Hampton have instructed the solicitor in this prosecution - I recommended Mr. Alkin as the solicitor; I employed him; I wrote to him; he has never before been concerned for me - I recommended him because he was a connection - there were two servants in the house in Princes-street (a maid servant and a man) when I went and found the box open - they were keeping the house - I made no inquiry as to how the girl's locks happened to be open.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. The house in Princes-street is only partly occupied by Mrs. Hampton? A. Yes; Mr. Thompson lived there - when the girl left Margate on the 7th of September, she stated it was her purpose to go to London; she then had plenty of opportunity of doing anything in the house of Mrs. Hampton she chose.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said you had the keys; on your oath, as you will answer to your God, did you ever open or pick the locks of either of the boxes? A. I did not; never - never - never, I believe, was I down there till that very day; the first time I saw the two papers in question was when Schofield and Alkin were present.(Receipt put in and read.)</p>
               <p>The two papers being produced, had the following words on them.</p>
               <p>"Follet - I Fol. receive 4,000; 1 H. pounds; 150 P. o."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I most positively deny the charge Mrs. Hampton brings against me; I never saw the receipt; I never gave her a receipt from Madame Follet - in February I paid 40l., bringing the bill receipted to that effect; then gave it to Mrs. Hampton, and never saw it since - before the 22nd of July last I received from her two 50l. and a 10l. note; she desiring me to take them to Mr. Barnes, in part payment of the heavy bill she owed him, which I did, and brought Mr. Barnes' receipt, and gave it into her hands - Madame Follet had been promised to have her bill settled in July; Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170039"/>Hampton sent me several times to put off the payment, and they came for the bill at different times, and she told me to put them off when they did come - in July last I was desired to tell them by Mrs. Hampton, that in consequence of the failing of her agent she was unable to pay the bill; I did so - he afterwards called again from time to time, and in August last Mr. Follet called every week for his money, and gave violent knocks at the door, which Mrs. Hampton must have heard; and Mrs. Hampton was fearful he would force himself into the drawing-room, to ask her for his money - she heard him every week declare that unless he was paid his bill he would force his way into the drawing-room himself to her - she always sat with the drawing-room door locked; and desired the door should be shut in his face - she applied to Mr. Tufnell to know what she should do; he applied to a lawyer, and brought her home word in my presence, that Madame Follet could not hurt her or call on her for the money, she being a married woman; she must sue her husband; and to treat it with indifference - Madame and Mr. Follet frequently applied, but Mrs. Hampton never would be seen - at another time when Madame Follet called for her bill, Mrs. Hampton told me to tell her to do her worst and her best, and to sue her husband for it, and I told her so - Madame Follet again applied and she desired me to tell her to wait till October, and she would pay her; I told her so, and if Mrs. Hampton had the least suspicion of the receipt being forged, she was in the habit of hearing them apply for their money every week three days out of seven in August, and never would be seen by her - she was in the habit of going to Regent-street, to purchase articles, and passing by their door, and going out of an evening with Mr. Tufnell, in August, and passing Madame Follet's house, where she could have inquired about the receipt - I never received money from her to pay to Madame Follet - the money in question I received was for Mr. Barnes, which I paid him, and brought her the bill and receipt - I have gone with different messages which she has given me for Madame Follet, and she has been in the habit of hearing them give loud knocks at the door, and stating they would have their money, and not leave the house till they got it; and she has desired me to show them into my room, and sent her daughter up and down with messages, when he was in the house, declaring he would not leave the house till he had his money - I have not the least hesitation in saying this is all done to put me out of the way and banish me, to crush the facts I am in possession of concerning the criminal intercourse between them, such as his sleeping with her, her clothing him, and feeding him, and making him presents of money, and diamond pins; also of her lending him at different times, large sums of money - when he has received her money from her agent in the city, he has borrowed large sums from her, which made her unable to pay her debts; and I am in possession of her pawning jewellery, clothes, and different things, even her petticoats, and other things, with pawnbrokers who have from her received authority to take them in - the whole of it is a conspiracy between Mrs. Hampton and Mr. Tufnell to banish me and my evidence - Colonel Hampton is daily and hourly expected in England, in consequence of suspicions of their criminal intercourse, for he has heard of her shameful proceedings with Mr. Tufnell, and they daily expect he will arrive - their principal object is to defraud the tradespeople and throwing all the blame on my head, and to banish my evidence against them.</p>

            . I am a jeweller and silversmith, and live at No. 15, Henrietta-street, Cavendish-square. I knew the prisoner as the servant, of Mrs. Hampton; Mrs Hampton was a customer of mine - at present she is a debtor to the extent of many hundred pounds for jewellery and plate - between the 15th and 22nd of July, I remember the prisoner paying me on two or three occasions, money on account of Mrs. Hampton - on two or three occasions, in the month of July - (refering to his book) - I have an entry on the 17th of July, to credit of Mrs. Hampton, "cash 50l.," and on the 20th of July, "Of cash 60l.," - here is "Mrs. H." with the date on one of the notes I received from Mrs. Hampton; the date looks like "20, 7.," which is July.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have spoken to two payments; in what was the 60l. paid, was it by a £50 note, or what? A. To the best of my recollection it was a £50 note and a £10 note - I did not make an entry of the note and the manner in which it was paid - I mark every note, and have marked this "Mrs. H."</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did you mean by "H.?" A. Hampton - I have seen a note with my hand-writing, and "17 - 7," by which I have no doubt the payment on the 17th was made by that very note - (looking at a note) - I should say I never received this note, but on the 17th of July, a note of £50 was paid me, and I recognise the other note as one I received from the prisoner on Mrs. Hampton's account - the balance due on the 20th of July, would be about 700l.; I had very often applied for payment - I never gained a personal interview with Mrs. Hamptno on applying for payment; the messages were always sent through Ann Vickers - I have received a great number of sums of money from the prisoner from Mrs. Hampton, somewhere about 600l. at different times, I would say 500l. - I have several times endeavoured to gain a personal interview with Mrs. Hampton, and have been unable - Mrs. Hampton made a charge against me.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been acquainted with Ann Vickers? A. As the servant of Mrs. Hampton, since February, 1832 - Mrs. Hampton herself gave me no order for any part of the property she has had of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have you and Ann Vickers been on very intimate terms? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean the ordinary terms of intimacy; pray have you been very late of a night at the house in Princes-street, when Mrs. Hampton was from home? A. Yes, I have staid there all night long - I understand it was not for receiving this £50 note, knowing it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170040"/>to have been stolen, that I was indicted, it was on another note.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you, ever since the charge was made before the magistrate, been in the way, ready to come forward and answer any charge? A. Always; I never took any order from Mrs. Hampton for goods for her - I think I have had two personal interviews with Mrs. Hampton - the orders for goods came invariably through the young woman, and she made the payments - I am a single man.</p>

            . I am managing clerk at Mr. Cotterell's. I know the prisoner; she has pawned articles at our house, articles of great value, diamonds - I know Mrs. Hampton; I saw her on the 14th of May at Mr. Cotterell's shop - Ann Vickers was with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Hampton on that occasion, in Ann Vickers's presence, give her authority to pledge with you, and give you permission to take in any articles she might bring of her's? A. She did, and I have acted on it ever since; I shouldthink I have advanced 400l. or 500l. through that girl on Mrs. Hampton's account - I should think as much.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you summoned here on a trial, in the event of which, if the prisoner is convicted, you will have to restore 
               <persName id="t18331017-55-person622">al</persName>
             the property? A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if the prisoner was convicted of stealing the property you say Mrs. Hampton gave her authority to pawn, you would have to give it up? I do not know that - I have a book with me containing an account of the pledges in September; I received pledges on the 9th of September - nothing between the 7th and the 9th; nothing on the 7th - on the 9th, a silver tea-pot, two castors, a mug, six dessert forks, a pair of sugar-tongs, two ladles, a butter-knife, two silver soap-dished, and one cover, a fish-slice, a silver gravy-spoon; 34l. was what I advanced - on the same day there was a gold chain pawned for 15l. 6s. 6d.; on the 10th, two gowns for 12s., and a shawl and handkerchief for 16s.; there was nothing on the 11th - I have not received any thing in pawn from Ann Vickers since that time.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you advance the money to her on the faith of the authority given to you by Mrs. Hampton? A. It was advanced to her as the servant of Mrs. Hampton; I advanced the money on these goods exactly as I did on all the other goods - I am only a shopman to Mr. Cotterell; it does not make a penny difference to me whether my master is obliged to give up the property or not.</p>

             - in consequence of some circumstances Dr. Burney had altered his mode of drawing by an agreement with our house which I understood) - the prisoner said he was to meet Mr. Jones at the Barrack Tavern that evening, or early the next morning; the Barrack Tavern is on Woolwich Common - I went with him to Woolwich the same day, in company with the officer and some others - I did not go to the tavern myself - I do not know anything of a Mr. Jones - I thought the signature was a forgery, both from the want of likeness to Dr. Burney's hand-writing, and from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170041"/>omission of what was the understanding between us about all his cheques.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe it is the custom of your house not to pay any cheques not written in full? A. They are all written instead of being printed - Dr. Burney does not write different hands; it bears a very general similarity throughout.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean that Dr. Burney's hand does, or that this paper does? A. No; Dr. Burney's hand does.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. There is no difficulty in deciphering what is his hand-writing? A. Generally speaking there is a great similarity - We have before paid drafts which were not his, which purported to be his - I had never seen the prisoner before to my knowledge; I did not receive the cheque from the prisoner's hand - I was close to the person to whom it was presented, and saw it presented by the prisoner - Geroge Lock is the person to whom it was presented; he is not here - the prisoner said he received it from a Mr. Jones; I went to Woolwich with him; he said that he was to meet Jones at the Barrack Tavern - I did not go to the tavern - I did not inquire for Mr. Jones at Woolwich - I have not had the cheque in my own individual keeping; when I received it I made such an inspection of it as enables me to say it is the same cheque - I was in the act of paying money at the time - it was put into my hands by Lock.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. And did you see the prisoner put it into his hand? A. I did; I had some conversation with the prisoner about it, after he was in another room - the cheque was present, and he knew of what cheque I spoke; it was the same cheque as Lock had put into my hand.</p>

            . Not a letter of this cheque is in my hand-writing; I never in my life authorised anybody to write it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does it occasionally happen that your hand varies? A. Not more than your's or anybody else's; I perhaps may have mistaken my own hand-writing, but never when I wrote a cheque.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to say you have not had an occasion, when you have doubted about that being your writing, which ultimately turned out to be so? A. The circumstance I believe to which you refer, is this, another cheque was presented at Child's, that cheque was returned to me as wanting the private mark agreed on by the bankers and myself; on receiving the cheque, I never troubled myself to see if it was real or forged; I simply looked to see if the mark agreed on was there or not, finding it was not there, I knew I had not drawn the cheque, and substituted for the cheque another with the mark - I never looked as to whether it was my hand-writing or not; it was returned to me simply as requiring that particular mark - I looked at it and thought I destroyed the cheque, but I destroyed only half of it, and on looking among some letters, this half cheque was found; I suppose that is what the allusion is made to.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Allowing for a difference, in sickness or health, or any accident, can you tell your own handwriting, as well as other men can tell? A. I have no doubt of it; I swear this is not my hand-writing.</p>

               <p>DANIEL FORRESTER re-examined. The prisoner was delivered into my custody at Guildhall - I went to Woolwich with him because he said he had received this cheque from Jones on Woolwich Common.</p>
               <p>Q. In any house or street? A. On the common; he was to meet Jones there that evening, (Thursday) about half-past seven o'clock, or next morning about ten o'clock; I went to the Barrack Tavern with him, into a room which looked on the common; we waited till about half-past five o'clock; I said "Do you think he will come into a lower room, if so we will go down stairs"? and we went down stairs - no Jones appeared - he said he did not know him before; he did not say he had seen him at the tavern - we waited till about half-past five o'clock - something was said about the coach starting; he said, "I do not think it worth while waiting any longer," I said,"Mind, I will stay here if it is until nine o'clock," he said, "No, I do not think it is of any use waiting any longer;" he said nothing about going the next morning; I took this piece of paper from his person, here are some figures on it, he said the person gave it him, and that was how he was to get it cashed; I asked him as to the hand-writing on the back of it, he said he did not know there was any there, if there was, it must be there when given to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything about the man meeting him on the Common, and giving him the cheque? A. No; he said he had been to the Barrack Tavern on the Tuesday afternoon with Mr. Imms - I asked if Imms saw him with the man? he said, No, he did not think he did, as it was after he came out of the tavern.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The paper he said was handed to him by Jones when he gave him the cheque, describing how he was to get it changed? A. Yes; I beg to state the prisoner did not ask for any person named Jones in my presence while I was at the tavern - I asked the waiter if he knew such a person as Jones? he said, "No."(The cheque was here put in and read.)</p>

            . I know the prisoner - I am superintendent at Woolwich, and collector to the Gas Light Company - I have frequently seen the prisoner write; I should say the figures in ink on this paper decidedly are not his hand-writing; I am not so positive as to the other- I would not take on myself to swear they were his - I should say no part of it was his - I do not know whose hand-writing it is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been on the Common with him on the day he states? A. I was on Woolwich Common with him on Monday, the 26th of August, and we went together to the Barrack Tavern - I occasionally parted from him - I ought to have explained<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170042"/>- he was to have dined with me on Sunday, and did not come; he came on Monday - as soon as I finished dinner I said, "Now, Corbett, I must go collecting, will you go on making out accounts, or go with me?" he said, "My mind is in such a state I cannot sit at books, I will walk with you" - he went with me - I went into different houses collecting, and left him outside - he had been disappointed in a situation - I have known him sixteen or eighteen years - I should think his age is about thirty-six.</p>
               <p>Q. During the whole time you have known him has he borne an irresproachable character? A. If he had not I would not have employed him - I have treated him as a brother.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was Monday, the 26th of August when you asked him to dinner? A. Yes; he did not tell me he had a cheque about him dated the 28th of August.</p>
               <p>MR. WORMALD re-examined. He presented the cheque on Thursday, the 29th of August.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to Graham's; I found the prisoner there - Miss Graham had the tops of her ear-rings in her hand - I asked the prisoner where she lived? and she said she lived there - when the tops of the ear-rings were produced I asked the prisoner where the drops were? she said she knew nothing of the drops, but she picked up the tops in sweeping the room - I took her into the next room to search her - a knife dropped from her with the name of Graham on it, and this handkerchief slipped from behind her clothes with the initials of M. G. on it - I then went to No. 3, King's Head-court - I asked her which room she lived in? she said the second floor, and told me where the key was to be found; I found it where she described, and it opened the door; and I found keys on her which opened some drawers there; and in the drawers I found the ear-rings and the whole of the property I have here, except the bedcurtain, which was between the sacking and the bedstead- I have a table cloth, a shirt, apron, chair cover, coloured neck handkerchief, pillow cases, some children's tumblers, cruets, saucers, bed furniture, and a pickle-dish; some silk, a pair of scissors, pen-knife, and snuff-box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Is that all the account she gave? A. Yes; she did not tell me how she became possessed of them.</p>
               <p>MARY GRAHAM re-examined. These are my earrings, but this pair are not mine; when I accused her of taking my earrings, (after seeing the tops in her ears;) she said she had broken her own the day before; these earrings are mine, and the scissors, and silk, and the handkerchief; I made the curtains - I know the shirt, table-cloth, and other things; the snuff-box and knife belong to my brother - I have examined them all, and know them to be our property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your father's name Robert? A. It is; the prisoner has been treated confidentially in the family; some old dresses were given to her once - I have a sister married; her marriage was not known to my father for some time after it happened - the prisoner said it was not known to her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Those things there, I bought and gave 8s. 6d. for, in the New Cut; there never was a stopper to them - it was two years ago last March, when I nursed a person named Jones, over the water; the pepper-castor and mustard-pot I bought myself, and gave 1s. 6d. for in Sun-street, Barbican; and that vinegar-cruet, belonged to my grandfather; the earring drops I found in the chimney place, when I swept the room; and two days after that, I found the tops under the carpet which was turned up; I took them down into the kitchen, and laid them on the dresser, thinking to give them to Miss Graham, but she never came into the kitchen at the time; previous to that, her sister came up; and before that, I put one in my ear, and Mrs. Storey, her sister, saw it in my ear, and she sent me on an errand, and when I returned, I took it out and put it in paper ready for Miss Graham - I called her up, she said, "I am coming presently;" but she never came up until I was in custody.</p>
               <p>MARY GRAHAM re-examined. I know the decanters, for we had half-a-dozen of them; two are at home now, and we have only four left - one of them is here - there is no mark on them; I know the pepper-castor, for we had three of them in an old-fashioned stand, but they were broken, and we took this for salad oil - I am sure<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170043"/>it is the same; it stood in the larder on a shelf; both the handkerchiefs have names on them, and I made the shirt myself - I know my work on the shirt, the letter G is still there, but the other letter has been picked out since I marked it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutrix, as I stood by the door, came in and passed me in the house, and I stopped some time myself talking to the landlady of the house, and went out again - if I had had any inclination to escape, I had plenty of opportunities - she was away some time before she brought the person belonging to the property - I never knew the woman - I went into the Cholera Hospital, in Greville-street on the 10th of August, and stopped there eleven nights, and had all my clothes burnt - but it was a different time that I was in Bartholomew Hospital - I have a certificate from the Cholera Hospital to show I was there, and afflicted with the malignant cholera.</p>
               <p>Edmund Ireland, butcher, No. 3, Water-lane, Fleet-street, and Samuel Allen, a coffee-house-waiter, gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

The witness did not take the hat out of my possession, that I positively deny - I have been troubled with the severest poverty for two years; it was in a moment of urgent distress; I had not a place to lay my head - I have even gone to ballad singing to get bread - I have got a precarious lodging for the last two years, consequently can refer to nobody for whom I have worked.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. JONES. Q. Are you married? A. Yes - I was quite sober; I did not stop with the prisoner more than a minute and a half - I did not speak to her first - I did not ask her to do anything - I did not lay my hands on her; I only put her hand away - there were four sovereigns in my purse, but no silver; I did not tell the prisoner I had no silver, or very little - I did not ask her to grant me any favour on the spot; I will swear I did not unbutton my trousers - I will swear I did not unbutton any part of my dress - she did not tell me she was not in the habit of exposing herself in the street, if I was - she did not say that I had acted very indecently, and very ungentlemanly towards her - it was not dark, the lamps were lighted - I did not ask her to take me home with her - she took hold of me; I could not have got from her but by violence - she had run forty yards before I overtook her - I will swear it was as far as that - she told me to give her into custody- I did not search her; I had hold of her till I got her to the officer - I distinctly swear I did not search her in the street, nor attempt it - when I took her, I said,"I know you have got my purse; if you will give it me I don't mind giving you a shilling to get something to drink".</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did she lay hold of you? A. By my coat; I suppose she saw the top of my purse outside my waistcoat pocket.</p>

             (police-constable C 111). I took the prisoner - I went to Clifford-street, and waited till they returned with a light; I then got over the rails of No. 19, and picked up this purse, containing four sovereigns - the prosecutor said he had lost his purse and four sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not a place where it might have dropped, if two persons had been standing there? A. No, it must have been thrown; it was six feet from the footpath.</p>

I received information; I went to the prisoner's room in Davis-court, Chequer-alley; there was no one there; the house they live in is No. 5, but I had before that, heard some person run across the alley to No. 3; I went and knocked at No. 3, the door was opened by the landlady of the house; I saw the prisoners there - one sitting on a chair, and the other on the bed; I said I should take them all three into custody; the prisoner Brown then said, "Don't take Kelly, (which is the name the landlady goes by); I have the money, he agreed to give us half-a-crown a-piece in coppers, to sleep with us both;" she then gave me 7s. 10d. in copper, and Dixon gave me a penny; and there were five penny pieces on the table; they said they had met a gentleman in Barbican who gave them a shilling a-piece in penny pieces.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Ickenham, near Harefield.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the place at which you saw the prisoner, about eight o'clock that night, in the direction to Harefield? A. A little; he could have gone to one place or another; there are three turnings - I have known the prisoner eight years, and never knew any thing dishonest of him - he has been a hard-working industrious man.</p>

               <p>MR. DOANE. Q. How came you to recollect the time that night? A. I was just going to bed and I make it a rule to look at the clock when I go to bed - I have always stated the same time as I do now; I have never said it was a quarter before nine o'clock when he came in - I will swear I never said so - I will positively swear that he came in about twenty minutes before nine o'clock, according to my clock.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you look at the clock every night? A. Yes; I generally go to bed between eight and nine o'clock; I cannot tell what time I went to bed on the 1st of October, nor on the 5th, but I can remember going to bed at twenty minutes before nine o'clock on the 3rd, by the children saying about my son coming home on that night; they reminded me of it after the charge - my son did not go out again that night - I heard him come to bed, but he did not come into the room I was in; if he had gone out I must have heard him.</p>

I took the prisoner on the 16th of September - I saw him and another go to a shop - the other went in, and the prisoner stood at the door - I went and took him to the watch-house - he gave up these eleven half-crowns, and said he got them from a man in Smithfield, whom he would show me, and who was the maker of them - Waller went with him, and he pointed out Robson, who was taken into custody - we went to Robson's house, and found some moulds, and three more half-crowns, which we have - those which the prisoner had were wrapped up in silver paper.</p>

               <p>10 OTHERS COUNTS, varying the manner of laying the charge.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>JOHN COOK. I am a silver spoon polisher, and have been employed by the prisoner a little; he lived and carried on business at No. 3, <placeName id="t18331017-85-crimeloc477">Essex-street, Battle-bridge</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18331017-85-crimeloc477" type="placeName"

                        targets="t18331017-85-off474 t18331017-85-crimeloc477"/>- he came to live there before April last; he took the house for Mr. Hawkins in the beginning of the year - Hawkins lived in the house from January till the beginning of May - he then went away, and the prisoner lived there from that time, and was a silver spoon maker - Bates, a silver polisher, lodged with Hawkins, and with the prisoner, after Hawkins left - on the 27th of July, I was employed by the prisoner to pawn two gravy spoons, at Mr. Wood's, in St. John-street - I believe I got 2l. 10s. on them - the prisoner went very near Wood's shop with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he assign any reason for not going himself? A. I being known there; I pawned them with Mr. Wood, I gave the money to the prisoner - I do not recollect pawning any thing else at Wood's about that time; I do not think I pawned any thing in May - I pawned other things for the prisoner afterwards; I think it was in August - I do not recollect pawning any other spoons in May - I believe I have only pawned plate for the prisoner twice; I have pawned things for Hawkins - Hawkins went away the beginning of May, or in April, I do not know when exactly - I do not pawn for him after he went away - if I pledged any plate at Wood's in May, it was for Treen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any knowledge, one way or other, whether you did? A. I do not recollect; I think it was in May that Hawkins left the house.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Pray have you a son? A. Yes; he went with Hawkins - I do not know the date at which he left; it was in the beginning of May, I think - I never pawned any plate at Wood's, but for Hawkins and the prisoner - I do not know whether my son is in this kingdom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The prisoner was a spoon polisher in Hawkins' employ, like yourself was he not? A. Yes; Hawkins was a manufacturer - he supplied Mr. Savory; the prisoner and I used to polish the spoons - I cannot say at what time in May Hawkins left - he absconded in consequence of something which happened.</p>
               <p>Q. And you men were left behind to do as you could? A. Yes; I have heard that Hawkins and my son are gone to New York together - the variable letter on plate, to denote the present year, is "S" - "R" was the letter for the year before; "Q" and "P" for the two previous years.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from "A" down to "S" the letters have run on? A. There was some letters left out - a person forging a mark twelve months ago might have good reason to believe the letter would be "S" this year, as the last was "R" - the prisoner gave me the spoons to pawn at Wood's because I was known there - knew him as well, I believe.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Do not you know that the form and shape of the letter, and the size depends on the order of the Commissioners? A. I have not noticed that.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been asked whether the prisoner was not a polisher; was not he a manufacturer as well as a polisher? A. He could make; I have seen him help Hawkins to make.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. After Hawkins went away, to your knowledge, has the prisoner carried on the business of making plate? A. A little; his name is not over the door as a manufacturer - I had been about twelve months in Hawkins' service, on and off; I went to work, at intervals, when he wanted any body - I do not recollect any plate being made with the letter "S" on it, while Hawkins lived in the house; I think there was - I do not exactly recollect - while Hawkins was in the house I do not think there were any spoons of that description; there might be some, but I do not think I have seen any - Hawkins could put what he pleased on them, without my knowing any thing of it.</p>

My sister was up-stairs; she came down in about ten minutes, and went to the work-table drawer, where the watch had been - he had sat so near the work-table, that he could put his hand into the drawer - directly she came down, she went to see what was o'clock, and the watch was gone - I had seen it in the drawer a quarter of an hour before; it was a gold watch, with a gold chain, a gold watch-hook, and gold key; they were all gone, and were worth about 30l. together - no other stranger had been in the house that day but him - I was speaking to the prisoner for about ten minutes; I am quite certain he is the man; I have seen him twice before - I should know the watch again - he was near enough to the table to hear the watch tick; because I have sat in the same seat, and could always hear it tick in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you called on me, to recognise me at the prison you looked round; there was not more than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170055"/>three or four men in the yard, and you could not discover the person. Witness. I immediately pointed the prisoner out to the gaol keeper, and to the sergeant of the police.</p>

            . I was servant to Mrs. Ebrington and Miss Crook, in May - I remember the person coming to look at the house; he came with a card - I showed him the parlours and the kitchens, and then took him into the drawing-room; he looked round, and the lady sent down word, that he must wait a few minutes before he could come up to see the bed-rooms; I asked him to sit down a few minutes in the drawing-room - I believe the prisoner to be the man, to the best of my knowledge; I have seen him twice before - I let him out afterwards; he was in a hurry to go out - there was no other stranger there until after the watch was missed; it has not been found - he was apprehended about a month ago.</p>

               <p>Q. State exactly what he said? A. He said, he ought to have paid the account in cash, but could not do it, but he had a bill of exchange which would be duly honoured, when it became due - he presented me the bill, wished me to take it, and furnish him with more goods; I let him have goods - the bill was presented by a notary - the amount of goods he had that day was 4l. 2s., and he owed me previously 5l. 19s. - I did not give him the difference - I put the bill by as a collateral security; I could not give him credit for the bill, it not being cash - I took it expecting it to be honoured when due; that was my inducement to part with my goods - I have received several letters from the prisoner, which I have acted on and have become perfectly acquainted with his hand-writing - it is my firm belief that this acceptance is not his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>JOHN CHARLES BEALE. I live at No. 32, Tenter-street, Spitalfields. On the 5th of October, at night, I was near <placeName id="t18331017-95-crimeloc528">Petticoat-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you ever given a different account of the transaction? A. No sir; I said there was a crowd assembled - directly I found the handkerchief in his hand I took him by the collar, and did not loose my hold till the officer tok him - I never said that the confusion and crowd were so great that I could not tell from whose hand I took it; I said there was a crowd of persons assembled, which caused me to stop and listen - I never said my mind was confused by the crowd; I said my attention was directed to the crowd, and while I was listening to the observations going forward, I felt the tug, turned round, and found the handkerchief in the prisoner's hands - I never told the prisoner's mother, that I could not tell whose hand the handkerchief was in - she came down after me three times, and said at first that she was very sorry for what took place, and if I liked to make a flaw in the indictment, he would get off; that she was very poor, but if they could do any thing to stop the business she should be happy - I said I would do nothing and if he was a good character he would be able to stand the trial - I said no more to her than I have stated.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a crowd of persons there? A. There was about a dozen persons - I was alone; quite sober - as collected as I am now - it was a quarter to one o'clock in the morning - I was returning from a club to which I am secretary, and it does not break up till twelve o'clock; it is held at the Blue Anchor, Ratcliffe-highway - the spot this happened in, is in the way I generally go home - I cannot say that it is in my way home; sometimes I might go out of my way; but it is the way I generally go - I could not have gone any other way then to have taken the turning before it, or down Petticoat-lane - it was not out of my way, I should think the length of eight or nine houses - there is no mark about the handkerchief I believe; I did not look in this corner to see if there was a mark - it is torn here, that was what I was looking for, but I did not notice it when it was taken; I cannot positively say whether I noticed the fear when it was taken, but I noticed it when the officer gave it to me - it might have been changed for another for what I can tell.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you such a knowledge of your handkerchief as to be able to say that is yours? A. I consider it to be mine; it is my property and what I lost.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Will you venture to swear it is your handkerchief? A. I consider it to be mine; I will swear it is mine; I know it by the pattern - I am no judge much of handkerchiefs - it is a cotton one.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you buy it? A. In Commercial-road; I gave 1s. 6d. for it - I bought it new.</p>

            . This is the prisoner's handwriting - he never accounted to me for the receipt of this money - I did not discover it had been received till I lost my day-book and was obliged to call in assistance to elucidate my accounts - the day-book was in the prisoner's custody - I think I missed it on the 4th of September, when the prisoner left me, and I had occasion to examine by books - I had not settled my accounts with the prisoner; he left me in consequence of my books being very back and my accounts very much deranged - I had complained of it, and on the 4th of September, I complained very much, and he said, "I see I cannot get on, I will cut it at once," I said "Agreed" and he went, but in the evening when I was absent, he insinuated himself into the warehouse - the next morning I called in assistance to go into the books and we missed the day-book - the debts which are deficient were between the cash-book and the ledger - the prisoner never accounted to me for this 1l. 6s. - he was in my debt; I had lent him money only a few days before; I have never found my day-book - I had examined that book before September; if this sum had been entered in the day-book I must have seen it, as they were always entered into the cash-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect all the entries? A. No, not a fiftieth, nor perhaps a hundredth part of them - I recollect going to his house after he left me, and desiring him to come and assist me to look at the books, and he was in a state of intoxication; but he came to me several days afterwards - I frequently found fault with his manner of doing business - I have had frequent cause to find fault with my wife - I do not know but I may have quarrelled with every body in the house - I have received many sums of money from the prisoner - my wife has received money of him when I have been out, and some times when I have been at home - the prisoner did not go over the books with me, after he left me; he did through the stock - I have quarrelled with my wife on account of her interfering with the business; it was her duty to receive money sometimes, but not to dictate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember taking the whole file of receipts, and in your fury, pitching the whole file out of the window into the garden? A. Yes; and if I had pitched him out too, it would have been as well; I never was so exasperated in my life - I got the file back again in a minute; to the best of my recollection the prisoner brought it me; I think that was a few days before I accepted his resignation - his lodgings were most accurately searched a few days after he left, but nothing was found - I have not brought my wife here, but the prisoner has subpoened her - this account was received in May, 1832.</p>

               <p>RICHARD TOWNLEY. The prisoner never gave me an account of this; it ought to have been entered in the day book, which was kept in the warehouse, and which was missed some days after the prisoner left me; this sum of 2l. 3s. 6d. could not have been entered there, or I should have seen it; and it was my uniform practice to go over that book, and enter the cash in the cash-book, and the balance was struck at the bottom by the prisoner; it might sometimes be a week or two before I made the entries, but it was always his duty to hand over money to me, and if it had been entered in the day-book regularly, in the course of a day or two, or a week, or a fortnight, I should have gone over it and entered it into the cash-book; there is no entry in the cash-book of this sum; when he left he was in my debt, we had not settled our accounts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When had you seen the old day-book? A. I missed it on the 5th of September, but I cannot be positive as to when I had seen it; there was a new day-book in use on the 2nd, and I will swear I saw the old one after the new one was there - I took the old one out of the bookcase where it had been, and threw it down, and reproached him with indolence; I said "If you had any management you would put this out of the way, you will have very little occasion for it now" - I cannot say that there might not be three weeks elapse between the times of my looking over the day-book- I should not wonder if there had been five weeks elapse, I was so oceupied in my business; but he had no right to keep money a single day - he always treated me with respect.</p>

            , and my name was put Eliza, instead of Elizabeth Abbot; I had it altered, and we were married again at Gravesend church, on the 3rd of April. I had when we were married £500 in the funds, and he had had £230 of me before our marriage; the reason of my advancing this was that when he took me from home he had no money, and he asked me for what I had, which I gave him, and then I sold out some more: we were then living at the Nag's Head, in the Borough, but I had no intercourse with him, we lived only as brother and sister. I let him have £200, to buy furniture against our marriage, and two or three days after we were married he had the rest, as he said he had some bills to pay - the broker objected to let me have it, and I asked my mamma for a letter to the broker, which she gave me, and I took it all out. I asked the prisoner for it again, and he refused to let me have it; he said, if I did not let him have it, he would leave me - I went with him to Gravesend, and he then told me that if I lived there I should live on his sister's charity.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If you did not live with him. A. No; he said "I might go home to my mother again, if I liked, but if I stopped there I should live on his sister's charity - up to the present moment I have been merely as a sister to the prisoner, nothing more - his father never told me that the money should be returned - I was not told that the prisoner was a married man previous to our marriage - I was not told so till I went to my mother's, about four months ago - I pressed him to marry me after we came to London, but not before; I came to London with him, on the 17th of February last.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, recollect yourself, did you not press him to marry you before your visit to London; and did you not frequently write to him, in 1832, soliciting him to marry you? A. Not till after he promised me marriage; I did not write to him till he wrote to me - he told me on the night I left home that his father consented to our marriage - I did not state to him that his father would not suffer me into his family - I never intimated that to him to my knowledge - this letter is my writing - (read.)</p>
               <p>Edmund, December 11, 1832.</p>
               <p>"I am quite surprised at your strange behaviour to me, after professing so much towards me - you certainly have not acted like a man. I wrote to you twice and had no answer, therefore I sent a friend of mine down, thinking you might be ill, and when I heard the result, I was quite astonished, not only astonished, but very much hurt, to think you have acted so deceitfully towards me, after what you said the last time we met. I am quite convinced you never meant a word you said, although you know what I have gone through for you: my friend took the trouble to call on you twice, and the second time you sent your father out, instead of coming out like a man; that showed how guilty you was, or else you would not have got your father to have spoken for you. Your father told my friend I was not worth coming into your family, but it is not because my family bear the name they do that I should, for I consider myself as respectable as you in every respect. Edmund, do not think that by writing this letter to you, I ever wish to renew this correspondence again to such a worthless man as you; but although you have acted as you have towards me, I wish you all the happiness this worth affords, and whenever you marry, I hope the lady will make you a better wife than I should. Hoping when this meets you you will be quite well, I, for the last time, shall bid you farewell. With every mark of respect, I remain your sincere friend. - E. SLEE.</p>

               <p>Witness. He had told me that his father was angry with him, but he should not mind that - but he afterwards told me his father had given his consent - up to the 10th of December he had not received any money from me - I have preferred an indictment against him for stealing this money.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you heard that he had a wife before you were married to him? A. No; I asked him, and he said he had not - he told me that his father had given his consent to our marriage, and he went with him to take the license - I saw them go out of the house to get it - the money found at the prisoner's was in the identical bank notes which I had from the stockbroker.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are we to understand that he courted you as a single man? A. Yes; and I believed he was single, and able to marry me legally.</p>

My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury; - Conflicting as are the feelings which weigh heailyv<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170061"/>upon me in my peculiar and unhappy position - and which, in their attack upon every nerve, wildly contend for mastery, I cannot hope, with any degree of self-command, to be able to address you, - and must, therefore, appeal to your indulging forbearance while entering upon that justification of my conduct which will, I firmly and sincerely believe, dispose you to declare me entitled to a release from the opprobrium and danger of my present situation. High and ardent as were the hopes which painted the happiness of a wedded life, and which attended me during my courtship and marriage with the object of my most sincere and heartfelt attachment, they were doomed to be severely and speedily crushed by the proceedings of the immediate guardian and protector of the lady, - who, the moment the ceremony was performed, declared it illegal - effected our immediate separation. It were a painful and almost useless endeavour, my Lord and Gentlemen, to attempt depicting the anguish and desolation caused by our final and complete separation. To be most decidedly and peremptorily told, that my imagined legal claims were unequal to oppose the parental authority which separated us, and to reflect with bitter regret upon the peculiar regards which the world would extend towards her, from the connection which had subsisted between us, - all these of necessity pressed heavily upon me, and rendered me, in the very dawn of manhood, a mere wreck - a solitary and broken-hearted being. Would not the deep love, my Lord and Gentlemen, which characterised my regards, have prompted me to seek, by legal means, the restitution of my connubial rights? Assuredly, yes! But fully convicted of the illegality of the union, and impressed with a conviction of my total inability to substantiate my claims, I considered that such a course would be but futile, and resigned myself in silence to my fate. The lapse of some years soothed the keenness of my regrets, and I permitted myself, upon an introduction to the lady by whom these proceedings are instituted, to regard her with feelings, which I solemnly declare would never have been encouraged, had I considered my first marriage legal or binding. Circumstances, however, effected a change in my sentiments towards her, and by the advice of my family I discontinued my attentions. Far be it from me, my Lord and Gentlemen, to attach the slightest stigma to this lady, yet I state but the strictest truth in saying, that her imprudence in suffering her name to be mentioned with mine in an equivocal manner, rendered herself and family improdence on the subject of our marriage. It was in vain I assured her that the love which should attend the wedded state, was not an inmate of my breast. It was in vain, my father amid the various obstacles he opposed, informed her of my former marriage. All was useless, - and at length after considerable hesitation, and scarcely conquered reluctance, I was hurried into an act, the commission of which is now attempted to be converted into a crime, - and upon which my ruin and disgrace is carefully and unrelentingly planned. That I wilfully erred, most solemnly do I deny. Even after so great a lapse of time, some lingering doubts as to the alleged illegality of my first marriage still existing in my mind, I took the advice thereon of a respectable solicitor, resident in my neighbourhood, upon whose given opinion I entered upon my second marriage, without the slightest suspicion of acting wrong, or contrary to the utmost strictness of the law. I have thus, my Lord and Gentlemen, attempted an outline of the facts and feelings which have been my prompters during the whole of this unhappy train of complicated ills. That I should be an object for pity rather than for punishment, I do unfeignedly conceive. In neither instance did I harbour the remotest thought or intention of effecting a moral injury or legal wrong. And now most sincerely - most earnestly do I look foward to your decision, which will, I firmly trust, direct my acquittal, and will gladly assure me that the intense hopes I cherish of being restored to the world with honour, are not of things to perish.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you he had been robbed as soon as you saw him? A. Yes - I don't know that he was exactly sober; he went about his work, he did not appear to be tipsey.</p>

             (police-constable K 81). On the 9th of October, I fell in with the prisoner, carrying a bundle on his back, in the Isle of Dogs - I had not known him before; but my brother officer asked him where he got the bundle, he said, he came from Captain Gilmore, who I understand is a captain in the navy, and he was going to take the bundle to Canton-place - my brother officer said he would go to Captain Gilmore's and see if it was right, and he told me to detain the prisoner - as soon as my brother officer was gone, the prisoner acknowledged that he stole the things from Captain Gilmore's.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, in the employ of Mr. Tilley, of Mile-end. On Friday morning, the 4th of October, the prisoner brought a watch to pawn - I asked him two or three questions, his answers did not agree with the description of the watch, and I sent for a policeman; before the policeman came, the prisoner ran down a court, and got into a privy; he was there taken.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hounslow. On the 28th of September, about ten o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner at Hounslow, which is about seven miles from Shepperton, he was offering two pigs for sale - a master-butcher, named West, said, that he thought by the price at which the prisoner offered them they had been stolen; I said, I thought so too, and I went and took him; he said, they were his brother's pigs, who lived at Egham, and he had been distrained on for rent, and he sent him to sell them - I took him into custody, but did not make him any promise or threat; but he said, "It will be better for me to tell the truth;" I said, "Mind, I do not ask you to tell me;" he then said, "They are stolen pigs, but I did not steal them" - I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 11th of October, I watched the two prisoners from Marylebone-street to St. James'; I saw them go into several shops, and at last Pearce went into Mr. Gooch's, in <placeName id="t18331017-116-crimeloc635">Curzon-street</placeName>

            . I was with this officer, what he has stated is correct - I took Gordon, and found this pair of silver spectacles in his hand, which I had seen him draw from his pocket; I said, "How do you account for these spectacles?" he said, "They are my own;" I said, "I suspect you took them from the brush-maker's shop in Curzon-street" - we went there, and I said to the prosecutor, "Sir, do you now miss anything?" he said "No;" I then said, "Sir, do you wear spectacles?" he said,"Yes;" I said, "Where are your spectacles?" he looked for them, and they were gone - I showed him these, and he claimed them as his.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Catherine Roach made no hesitation at producing the key of the parlour? A. No, she opened the door herself - these glasses were found in a deal-box, like a servant's box - whether Catherine Roach had ever opened it I don't know - I recollect during the time Mary Roach lived with me, that a party of gentlemen were at my house one night, who got tipsy, and broke the glasses; but they were mostly ale glasses; there might be some like these; I did not hear Mary say, that as the gentlemen had paid for all the glasses, she was entitled to those which were left whole as her perquisite - she might have taken more valuable things than these - I don't wish to hurt her, but I was forced to prosecute.</p>

            . I am prime warden of the Goldsmith's Company; in consequence of something I heard, I went to the shop of Mr. Savory; in Cornhill, on Wednesday, the 21st of August; I asked for six tea spoons, stating that I wished to buy six plain tea spoons - I was furnished with them; (I now hold them in my hand) I looked at the marks and thought they were forged - I asked to see some more spoons - I did not specify any number; I asked if their spoons of other patterns, but the same quality, were a higher price - and asked to see some; the shopman told me he had none, but I might see some in the afternoon - there were three shopman in the shop; I examined the marks openly on the counter, and asked if they were the proper marks - the shopman told me they were all manufactured at their manufactury, pointing to a board with golden letters, written on it,"Manufactory, Myrtle-street, Hoxton;" the board was at the top of the shop, just above the counter - and he added if these marks were not put on at Goldsmith's Hall, they were subject to a penalty of £50, for every article they sold without it; I paid £2 for them - there are the regular officers here from the hall, to prove the marks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. How long have you been warden of the Company? A. Nearly four years; I am not in the trade, nor connected with it in any way - we had made no discovery respecting a man named Treen when I went to Mr. Savory's; he was also under suspicion at that time - at the same time I received a communication regarding one party, I received it regarding the other party.</p>

            . Q. How long have you been engraver to the Company? A. Since 1807 - the Company are authorised to impress stamps of their own when they assay silver - the Stamp Office have the management of the King's duty - the stamp is made by me, by the authority of the Stamp Office - the stamp is put on the plate by the Company at the hall - they have the stamp of the king's head to denote the duty is paid; and their own stamps, the lion passant, the leopard's head, and the letter of the year, are all put on at the hall at the same time - all those stamps are forged - I am not in the habit of attending at the hall when the stamps are put on; I know how it is done - the plate is sent in a bag to be stamped; there is a ticket with the bag containing the weight of silver - the duty is 1s. 6d.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170069"/>an ounce; I don't know whether 3d. an ounce is allowed for discount.</p>
               <p>Q. Now; did you go on the search at Mr. Savory's shop? A. I did - I did not know Mr. Savory - we went to search on the 24th of August - Mr. Fuller accompanied me; Mr. Miles went also, but left immediately, he was going to Bow-street - Mr. Miles is assayer - we went with Forrester, a city officer, between eleven and twelve o'clock I think - I think the question was asked, whether Mr. Savory was at home - he was out; I don't recollect where they said he was - one of the shopmen asked to write a letter to Mr. Savory; I did not look at it - I went out of the shop to get a bun at the pastrycook's - nothing was said about the letter afterwards in my presence - I should not think we staid more than an hour there searching, for we took the plate away to the Goldsmiths' Company - we took the whole plate that they gave us up; which they said was the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Treen's work asked for? A. It was not that I am aware of - when I was present six hundred and fifty-five ounces were taken.</p>

I merely went into the shop I think a second time; but I don't recollect stopping there - I was only present at one general search - the day I went with the officer we took the whole plate that was delivered up to us - I was not present when there was any contest about an officer being left in the house, and it was agreed a padlock should be put on the door - the first time I was present was when six hundred and fifty-five ounces were brought away - there had been a search before; I was not present at the first search - Mr. Miles went to the first search I believe - he brought some plate to me to be examined; I don't know how many ounces; I did not take any account of the weight - I don't know what he took away - I examined all Miles shewed me; I am not aware that Miles shewed me anything till after I made that seizure - I examined some, but not what was brought me by Miles - Mr. Bedell brought some from the prime warden - that was one spoon.</p>

            . Q. Then you don't know that Miles took thirty-six ounces? A. No; I took six hundred and fifty-five ounces - only sixteen ounces nine penny-weights were kept, and I believe the rest of the six hundred and fifty-five ounces were returned - I was four or five hours examining it at Goldsmiths' Hall; I had a glass - the plate was full of dirt with the polishing powder; it took some time to clean it out.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any of that cleaned out by the shopman while you were searching? A. They cleaned out two or three, but I said we had better take it to the hall, where we could do it more effectually - I do not remember Miles thinking some was forged that I thought not.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you remember Miles, or somebody saying,"It is all forged," and your saying, "Oh! you know nothing about it?" A. I never said such a thing; I don't call it to my mind - there was no difference of opinion on the subject of forged marks being on some of it - I did not consult with them upon it - I have no recollection of any difference of opinion about it - every piece was examined to the best of my knowledge; I don't think I missed any - I did not examine the whole with a glass, where I did not see it required a glass.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could any person commonly conversant with the company's mark be able to discover it was not the company's mark? A. It was very well done, a portion of it; the public would be deceived, but silversmiths would be able to detect it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Some of it is indifferently done; is it in the letter S, the leopard's-head, or the lion passant? A. The general character of the mark altogether is indifferently done; the whole of it.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You have said there was no difference of opinion among your gentlemen at the Hall about the forgery? A. No - I had no conversation with them on it, at the time I examined the plate, a considerable delay was occasioned by dirt being inserted - the public could could not see the mark - they could not discover it.</p>

            . I am assay master at Goldsmiths'-hall. I accompanied the officers, Cope and Forrester, to Mr. Savory's shop, on the 23rd of August, last; we had a search warrant; we seized about thirty ounces of plate, I have it here (produced); I have no account of the exact quantity; I signed a book for it; here are four tea-spoons, and six butter-ladles; we seized about twenty-seven ounces, on the 23rd of August, according to my signature, the four tea-spoons, and six butter-ladles are about fifteen ounces - I examined the twenty-seven ounces, with a view to ascertain whether the marks were forged - the four tea-spoons, and six butter-ladles have forged marks - the remainder of the twenty-seven ounces had genuine marks - I went the next day, the 24th, with Mr. Smith, and Mr. Richards, an officer belonging to the company; I left Smith and Richards there, and went away; I had other business to attend to; what took place I cannot tell.</p>

            . Q. At what time of the day did you go on the 23rd? A. Between four and five o'clock; I found four young men in the shop; I went with a warrant accompanied by the City Marshall, and one of the City officers; I cannot say whether I asked for Mr. Savory - I heard that Mr. Savory was either at Hastings or Brighton - I recollect one of the young men writing him a letter, Mr. Cope read it - two officers were there, Cope and Forrester - Mr. Lane was not there, nor Mr. Prideaus - there was somebody else there, who I don't know - I did not hear the letter read - we did not look at all the plate in the shop, for we came home, the shop was so extremely small, and it was dusk - customers constantly coming in kept the shop in confusion - I did not ask for the work of Treen - I don't recollect it - nobody asked for it in my hearing that I remember - I looked over one or two articles of plate - we looked over a very small portion of plate that evening - the young men in the shop assisted to clean out the marks in the shop - I did not take the plate to another shop which was more light - the plate was taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170070"/>on Saturday - we went over to another shop on the second day, to see if the plate could be examined there, but it was taken to the hall - I was there about an hour the first day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your business as assay master to ascertain the quality of the silver? A. Yes - I do not put on the stamp; somebody in our office does - when I have ascertained the plate is proper quality according to law, I give permission for the stamp to be put on - I have been assay master for about twelve years - I have not been constantly in the habit of examining the marks - I now and then look at a mark, but it is not my business to look at the marks.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your business is to see that the quality is right, you have nothing to do with the marks? A. No.</p>

            . Q. I thought you were sent to examine, because you knew the forgery? A. If there was any mark I had a doubt upon, I should refer it to the engraver - I cannot say why I was sent - I was ordered by the warden to accompany Mr. Cope - I have been examined here before on this question, and called to give evidence about stamps - I have no recollection of making any mistake about about any - this is my signature in this book, I signed it on the 23rd of August - it is a true entry of the articles we took away - (reads) - "four shell deserts, six fiddle sauce, six teas, two mustards, one salt,"(that means salt spoon) and here is something about another salt, with K. P. before it - I don't know what it means.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it mean king's pattern? A. Yes, that is it - they make altogether twenty-seven ounces - I took them away on inspection that night suspecting these marks to be all forged - they were shown to the engraver next day - I was confident part were forged, of the other part I was not certain - I produce six sauce, and four tea now, as forged - I took altogether twenty articles - I took six teas- I said in the shop that I was not certain about them, but I should take them - I expressed that opinion in the shop - we could not take the whole there was such an immense quantity - I found it quite impossible to go through it myself, and proposed to Cope to secure the shop, so that nothing could be removed, and next morning I would send somebody down - I don't know that a padlock was put on the door - I left that to Mr. Cope - I have not returned the two teas, &amp;c., they are at the hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that neither at the first or second search any inquiry was made about Treen's workmanship? A. I don't remember it; I remember seeing some of Treen's work.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you know it was Treen's unless his name was mentioned, you would only see that by the initials? A. That was what I knew it by, they corresponded with some spoons I have before seen from Savory's - I have no recollection of asking for Treen's workmanship.</p>

            . Q. Were you never there with Mr. Lane? A. Never; nor any of his clerks - Mr. Prideaux was never there with me - I went next day, I think, between nine and ten o'clock; I think I had shewn the twenty-seven ounces to Mr. Smith, in the mean time; the whole of them - when I went next day, I still found it was too dark in the shop - I found the shop extremely small, and we could not go over the stock - I took the engraver; we had not time to take him the first day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went next day was any proposal made by persons in the shop, to go to another shop, as there would be better light to examine? A. Yes: we went over to see the shop, and there were so many workmen there; we thought it best to go to Goldsmiths' Hall, and the plate was taken there - we only took the spoons; we did not take the other articles of plate at all, at that time - I had looked at two or three articles the day before; the spoons were the only things I suspected - I did not know Treen at that time; it was not in consequence of information that I received about Treen, that I suspected the spoons - I never heard Treen's name till after I made the search - The practice is for plate to be carried to the hall and examined, and stamped, and returned to the workmen to finish - it is brought to me before it is finished and the duties are paid.</p>
               <p>Q. When you put the stamp on, if the plate is rather thin it sometimes puts it out of shape, does it not? A. Not much in spoons; it puts it out of shape a little, and they must be beat again to get the shape back, and that is after the duty is paid - the duty is paid by the workman he sends the plate with two notes; the duty and the price of marking - the money is received by the clerks in the office; it is put into the bag with the work - it is always the practice to put the money into the bag - the plate is first weighed and ascertained to be correct, then the duty is taken out of the bag; then the plate is tied up again in the bag after it is marked - it is not sealed - that is the invariable rule - if you sent a bag of large table spoons, and a bag of small tea spoons in a separate bag, with your mark on it, they would both he returned on the same day, if they are both sent at the same time - the bag must be brought before nine o'clock; the office is open from eight to nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I put the case of a man sending a large bag and a small bag, before nine o'clock, he receives them back the same day? A. Yes; if a man sent two bags of large work, we should not take it in; we only take in one bag with large work.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If the same man sends two bags of the same kind of work, you do not take them in? A. No; we should compel him to put them into one bag, as it would occasion so much confusion in the office - they may bring half a dozen bags so that they send a note of them all in one weight; if there are three or four bags, if those bags are all included in one weight; they must send one note with the whole weight.</p>

            . Q. Did you examine the mass of plate which was taken the second day to Goldsmiths' Hall? A. No; I was before the Lord Mayor; Mr. Savory came before the Lord Mayor - I have not stamped any plate myself for fourteen years - I have formerly stamped a good deal; I stamped it for about four years, at the Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your attention must be drawn to the stamp<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170071"/>ing? A. Yes; It is my duty to assay - in stamping, a stamp may be made too light; never too strong - I have not known instances of it being sent to be marked over again generally when we discover it is marked too slightly, we mark it again without it being sent - I have known instances of workmen bringing the plate back to be marked properly - I have known instances of plate being imperfectly marked, and being sent back to be marked stronger - the initials of each workman of plate, are kept in a book - when he bring plate to be stamped; the quantity is entered, but not by me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The plate being stamped, is entered in a book? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. That book is regularly kept from day to day? A. Yes; the man's name is entered, the weight of the work, and what he pays - after a man has entered his name, we can by reference to the books, find out the day that man came to have plate stamped - an allowance of 3d. an ounce is deducted from the 1s. 6d. duty - the money comes in the bag with the work - the workman sends the exact money, deducting the one-sixth - he sends but 1s. 3d. an ounce.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have been asked when the stamp is made on thin materials, whether it bulges on the other side, and you say it is hammered then? A. Yes, it is hammered; I am not a manufacturer and I cannot say whether it is filed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do I understand you, that after the stamp is put on, it is hammered to get it all right again, if imperfect? A. Yes; it is done by the manufacturer; not at the office.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have been asked if you examined principally spoons; your suspicion being directed to them - did you also examine some of the large massy articles of plate? A. I did; tea pots and sugar basins - I found no forged marks on the larger articles, (producing some spoons) - the initials on these articles are 
               <persName id="t18331017-125-person1186">R. H. </persName>
            (six forks, two butter knives and a salt spoon produced) these are also forged marks.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is this part of the general mass, or of the twenty-seven ounces? A. Part of the general mass.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have been asked about plate being brought in an unfinished state to receive the various marks, and then taken back to be finished; are those articles of plate brought to receive the genuine marks of the Company? A. Yes; it is completely finished, except polishing - If I found on plate produced by a manufacturer, marks at all resembling thesa, I certainly should not take it in.</p>
               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. Did you go to White-lion-court to make any search? A. Yes - not as one of the places Mr. Savory manufactured at - there was no manufactory there at all - I went to search a warehouse of his there on the 24th - I did not search there; I was there about a quarter of an hour; I left Mr. Smith there - nothing was brought from there that I know of - I did not go to his warehouse in Myrtle-street, Hoxton - I saw a board in his shop with Myrtle-street, Hoxton, written on it - I had no warrant to search that place, nor was that place entered in Mr. Savory's name - I always understood it to be entered in the name of Hillham - I supposed the warehouse in White-lion-court to be in the name of Hillham; our books don't enter the place of manufactory, but the place of abode - I have Richard Hillham entered - it was not known that Mr. Savory carried on a wholesale business under the firm of

               <p>JEREMIAH FULLER. I am one of the assayers of the Goldsmiths' Company. I have the book in which the entries are made of the different manufacturers, (produced) Savory has entered his name as "Thomas Cox Savory, plate-worker, 54, Cornhill" - I find no reference there to a place called Myrtle-street - there is no R. H. in my book to correspond with the R. H. on this fork - we have some R. H.'s in our books, but they don't correspond with that - there are smaller and larger letters, but none of this size - none with a punch which would produce this impression - when they enter their name they produce a punch, and we take the impression ourselves; and this R. H. does not correspond with any impression in our books.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q. Is that the book in which all the names of the persons are kept? A.

            . In August last I was in a situation in Mr. Savory's shop, No. 54, Cornhill, - I have served him from the 27th of April, in this year, to the present time; In April, Treen was one of the workmen - I did not know where Treen lived - Treen came occasionally for his work, and occasionally sent his man, Cook - I knew him by his coming, and knew Cook by his being sent - Treen continued to be employed, more or less, from April; he was discharged at the end of July - I heard of it - I did not know the cause of it - I remember Cook coming to claim a balance of 3l., about the middle of July; he received 2l. less than the money he asked for - he had brought in a bill - he was employed two or three days after that happened; I am not sure how he was finally discharged - when work came from Treen in his name, or by Cook, the bill was handed to Mr. Savory - when the work came home a bill was brought with it - to the best of my belief, in all the instances of plate being brought from Treen, that I know of, he was paid as usual, the duty, the price of manufacture, and had the weight of metal returned; Treen and Cook always brought an account to the shop when they brought work - other men worked for Mr. Savory - when Treen or Cook produced a bill, Warboys made an entry of it - he was paid according to Warboys' direction - he would be paid by a cheque, for the silver, on Sorrell, the refiner, and cash for the fashion of the goods and duty; the cheque would be for the quantity of silver to be returned; that was the constant course of business during the time I was there; it was so with Cook as well as Treen - Cook was considered a workman of Treen's - Treen's notes were chiefly preserved; I believe this to be one of Treen's notes for the month of April,(looking at it) - I know Treen's writing - I have always seen the man when he received the notes for silver, and money for duty, mark it on the bill which he brought; this one has

            's writing, there is a charge for duty in the bill - it was an invariable practice at Mr. Savory's, that in every ticket brought there was a charge for the duty, and, as far as I am able to judge, the amount of the charge both for duty and work was paid - between April and July I might have witnessed the mode of payment for work done once or twice a week - I never knew any instance to the contrary - I never knew a deduction of a farthing for the duty - it was sometimes Warboys' duty to keep the bills - four young men were employed in the shop - Mr. Savory was at Hastings at the time the search warrant came - the officers first came on Friday; I was there when they came in, about five o'clock, on the 23rd of August, it was twilight - I should say it is a darker shop then ordinary - Mr. Cope, the marshall, George Miles, Daniel Forrester, and, I rather think, a gentleman named Prideaux, came with the search warrant; Mr. Prideaux was a clerk of Mr. Lane, attached I believe to the Goldsmiths' Company; Mr. Cope said he had a warrant to search the premises, I answered for Mr. Savory; Treen's name was mentioned; either Mr. Miles or Prideaux introduced the name of Treen; I am quite certain Mr. Miles was present when Treen's name was mentioned; he said they were searching for Treen's work; Miles or Prideaux said that, one or the other, and I am sure in Miles's hearing; one of them said it was only Treen's work they were searching for; we collected what work we saw of Treen's, and it was handed to Miles I believe; I said it was better to collect it ourselves, and show it them; I collected what I believed to be Treen's work, and produced it; the only criterion by which I judged of Treen's work, was the mark of W. T. on it; Miles said to his own party I consider that it is forged - they went away and took 27 ounces of silver, that evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Was anything mentioned about your making search after Cook, Treen, and Bates? A. Yes; it was by Mr. Prideaux, he mentioned Treen more particularly, I should say Treen more certainly; Mr. Prideaux asked where Treen lived, Warboys answered it was in Essex-street, Battle-bridge; they asked who worked for Treen, and was answered a person named Cook; it was described where he lived to Forrester, the officer, by Warboys - Warboys offered to go and point out the residence of Treen, and also his person that evening, after business was over; the same offer was made with regard to Cook - they accepted the offer - I believe Warboys went, but not to my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, at the time of the search, both the first day and the second, was every facility given to make it effective, and were all papers and books produced? A. Most certainly it was; I thought it most prudent so to do - the book containing Treen's account was examined on the Saturday - when Miles came on Saturday, and asked to see the books, I asked if his warrant would authorize him to see them, he said it authorized him to do anything; I said I doubted it, but produced them, and he took extracts from them, or a person with him did so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170073"/>- they did not then ask me about any place in White Lion-court - the first time they came I believe inquiry was made where Mr. Savory was, and I told them he was at Hastings, he went on the Saturday before; I said something about writing to him to apprize him of what was passing; they allowed it as a favour; Mr. Prideaux said he granted it as a favour, I shewed him the letter - I have not looked at the six spoons, the subject of this indictment, since the purchase,(looking at them) - I remember a gentleman coming on the 21st of August, and asking for six spoons, Warboys was in the shop, engaged with a customer, Hillham, and the clerk, Metcalf; I served Mr. Cox myself, for the shopman was engaged; Mr. Cox asked for some spoons, he mentioned no particular pattern, I served him with six spoons; I cannot swear that these are the six spoons - a gentleman came afterwards, and said he came from a gentleman who had bought six spoons in the morning, and paid 2l. for them; he wished six similar to them, they must be exactly to match; I supplied him with six; I don't know whether they were the same workman's make; I told him if he did not like them, as to pattern or anything, they would be changed; I had no reason whatever to believe the duty had not been paid on those spoons; I had not the least suspicion that the marks were forged - an invoice was made for the two lots that we sold in the morning and afternoon - when the marks were to be investigated, I assisted in cleaning them, to facilitate the detection of forgery, if there was any.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Mr. Savory was in the country? A. He was, and he left me there as assistant - Mr. Cox did not ask me for six more spoons when he bought the six, to my recollection; the duty is 1s. 6d. an ounce on spoons - we do not charge the duty separate from the rest; we charge so much an ounce - we sell tea spoons at 7s. 8d. an ounce, including all the shopkeeper's expences - 7s. 2d. was not paid for these; we have a paper in the window which intimates we sell spoons at 7s. 2d. - that only alludes to tables spoons and dessert spoons.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you sell these spoons for 7s. 8d.? A. I believe I did, if I did otherwise it must be a mistake.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Is that the price you usually charge for tea spoons? A. It is, and 7s. 2d. for dessert spoons, and table spoons, and forks.</p>
               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. Is this the paper which is put in your window? A. It is a printed paper like this; a paper of prices.</p>
               <p>This paper was here read, stating fiddle pattern spoons, dessert and table spoons at 7s. 2d. an ounce, and tea spoons at 7s. 8d., &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Witness. I gave an invoice in writing to the last lot, in which I included the first - according to my belief I charged 7s. 8d.</p>

            . I was in the service of Mr. Savory about three weeks since; I had been in his service about seven months - I came to him about February last; I had been in the same line of business before, about seven years, serving as shopman, more or less - I was in the habit of selling plate, and mostly receiving it from workmen - I knew a workman named Treen, employed by Mr. Savory.</p>
               <p>COURT to DURHAM. Q. Looking at those spoons, is there any thing about them that would strike you that they were forged marks? A. No, sir; on now looking at them and examining them, I should not be able to discover they were forged impressions - I do not consider myself a sufficient judge; I have been in the employment nearly four months.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Look at the W. T. on that, is there nothing remarkable on that? A. There is nothing to excite my suspicions; it is partially defaced in every instance - I have seen that often in other spoons with other marks.</p>

             re-examined. I have been nearly seven years in the trade with different persons - I know that Treen worked for Mr. Savory, who purchased plate of him - Treen was what is called a "Little Master;" that name is known among the trade as "Little Masters" who work themselves, and sell plate to silversmiths - I in general received Treen's work from Cook; I never knew him bring plate without a bill - (looking at some bills) - these are a mass of his bills of parcels - they were made out in general in the same form - the number of ounces are always specified, and the charge for duty and workmanship - we paid him with money for workmanship and duty, and gave him a cheque on the refiner for silver he brought, and the duty was paid with the workmanship - here is a bill of parcels, "8th July, six fiddle butter ladles" - (looking at some) - I cannot say these are the six; I can only say they are Treen's make - at the time we received the orders for these, we had no other in the house - I wrote a twopenny post letter to him for them - I ordered six; the charge in the bill of parcels, dated the 8th of July is, "Mr. Savory, to William Treen, six fiddle butter ladles, 8s. 6d. - weight twelve ounces, duty 18s. 7d., making 1l. 7s. 1d." the whole amount - the amount of silver is twelve ounces, and eight pennyweights - this is a cheque on Surrell the refiner, which was given to him for the silver - I did not see it written - it is Durham's writing, dated the 8th of July.</p>

             re-examined. I can undertake to say, that the duty was paid, as well as the making - I should say these tea-spoons which Mr. Cox bought, are Treen's make - I cannot say they are the spoons Mr. Cox bought - at the time they were bought, I was serving another customer; we have had a quantity of tea-spoons of Treen, several times; it was an invariable rule to pay him a cheque for the silver on the refiner - and cash, for the duty and make; I never knew of the least variation from that rule - I should not know any of those stamps to be forged; if Treen had brought these spoons to me, and I had no previous suspicion of the man, there is nothing to induce me to look at them narrowly, to suspect they were wrong - I do not know how long Mr. Savory has been in the trade; there are ten bills of parcels here, some in Cook's name, and some in Treen's; they are the bills we received from Treen - this one is Cook's writing; he mostly brought the work - Treen very rarely brought work; generally Cook - I cannot tell distinctly, what was the last date of any work paid to Treen, but it was about the latter end of July - (looking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170074"/>at a cheque) this cheque is in Mr. Savory's hand-writing - the invoice of this transaction is not here (looking at another paper) the writing below here, is by Mr. Savory, it is dated the 10th of July; (looking at two other cheques) one of these cheques is my own hand-writing, signed by Mr. Savory; the date of that is July, the 19th, and the other, July the 20th; I do not know of any transaction with Treen after that date - to the best of my recollection, that was the last - Treen was dismissed - a note was sent to him; I did not carry it; that was about the 21st or 22nd of July; I remember his coming afterwards, and Mr. Savory refused to deal with him; during the whole seven months I was with Mr. Savory, I have known of his paying the silver, the fashion, and duty, to Treen or Cook - in every transaction; this was done sometimes three times a week - he manufactured a great deal of plate for Mr. Savory - I never noticed the difference between what we had from Myrtle-street, and what we had from Treen - Treen made a good many spoons for Mr. Savory - Mr. Savory had a wholesale trade as well as retail; the wholesale trade was carried on in the name of Richard Hillham; the spoons were marked in that name, 
               <persName id="t18331017-125-person1200">R. H. </persName>

               <persName id="t18331017-125-person1201">T. C. S. </persName>
            - we sometimes got goods from the wholesale manufactory for the retail shop; sometimes we have goods marked R. H. in the shop - goods for the wholesale shop were all marked R. H. to my knowledge - I recollect the circumstance of Treen's marking his own goods W. T.; several quantities were bought of him with his own mark on them - Treen had some in his possession at one time marked R. H.; I don't know how he got the mark; I don't know when he gave it up; he brought spoons in marked 
               <persName id="t18331017-125-person1202">R. H. </persName>
            - I recollect the circumstance of Cook bringing the mark, and giving it up to Mr. Savory, and after that the spoons were marked "W. T." - Mr. Savory carries on a considerable business; his country business was considerable, as well as his town, when I first lived with him - I cannot say how much he pays for duty in the course of a year, but it is to a very large amount; he has a very large stock of plate - the duty was paid on all the tea spoons that I know of; according to my belief, there was not one on which the duty was not paid - no deduction was made of the 3d.; all the little masters he dealt with were paid the full amount of duty, without deducting the 3d.; whatever they were paid for workmanship they had 3d. an ounce besides.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have been seven years in the trade? A. About seven years - I have not yet been able to discover a forgery from a genuine mark - I never said so to my knowledge; I never said to that gentleman that I could detect the forgery - I cannot say that I ever told him I knew that these spoons were wrong; not to my knowledge - I was not shewn them to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear this gentleman never shewed you any of the plate in question? A. I saw half a dozen spoons at the hall - I don't know the day, but it was last week to my knowledge - I went to the hall last week; they shewed me half a dozen table or dessert spoons; I think table spoons - the gentleman at the time, Mr. Prideaux I believe, said the hall did not intend to shew any plate, besides that the indictment was laid on, and he showed us half a dozen table spoons; not these six- I cannot say that this gentleman ever shewed me any plate at the hall, at any other time, nor in Mr. Savory's shop - I never told him that I knew there was something wrong about the spoons - it is about three weeks since I left Mr. Savory; I am still on terms of friendship with him; I have no reason to complain of his conduct; I was with him last Saturday evening; I staid perhaps three hours; I left home about a quarter after eight o'clock; it took about half an hour to go there, and I left Mr. Savory's it might be about half-past one o'clock- I was not in his company at all yesterday afternoon; I was in his company in the evening, about five minutes - I was before the Lord Mayor, but I was not called I don't think these invoices were produced before the Lord Mayor, in my presence.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray what was it you said about Treen; you say he was dismissed by Mr. Savory, had Mr. Savory and he several little misunderstandings, which they made up afterwards? A. The transaction I recollect was Treen had twenty-eight ounces of silver more then was due to him - Mr. Savory had given him some silver, and at the same time a cheque on the refiner, and about three days afterwards Cook called, and said Hawkins had ran away with the silver - there were only two misunderstandings to my knowledge - I have seen Cook here to-day; he brought Treen's work home - I saw Hillham last night, at Mr. Hargraves, Bishopsgate-street; there is nothing to prevent his being a witness - Mr. Savory had desired Treen to give up the stamp with 
               <persName id="t18331017-125-person1203">R. H. </persName>
            on it; I am not aware of the reason, I was not there at the time; I heard from Mr. Savory that he desired him to give it up; he did not state his reasons for desiring it - the only recollection I have of it is, Mr. Savory said, he thought for the future he would have Treen mark his own work in his own name, and give up the R. H. stamp - Mr. Savory is acquainted with Hillham.</p>
               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. Did you assist in keeping the books? A. I did; the wholesale trade was carried on in the name of Hillhan.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Hillhan to your knowledge is not very ill to day, is he? A. Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. Cook is the same man as the prosecutors examined on Saturday? A. He is; the two misunderstandings I alluded to were, Cook came one afternoon, or Treen, and there was nearly a new bag lying in the shop; he took that and left his own behind him; the person belonging to it came, and Mr. Savory said, he did not like the appearance of it, and sent one of our lads immediately down to Treen for it, and it was brought back again; that was one misunderstanding; I do not know when that happened; it was soon after I came - the next was, he brought some work, and it was about Mr. Savory's time to leave town for Peckham; Mr. Savory asked him what it was; he said, 3l., and it was only 1l.; that was Cook; Mr. Savory disapproved of that; those are the misunderstandings - I assisted in taking up Cook; Mr. Prideaux asked if I knew where Cook lived; I said, I knew where he used to live, and if he would meet me after I left the shop, and would go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170075"/>with me, I would show him - Forrester asked me the name of the street; I said, "Edward or Edmund-street;" I went with him - there was a person named Bates apprehended; I apprehended that man likewise, he had been in Treen's service - Leadbetter the officer was present at the time; I was where Mr. Savory was some hours on Saturday night; it was not with him; I did not inquire whether he was gone to bed; I was called on to look over the accounts of Treen, to see what I knew of the transaction, in order that there might be instructions given to counsel - I do not think I saw Mr. Savory all the evening - Mr. Savory was very punctual and exact in business; he dealt mostly for ready money, and paid ready money in most transactions.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live in Castle-street, City-road. I have considerable transactions with silver articles; I have known Mr. Savory about ten years; six years in business for himself; he bears the character of a person of the strictest integrity - from my knowledge of him he would not for the sake of gain commit a fraud - I have found him strict in small matters, such as correcting errors made by our clerks - on looking at this plate with the naked eye I should not detect anything wrong here; I should say even looking at it with this magnifying glass it is almost impossible - the work is so battered it would have to be replaced in its original shape; the leopard's head is so stretched - I might take up a dozen articles coming from the hall, and there would be a visible difference - I should not be able to judge whether it is a genuine or forged impression - it is my business to manufacture the patent pencils; I employ about fifty men in the trade.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I think you say, it has been so battered to make the impression, that to bring the spoon back to its proper shape, the spoon becomes defaced. A. It is; the French do not cut so deep as we do here - you are obliged to beat it to get it back to the share; it is battered in receiving the stamps at Goldsmiths' Hall.</p>

Yes; that transaction was done honestly - I cannot answer whether the prisoner might have furnished a person with the receipt in my name, thinking he had authority to do so - I never sent more than one person for the money; nobody else called by my authority - I authorised the prisoner to call for it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the Sodawater concern did not belong to the prosecutor, whose name was only printed on the door, in order that the business might be kept from the creditors of Davis, his son-in-law, who was in Whitecross-street prison, for debt, and that he was never in the prosecutor's service.</p>

               <p>Q. Being employed by you, if he had paid the money, and said, he had given a receipt in your name, should you have complained? A. I cannot answer the question; I should not have wished him to have signed my name; I have sent him to collect money, not on account of Davis - Davis is not interested in the business; this was for lead - nobody was interested in that business but myself - I have received money from the prisoner in my lead business - I don't know whether he gave a receipt in my name on that occasion; I have not heard; he no doubt gave a receipt - he paid me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Now if he had paid you this money, should you have considered he exceeded his authority, in giving a receipt for that money? A. If he signed my name, I should certainly think he had; I never knew an instance of a person signing the name of his principal, and handing the money over - I always considered it should be with the additional signature of the party himself - it should be signed "for

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARNOLD. Q. Had he been out of your service before you made the charge? A. He was in my employ up to the Tuesday night, when I discovered he had received Wood's money - I had not dismissed him from my service before - I did not ask the prisoner to come into my service - he had met me in the street some months previous, and asked me if I could give him a situation; I said, I was full, and had no place for him, and while I laid ill, one of my clerks engaged him - I did not know that he was in the service of Abrahams, another attorney - he came to me; he did not tell me that he was in Abrahams' service, and must give him a week's notice before he could leave - he called on me on a Saturday evening, and wanted to know what salary I would give him, and I told him - I took him without a character.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe in the course of his employment you have trusted him with considerable sums of money? A. To the amount of about 20l. at a time - I always found him act faithfully - I should not think I have trusted him with 30l. or 40l. - I have sent him out to get cheques cashed; he has gone to my tradesmen I believe, and got the amount for cheques; I cannot say that I was in the habit of giving him cheques - he may have had 35l. at a time - Fuller had not complained to me of neglecting his business, for unfortunately almost immediately after I became employed for him, I was confined to the house very much<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170077"/>through an accident - I should say his business was got through in the Insolvent Court with the usual quickness; he never complained to me, for I think I saw him but twice; I never received such a message from him by one of my clerks - I never knew he was dissatisfied - I was to pay the prisoner 1l. 5s. a week; he attended from nine o'clock in the morning until eight o'clock in the evening in the vacation, and from nine to nine in term; out of which he was allowed two hours for dinner; he did not work beyond those hours in the office certainly, never for me, to my knowledge; I have never paid him for any extra work he has done; I never paid him two shillings for two extra hours; not for engrossing a schedule of James Cooper to my recollection; I will positively swear I never did, nor ever for any extra work.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you allow him to retain for his own use, sums received from clients? A. I believe he said he kept back two shillings one week, for sums he said he had paid to the crier of the prison.</p>

               <p>Re-examined. I did not say when he entered my service "My hours are so and so - I never require my clerk to attend beyond that hour, or if I do I pay him for it."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever promise the prisoner to give him something extra, in consequence of his staying one hour at dinner instead of two? A. I swear most positively he took on several occasions three hours instead of two, and came back drunk, and I threatened to discharge him; I never promised to make it up to him for staying only one hour - I did not promise him five shillings for every case he brought to my office; nothing of the kind; nor did he ever get a case while he was with me - I owe him two days' wages now, which is the Monday and Tuesday - I have subpoened Fuller here; he has come up from Harwich - I have not given him an undertaking to pay him something for coming up to give evidence; he was not up here to find the bill, and I wrote to him that his recognizance would be estreated.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You employed Mr. Norton as your attorney? A. I did; I saw him about twice - I generally saw the prisoner - I gave him the 2l. for the expense of getting through the court; I did not take any acknowledgment from him - it was not for the express purpose of employing counsel; I did not tell him to go himself and get counsel for me; I told him I expected Mr. Norton would do my business and find counsel - I had an agreement with Mr. Norton to do my business for a certain sum; I said I expected Mr. Norton to find counsel for that amount - Drew gave me an undertaking; it was given me by Drew about the time I paid him the money; this is it (producing it); I received this from him in consequence of paying him the 2l.; I took the undertaking, thinking he was doing it for Mr. Norton; I never told him not to pay the money over to Mr. Norton; I never said such a word - I certainly complained of Mr. Norton's neglecting my business, because I could get nothing done - I was delayed, and kept there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did you not tell the prisoner not to give the money to Norton, for he had neglected you, and you would not employ him any longer? A. No, I did not; the money was paid when I first had the dealing - when I told Drew to bring the books, and I would have nothing more to do with Mr. Norton, was five or six weeks after I had paid the money; I did not complain of him at the time I paid the money - counsel was to be employed in case there was opposition - it was to be done for the amount I agreed with Mr. Norton for - it was part of the original agreement with Norton to supply me with counsel for the whole sum I was to pay him; it was not to be a specific charge afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was £5. the sum you were to pay Norton? A. That was the agreement; I understood from Mr. Norton, that he had declined coming to see me because he understood I had not advanced any money, and I sent him word that I had given his clerk £2.; the prisoner did not deny it - after Mr. Norton found the money had been kept back by the prisoner, he acted for me, and did my business as well as he could.</p>
               <p>MR. ARNOLD. Q. You mean distinctly to say, he was to employ counsel and every other thing for £5.? A. Yes; that was the agreement - I have not been heard before the court - I have been in prison since the 9th of July - this money being kept back, has thrown me back a month.</p>

I believe it is a custom for attorneys clerks to treat prisoners in the prison, when they go to solicit business - he had no demand on me whatever, on the score of treating prisoners; I never authorised him to treat persons with a view to get their business - I never allowed him to deduct in a case, what he spent in treating - he was only my clerk, and was sent by me to the prison for particular reasons - I know in the insolvent court, prisoners are treated, but not by me - it never was done, and that I can swear.</p>
               <p>The prisoner being called on for his defence, made a long and unconnected address to the court, the substance of which was as follows:- That by an order of the Insolvent Debtor's Court, the attorneys were bound to register the names of their clerks in the books of that court, which the prosecutor not having done, the prisoner could not be considered as his clerk. That the prosecutor was in his debt for having treated different inmates of the prison; also 5s. for every insolvent case that he obtained, and for having worked over hours. That he did not conceive he was bound to pay the 17s. 6d. over to the prosecutor, inasmuch as it was given to him to pay into court. That the 2l. was paid him for the express purpose of employing counsel if requisite, and being himself answerable for the money, he did not think it right to give it over to the prosecutor, and that he had incurred a greater expense in obtaining business in the prison, the prosecutor having got into great disrepute there, through neglecting his client's business, and there was now an indictment against him for perjury.</p>

            . I am an officer. Mr. Norton gave the prisoner into my custody - he said he had a demand against the prosecutor for extra services done - he did not say he had laid out money on the prosecutor's account - he did not produce a bill till the second examination - in the first instances, he said it was for services done.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WOOD (re-examined). When I paid the prisoner the last sovereign, I had an undertaking from him that counsel should be employed if requisite - it formed a part of the payment of 5l. - it was all to be included in the 5l. he was to pay it over to his employer.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you distinctly understand he was to give the 2l. over to his employer; or was he himself to find counsel? A. He was to give it to his employer, who was to find counsel.</p>

               <p>MESSRS. BODKIN and LEE conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>CHARLES PELL. I am a clerk in the banking-house of Sir John William Lubbock, Bart., and three others, in Mansion-house-street. I recollect this cheque being presented on the 31st of August, and I paid the amount mentioned in it myself, £348; I paid a £200 note, No. 3556; a £100 note, No. 4639; a £40 note, No. 16,904; and a £5 note, 2662; and 3l. in money - the cheque was presented by a man I believe, but I don't recollect - I have not got the dates of the notes - I should think it was between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. On looking at the cheque are you able to say it is one of the cheques, which is generally in the books delivered to your customers? A. It is; when we deliver books to our customers there are no two alike, delivered from our house - the same number of cheques is inserted, but not the same letter - the number and initial of the particular customer is entered into a book kept for that purpose - the number and initial on this cheque is the numbers and intitial of the prosecutor's cheques; he keeps cash at our house; forty-eight cheques were in the book delivered out to Mr. Dutton; (looking at the book,) this is the book issued by the firm to Mr. Dutton, containing forty eight cheques - it bears the number and initial of which I have spoken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is the initial and number marked on every cheque here, or only on the book? A. On every cheque - I don't give the books out myself, any of the cashiers give them out.</p>

            . I am a paper-maker, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170079"/>live at Bermondsey. I am a friend to Mr. Dutton, and frequently assist him in his cash transactions - he needed assistance in filling up cheques, being infirm - I know this is the cheque book which he had - I have understood that the prisoner who was in his service, occasionally filled up cheques for him - I have not seen him do it; I have seen the prisoner write, (looking at the body of some cheques,) there are twelve of these; I cannot speak to every one of them, but to many of them I can; I can only speak to the best of my belief, that the body of them is in his hand writing; not the signature; I don't know whose hand-writing the others are; many of these are in my hand-writing, but not all; the three first are mine; I may trace the similarity; I believe the name "Mr. Walker" on the cheque in question, to be the prisoner's hand-writing - I was present when the prisoner was dismissed from Mr. Dutton's service, on the 23rd of August - he left the service that evening; Mr. Dutton's brother paid him his wages in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What were you to Mr. Dutton? A. A friend of his in business; he has been in business - I was a mere friend of his - I was in business myself; I live at Bermondsey; I often called to see how his health was going on, and on those occasions he has asked me to fill up cheques for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you then a sort of friend who occasionally dropped in and filled up cheques? A. Not exactly so; he was aware of my periodical visits - I have said, "I will call on you in three or four days, or in the course of next week," and if he had occasion for my assistance, he waited till I came - he is in a very prostrate state of health - the cheques I have said are in the prisoner's hand-writing, I mean are in his ordinary hand - that name, "Mr. Walker," is an endeavour at concealment - I consider it bears a strong resemblance to his writing; I consider there is a very strong similarity in the word"Wages" and "Walker" on the cheque in question, and I should say in this cheque there is an "A" very much like it, evidently the same hand, bearing in mind the endeavour at concealment - I consider the same faculty that formed the one formed the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you judge that it is the feigned hand-writing of the prisoner, because of what you suppose to be the general resemblance to the eight cheques? A. Yes; I do mean so - on comparing it with his accounts, and what I saw him write, I suppose it is his - the cheque is an effort at disguise, which I have discovered to be his hand-writing from its similarity to his ordinary handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not that be just as likely to have happened from some other person endeavouring to imitate the prisoner's hand, as if he were endeavouring to disguise it? A. It is not for me to say; I feel it difficult to arrive at any other conclusion than that it is his - Mr. Dutton's housekeeper was not in the habit of filling up cheques to my knowledge - I have seen one or two entered in the margin, as being filled up by other people - I do not like to venture to say these four cheques are the prisoner's writing, so positively as the other eight, because I thought they did not bear so strong a resemblance, but I believe these also to be his hand-writing- I saw the prisoner write on the 23rd of August, when he was paid off, but never before to my recollection; he then wrote in this book, "Wages ill bestowed - (ten guineas) to the fool; debtor £12 - received the above"- I saw him write that; I was at his elbow at the time - that was all I ever saw him write - I did not see him write the "ten guineas," only the two lines; I saw him write it altogether; it is a receipt for his own wages - (looking at the cheque and the book) - I judge these to be both written by the same hand; I have no other means of judging - it is from the similarity that I judge it to be his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. And that a single instance? A. But I am bound to observe, my Lord, the prisoner acknowledged the whole book to be his hand-writing - I compared the book; my knowledge is not formed from comparison of what I saw him write, but by a comparison of the book which I heard him acknowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Look at the "Wa" in the word "Wages." and look at the "Wa" in the word"Walker," and tell us is there the least similarity? A. The "W" is not so much alike as in other places.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is not one stiff straight writing, and the other flourishing? A. Yes; there is a peculiar flourish at the end of the "W" of his own writing - the one is upright, and the other sloping - one sloping, and the other stiff - one with a flourish and the other without.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. And from that dissimilarity you trace the likeness? A. With the reservation I have already stated.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. At the time he wrote that flourishing hand, was he sober or not? A. He was not exactly sober; he has been reported drunk - he was nearly sober, and knew perfectly well what he was about; he appeared to have been taking liquor more than was proper.</p>

I live at Upper Clapton - the prisoner was in my service, to attend on my person; he was in my service twelve months all but one week; he left on the 30th of August - in consequence of infirmity, I am occasionally obliged to have assistance when I draw cheques - the prisoner assisted me on those occasions - I sometimes employed him to fill up the body of cheques when not able myself - I kept my cheques in a drawer of the sideboard - he had access to all parts of the house - my custom is to enter the name and sum in the margin of the cheque - I always filled up my cheques with my name in them; and those who I pay money to I generally enter in the margin - for any large amount I generally have a banker's name written across my cheques; but sometimes with persons requiring small amounts, I did not - this is the cheque-book I had in use during the time the prisoner was in my service; I never counted how many cheques it contained - I have not myself looked at the margin of the cheques - Mr. Turner and my solicitor have examined them - this cheque is not signed by me - I gave no authority to fill up any such cheque; I had no such sum to pay to a man named Walker - I don't know anybody of the name of Walker - I had no such a sum to pay to anybody - I have seen the prisoner write; I do sincerely believe the filling up of the body of this cheque to be his hand-writing - I can say positively it is, as far as I can judge one thing from another; I should swear it is the prisoner's hand-writing to the best of my belief and knowledge - I have often seen him write - I saw these twelve cheques filled up by the prisoner, by my authority - the writing on this paper is not mine; it is very much like it; I saw it before the magistrate - I can positively swear it is not mine; I never saw it till I saw it at the Justice's room; it is a very capital imitation - the prisoner was discharged from my service on the 23rd of August - he gave me warning six weeks before, because I would not take his work, and tired me out; and he said he should want no character, as he was going to live where his wife lived - he gave me no address - Mr. Turner and my brother were there at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The prisoner sometimes filled up cheques for you, did anybody else fill them up? A. Yes; Turner and my brother has occasionally - I think Mr. Norris has done so; and my friend Cane I sometimes used to discount bills for, and he filled them up; that was only in four instances - my housekeeper never filled them up to my knowledge - I never had my name written on a bit of paper when I had my cheques filled up; I put a pen sometimes on a cheque to bend the point down - I never wrote my name on paper before I wrote it on the cheque; my memory is very good though I am so infirm - (looking at two cheques) - the prisoner filled up the first of these two cheques, and my brother the second; that I am sure of - (looking at some more cheques) - Mr. Turner filled up some of these, and Mr. Norris some - I don't see any of the prisoner's filling up here; there is only one of the prisoner's filling up in the whole bundle - I am confident the cheque in question is in the prisoner's hand-writing; the whole of it, name and all, "August the 30th," and everything, though it is disguised - I did not say at the Mansion-house, I could not swear to it; I said it was the prisoner's to the best of my belief - I speak from my own knowledge of his hand-writing - he produced his accounts to me very frequently, and I saw him write when he wrote cheques for me; that is all I have seen of his writing - the name "Walker," is in his usual hand-writing; the "348" is attempted to be disguised; the "August," and the rest, is more like his free writing - I have no doubt of every letter being his hand-writing, from my knowledge of his writing.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL DUTTON. I am the prosecutor's brother, and live at Ludgate-hill; about six weeks before the prisoner left his service, I was there; a complaint was made, and notice was given; I afterwards attended, when his accounts were audited by me - when the prisoner left, he did not tell me where he was going - he said he did not want a character, that he was going to live with his wife, and I think at Lady Hatton's at Harford; he said he was going to live at Harford with his wife - I never saw him write, except at the time he was paid.</p>

            . I am housemaid to Mr, Thomas Dutton; I went into his service on the 25th of June - I remained there till the prisoner left on the 23rd of August; I have seen the prisoner writing: on one occasion in particular - that was a month or five weeks before he left - it was between ten and two o'clock in the day - he was writing on a small piece of paper in the kitchen; there was a knock heard for the porter - he was called up to Mr. Dutton; he took the paper into the back kitchen, and threw it down there - I picked it up, I don't know what has become of it - I threw it down again, not thinking it of any consequence - I have never seen it since; I have been in the room several times since; I have never seen it - I threw it where I picked it up, by the side of the window; it was in a place where it would be swept away; I have not looked to see if it has been swept away, but I am conscious it is not there, for the place is swept twice a week - I have swept it myself all over - I have not seen the paper since; I must have seen it if it had been there - I should know the paper again if I saw it; (looking at a piece torn in half) neither of these is the paper, but the hand-writing is exactly the same; I did not make any observations to him about what I had seen.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did the prisoner ever show you any cheques singed by Mr. Dutton? A. Yes; he made no observations except asking if I was not surprised at the hand-writing being so good; I have heard the prisoner talk of going abroad to America - that was not more than a fortnight before he left; he said he should go to America; the cook said, many people went there with an idea of making a fortune, and found their mistake; he said people did not do as they ought to do, they should go with a little money, which they could do without, and speculate; I have seen the prisoner write several times -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170081"/>I have seen him write different hand-writings; I can form a judgment of some of his writing, and some I can not - I think the W in the name of Walker, in this cheque, is his; I have seen this cheque before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you heard the observation made by any one else? A. No; I have no opinion of any thing more than the W.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The W is the sort of W he usually makes? A. It is the W I have often seen him make, but he makes different ones; I was not before the Lord Mayor, nor a magistrate at all.</p>

               <p>JOHN HANCOCK. I am a printer and engraver, employed by Lubbock and Co., to make their cheque books; this book was made up by me - I made only one of that description - that is there are some with two quires, and some more; this originally contained forty-eight cheques - I see two of them have been pulled out, margin and all - I have not a doubt but this cheque is one of the forty-eight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You are called to show that this is one of the books you supply to bankers? A. Yes; there are two-quire books and three quires, this is one quire; there is only one book of one quire, and the number and letter is the same all through; the E 242 is put on at our house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there different numbers and sizes of your books? A. No; they are sent into the banking-house; and we have one hundred and fifty back to stamp.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you make any other book of this size, marked with E 242? A. No.</p>

            . I live at No. 17, Marylebone-lane. I know the prisoner; I first saw him in July, I believe; I saw him with his wife after she had taken my lodging; he came to my house on the Tuesday, I cannot say the date; he paid me on the Thursday, and came to me on the Tuesday - about the 27th of August was the day he came to me; his wife had taken the lodging before and had left it - he came on the 27th of August, and stopped there a week; he slept at home on the Friday night to the best of my belief, and went out on Saturday morning, the 31st, and came home I think between one and two o'clock in the day; he was lodging in the first floor back room; he left on the Sunday morning, and returned on Monday morning, accompanied by his wife - on the Tuesday morning, about eight o'clock, a cart came to the door - I had no notice of his intention to leave my lodging before that; the cart was brought to receive his goods; I bought some of him, and the rest were taken away; he did not tell me where he was going, I did not ask him; he had before that told me, he should go to America, for he could live better there than he could here- when he came to me the first time he was in a cab; he was dressed to the best of my recollection with black crape round his hat; he said his master was dead, that he had signed a will, but he did not know that he should get anything for his trouble.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you sure it was Saturday, about two o'clock in the afternoon, that he came home? A. Yes; it was a remarkable day, because a lady I serve, went to Colchester that day, and it poured of rain all day - I am confident it was not Friday - he was wet through when he came in.</p>

            . I am the wife of William King; I recollect the prisoner coming to our house on Tuesday, the 27th of August - and on the following Saturday, the 31st, he requested me to light a fire, between two and three o'clock - it was a very wet day, and he was very wet - he went out while I was lighting the fire, and returned - he gave me a japanned box out of his drawer; it was not quite so large as that book, (pointing to one) and about the width of it, and I dare say it was five or six inches deep; he pulled a key out of his pocket, opened it, and showed me what was in it, which was a great many sovereigns - I cannot say how many.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. Was there more than 100? A. I dare say there was, but I cannot say the quantity.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Was the box half full or fuller? A. Not a quarter full; I could not see the bottom of the box when he stirred them about.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the top of the box wide open? A. Yes; he produced it to shew them to me, and he asked me to feel the weight of them, and I did so; they appeared very heavy, and I said to him, "They must be worth something, they are very heavy;" he made no answer at all; he did not say how he got them - I recollect his leaving on Sunday morning, the 1st of September; he said, he was going to fetch his wife home.</p>
               <p>GEORGE COOK. I am coachman to Miss Hatton of Harford.

               <p>DANIEL FORRESTER. I am a police-officer. On the 16th of September, I took the prisoner into custody; I did not tell him the charge - I found him at No. 23, Gill-street, Limehouse, at the house of Thompson - I searched his person, and found on him a purse, and several papers which I took from his pocket, (looking at one) I found this, not on his person but in his room; I took the purse from his pocket; I think there were four pieces and a card, and when I laid down this paper, he snatched it up and crumpled it; I said, "Leave them alone" - I took them from his hand, this is the paper, it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170082"/>was crumpled up - I have inquired at No. 68, Holborn, for a person named Walker.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe when Ward found that these wheels were stolen, that his wife was the means of Arnold being apprehended? A. Yes; she gave him into custody - they were exposed openly at Ward's door for sale - I had had them for twelve months.</p>

             (police-constable T 138). I went to Ward's house and saw these two wheels at the door; I went close to them and saw they had been red before - I went to the prosecutor and took him to the house - I asked Ward where he got them, he said he bought them of John Herbert, in Arlington-street, for half-a-crown - my sergeant took the wheels, and I went to Arlington-street, but there was no John Herbert lived there, nor any wheelwright - I then took Ward to the station-house, and from some information, I went in pursuit of Arnold; on my return, I met my brother-officer with Arnold; I said to him, "I want you for those wheels," he said, "I did not steal them;" when we got to the station-house, Ward said to him, "You are the person I bought the wheels of," he again said, "I did not steal them, I carried them for a man."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know that Arnold went by the name of Herbert? A. Not since I have known him - the officer who took him is ill - I heard that Ward's wife gave Arnold into custody.</p>

I am son-in-law to Ward; he gave me a job to paint the front of his house; I had some paint left, and I painted these wheels with it, as I thought they looked rather scaley - I had no orders to paint them - Mrs. Ward, (who is my mother,) saw Arnold in the street, and she accused him of having sold these wheels to her; he ran his fist in her face, and I went up and took him till the officer came - she said he went by the name of Herbert.</p>

I am a silk-dresser, and live in Eagle-court; I have seen the truck and helped to move goods with the prisoner; he has used it in public; I can swear he had it a length of time before Christmas, and he asked me if I would have the use of it to remove some goods which I bought of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now upon your solemn oath, how many months did he have it before Christmas? A. I cannot challenge my memory, because I never thought of any thing of the kind, but it was a length of time before Christmas - it was a month, or a fortnight, or perhaps a week - I am in the employ of Messrs. Bolton &amp; Meek; the prisoner never told me how he came by the truck - the wheels were taken off because they could not get it in with them on - it must have been about the month of November that he offered me the loan of the truck - it is not now in so good a state as it was at that time - I did not borrow it but he offered it me, as I had bought a bureau of him - I then lived in Windmill-street, Finsbury-square; I said it would be too much trouble for him to get it down, and I hired another instead - I have no truck of my own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought it about three weeks before last Christmas, and had it in regular use as I wanted it.</p>

I am not the person at all - I never saw him till the 24th; and when I was taken there were two other women there, and he said he could not say that either of these were the women. Witness. I had seen her once before, and talked to her, and I saw her come to bed to me that night - I swear she is the woman.</p>

             (police-constable H 178). The prosecutor said he had been robbed of his watch and pencil-case; he described the prisoner - I had seen her four or five days before, but did not know her haunts - on the Tuesday after she was taken, and said she had sold the watch to a man named Smith - my brother officer went and took him - in going to the office, the prisoner said she did not care what she was done to, so long as Smith was liberated.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I never said such a thing; the first time I saw the prosecutor he came up-stairs with two policemen - there were two other women there; the officer asked him if either of those were the women; he said,"No" - I afterwards went down to get a pennyworth of pepper, and one of them said, by the description, I was one of the women - I said I was not, I would go where they pleased.</p>

I know the house at which this happened; I was on duty just by, and about half-past one o'clock, I saw the prisoner run out of the court in a hurry, she seemed to be putting on her bonnet and shawl; I asked what she was going for, she said to fetch some gin - I saw her put her hand to her bosom; I drew it out again, and took this purse from it; I took her to the station-house - in going along she took these two handkerchiefs from her bosom; I then put my hand to the back of her neck, and found this watch there - I then went back to her house, and found the prosecutor locked in the room.</p>

I assisted to take the prisoner to the office; the prisoner asked me how I thought he should get on with this concern; I told him I could not tell, but the prosecutor had owned the knives, which were at the pawnbroker's in Blackfriars-road; he said, "That was all I feared; I suppose I shall be committed; however, I can exonerate my brother, he knows nothing of my transactions."</p>

               <p>Prisoner to MR. WILLETT. Q. How long have you had such knives as these in your possession? A. A year and a half; I have not parted with any - I cannot say that I had all the knives of those patterns: but mine corresponded with them, and the same maker.</p>

             (police-constable S 73). I was on duty at half-past one o'clock that Friday morning; Mr. Smith called me and I went to the house - I found the prisoner in bed and these things about the room - these things were in his hat, and these were under his head - he was perfectly sober - he said at the watch-house that he was in liquor, but he was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I got to the watch-house, this woman said she could not swear I was the man, as there were plenty more in the house. Witness. When I got to the house first, there was no one in the room but the prisoner and the two children; the other persons from the house came in afterwards,</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutrix was not willing to press the charge.</p>
               <p>MARY SMITH. I said, I did wish to press the charge, but I am confident he is the man that committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could any other man have gone into the room, from the time of your children going to bed and the prisoner coming in? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said she could not prove I was the man, and the sergeant said he would put it down on suspicion; and the officer came back and said to the sergeant, "I have made all right, I have told the girl what to say."</p>
               <p>ROBERT ECCLES, I did not say any thing of the kind, I left her to her own free will; the wife was unwilling to press the charge, but I fetched the husband and he pressed it.</p>
               <p>COURT to ANN SMITH. Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man who came and undid the boxes? A. Yes, quite sure; what I have said is all the truth; neither the policeman, nor my mother, nor any one, has told me what to say.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the night of the 12th of October, a person resembling the prisoner Hickford brought a letter which was in the writing of Hinks - I had known Hinks before, and seen his writing several times; he had lived in her ladyship's service, and his wife is there now - I went to the door and took this letter, which is directed to Mrs. Lacey, who is our housekeeper; she is the inventress of some famous fish-sauce; I handed the letter to her - this was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; and about a quarter-past nine o'clock I heard that this writing-desk was missing - I saw it again about four o'clock the next morning.</p>
               <p>Hickford. Q. Did you not say you could not swear to me, but you believed I was not the man? Witness. No; I said I could not swear to you, but I believed you was the man.</p>

               <p>Hickford. She said at Worship-street, she thought it was a shorter man than me. Witness. I said I thought he was a younger man, but his dress and every thing else corresponds; his voice seems very much the same.</p>

I took Hickford into custody on the Monday morning - I asked if he knew a man of the name of Hinks; he said he did, and he had been in his company about eight o'clock on Saturday night - I told him Hinks had committed a robbery, and from the description I had received of a person who was with him, I believed him to be the man - I took him to her ladyship's, and Lacey said, from his appearance and his voice, she believed him to be the man who brought the letter - he said he had taken a letter about three weeks before, and that it was addressed to the cook of the house, who was Hinks' wife - he said he lodged and slept with Hinks, and they worked together as paupers for the parish of St. George - he said Hinks came home that Saturday night and wanted him to go out for a walk, but he had refused, and Hinks then left him.</p>
               <p>Hinks' Defence. I left work at half-past six o'clock with the other prisoner, he went home - when I went home I found him in bed; I went to take a walk, but he would not go, as he said he was tired; I came out, left him in bed, and saw no more of him till we were at the office - I went out and saw a young man who asked me to go and have something to drink; we went and had a glass of liquor; and from that time I recollect nothing that happened till I was in Queen-street; I was then just as if I had awoke from a dream, and found I had the desk - I then lost myself again till I was near Marylebone workhouse; I then took a coach and drove to the public-house - I recollect no more till I was called up on Monday morning - the man I took a walk with was shorter than Hickford.</p>
               <p>Hickford's Defence. I went home to bed; the other prisoner came home and asked me to take a walk, but I declined it; and I saw him no more till I was taken.</p>
               <p>JURY to LACEY. Q. Did you let the man out? A. Yes; he had no desk then - I did not see him in a good light, and cannot swear to Hickford, but I believe he is the man.</p>

            . I am one of the City-police. I was in the watch-house near Smithfield, on the morning of the 16th of September, a little before ten o'clock - a person named Smith was brought into the watch-house, and in consequence of what happened I accompanied Smith and Crawley the policeman to Smithfield market; and saw the prisoner in the market - I took him into custody, and took him to the station-house, and asked him where he resided; he said, in the Barley Mow-passage, Long-lane, Smithfield; he asked me why I took him into custody; I told him I took him on suspicion of bad money - I went and searched his house, No. 1, Barley Mow-passage, with him and Crawley; the prisoner had got the key and unlocked the door himself - I entered the house, and searched the parlour in his presence - I asked him if there were any lodgers in the house, or did he occupy the whole himself - he said, yes, there were no lodgers, he occupied the whole himself; I told him I should search to see if he had any bad money, or materials to make it; he said, very well, there was nothing in the house that he knew of - I searched the chest of drawers; I then pulled them on one side from the wall, and this mould dropt down, it was in this tin band which fell at the time - I proceeded to search in the drawers, and found this bag of plaster of Paris, and some metal; I found some more metal in this paper, and found some military buttons and some quicksilver in a quill in the drawers; I then searched in the coal cupboard in the room, and found an iron ladle, and two tobacco pipes - I found in the tabledrawer, two small files, the drawer was closed; I then found three metal table-spoons in the same drawer - we then went down into the cellar, and on the stair case behind a beam I found three bad half-crowns - and into the cellar I found these keys; I went up stairs to the second floor, and then to the attic; I searched the attic, and found this bit of wire in the stove, here is some metal on it; it was in the stove between the bars; there was no fire - I took the prisoner to Guildhall; I locked the house, and kept the key I gave it to Mr. Compton the landlord - I returned to the house, in two or three hours (before I parted with the key) I searched the privy, and found part of a mould of a crown-piece; Mr. Compton was present; it was down in the soil: I found this dark lantern, in the same place.</p>

            . I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint - I have a great deal of experience in examining counterfeit coin, and other things; this mould is of plaster of Paris; on one half, of it is impressed the obverse side of half-a-crown - the other half, has the impression of the reverse side; the mould has been used for casting coin - it is discoloured from the heated metal having been poured in - I find among the metal produced, what is called a get, which fits the mouth of the mould, and appears to have been cast in it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose I was pouring metal into the mould, when filled, there would be a stream which would be afterwards cut off? A. Yes; the three half-crowns produced, are all counterfeit, they are cast in white metal, and correspond in all respects, with the mould - the spoons are of a similar metal to the counterfeit coin, and are frequently bought for that purpose; this iron ladle has white metal in it - the tobacco pipe is used to pour it into - here is a portion of grain tin; this plaster of Paris is what the mould is made with - the files are frequently used to remove the lumps on the surface of the coin, and to cut off the get; there is white metal in the teeth of the file - the tin band is used to form the mould.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). My wife, who has had the misfortune to break her leg, has been for some time confined in the hospital, and during that period, a young man named Brown, with whom I was acquainted, lodged with me. He had free and unobserved egress and ingress, and during my absence at my daily work, had of course abundaut opportunities to take any articles either in or out of the house, had he been so inclined. I have discovered that he is well known to Smith, the witness against me, and I have a firm persuasion, that the articles found at my lodging. and now produced against me, were placed there for concealment by Brown. The very manner of their concealment justifies this suspicion; they were found behind some drawers which he well knew I never had occasion to move, and where they were in no way likely to meet my observation. At the time of my being taken into custody, I was proceeding to my work, having just visited my wife in the hospital. Nothing whatever was found upon me of an improper nature. and I willingly offered to accompany the officers to my lodging, feeling certain that nothing wrong could be found there. Permit me to ask. if it is probable I should so have acted, had I been aware of these articles being there concealed? That such would never have been the act of a guilty man, I do most respectfully yet confidently submit. Previous to this unhappy charge, my character was never called in question' while the witness Smith has long been known to the police, has been several times in custody, and yet, upon his sole information, I am placed in a most dangerous and threatening situation.</p>

            . I was with Bannister on the night in question - we were going home on the pavement; the prisoner and several companions came by at the same time, and they said, "Look at the b-y lumpers;" before they said that, the prosecutor had not said a word to them - I immediately asked them what they had to do with the lumpers - the prisoner said, any thing what I liked, or the rest of the party; Bannister said, if they did not go off about their business he would send them to the station-house - the prisoner immediately struck him a violent blow on the face - Bannister had done nothing to him; Bannister was not able to return the blow; when he received the first blow from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170094"/>prisoner, it cut him very much; the prisoner repeated the blows very fast, very quick - Bannister was quite insensible while he was repeating the blows - he bled very much indeed; he lost a great deal of blood - I saw a man named Grimble there; he is here to-day, he was in the Green Dragon when the blow was first struck; I afterwards saw an oyster-shell in Grimble's hand, about four or five minutes after the blows were struck; the prisoner was gone away then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What became of Bannister after the first blow was given, what did he say? A. He was beat up against the side of the house; he was quite insensible when he was struck, and could not speak; he said nothing - the blow cut him across the nose, and disfigured him; he did not stand up; he leaned against the side of the house, and then the prisoner beat him very violently - I was close to Bannister.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not prevent the prisoner from striking him? A. It was done so suddenly, and the alarm given so quick - Grimble was out almost immediately after the first blow.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason why you did not interfere to prevent it? A. There was only the prisoner striking; there was only man for man - Bannister was insensible after the first blow; but there was such a parcel of people got round, it was impossible to get to him; I was close to him when the first blow was struck, but the crowd assembled very fast; I saw nobody strike him but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. As you have used the expression "Man for man," will you swear there was not a fight? A. Fight, why no.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take your oath there was not a fight between the prisoner and Bannister? A. I call it nothing else but a fight; Bannister did not strike any blows at all - I did not hear the prosecutor say, he would fight any coal-heaver on the coast; nor that he was ready to fight any; I heard no such thing - the prisoner might have staid four or five minutes in my presence; his brother was there at the time - I know

            . I am a lumper and coal-heaver; I was in the Green Dragon public-house, on the 27th of August, and in consequence of a noise I went out - I saw the prisoner kicking and beating Bannister who works with me - I am foreman to Mr. Burkitt - I ran out of the house and the prosecutor was then lying under the next house from the Green Dragon, where I saw the prisoner and others beating him - I saw the prisoner beating him at first, and I saw others making up towards him - I did not see them inflict any blow - Bannister was profusely covered with blood - he was insensible - the prisoner made his escape directly - I took Bannister into the Green Dragon - I believe a surgeon was got for him - you would not know the man, he was beat so on his head, and covered with blood - the moment I was apprised of what was going forward, I rushed forwards and a gentleman there gave the oyster shell into my hands - I have it here - the prisoner was absent at the time - I never showed the oyster shell to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by the expression that you saw the prisoner and others beating Bannister? A. The prisoner I have known for three or four years; he was the first man I saw beating the prosecutor - I saw three or four others who are now in attendance, stripping their clothes off, to beat the b-y lumpers - I saw the prisoner kicking him.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying you saw him and others beating Bannister? A. I may possibly have gone too far; but I have sworn to the prisoner at the bar, seeing him beating him and others attempting to do the same - I saw them rushing forwards - I did not see the spectators strike him - I have been with Burkitt about seven months - previous to that, I belonged to the police-force, to the K division - I did not leave it with any disgrace at all - I left at my own option, that I swear - no charge was made against me to the commissioners - I was recommended to the commissioners from Norwich - I came and served here three years, and left without disgrace to my character - my recommendation was from Colonel Harvey - I swear I was not discharged, for I took off my clothes and delivered them up - I left it because I thought I had got something better to attend to - I shall not answer you another question - I will only answer any questions the Court think proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you, now do you mean to say you quitted the police-force of you own accord, and was not discharged? A. I do - I did not see him kick more than once, for the moment he clapped his eye on me, he made his exit - I had time to see one kick - I cannot exactly say where he kicked him; I should suppose it was in the body; he was down at the time - I suppose it might be from the head, betwen two feet of that and the head - I do not think he kicked him on the head.</p>

            . I am a servant at the Green Dragon. I remember going out into the street on hearing a noise - I saw the prisoner there - I saw him give Bannister a most woeful blow; a hard blow - Bannister was standing up at the time - a little time after, I saw a shell in the prisoner's hand - I did not see it in Grimble's hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long after the blow did you see the shell in the prisoner's hand? A. About ten minutes as near as can be after the prisoner struck Bannister the blow - Bannister was helped into the yard - the mates helped him in that were in the tap-room - they did not help him in directly after the blow - it was a very few minutes after the prisoner struck the blow; he stood there; he did not do anything after the first blow that I saw - I went closer to him after he struck the blow, and I found Bannister standing up, he was staggering a little, when I got up to him; the prisoner was standing up when I got closer - and the men took Bannister into the yard, a very few minutes after the blow was given - I did not hear the prisoner say anything when he struck the blow - he did nothing but stand there that I saw - Bannister was standing with his face towards the prisoner; I did not see his hands up; I only saw the prisoner give him one blow - the prosecutor was standing up when the blow was given - and I did not see the prisoner strike him at all afterwards - I am quite sure Bannister was standing up when he received the blow - I did not see anything the matter with his face before he got the blow - Bannister had a quantity of blood on his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170095"/>face - he was covered with blood - I saw the first blow, his face was covered with blood after the blow - I did not see the prisoner go away - he remained behind after Bannister was taken in - I saw Grimble, he was not there when the blow was given; he was fetched when the blow was given - one of the mates called him, and he came out- the prisoner staid a few minutes after the blow was given - he did not go away directly, Grimble came out - we were both the same distance from him - I could see as well as Grimble.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see Bannister strike the prisoner in any way? A. No, not at all; after I saw him bleeding he was leaning against the wall, staggering against the house.</p>

            . I am a surgeon of the parish of St. Luke's. I was called in on the Friday subsequent to Tuesday, the 30th of August - I saw the prosecutor bleeding at the nose profusely then; there was a lacerated wound on the right side of his nose; the cartilage was separated from the bone of the nose; there was a considerable contraction about the right eye; it was closed - it was not a very serious case; I considered the haemorrhage which took place was an effort of nature, and that he would recover from it.</p>
