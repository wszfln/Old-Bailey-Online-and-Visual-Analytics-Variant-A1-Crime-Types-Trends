I went to Mr. Masters's, who is a pawnbroker in Holborn, there I found these four aprons, and one linen table cloth.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to by prosecutor.) My husband's things were all sold. I was present when they were examined before the justice. Price there confessed that he took the things; he said he sold my husband's coat and shoes to a Jew; he said Bedwell was with him; she said that she met him in Holborn, and he gave the things to her; he said he got in over the door.</p>
               <p>- Brooks. I am a pawnbroker. Bedwell brought these things to pledge on the 4th of July; I scrupled their being her own; she said she would fetch her sister to satisfy me that they were her own. She did not come again.</p>

I told him if he would be a little easy I would give him my money. Whilst I was getting out my money they swore they would have my watch. I took my money out of my pocket and gave it him, and at the same time took hold of his pistol and wrenched it out of his hand. They both ran away. I stept after the tall one. I thought he would run too fast for me, so I turned about and run after the short one. I called to him, and told him if he did not stop I would shoot at him or blow his brains out. I came up pretty near him, but not near enough to lay hold of him; I attempted to fire the pistol at him; it flashed in the pan but did not go off. I could run no further; so he made off over the fields to Portland Square. One thing I observed as he came round with the pistol, he hopp'd a little.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a dark night?</p>
               <p>Hunt. A little darkish, not very dark; I saw the bottom of Godbolt's face; I think it is his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Godbolt lame?</p>
               <p>Hunt. Yes, he is lame. He said before the justice he could not run; the justice called in one of his servants and asked if he could run; the servant said yes, very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the dress of either of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110005"/>Hunt. The tall one had light coloured clothes, the short one dark brown or black, brown I believe; they were in their own hair.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they great coats or common coats?</p>
               <p>Hunt. I believe furtout coats, but am not quite sure. They took 18 d. in silver, and a good many halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them speak?</p>
               <p>Hunt. I heard only the tall one speak.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard him speak before the justice had you any recollection of his voice?</p>
               <p>Hunt. I thought I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole what is your belief of the matter, that the prisoners are or are not the men?</p>
               <p>Hunt. The tall one I verily believe is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to the other?</p>
               <p>Hunt. He stood on my right hand; I did not observe much of him. This is the pistol, (producing a pistol about a foot long) it was charged half up with short pieces of tobacco-pipe and a piece of a spoon cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never had a light coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. At justice Welch's several people said he had a light coloured coat, as I described.</p>
               <p>Sheredine. I was not in that robbery; only I heard Godbolt say, on Wednesday or Thursday morning, when I went up to his room that he had bad luck. I said what bad luck? He said he stopt a gentleman and a lady; that he asked them for their money; that the gentleman gave him 18 d. and some half-pence; he said he went to take his watch; the gentleman put his finger in the trigger of the pistol, and one pulled one way, and the other the other. That the gentleman being rather stronger, got it away; and he hearing somebody coming up on horseback or a foot, he was forced to let go the pistol, and ran away and hid himself.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear this?</p>
               <p>Sheredine. The morning after the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before you was taken up?</p>
               <p>Sheredine. We were taken up on Sunday; it was the Thursday or Friday before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other man?</p>
               <p>Sheredine. No; Godbolt was the person that told this to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after the robbing of Mr. Hhuff?</p>
               <p>Sheredine. Yes; it was on Monday night we robbed Mr. Hhuff; this was the Wednesday or Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that pistol?</p>
               <p>Sheredine. Ours had such a hook, with which I us'd to hook it to the inside of my coat.</p>
               <p>(Note, It has a hook 5 inches long to hang in to the inside of a coat.)</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the pistol you robbed Mr. Hhuff with?</p>
               <p>Sheredine. This is the pistol, I believe; it was given to Godbolt; what he did with it I do not know; it was his pistol; we always returned it to Godbolt.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of ammunition did you load it with?</p>
               <p>Sheredine. I never saw the pistol loaded; whether it was loaded or not I cannot say; it was primed when I had it.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened you not to be out that night?</p>
               <p>Sheredine. I was out somewhere, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live at the same house?</p>
               <p>Sheredine. No; we live at separate places near each other.</p>
               <p>Q. What clothes was Godbolt dressed in that morning when he talked of his ill luck?</p>
               <p>Sheredine. I think in a brown coat; he had a light coloured coat on on Monday night when he robb'd that gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what became of that coat?</p>
               <p>Sheredine. I never saw it after that Monday night.</p>
               <p>Q. from Godbolt. Did not you say you came up and drank gin with me that night?</p>
               <p>Sheredine. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hunt. Did you hear him say so?</p>
               <p>Hunt. No; I did not.</p>

I told him I thought he did not look like a person whose wife wore a watch. I took him to the Compter. The next morning he confessed he had robbed his master of four watches; he gave me a direction where to find his master. I went to his master. He said he had sold one at Inglestone, another at Eastham, and the other he had sold to a travelling Jew.</p>

               <p>- Moody. I live at Inglestone; my husband keeps the Blue Anchor. On Saturday, I don't remember the day of the month, I bought this watch of the prisoner; I gave him 20 s. for it. I had it valued before I bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dress'd?</p>
               <p>Moody. Much as he is now.</p>

One night we had been out and he brought in a loaf of sugar in his lap; he swore the boy had watched him, and he was vexed at it. He went down into the apartments in the cellar, and she with him; he came up and said he would make the best of his way home; she asked him to drink some crank; he drank a little he went away and came back soon after. Mrs. Summerayse asked him what the boy wanted him for; he said, d - n his blood only to ask me where I was going? there was nothing more of it. There was fourteen or fifteen pounds of chocolate in the house the day before this was found out; and a week before the loaves of sugar were in the house.

               <p>Q. Did you never apply to her to give you any character?</p>
               <p>E. Neale. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never been under any difficulty?</p>
               <p>E. Neale. I had; but not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you send to her to give you a character?</p>
               <p>E. Neale. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not give you a character before a magistrate?</p>
               <p>E. Neale. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Never?</p>
               <p>E. Neale. She was there before the magistrate; but she did not speak a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sent to her some short time before this matter happened in order to give you a character?</p>
               <p>E. Neale. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she refuse to give you a character?</p>
               <p>E. Neale. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never send for her to appear for you?</p>
               <p>E. Neale. No, only as I said before, she went with me one day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you would be revenged of her?</p>
               <p>E. Neale. I never said I would be revenged of her. She called me a bad woman; I said she was a worse, to encourage a man to rob his master.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you follow any way of business?</p>
               <p>E. Neale. Yes; I am a mantua-maker.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to Mrs. Summerayse's on account of a quarrel between Mrs. Neale and Mrs. Summerhayse. When I came I found they had been fighting. Mrs. Neale said White had stolen goods from his master and brought them them there to Summerayse. She said this before White, that he had had 8 or 10 loaves of sugar there at a time in the cellar. White said she was a false woman. I put her in the Compter, and then went and told the story to Mr. Saunders; he got a search warrant and we searched the house and found the things before mentioned in the house. The cannisters were found in the cellar, the rest on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>- Rothwell. I found these cannisters in a box corded in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Prostine Snow I lived with Mr. Saunders a twelve-mouth. The prisoner would go up when the rest of the family did; after they were, as he thought, asleep, he would go out. I went back one day into the warehouse; I saw a bag full of tea there. I took it up and saw it was bohea tea. He brought his great coat out with him. Soon after, when I sent him out, I suspected he had the bag of tea. I went back into the shop and looked for the bohea tea I had seen ten minutes before, and it was gone. This was the 24th of August, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of tea might be there?</p>
               <p>Snow. I fancy about two pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else been in the warehouse besides you and him?</p>
               <p>Snow. I sent him out; and immediately as I came out I miss'd the tea; I spoke about it to my master.</p>
               <p>White's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never carried any thing there. I used to call in as I went along with parcels or so; but never wronged my master of a halfpenny. As to the breast buckle, they all denied it to be theirs, time after time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Saunders. How is that?</p>
               <p>Mr. Saunders. The breast buckle was lost some time before we suspected he had it. We sent to him for it. My boy said it was his; one of the stones was broke. I said it was better to be tender, so we returned it to him; two of my children said they could swear to it, before they returned it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this before he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Mr. Saunders. Three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Summerayse's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never received the worth of a penny in my house in my life, but what I justly bought and paid for. Two of my nephews that used my house have brought things in. The tea and coffee was mine. The cannisters were brought into my house last July was twelve-month, by my nephew

After it was taken out of the boat, Neal said it was his property. Conway said he had no concern in it; he only got his passage up in the boat. I saw part of the sugar come out of the vessel.

               <p>Q. What quantity might they take on Monday night?</p>

I went to Mr. Lee, who is a headborough in Shadwell parish, and told him to lie in wait to take them, when they came a-shore with the sugar. I saw them a-shore about twelve o'clock. There was two boats; John Hill and two others were in the first boat; I can't tell who was in the second boat. Conway came along the causeway; I took the two bags in charge; he said they were his property, and made a demand of them; with that. I took him by the collar, and said I would take care of him and the bags too, and called somebody to my assistance.</p>

            . I was a carpenter on board the ship. We came up the third of July, from St. Kite's. Two casks of sugar were carried to the custom-house, and paid duty for; the third I gave to Neale to make what he could of it for me, without paying the duty. He was working on boarp the ship ; I told him to get them on shore when he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear this sugar is your's?</p>
               <p>Reymot. I can't swear to that. I received five guineas of one Chamber's for the sugar Neale sold for me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive it?</p>
               <p>Reymot. I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before these people were apprehended?</p>
               <p>Reymot. Yes; I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you guess how much sugar you had in these 3 barrels?</p>
               <p>Reymot. About 600 lb. I received money for about 400 lb.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what came of the rest of the sugar; did you go on board after the sugar was sold?</p>
               <p>Reymont. Yes; there was about 90 lb. left the day after he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive money of any body else besides Chambers?</p>
               <p>Reymot. No; I carried the rest home to my house?</p>
               <p>Q. Who did Chambers receive the sugar of? Did you, on your oath, carry this sugar to Chambers?</p>

I came down naked and catched her in the street; I was in my shirt; she had the four quartern loaves in her apron: we found were the woman lived and there they found these two saucers, 3 towel and a bag with flour. (producing them.) Before the justice she said she had paid him. He said she had not, and he thought she was going to pay when she ran away. There was not a word pass'd between them.

I put my hand in my pocket and miss'd my handkerchief. The prisoner passed on, and I observed him put his hand to his breast; it was his right hand which was farthest from me. I said to my father, I have lost my handkerchief, and I believe that man has got it. He said, charge him with it. I went to him and tapped him on the shoulder, and said, I believe you have got a handkerchief of mine; he said he had not; I said I would see; then my father and Mr. Horne came up, and we took him into a shop in St. Paul's Church-yard; and he dropped the handkerchief, (produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Tustin. No; when I found myself robbed the prisoner was gone; on the 19th, which was the Monday, I went and found her at the same place; she charged the other prisoner with being concerned with her; upon which I called a constable and had them before the justice; I have not got any of my things again; when we took them up they both owned they sold the watch in Hungerford-market, for half a guinea and a gallon of beer; they gave no account of the rest of the things.</p>

I am coachman to one Mr. Broughton. I lost a blue coat, it was not a livery coat, it was my own; the waistcoat was the same colour. I lost a linen waistcoat besides, and a shirt, five neckclothes, and a pair of leather shoes; two handkerchiefs and my razors, and a gilt metal buckle.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of them?</p>
               <p>Lacy. About six pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to think the prisoner had them.</p>
               <p>Lacy. The day I employed him he stole a knife, July 21, and on Sunday morning the 4th of August, I found the stable broke open, three tiles were taken from the roof, and two boxes were broke open, and I missed these things. I found the shirts, four neckcloths, &amp;c. (repeated the things mentioned.) I took him up the week afterwards, August 13, in the Strand. He was in the street, he stood against a door; I had a warrant in my pocket; he had the shoes on his feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any promise to him?</p>
               <p>Lacy. No; he said, he would produce all the things if I would give him a week to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he had taken them?</p>
               <p>Lacy. No; I charged him with taking them. and he said he sold them in Monmouth Street. He did not know at whose shop. I took him through the street to see if he could see the man; he did not; he told me where the shirt and three of the neckcloths were; they were in the same place where he directed him. The linen was in boxes, the boxes were broke open.</p>

               <p>Q. How long after the taking up of the ring, did he run out of the shop?</p>
               <p>Reneals. About half a minute; he turned round to go out, he had no money in his pocket; in about half an hour, I found him in a person's closet, he was shut up; a little boy saw him go in, I went to see where he went to; so I enquired for him but he was denied, the boy said, he saw which apartment he went into; while I was examining the woman, the little boy opened the closet door, and there he was stuck up in the closet. I did not find the ring on him, but I saw him take it.</p>

I saw the prisoner in the college yard on the 1st of August, between the hours of four and five in the afternoon; she invited me to drink part of a pot of beer. I went away with her. I had received my money that evening. I had it in a green purse. I sat along with her a drinking. I paid for two pots of beer. I pulled out my purse and took out a six pence, and put it in my waistcoat pocket; my comrade came after me, and found me there; we were sitting close together; she was sitting on the right side of me. I thought her a very honest and modest like woman by the appearance of her. My thigh happened to be on her left thigh, and she let her thigh slip, and my thigh went between her legs; her hand was in my pocket, not that I thought she would steal any thing out of my pocket; seeing her so free I took my foot back and sat beside her, and I took the beer and drank. Was not this person very lovely. I bid her drink, and she drink at last. The third time I put my hand in my pocket, and I miss'd it directly; her hand was round my waist; but I did not think she took it then. Before I got off the seat I challenged her; and said you took the money out of my pocket. She said no, take care your comrade don't take it away. I said no, you took it out of my pocket, when my hand was under your pettycoats. Then said she, unstrip; O said, I, I did not think you was such a one. My dear, says she, your money is safe enough; it is better I should have your money than yourself; come along with me; and so she invited me to dine with her. Woman, says I, you had better give me the money; and I rose and paid the reckoning with the loose money I had in my pocket. Woman, says I, I want to go home, and not stay with you. I got out; I did not know what to do with her. She got to another place and would have a bottle of Hock. I said, woman, I want to go home. I do not want to sit down. I gave her a bottle of Hock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she carry you to?</p>
               <p>Maclane. It was not any place I knew. She would not go where I was known. I thought I was going to have my money. She would not be satisfied till she had a glass of gin at another place; and I humoured her for the sake of my money. Night was coming on, and she was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110016"/> for flinging me in the street; she could not do it. She came where there was five or six men drinking, and would not go by without drinking. I would not call, but she drank first out of the pot, and then gave it me, and said pay for this; I had but one penny then. She said this man is blaming me for a robbery. I said, Woman, I shall not follow you any longer. I thought she would bring me in another company; the men never spoke a word. I ask your pardon said I; I throwed it in her face, and said, if it costs me a dollar to morrow morning I will find you. I came out of the door, and she came out. I took her by the arm and gave her a kick with my right foot, and said go home; I'll find you to-morrow morning. She called me by name; I turned about, and she said, come along with me, the money is safe enough; so I went to her own apartment, and lied all night; 'tis below Jews row; I could not sleep; I left some cloaths on the floor, and when day light came I put no cloaths on but my shoes, and I rose, and she waked, and said, Maclane, what, are you getting up? your money is safe enough. I laid down again; I could not rest, but did rise between four and five, and I would not stay in the place; she rose and put on her clothes, and bid the other woman, that was her partner, take her clothes with her. I would not stay. I desired her to let me have the money; she said, as true as I'm the devil I have none. I never heard such an oath before from any one. I said, I will find you before night; so I went home to my comrade; there were none of them up. If it had been an English woman I should not have minded it; but it was very hard to be served so by my own countrywoman.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you sober or drunk?</p>
               <p>Maclane. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the sign where you picked her up?</p>
               <p>Maclane. The Mermaid.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did you loose?</p>
               <p>Maclane. Two guineas, and a half guinea in gold, and 4 s. and 6 d. in silver. I received it from the office the same day. I had not had it three hours in my custody.</p>

            . He received his money at our college. They were in the yard; I saw them in the Mermaid yard; when I went to receive my next paper to know when I was to receive my next money, they were moved into the box, and were sitting very lovingly together. I said it was time to go home; he said he would come presently; so I left him. I saw no more of him till between five and six o'clock next morning; he had been with that woman all night, and had no money left. I said you have made a bad hand of it; he said she had picked his pocket of it. He said there was no body in company but her and him; he knew he had it in the Mermaid; there he missed it. I came down with him to Jews Row, and finding the woman, we went into a public house with her about the money; she said his money was safe enough: and if he would live with her, he should have his money again; and he should never want money in his pocket, and she would be better to him than his money. I believe I staid about three hours, desiring her to give the man his money, she said it was safe enough, he would get it again. I left her and came down again the next day; she said the same again, it was safe enough, and she would not give him a farthing till she thought proper herself; so we took her before the justice; she denied it before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. So the man never got any of his money?</p>
               <p>Addey. No.</p>

            . I live at Temple Bar; they came into my shop; I suspected them, and I watched them into a great many shops, at last into Mr. Foot's, and we took these muslins from under their cloaks, one of them said to the other it was a very unfortunate accident or they should have had something; there were five of them, three waited at a distance, these came to them as they came out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shops did you watch them into?</p>
               <p>Ham. I believe at least fifteen.</p>

               <p>Morley. About seven or eight o'clock; I found it broke open fronting the water; the boards of the side of the warehouse were broke, the front of the warehouse next the water was wood.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner were they broke?</p>


               <p>Morley. There was a hole made; there were two or three boards broke, a man might get, in at the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know particularly what you lost?</p>
               <p>Morley. I do not know what was in the trunk, or box, there was a truss cut open; I was the first that went in in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. What on the other side?</p>

               <p>Q. Is there no fence?</p>
               <p>Morley. The warehouse parts our wharf, and the other wharf.</p>
               <p>Court. Can they get into this warehouse without going through your great gates, and under the shed to it?</p>

            . I am a lieutenant in the 7th regiment of foot. I sent two trunks up from Chatham, in the Chatham hoy, they were landed at Mr. Harrison's wharf; I went there and saw them standing on the wharf, on September 3, about eleven in the forenoon; they were put into Mr. Harrison's warehouse. The things mentioned in the indictment were in the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. to Morley. Were these Mr. Hay's trunks that were one opened, the other carried away?</p>
               <p>Morley. Yes, they were directed to lieutenant Hay; they were landed at our warehouse the third of September.</p>
               <p>Hay. They threw a number of my things into the river, boxes and such things.</p>

            . I met with Castle (on Thursday last was se'nnight, at five in the afternoon ) at a public house by Newgate-street. I saw him in company with one Isaac's; I called for a pennyworth of beer, and sat down; he asked how I did; I said he had got the advantage of me; he asked me if I did not remember his coming along with Isaacs: he told me he had got some things to dispose of; this Isaacs was a Jew that used to deal with him. He said he had two swords to dispose of; I asked him where I could see them; he said, he would either bring them, or I should go and see them, immediately. I went with him to the sign of the Dolphin; a lad fetched the swords.</p>
               <p>Q. He bid him do it?</p>
               <p>Bureau. Yes. He asked me what they were worth; I said, I did not know; I asked him what he would have for them; he said, six guineas. I told him I could not tell the value of them, and asked him if he had nothing else. He said he had got some lace to dispose of; I asked what lace it was; he said, some lace from off regimenta l cloaths; he did not produce it. I asked what became of the cloaths; Glover said they were thrown over-board. I told them both to meet me in the evening and bring the things, and that I would deal with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110020"/> them. Nothing was produced then, but these two swords.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you?</p>
               <p>Bureau. A tobacconist. Glover said he was going up the river (he is a bargeman) and he could not meet me, he said, that evening, but would the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they meet you the next day?</p>
               <p>Bureau. No. I saw Castle on Saturday afternoon, about five o'clock; I asked him why he did not come; he said he could not that time. Another man followed me, and asked me to buy the swords; he said they were his; I said I would not deal with him, I would deal with Castle. I met Isaacs on Friday night; he insisted upon my laying an information before Sir

I found these two swords, and the things that are here; a waistcoat, a pair of breeches, and a shirt tied up in a bundle, behind a butt, in the cellar: this was the place where the swords were shewed. (The things produced) There were the two prisoners in the house, when I searched, the two Mr. Bond's, and I.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the swords in the wrapper?</p>
               <p>Heley. They lay under a bed, in the two pair of stairs room. The landlord said, What you are searching for is under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take up any body besides the two prisoners?</p>
               <p>Heley. Yes; there were two or three more. Before we searched the house, we secured the two, and made the rest sit down to take care of them, while we searched. (the swords produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q. How many shirts are yours?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The two waistcoats are mine, and two shirts; I know them, they are marked: the wrapper is mine, and the paper snuff-box, is mine.</p>

               <p>- Phillips. I was at the Dolphin alehouse when it was searched: I am a constable; I took the prisoners, and search'd him first. I found in Castle's pocket this button; No. 7, upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Does that button belong to you?</p>
               <p>Hays. Our regiment has that number on the buttons.</p>

               <p>Q. to Heley. Out of which pocket did you take the box?</p>

               <p>Castle's Defence.</p>
               <p>I Was at work late on Thursday night, I had been down to Deptford with a fare; and rowing up, a man called, Sculler; I came to him, and he put these things in the boat; he asked me where he could lie that night; I told him in Dark-house lane; knowing there was a night house there; he asked me if I would buy these things of him: he told me if I could get any body to take them he would make it worth my while to meet him at ten o'clock. The Jew came, and said he would give me fifteen shillings for them, and break the blades off immediately; then Bureau bid me meet him at his house the next morning; I did not go then, he came to me; and I said there is the man that owns them; he will not take less than three guineas for them; then he said he had some lace that I should dispose of for him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bureau. Did you offer him fifteen shillings for these swords?</p>
               <p>Bureau. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you would break the blades off?</p>

Seeing a great quantity of goods close by him, on the table, I asked him how he came by them; he said he brought them from Manchester, and dealt that way; I took him before the justice, he told the justice the same, but would not tell his name; there were several bills of parcels, and the like, in the trunk, and a travelling licence; I went to some shopkeeper and found they belonged to some persons that attended the fairs; Clapham fair was that day; I went there and found out the prosecutor; these are the goods I took from the prisoner; they were sealed up before the justice; (the goods are opened.)</p>

               <p>Q. Explain that?</p>
               <p>Craswell. As they are told off from Bristol, we tell them afterwards, and if there is any difference we make an alteration; if there is none, we do not.</p>
               <p>Court. Does the Post master at Bristol put the charge on the letters?</p>

               <p>Craswell. I should; I do not suppose the tale varies once in a 12 month, (a paper produced) here is the tale of 645 then there is 19 added, we make it into one sum, that makes up the whole sum, so that it tallied exactly with the charge.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. It is possible to make a mistake in casting up the four-pences, suppose 645 were charged when there was 646, in truth such a thing might happen?</p>
               <p>Craswell. It seldom happens.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Suppose the letters instead of 645 there was 646, if one was lost they would be right?</p>
               <p>Craswell. No, it could not, because there would be one difference?</p>

               <p>"The prisoner said in his defence, that the day he sent the note to his brother, he took a walk to Cold Bath fields to meet an acquaintance: that, not meeting with him, he went to Lord Cobham's Head, and began amusing himself at the billiard table: that a person asked him to play; that he did, and was considerably the gainer; that he pulled out a handful of money; that the person asked him to change a twenty pound bank note; he told him he could if he was at home; that rather than loose what he had won, he took him home and sent the bank note to his brother to change; that if he had stole the note he might have done it privately, and should not have sent it to his own brother to change, who he knew must write his name upon it; that he believed it was a planned scheme; that the story being abroad that the office was robbed; it was a designed thing to throw suspicion on him, and that any man in his senses, if he had been guilty, could never have acted in the open manner he had done.</p>
               <p>The prisoner began calling witnesses to his character; but the judge said that the jury would give him credit for a character; for none but those of good characters had places in such offices.</p>

The prisoner wrote a note, and Wright delivered it to my neighbour. I delivered the key to Murphy. I found afterwards my house had been robbed in the night-time. I was in gaol twelve weeks. When I came out I found the house stripped; other people had got it: all the goods were gone except what a neighbour had secured. The goods, mentioned in the indictment, were all in my house at the time I was taken up, and they were gone when I came out; who took them I do not know. She did not come as she had promised to do on Monday, but came to the gaol on the Thursday following. I asked her how she could do so; she abused me, and said it was only a breach of trust.</p>

About twelve at night her landlady came down, and said she saw some man go into her room, and she would nor suffer it. The prisoner bid me hold my tongue, and she would stand the cause. Her landlady went away, she asked me to give her a shilling and go to bed with her, which I did. I pulled my shirt off, for fear of catching any vermin. When I awaked in the morning, the prisoner was gone, and all the things mentioned in the indictment. I went home, and cleaned myself, and went into the alley, and enquired for her. She was gone. I met her with a black man, going into Tower-street; she had my breeches in her hand; I charged a constable with her, who took her to the Poultry compter; where I took my key, buttons, a little box, and a knife from her.</p>

            . I am a constable in Shoreditch parish. About twelve o'clock at night, Knight pitched a bag, near the Spotted Horse, Shoreditch; the watchman came and told me he believed it was stolen, Harding was near the watch house-door; he ordered Knight to go away with it; my brother officer said, he believed it was indigo; we asked Harding where he was going with it; he said to Mrs. O'Neale's, in Islington Road. We went with him to Mrs. O'Neale's; Harding called out aloud, Mrs. O'Neale here is a parcel come out of the country. Mrs. O'Neale came down. I asked her if she expected any parcel out of the country; she said no; she had no bill of parcels; so I took them back to the watch-house: Harding there said he had bought it at St. Edmund's Bury, at 6 s. and 6 d. per pound, and he could not make more than 7 s. and 6 d. of it. The next day he said he brought it to town by getting lists of the waggons. I took him before justice Camper; he brought one Nugent next day to prove that he bought it at St. Edmund's Bury; then he said he was to give 5 s. and 6 d. before he said 6 s. and 6 d. per pound.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that he bought it and gave but 5 s. and 6 d.</p>
               <p>Reynolds. He said so I am certain; he said he hired Knight; first he said at Bow; then at Cheapside; then he said at Cheapside Bow.</p>
               <p>This evidence is confirmed by another constable.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Rutherdun at Aldgate; on the 22d of July the prisoner offered me this gold chain; he said he found it at Newmarket; I told him I did not like to have any thing to do with it; he said he had looked over the papers for two or three weeks past and it had not been advertised: I did not chuse to buy it, then he asked me to lend him some money on it: so I lent him two guineas on it.</p>

I went to serve her with some lace. She had a yard and quarter cut off, and another piece about two yards and a half; and after that she wanted some ribbons; I saw her fling the lace on the ground, between her and the counter. I came back and shewed her the ribbons, which she liked very well; she wanted to know what it came to. I measured it, and said it come to 39 s. She wanted to go out to get some more money. I suspected she had concealed this lace; she had stooped with a pretence to tie her garter. I wanted her to pay for the lace I had cut off. My wife came round the counter and said to her, you don't want to buy lace, for you have a piece under your arm; and as soon as she had taken that from her, I took hold of her arm, and said I believe you have some lace about you, and desired to search her. She would not let me; but said she had no more. I sent the boy for the constable, and when she saw him, she said she would give me what she had if I would not let the constable in; then she pulled this card out. The constable went away. I desired to search her; she would not let me. I then told her I would send for the constable again. I sent for him, and went to Sir

               <p>I am very innocent; I know nothing of it; they were found beside the counter; because I would not pay for the lace they had cut off, they charged me with the robbery. I had a guinea and a half in my pocket; he said before the constable came in, he would have me taken before the justice; I said it was only spite, because I would not have the two yards and a half that were cut off for me. It is very hard I should be so long in confinement, and innocent-in the affair. I buy and sell clothes.</p>

I shewed her a room; she wanted to go to bed between five and six; I don't know the exact time; it is about three months ago. I saw her again a little before six in the morning, down stairs; I asked her what made her get up so soon, she said she had been very ill, which made her get up. She got into the coach about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any bundle?</p>

            . I drive the Epsom stage. On the 8th of May, which is our race week, I saw a woman sitting in the coach; I asked her if she had sat there ever since I had come in; she said no; she laid at the Bell Savage, and she came up by the Norfolk stage. She had two bundles lay on the fore seat of the coach, one a large bundle, tied up in a check apron, the other seemed to be a handkerchief. I said I would put them in the coach seat, or the boot; she said no, she would take them in her lap. I set her down at the King's Head at Epsom.</p>
               <p>- Cole. I live at Epsom. I look after Mr. Nelson's business as his bailiff. The prisoner lived under me at Mr. Nelson's; we had a suspicion of her being with child. I taxed her with it several times; she denied it; I told her she should go away: she went away almost immediately. I went to Epsom on the 8th of May, to meet a friend; he said here is Nan, your servant that was, how came you to turn her away; I said because I had a suspicion she is with child; he laughed, and said no, she was not with child; for I understand she has miscaried at the Bell Savage last night. I had not seen the prisoner; I said, she must go to the work-house; he said it is a pity she should go to the work-house, for in three or four days she would be fit to go to service again. I said I would go and speak to her, and if she owned who was the father of the child, where she miscarried, and what she did with it, I would get her a place. I went to herin one of the rooms at the King's head. After some little conversation, she said one

I went to Mr. Potter, a painter and glazier, that worked for Mr. Nelson, to get him to take her in for a few days. The next day I was told there was a child in her bundle. I went on Friday morning, she was very uneasy;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110044"/> I was afraid she would make away with herself. I asked if she had a knife, and she gave me this; (producing a small clasp knife.) there was some specks of blood on the blade; but I have carried it in my pocket and it is worn off. I went up with the doctor, and saw a child taken out of the bundle, but I was not near it. He said, on his cross examination, that he had known the prisoner many years, and that she had an extreme good character.</p>

            . On the 24th and 25th of last March, I was sent for to the prisoner, at Mr. Nelson's: she was in bed; I asked her several questions; I told the family I suspected she was with child. I took her into another room, and told her my suspicion. She denied it. I was sent for on Friday, the 10th of May, about eleven o'clock, Mr. Cole came for me; we went up stairs; a bundle was laid on the bed. I desired the prisoner to open it; she began and pulled out a few things; she was in great confusion: I assisted her in opening it, and discovered a dead female child, in appearance at its maturity. I examined the child, and on the head lay a large pin, flat, the point stuck in the skull, it did not go in to the cavity of the head. The prisoner said she did not do that. The skull was not penetrated; it might have been by accident. I lifted up the child's head, and I saw three large stabs in its throat, and a large wound across the throat; that wound divided the right internal jugular; that of course must have occasioned a great effusion of blood. That wound was certainly mortal. I opened the body, the lungs appeared in a sound state, and on throwing them into water, they swam.</p>

               <p>Brooks. This pedigree was produced by Mr. Brown who appeared there as attorney for Burch; and Burch acknowledged that he had given it into Mr. Brown's hand; the pedigree was produced to shew the similitude of hands between the signing of that and the will. Martin was present, but he said nothing; Burch said, he found the pedigree among the papers were the will was, and that he indented one corner that he might know where he had it from.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any mark upon the will?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No; it has never been out of my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how Bruch and Martin came before Sir John?</p>
               <p>Brooks. When an application was made to Sir John, he thought it would be proper to summons Mr. Lloyd to give evidence how he came by it; as it was said that he gave it to Mrs. Glover; he accordingly on Friday came to our office, and brought with him Burch and Martin; who, he said, gave him the will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come voluntarily along with him?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes; they came with him.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Did they mention how long this will and pedigree had been found?</p>
               <p>Brooks. They did mention the time, but I do not recollect it; it was a small time ago; he said, he saw the will first three months before that time, at Mrs. Brooks's; that it was found among a bundle of papers then in the custody of Mrs. Brooks.</p>
               <p>Q. from Burch. You said I gave the will to Mr. Brown, I produced it myself in the office?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I am told by Mr. Brown that he did produce it; whether he gave it him in the office or no, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. from Burch. Were we not at the office on Thursday?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes; and I advised them to come again on Friday morning according to the summons.</p>

               <p>Lloyd. About four months ago, Mr. Burch told me there were some papers of consequence relating to Sir Andrew Chadwick's estate; I asked him what they consisted of; he did not choose to tell me of what nature they were; Martin was not present, he desired I would apply to Mr.

            , and tell him of these papers of consequence, that he might see them if he pleased. Mr. Hudson was the agent concerned for the heir at law; I told Mr. Hudson of it; he desired the men to come to his chambers; Mr. Burch reported that he was not possessed of them, but that they were in the hands of Martin; I acquainted Burch and Martin of it, neither of them chose to go; Martin said he did not choose to go; they met me at the Fountain in Broad-street; they took me into the passage; I said, I had spoke to Mr. Hudson; Martin said, I mentioned the matter to you, and I shall not go; and I heard no more of it for two months, till at last Burch came and informed me the papers consisted of a will made in favour of Lady Chadwick.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to apply to you; are you any relation to Lady Chadwick?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. None; I have let the houses, and have been a sort of an agent for Sir Andrew; have taken schedules of fixtures and the like; I was an agent to Mr. Hudson at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they at that time mentioned what the papers were?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No; they only said they were papers of consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Martin present when Burch said the papers consisted of a will?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No; he said that every shilling of rent that was paid to Mrs. Law, was paid to Lady Chadwick's wrong; I said, then if you are possessed of these papers of this consequence, why in the name of God do not you bring them forth; I will, says he, next Friday; they were to be brought to the Fountain; I attended there, they did not come; I think it was next morning that Burch said he would bring them; on Monday morning Burch came up to the Fountain; he asked me if Martin had been there;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110049"/> I said, no; he said will you take a walk with me; I asked him where; he said towards the Seven Dials; I went with him into Grafton-street, he desired me to go into a public house, I think the sign of the Bear, and to wait till Martin came; I went into the house and called for six-penny worth of brandy and water, and sat in a box in the window; I looked out at the window to see where Burch went to; he went into a house next door to an ironmonger's; he came back and told me that Mr. Martin was not come; then I said, we may as well go up again to the Fountain; and leave word here; before we had drank out the six-penny worth, I saw Martin go by; I said, there is the little man; Burch called him in; he had a bundle under his arm, in a canvas bag, tied up in a silk handkerchief; Martin said, here is the very thing; upon which I said, we had better go up to the Fountain and look at it; we went there, and there the parcel was opened in the one pair of stairs fore room; Martin took a paper out of the parcel and gave it me to read, which one of them said, was Sir

            's will; it appeared to be dated in 1764; I just took a cursory view of it; I had not time to read it; out of the same parcel Martin produced another will dated in 1762, and said, this is the will you are to carry over the way to Lady Chadwick's; she lives opposite; (a paper shewn him,) this is the will.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. As near as I can bear in memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they give any reason why this will and not that dated 1764, was to be took over the way?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the will in 1764?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes; I took a cursory view of it; it had the same witnesses to it as this; they were in the same order; Field and Grove.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you read any part of the contents of that will?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I did read some part; there was a clause whereby after Lady Chadwick's death, he gave the real estate to the Chadwicks in Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. Your knowledge of the world in general must give you to know that the will in 1764, was a revocation of the will in 1762?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet Martin told you that that was the will you was to carry over the way?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any curiosity to enquire further after the will in 1764?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I asked what was become of it; and did not know till I came to sir

               <p>Q. Did they give any account of what became of the papers and will of 1764?</p>

               <p>Q. Who said that?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I believe it was Martin; Burch said that the Chadwicks had given 4000 l. notes for these papers, eight five hundred pound notes of hand, payable on demand.</p>
               <p>Q. That the Chadwicks had given him these notes?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes; and they were in Burch's possession. I believe that Martin witnessed the bills, for I fancy neither of the Chandwicks could write.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at that time said they expected to be rewarded?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No; I believe a week before the will was produced; Martin was by at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether something was said about so many years rent?</p>
               <p>Court. Was any thing said about who was to receive the rent, in case this will prevailed?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with them before Mrs. Glover?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. The day the will was produced, the 5th of August, Martin and I went over to Mrs. Glover: when we came there, Mr. Hulse, Mrs. Glover's attorney, interrogated Mr. Martin how he came by this paper. Mrs. Glover lives with Lady Chadwicks. He asked him who he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110050"/> was, and what he was, and where he lived. He told him where he did live, which I did not know till that time, and that he had that paper from Mrs. Brooks, among a parcel of other papers. Mr. Hulse desired him to attend next morning at his chambers, and bring the woman with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the will produced to Mr. Hulse at that time?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes; and I think he looked at it; Martin, Burch, and the woman went to Mr. Hulse's chambers; there was Mr. Rose and Mr. Vaughan; I don't know what business he had there, he is a cabinet maker. Mr. Hulse was questioning Martin and Brooks, and in came Mr. Blake, and asked where I had that will from; I said from Martin; he was sitting in the room then; he asked me if I had any objection to go before sir

               <p>Lloyd. One Sunday evening I called at the Horse and Groom in Theobald's-row; I believe a fortnight or three weeks before the will was produced, Burch had promised to raise a man, in low circumstances, twenty pound for a year; I thought I would become security for this debt of twenty pounds, because it would give me some time to pay the money I had entered into security for him; his name is Kimber. I called on Burch on Sunday about it; we went to the Horse and Groom, in Theobald's row; he said, now I will shew you something; he went out of the room, and brought a paper or parchment in his hand; he doubled back the lower part, and said there, see that; do you know that hand writing; is that like sir Andrew Chadwick's hand writing?

               <p>Lloyd. Yes; by Burch, about a month before the will was produced; he told me that the last codicil of Sir

            's will, was a most extraordinary one; that there was a doubt whether it was not forged; that there was a bill in Chancery going to be filed against the sesiduary, legatee and the executor, that one Mr. Potts an attorney, who lives some where towards St. James's-street, was concerned; that they wanted these receipts that were known to be Sir Andrew's hand writing, to see if they tallied with that codicil; I fetched my file and he took of three receipts of Sir

            's, and took them away with him; he wanted a receipt with a good many figures; I had been Sir Andrew Chadwick's tenant many years.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that four months ago, the rumour was spread of some papers of consequence being to be produced; and this was a month before the production of the will?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then my question is; whether the application for these receipts, was after the begining<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110051"/> of that four months, that you say the things was talked of; the papers being to produce?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes; it was after the commencement of that conversation.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray do you know whether there were any figures in Sir Andrew's codicil, that was suspected?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No; He asked me for a receipt that had figures in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You was agent to Mr. Hudson, who is concerned for the heir at law; whoever it may befor now, it is in dispute?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The account they always gave you of this will was, that it was found among some papers, in a bundle at Mrs. Brookes's?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ever pretend to say whether the will was Sir

            's will, or not?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. They said it was a will of Sir

                  Andrew

            's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they say they had found it out?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. About last Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ever pretend to you to know any thing more of the will, than that it was found among a bundle of papers?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the purpose for which this will was to be carried to Mrs. Glover's; the person that managed for Lady Chadwick, was to take their directions as to that?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not say it was a good will or a bad one?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No; it was left to the consideration of Lady Chadwick, to know whether it was proper to produce the will or not; there was no talk whether it was a good or a bad will.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not pretend to have any other knowledge of the will than what appeared on the face of it?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned something about a will in 1764; are you pretty accurate as to the date of it?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I think it was 1764.</p>
               <p>Q. You said just now that you had but a cursory view of that will?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They said they expected some reward if Lady Chadwick got any benefit by this will, for finding of it?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. They said they expected to be rewarded; I cannot say the very words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give your opinion whether you thought the will good or bad?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I do not remember that I did; I asked them if I should carry it over the way, and they gave me leave; I said the signature was like Sir Andrew's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say, when it was put into your hands; I will swear the signing to be the hand writing of Sir Andrew?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I said I believed it was; but I could not say I will swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell them that Sir Andrew had frequently told you in his life time, that you should be remembered in his will?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe a legacy is given to you in this will?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes; there is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them this before the will was produced?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No; at the time before it was carried over to Mrs. Glover.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give that as a reason to them why you apprehended the will might be the true will of Sir Andrew?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No; I do not remember that I did.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Was there no conversation prior to producing this will, with regard to Sir Andrew's good intentions to you?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you will take upon you to say that this expression, that Sir Andrew meant to consider you in his will was at that time, or before the will was produced?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I think it was at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you remember what was due from you to Sir Andrew, about the third of July 1762?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I believe the account was nearly a balance.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw this other will so as to distinguish they were the same witnesses; did you see any other papers of the bundle?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110052"/>Lloyd. Yes; there were bills and proceedings in Chancery.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether it is relating to Sir

               <p>Lloyd. There appeared to be one relating to Chadwick an attorney, and one relating to

            ; I saw none at that time, that related to Sir Andrew; seeing them lie on the table, I read the heads of the bills, Sir Andrew was not a party to them; Burch picked these out of the parcel, and gave them to me, because there was the name of Chadwick to them, he said there is more of the Chadwicks names; that was Monday the 5th of August, ( these papers produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Sir Andrew in 1762?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not in good health at that time?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes; except now and then the gout.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did it usually affect him mostly?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. In his fingers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who this solicitor was; whose name is to many of these papers?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I know nothing at all of him.</p>

               <p>Court. You said in your original examination, Martin produced a will of 1762, which he said, you was to carry over the way to Lady Chadwick; now did you ask, or he desire the will might be carried over?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I heard first of the will of 1764, Martin threw out the other paper, and said, that is the will you are to carry over the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to ask them leave?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. After I had first read it; I said, well, may I carry this over the way; they said, yes.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. There was an arrear of rent due to Sir Andrew at that time; the will has left him such arrears of rent, as may be due to Sir Andrew at the time of his decease?</p>
               <p>Cross examined by the prisoner Burch.</p>
               <p>Q. I desire you will answer me according to truth; long before ever I spoke to you of these wills, or the papers that I had possession of, had not we conversation about these whimsical, as you called them, codicils; and did not you say it was a matter of surprize to you, how these codicils were dated as they were?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. At the time the last codicil was dated, in 1768, I was pretty sure Sir

               <p>Q. Did you not say the same to me?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was before I told you of the papers at all?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I believe it might; I cannot pretend to fix the exact time.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner ever restore to you the three receipts?</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you read it all over verbatim?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you make this animadversion when you read it over, he desired in that will to be buried at Cardy place in Lincolnshire, and he was to have a vault erected?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that he had mentioned that in his life-time?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes; he told me he would be buried at Cardy-place; he had a family vault there; and I should be his undertaker.</p>
               <p>Court to prisoners council. This will of 1764 is not now produced, I believe?</p>
               <p>Council. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. After this was read over did not you say this is the thing, this is the very thing?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I do not remember that I did; I cannot remember my particular words.</p>
               <p>Q. And further observed, you thought there was a mistake in one of the names, mentioned in the will?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I turned the leaf over again, and said, this will is not dated.</p>
               <p>Q. You found a date?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After that was read over did not Mr. Martin give you the other?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you read that over?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say this must be genuine; Sir Andrew has forgiven me an arrear of rent, which no mortal but himself could know of?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I do not know but I might say so.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that the will of sixty-two?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes; Sir Andrew always told me he would remember me when he died.</p>
               <p>Q. And that no man knew you owed money to Sir Andrew, but himself?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. He had often declared he would give me something by his will.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had read this will over dated 1762; did not you desire Mr. Martin to give you leave to carry it to Mrs. Glover; did not Martin say you are welcome to do with it as you please, it is of no use to me; if it is of any to you, you are welcome?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Mr. Martin gave me leave.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Martin say he expected no fee or reward?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I do not remember he said so at that or any other time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you return again without this will?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No; with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Martin say you was welcome to carry it over again, if I pleased; for Mrs. Glover to show to her attorney?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes; that was after I brought it back.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back again, did not you say that you had shown it to Mr. Keatley's clerk?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. That Mrs. Glover had showed it to Mr. Keatley's clerk, and that he said, he believed it was Mr. Groves's signature; one of the witnesses of the will.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say anything about Sir Andrew's signature?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I believe he said it was sir Andrew's signature; I cannot be certain: I did not hear him say so; I told the prisoner I had heard that he said so.</p>
               <p>Q. If you remember you and I canvassed this bag of paper, and opened them every one?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I deny that; you looked them over then. Martin said, now he is in his glory; he has got all the papers to look over.</p>
               <p>Q. You and I picked out a great many papers that were signed Chadwick on them?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. You picked them out, and shewed them me.</p>
               <p>Q. One paper particularly was obliterated and torn, but plainly the name of Sir Andrew was in the body of it?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes, there was; it is among the papers now.</p>
               <p>Prisoners council. This is the paper; here is the word sir Andrew upon it. That letter, my lord, has been proved in the court of Chancery; that has been proved in the case of Snipe and Simpson; it has a reference to an estate somewhere in Bunhill fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether sir Andrew had any estate in Bunhill row?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoners council. You received only for the rents in your neighbourhood I believe?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I never received any rents for him only since his death.</p>
               <p>Q. After we had sat down in the dining room, did not you ask me if there was a possibility of finding out people that could prove the hand writing of Tenneson; did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110054"/> you desire me to go to one Brown, an attorney?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. You said you was not clear with respect to Tenneson's hand writing; I said one Mr. Brown, of Liquorpond street, I had heard him say, knew one Mr. Lowe that was acquainted with this Tenneson, and might be acquainted with his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this the first time the will was produced to you?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes; I was made acquainted with the names of the witnesses before I saw the will.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you then told there was any doubt about Tenneson's hand writing?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I believe Burch might say he had not got any body to prove Tenneson's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Court. How came Brown to tell you he knew one Lowe?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I was talking to this Mr. Brown about this will, and that there was one Tenneson, as Mr. Burch informed me, an attorney; that lived about Lincoln's Inn, a witness; he said there was one Mr. Lowe, who, I think, was intimately acquainted with Tenneson, and he will inform you whether it was his hand writing or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you desire me to go to this Brown? did not you desire me to bring as many people as I could the next day to Martin?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. For what purpose were they to be brought there?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I suppose, in order to see if they could prove the hand writings of the different persons that were witness of the will Mr. Martin produced; Ross was the man that was brought to prove Tenneson's and Field's hand, having a lease, wherein Tenneson was a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. This will was intended to be brought there for their inspection?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. It was to be returned to be sure for them to see it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not bring it back?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I went over for the will, and Mrs. Glover said she had left it with her attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. And you desired the parties to go next morning to Mr. Hulse's chambers?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes; and all the parties attended accordingly.</p>
               <p>Q. It was looked upon, by Mr. Black, the residuary legatee's attorney, to be a forged will, was it not?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes; it was.</p>
               <p>Q. I saw no more of you till Thursday evening; you said you had a summons to attend at sir 
               <persName id="t17710911-64-person664">

               <p>Lloyd. No; I said Mrs. Glover had been at sir John Fielding's, and asked me if we had any objection to go to sir John's; both you and Martin said, no, you had not the least objection, and we went all together.</p>
               <p>Court. You had before that told them that Mrs. Glover had made an application to sir

               <p>Lloyd. Yes; she asked to inspect it; I said I had it from the people over the way. I went, and they gave me leave.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Martin and Burch at that time know that the authenticity of this will was questioned?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes, they did; it was questioned on Wednesday morning by Mr. Black.</p>
               <p>Q. We went down to sir

               <p>Q. You desired us to bring Mrs. Brooks along with us to sir

               <p>Lloyd. When we came to the Shakespear Tavern, this pedigree was pulled out by one Mr. Walker, who was then in the room; he said, how can you wear out this pedigree so, it will be all rags and tatters; he put it into his pocket, and said, you shall never have it again.</p>

            's without any reluctance?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes; without any signs of fear.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Martin delivered this paper to you, did you see any red lines?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not I say it was wonderful to me, that there was a difference in the signature to the two wills in the scroll;</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I cannot remember that; you might say so; I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>Court. You read the will of 1764, as well as the will of 1762.</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, was the will, of the year 1764 of the same import as 1762 or not?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. The 1762 gives the estate to Lady Chadwick; the other sends it to Ireland.</p>
               <p>Court. Now I ask you, as an honest man, if you had seen the will of 1764, how you came to be negotiating and carrying about this will of 1762, in order to set it up in prejudice to the will of the year 1764; why you did not as well carry over the will of 1764 as 1762, which was a will made in her favour, as a subsequent will in her disfavour; why not, as an honest man, carry over both wills?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. So far I might be blameable; but as the papers were not mine, I carried the will given me.</p>
               <p>Court. You asked leave to carry over the will of 1762; I desire to know, why you did not as well ask leave to carry over the will of 1764?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. So far I might be blameable: but the papers were not mine; I had nothing to do with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have a meeting next day of all these people, to know whether the will of 1762 was a good one, when you knew of a subsequent will of 1764.</p>
               <p>Lloyd. The people were brought to prove the hand writing of the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning did you tell any of the parties of the will of 1764 at that time?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Oh! she; and you a man of business.</p>
               <p>Lloyd. So far I am blameable.</p>
               <p>Court. She was tenant for life in one will, and tenant in see in the other. When was the first time you mentioned this will of 1764?</p>

               <p>Mrs. Glover. I was acquainted in sir Andrew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110056"/> Chadwick's family, both in his life, and since his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray do you know sir Andrew's hand writing?</p>
               <p>Glover. Yes; very well. (The officer produces the will and codicils from the commons; the will the 7th of July 1765, and all the seven codicils.) I believe these are all sir Andrew Chadwick's hand writing. (another paper produced.) This is the will I had of Lloyd; it was put in to my hand, on Saturday the 27th of July, I think was the first time I heard there was such a thing, from

               <p>Glover. At Lady Chadwick's; we live together in the same house; I am to take and do all her business; she is old, and hears very badly; she speaks to nobody that she does not know, without I am present.</p>

I took it to Mr. Keatley, my lady's agent, he was not at home; I shewed it his clerk; he said he would swear it was sir Andrew's hand writing; I told him not be so hasty, for I would not swear to my own hand writing at the first look. I took it then to Mr. Tuand, my lady's council, he was not at home; I shewed it his clerk, and told him as I did Mr. Keatley's clerk, or to that effect.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you conversant in the family of sir Andrew, in his life time, long before his death?</p>
               <p>Glover. Yes; a great while before his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any papers, or memorandums of sir Andrew, relative to his family?</p>
               <p>Glover. I never heard him talk about his family; he would scarce mention any such thing as a family.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you intimate in the family in 1758?</p>
               <p>Glover. Yes; till about 1764; I never was intimate with them till after Mr. Glover died.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing of his pedigree?</p>
               <p>Glover. No; never.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you have seen the will that was produced by Lloyd?</p>
               <p>Glover. I signed my name to it at sir

            's.</p>
               <p>Q. From the observation you had made of it, and being acquainted with sir Andrew's hand writing, what opinion did you form of it?</p>
               <p>Glover. The first observation I made, was that there was Mrs. Humphreys, lady Chadwick's sister, for whom sir Andrew had a great regard; and that struck me; his having forgot her in the will.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Mrs. Humphreys dead or alive in 1765?</p>
               <p>Glover. She died in 1764.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other doubt?</p>
               <p>Glover. Yes; Mr. Groves being a witness; because I had heard him say, he believed sir Andrew had not made a will; I doubted on that account. I never let it go out of my hands till I gave it to Mr. Hulse, the solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides the omission of Mrs. Humphreys and Groves's declaration, what did you think?</p>
               <p>Glover. I thought it was not sir Andrew's hand writing; he had a particular turn in his will. I saw the letter r was rather daubed over a little, it had been a little medded, as if not the free pen of a writer of his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for these reasons you left it very properly with lady Chadwick's solicitor?</p>
               <p>Glover. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whilst you was in the family of sir Andrew, do you remember any thing of a little bible with any hand writing of his in it?</p>
               <p>Glover. Yes; (the bible produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to any hand writing in that book? Do you believe it to be any of his hand writing?</p>
               <p>Glover. His hand is much altered since this was wrote, I believe that is his.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a book in his own custody?</p>
               <p>Glover. In my lady's.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. Do you mean to say you are so conversant with his hand writing, as to be able to form a judgment whether that is his hand or not.</p>
               <p>Glover. I cannot swear it is, or not; the first part of the writing looks like his, the last part I do not think does.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you did not hear him talk of his pedigree?</p>
               <p>Glover. No; but I know he did own having relations down in Lincolnshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Since his death, who has been in the receipts of the rents of the real estate?</p>
               <p>Glover. I believe, Mrs. Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110057"/>Q. What part of that estate was it lady Chadwick had?</p>
               <p>Glover. The third part of it, as her right, I believe, she has had on account.</p>
               <p>Q. And somebody else has had the other two thirds?</p>
               <p>Glover. Yes; or somebody for her.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that ya, on Saturday, the 27th of July, acquainted you that there was a will?</p>
               <p>Glover. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him?</p>
               <p>Glover. I asked him in whose favour it was; he said in Lady Chadwick's. I said, how came that: he said it was signed by three witnesses. I asked him who the witnesses were; he said, one Tenneson, and Grove. I said, I believed it was not a right will. I desired to see it. I asked why he did not bring it; he said he would bring it. I said he should not bring it, unless I had some lawyer with me when he brought it. He said, there is the will; now will you believe it: that was all that passed at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you could recollect the whole conversation.</p>
               <p>Glover. Lloyd said to me, he thought the prisoner would expect something for finding the will.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else passed?</p>
               <p>Glover. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the day did he bring the will?</p>
               <p>Glover. About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say Mrs. Humphreys died about 1764.</p>
               <p>Glover. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was about the time you became acquainted with sir Andrew's family?</p>
               <p>Glover. I was not intimate before.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know Mrs. Humphreys in 1764?</p>
               <p>Glover. Yes; and before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you much acquainted with her?</p>
               <p>Glover. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say sir Andrew had a peculiar turn?</p>
               <p>Glover. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. How old was sir Andrew when he died?</p>
               <p>Glover. I believe about ninety.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose, from 1762 to 1768, there was a good deal of alteration in sir Andrew?</p>
               <p>Glover. He was a poor creature; he was rather an unaccountable man.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was rather apt to hide his wills about in holes and corners?</p>
               <p>Glover. It seems so, for fear the two legged rats and serrets should get hold of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own his relations in Ireland?</p>
               <p>Glover. He did not own his country; he d - d them all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any fortune Humphreys had of her own?</p>
               <p>Glover. I do not know; I heard she had some: she took care of lady Chadwick's house?</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was unaccountable respecting his actions?</p>
               <p>Glover. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether there are two Chadwicks in Ireland?</p>
               <p>Glover. Indeed I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hulse. This will was brought to me by Mrs. Glover, I believe on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Glover. The morning Mr. Lloyd brought it to you, did not you give it him to carry back?</p>
               <p>Glover. No; he never took it back; I believe he did take it over again at first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hulse. Mrs. Glover brought it to me on Tuesday, the 6th of August; I had it in my custody two or three days. I went with it to sir

               <p>Q. Is any part conveyed to you?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; on the 5th of August, I received a message from Mrs. Glover that she had seen a will; and that I might see it at Mr. Lawrence's. I had before heard a rumour of a will, and had entered a civeat; on the 6th I saw Mrs. Glover; she shewed me a will; I made my remarks, one was that, the signing was a greater distance than two inches from the writing; in the next place the paper when it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110058"/> was shewed me; though dated in 1762, was much cleaner than I could expect; and from the colour of the ink; I did not think it appeared as if it had been wrote above three days; this was last August; I then read it through; in reading, I made some remarks, and Mrs. Glover made some; she asked me what I thought of it: I said, I thought it a down right forgery, I made no observation of the hand writing, but that it was like his; my eyes are bad.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Did you ever see Sir Andrew's writing?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of any of the other writings?</p>
               <p>Hudson. There was the signing of one Tenneson who had been clerk to an attorney, and had acted for me; but I did not recollect his hand writing; I dined with them that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lloyd say any thing when the prisoners were there?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Not one word; a will was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Lawrence's, as Mrs. Glover bid you?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes; and he said he had it not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what he had done with it?</p>
               <p>Hudson. He told me Mr. Hulse was out of town, so I went home and drew up an advertisement, and put in the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Next morning in Mrs. Glover's house; she sent to me, I came to her, and she shewed me the will.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came in?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Mr. Keatly was there.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Tenneson did business both as a clerk, and on his own account?</p>
               <p>Hudson. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was an attorney, and had chambers of his own in Lincoln's Inn; you said just now it did not appear to have been wrote above three days; in the next place you say your eyes are very bad?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I can see colours very well, though I cannot see the minute stroke; I wear spectacles some time, then I can see better.</p>
               <p>Q. Why it seems very pale now; what was the difference between then and now?</p>
               <p>Hudson. The ink is altered in colour since that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positive to that?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I will swear it appeared so to me, and I believe so now.</p>
               <p>Q. You was concerned for this Mrs. Law?</p>

               <p>Hudson. Sir Andrew's first cousin.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does she live?</p>
               <p>Hudson. In Lincolnshire, on a farm that was Sir Andrew's.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been down there since Sir Andrew's death?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Who employed you?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Mr. Dearden, an attorney in the country; I am his agent.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she not in a workhouse there?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Never, that I heard of.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Mr. Dearden are in possession of all the estate, are you not?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; I am in possession of the estate, and account to Lady Chadwick for her third, her dower.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have accounted for it?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I have accounted with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you accounted with Mrs. Law?</p>
               <p>Hudson. They draw bills on me.</p>
               <p>Q. And you pay it to Dearden?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I account to Dearden.</p>
               <p>Q. Account, but do not pay the money, as I find?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes; I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How much have you in your hands?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I believe, nothing.</p>

             and gave an information there?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask any body next day, if they could remember what it was you had sworn?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; I believe they put a word or two more into my information, than came from my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say you could not recollect what you had sworn?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I believe I could, for I read it; and I believe those that know me, know I can read.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say you believed you had accused the innocent, and let the guilty go?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110059"/>Hudson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never made such a declaration to any body?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know if you did?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I cannot tell every word I have said, this six weeks, I have been hurried more than any man in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you made use of that expression?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Just now you said you would not be positive?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite positive that you never made use of such an expression?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes, I am; I suspect more people to be guilty than these people at the bar. I was always satisfied that I had done right, but was doubtful of some people I could not reach.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by the Prisoner Burch. Was not Mr. Lloyd employed by you and Mr. Dearden to get all he could out of me, in order to make up your defence against these Chadwick's, that claim'd?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And that he was paid for that purpose?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I employed him as an agent to make distresses and the like.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say if there was a possibility you would both hang Mr. Martin and me; and that you looked upon Mr. Lloyd and Mrs. Glover to reserve it equally with us?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Never, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not hesitate to shew Mr. Lloyd all the papers I brought from Ireland; when he had seen them he communicated the contents to you; these papers are such vouchers, as will perhaps take the estate another road, contrary to your wishes; these are the motives only that you persecute me for.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you seen the vouchers which this man brought over from Ireland of the pedigree of the Chadwick's?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; I had a copy of the pedigree which Lloyd gave me, which I suppose must be brought from Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. When you and Mr. Dearden took possession of the estates, did not you lower the rents, and grant leases, and buffet the poor ignorant people about, and so get into possession of what, in time, will, I believe, appear that you have no right to?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Mr. Hammond, the brewer, was represented to me as a man of good character; the house was empty, and I granted him a lease.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not there a lease signed by Sir Andrew, now extant, that Mr. Hammond has got; and is there not another granted, subsequent to that, by Mrs. Law?</p>
               <p>Hudson. There is; I granted a fresh term at a lower rent; it is a lease of the Fountain alehouse in Broad-street at 10 l. a year les s rent than it was leased at by Sir Andrew, because he was to pay the repairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not the Fountain now let for 50 l; the original rent on Sir Andrew's lease?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I hear it is; but then Mr. Hammond repairs.</p>
               <p>Court. What have you for being steward to this estate?</p>
               <p>Hudson. A shilling in the pound for receiving.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a common allowance.</p>

            . I am a conveyancer; I was concerned for sir Andrew from the year 1731 to his death.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you intimately acquainted with his manner of writing?</p>
               <p>Keatley. I was. (The forged will shown him.)</p>
               <p>Q. When first saw you that paper?</p>
               <p>Keatley. I think, the beginning of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a clean, or sullied paper then?</p>
               <p>Keatley. A clean paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it much cleaner than it is now; or did it look like a paper that had laid among others in a box?</p>
               <p>Keatley. I thought it a fresh paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation upon the colour of the ink?</p>
               <p>Keatley. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are acquainted with Sir Andrew's hand writing; now, what did you think, whether it was his hand-writing or not?</p>
               <p>Keatley. I thought then it was not; and I think so now; in the first place, I observed red strokes underneath the writing, and at the time this will bears date, my lady's sister was alive. Sir Andrew has many times spoken to me about his will. The last words I ever<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110060"/> heard from him was, I hope, in a few days, I shall see you, and then I will settle this d - d affair of mine: so he used to call the making of his will. He never came to any resolution, not knowing where to fix the reversion of his real estate; but Mrs. Humphreys being alive, he always mentioned her at all events. When I saw this will, I observed Mrs. Humphreys was not taken notice of, though she was alive. I was persuaded it was not Sir Andrew's will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Groves's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Keatley. No; I had no other reason about him than what he declared to me.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not mention any conversation you had with him; that is no evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else struck you as a reason why you thought this not to be Sir Andrew's hand?</p>
               <p>Keatley. Those I have given were the principal reasons.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, I believe, something of Sir Andrew's family; have you ever heard him speak of any brother of his?</p>
               <p>Keatley. I have heard him speak of a brother, Captain Green, by his mother, by a second husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him speak of a Thomas, William, or a

            ?</p>
               <p>Keatley. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him speak of any pedigree made out, to shew who was heir at law?</p>
               <p>Keatley. Never; I have heard him speak of relations in Lancashire.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any of the witness's writings that are supposed to be put there?</p>
               <p>Keatley. No; I never heard talk of any but Groves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Groves or sir Andrew die first?</p>
               <p>Keatley. Groves acted as executor under the will.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what sir Andrew's mother's maiden name was?</p>
               <p>Keatley. I cannot remember.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. He had often conversation with you about making his will, and called it his d - d affair?</p>
               <p>Keatley. No; his grand affair.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not chuse to entrust you with this grand affair?</p>
               <p>Keatley. True.</p>
               <p>Q. But he made this will himself after all?</p>
               <p>Keatley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, I fancy, he did not tell you all his secrets?</p>
               <p>Keatley. No; I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. As to his own family, I fancy, he was not very fond of talking about them?</p>
               <p>Keatley. I never heard him.</p>

               <p>Q. You are a legatee, I believe?</p>
               <p>Keatley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Under which will?</p>
               <p>Keatley. In this will, if it is a good one.</p>
               <p>Q. How much in this will?</p>
               <p>Keatley. 1000 l.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have been intimate with him, the space of thirty-six years?</p>
               <p>Keatley. I have known him ever since 1731, I have lived within five or six doors of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that will ever been in your custody before?</p>
               <p>Keatley. I took it to my house at the time Mrs. Glover and Mr. Hulse were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it ever less with you?</p>
               <p>Keatley. Only to look at.</p>
               <p>Q. You said there were some red strokes in in that will?</p>
               <p>Keatley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But it has been handed about a good deal; are you sure it was there at first?</p>
               <p>Keatley. Yes; that was one reason for my not thinking it genuine.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe red strokes under the subscribing of the witnesses; I observe it only under the first name?</p>
               <p>Keatley. I think there is at the d of Field's name.</p>
               <p>Q. from Burch. I think the whimsical codicils, as you call them, were secreted till after Mr. Grove died?</p>
               <p>Keatley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Burch. They were secreted till some time after Mr. Groves died, and then brought out in a surprizing manner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Glover. Was you by when the will was found of sir Andrew's?</p>
               <p>Glover. I never looked for a will of his in my life.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Mr. Groves a minister?</p>
               <p>Glover. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Of East Barnet, was he not?</p>

               <p>Q. Can you give any account where your father was in 1762?</p>
               <p>Field. He might be in London, or at his house in the country.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, when before Sir

            , on the will being produced, say that you believed it was his hand writing?</p>
               <p>Field. No; when I looked at it first, I said, it was very much like my father's hand writing; but upon examination, I did not believe it to be his.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you disbelieve it to be your father's hand writing from any other reason than by comparing it with this receipt in my hand?</p>
               <p>Field. I do not believe it to be his hand writing; I should have thought so, if I had not seen the receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has your father been dead?</p>
               <p>Field. Three years in July last.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this receipt to be your father's hand writing?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110063"/>Field. I believe it to be his; I did not see him write it.</p>

            , first of all, that you could not tell whether it was his hand writing or not?</p>
               <p>Field. At first it appeared to be like his, but on examination, I did not believe it, to the best of my knowledge, to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not say before Sir

               <p>Field. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never said you believed it to be his hand writing?</p>
               <p>Field. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say at one time you could not form a judgment, whether it was his hand writing or not?</p>
               <p>Field. I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you believed it to be his hand writing, before you examined it with any paper?</p>

               <p>Field. Yes; it struck me at first sight; but, upon examination, I thought otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know your father was acquainted with Tenneson or Grove?</p>
               <p>Field. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you make use of this expression, before Sir

               <p>Field. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear that Tenneson and your father were acquainted together?</p>
               <p>Field. I never heard his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Mr. Rose, a carpenter?</p>
               <p>Field. He and my father were acquainted together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gerrard. I am an attorney. I was acquainted with Mr. Grove. I became acquainted with him in the year 1766, and continued to be concerned for him to the time of his death.</p>
               <p>Council. Look at the will, signed S. Grove; do you believe that is Mr. Grove's hand writing?</p>
               <p>Gerrard. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have often had occasion, from being employed by him to see him write?</p>
               <p>Gerrard. Frequently; he was trustee for a great number of persons, in the York Building water works; he was trustee with Sir

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not acquainted with Mr. Grove till 1766?</p>
               <p>Gerrard. The beginning of 1766.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not have seen him write before that time?</p>
               <p>Gerrard. I have a large quantity of his writing before that time.</p>
               <p>Council. You cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Gerrard. They were deposited with me as such.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he die?</p>
               <p>Gerrard. February, 1769.</p>
               <p>Court. I believe that letter was not of his writing; he had the pally so much, he could hardly write.</p>
               <p>Gerrard. I have a good deal of his writing by me, I have seen him write when his hand shook so that he could hardly write.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he not very paralytic before his death?</p>
               <p>Gerrard. A little, not much.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was so paralytic, that he did not read prayers or preach for some time before his death.</p>
               <p>Gerrard. No; the reason he told me was, he was preaching at St. James's, and something suddenly affected his voice.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not for four or five years, before his death, I believe, read or preach?</p>
               <p>Gerrard. I believe rather more; I observed, sometimes, he did not write his name always alike; some I have where he sign'd S. Grove.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grove. I cannot see very well; I will not pretend to swear to my husband's hand writing, my sight is not good enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, at any time, been applied to for any receipts of your husband's, for any purpose?</p>
               <p>Grove. Yes, lately; about the beginning of August, I believe, by one, that calls himself, Lloyd; to see Mr. Groves's hand writing; I refused.</p>
               <p>Court. Pray can you tell what time?</p>
               <p>Grove. On the 3d of August he told me there was a will found with Mr. Grove's hand to it, and wanted to compare the hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether ever your husband employed one Field, a taylor?</p>
               <p>Grove. I never heard of his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any acquaintance as you know, with one Tenneson?</p>
               <p>Grove. I never heard his name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Whatman. I am a paper maker, and live at Maidstone, in Kent.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you make a great quantity of paper?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110064"/>Whatman. More than any body in England.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able, from a sight of any paper, to know whether that paper was manufactured at your mill, and at what time manufactured?</p>
               <p>Whatman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak with precision?</p>
               <p>Whatman. Yes, I can of any of my manufacturing; (shewing him the will.)</p>
               <p>Whatman. This paper is my make; here is J. W. in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you inform the court and jury of the time that it was made?</p>
               <p>Whatman. Yes; I have taken pains to speak with precision of it; here is some samples of the same that I sealed up at home, and shewed before the grand jury; it has been sealed up and never opened since.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak from your own knowledge, without comparing the paper?</p>
               <p>Whatman. I can with certainty.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you form your judgment merely from the J. W. or other marks?</p>
               <p>Whatman. From other marks; these are a particular mould; they were first began to be used in January 1768; I can swear positively to that; this is made on a mould, which is the first mould in which two sheets of this kind of paper was made at once; I am the first person that made it double, two sheets at once, they were in January, 1768; and the first made from these moulds, that was ever sent to London, was the 11th of March, 1768. I will give another convincing proof of it; here is an improvement of our manufactory in this sheet, in regard to blueing it; formerly our papers were of a very yellow cast; we have improved the manufactory, by throwing blue into it, as people do in washing into linen, in order to take off the yellow cast; the first of my doing that, was in April, 1765; this is very blue; so that I do not believe it has been made more than a twelvemonth: if you please to compare it with paper made seven or ten years ago, there is an amazing difference.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not any body copy your mark?</p>
               <p>Whatman. I have ordered several pair of moulds to be made alike, but never saw any two pair alike; they will differ in a wire, or something. I could have brought up twenty or thirty people to swear that sheet is of my manufactory. I have, for the prisoners sake taken a great deal or care, that I might speak with precision.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never make any paper of that sort before?</p>
               <p>Whatman. Not before the year 1768.</p>
               <p>Q. But had your paper, of 1768, he same mark of J. W.?</p>
               <p>Whatman. Yes; but not exactly alike.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other reason?</p>
               <p>Whatman.

               <p>Court. Now show me a J. W. when you changed it.</p>
               <p>Whatman. The first J. W. without a cypher is 1764; these are the first pair without a cypher. I never saw any paper with J. W. in it but mine.</p>
               <p>Jury. Will not the blueness wear off by time?</p>
               <p>Whatman. Yes; and this is so blue, it convinces me it has been made but a short time.</p>

            's, about two months ago; I cannot be particular to the time, more than that I think he said they were of no use to him; only that he looked upon a codicil of Sir Andrew's to be forged, and wanted to set it aside.

               <p>Q. Before you had seen the pedigree you called at my house, and said that Lloyd was employed by Hudson to get what he could out of me; you then made this observation, that Lloyd was an honest, punctual man, and true to his trust ; that I must not trust him with secrets.</p>
               <p>Kimbel. Yes; I said I always found Lloyd true to his trust, and as he was employed by the other parties I was certain he would stick by them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you hear Lloyd say that sir Andrew said in his life time, he would be a plague to his lady and family in his grave?</p>
               <p>Kimbell. He did not say he would be a plague to his lady, but that many that expected benefit by him after his death would be plagued to get it.</p>

               <p>I neither forged the will or did I publish it. I only acquainted Mr. Lloyd that there were such papers, and he desired very much to see them; he had them, there were two wills thrown down to him; he had a right to take which he pleased; Mr. Martin said, there they are, it they are of any use take them; I desired no see or reward for them; Mr. Lloyd had liberty to take and peruse what he pleased; such as he did not like he threw aside; the first I heard of this will was when I was in the Borough, settling some business with Mr. Martin, he hearing that I had lately come from Ireland; after our business was finished, he said, he had some papers with the name of Chadwick upon them; I desired some time after to see the papers; when I had seen them: I told Mr. Martin and Mrs' Brooks that I did not know whether they were of any material use, for there was a will produced of a later date; I called again about four months afterwards, and brought that pedigree with me, which corresponded with what came from Ireland with the rest of the papers, under the city seal of Dublin, which sets forth all Sir Andrew's brothers; here is a gentleman in court that has taken exact copies of the book; here is a certificate under the hand of the Accomptant General of Ireland, who knows Sir Andrew's brother, Peter; Mr. Lloyd was desirous to have these papers for Mr. Hudson, I told him I would introduce him to the person that had them; he made several overtures to me, he offered me money to introduce him to the person; I at last told him what they were; he had the papers, he did not choose to take the will of 1764, but that of 1762, to Mrs. Glover, I think he brought it back again; that is all I know of the matter, till we came to Sir

               <p>Brooks. Martin brought him with him to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What papers were there?</p>
               <p>Brooks. There were two wills and a parcel of papers, which I found in the drawers, in the bed room of the first floor, Mrs. Lutterel's room; she had been a lodger of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What was she?</p>

               <p>Brooks. The next morning after she went away; she lived with me about five or six months; I did not know that the papers were good for any thing; I put them up into a garret that I made no use of, at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the papers before you put them up?</p>

               <p>Q. You never opened them?</p>
               <p>Brooks I just opened them, but did not read them; I could not read them.</p>

No; on Tuesday Burch came again and said, he wanted the other will; and in the evening he called again, and said he had brought the other will back again; then he said, he put it among the rest of the papers; I cannot say he did, I did not see it; they were on the dining room table; he might possibly put it in the rest of the bundle; I cannot say I saw him put it in.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are in no way of business?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No.</p>
               <p>Q. May I presume to ask you by what means you get a livelihood?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I do nothing dishonest to get a livelihood.</p>
               <p>Q. No; God forbids I only thought it would be proper to ask that question.</p>
               <p>Brooks. I have two children by a gentleman that has maintained me this six or seven years past.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in any business when this gentlewoman lodged with you?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes; I had a husband at that time, and a son.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you expected this young woman would call again for these papers?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I thought if the papers were of any consequence she would call again, she was in my debt, I took a good deal of trouble to find her; about four months after I found her; I mentioned these papers, she left behind her, and she told me she would pay me and fetch them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not, any time before you saw this Lutterel, open this bundle?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I opened it and looked in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see?</p>
               <p>Brooks. A parcel of papers.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to say, when you first opened the papers, that you saw a will?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I did not take any notice then what they were.</p>
               <p>Q. You took no notice of a will at that time?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Lutterel, you said something about these papers?</p>
               <p>Brooks. She said she would fetch them, and pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how long it was before you removed them into the book-case?</p>
               <p>Brooks. That was when I removed.</p>
               <p>Q. A book case with glass or wooden doors?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Looking glass doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not speak to any body about these papers, till last Christmas?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No; they were tumbled about, and I thought them papers of no consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they when you looked at them this last time?</p>
               <p>Brooks. On the table; when I removed into Grafton-street, I put them in a book case; they were in my way in the book-case; I was taking them out to put them in the garret, when Martin came I was looking for a paper of my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell 
               <persName id="t17710911-64-person719">

             any thing about these papers?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he examine them one by one, or how?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I was busy about the house; I cannot say as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he inform you what they were?</p>
               <p>Brooks. He said there were two wills.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it right of you, when you had these bundles of a gentlewoman, to let other people have them?</p>
               <p>Brooks. She never came to pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. Burch came a fortnight after Christmas?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I believe not quite so much, he came about a week before Christmas, and about a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see all the papers?</p>
               <p>Brooks. To the best of my remembrance on the Wednesday; they were left in my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with them?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I burnt them.</p>
               <p>Q. After having kept them so long as between five and six years, what induced you to burn the rest of the papers?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110069"/>Brooks. When I went to the gentleman's chambers, in the Temple, there was this gentleman came in, and said it was a forged will, and we were all concerned in it, and said, we should all be hanged; he frightened me so, that I was not myself a week after; so I went home, and burnt the rest of the papers.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did nobody desire you to burn them?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any one of the wills burnt?</p>
               <p>Brooks. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a will brought; what is become of that?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. But there was a will brought back?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. But if there was, it was burnt as well as the rest of the papers?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I burnt them all.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether he put the will back or not?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No; I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this Lutterel kept by a gentleman?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He came backwards and forwards, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who used to pay, the rent, he or she?</p>
               <p>Brooks. She.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that gentleman's name?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was Chadwick?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No; I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time your brother opened these papers, did you stand close to him?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No; I was going backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot say what papers he found at this time?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I am sure the parcel of papers, and these two wills.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen these two wills in the bundles, before Martin your brother opened it?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes; several times.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you never opened the bundle but the morning after Mrs. Lutterel left your house, and then you did not take notice what was in it.</p>
               <p>Brooks. I did not then.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you opened the bundle, during the time that they lay in the garret in your first house, and that when you removed to Grafton-street, you put them in your bookcase?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever opened them then till your brother Martin came and opened them?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I opened them when I first went to the house, in Grafton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before your brother Martin came and opened them?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Two years; or above a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on your oath, did you know what these papers were, before your brother Martin came?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why was it you said to your brother that there were some papers left by a lodger, but you did not know what they were; cannot you read?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes; but I could read very little of these papers.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you there?</p>
               <p>Corneck. My wife and I were benighted, and we went together to lie at a house in Bluecoat-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body lie in the same room but you and your wife?</p>
               <p>Corneck. There was nobody there at night. I saw the prisoner at the bar there in the morning, and the buckles were found on him; the woman that stands here handed the buckles to my wife under the table, and she to me.</p>

I am his wife; I was with him at this lodging house; about four in the morning, on the 10th of August, we had a pint of beer, and he missed his buckles cut of his shoes; he got up and searched all about beside the curtains of the other bed; I saw the prisoner get up; and go down with his coat in his hand; we went to Mr. Heans's, where he was quartered, but he was not there; I went down, and saw the soldier doing something to the knees of his breeches. I said, John, I believe here is the man. Mr. Evans said he was an officer, so we gave charge of him; he said he had as lief be transported: he could live as well abroad as here. The girl said, if you have the buckles, give them to the prosecutor, that there may be no more of it; he pulled them out from under his breeches knees, wrapped up in a piece of news paper. All that he had to say, was, that he was in liquor.</p>

            , the accomplice. Penn and I set off, to morrow will be eight weeks, at night a robbing; we went as far as Mother Red Cap's, and had two pints of cyder; and then we went to Enfield Chase; where we stopped till a coach went by; we followed the coach; but thinking there was a guard with it, we let it alone: coming back, we met the Derby Fly, and stopped it, and robbed it of a gold watch, and a pinchbeck watch, in a shagreen case. I was taken on Saturday morning, in Hartshorn court, Golden lane, in Payne's room; I put the watch in Payne's chest; that is all I know about it.</p>

               <p>Lee. Yes; about six in the evening, Penn and Elmore had two horses of me, to go to Blackwall; Elmore came for them, and took them to the Bull; there Lee mounted one and Penn the other. I never saw Penn before; he was recommended to me by the person who keeps the Roe Buck.</p>
               <p>Penn. I hired the horses to take my wife a nd children into the country to their mother.</p>
               <p>Fanny White. Penn and Lee were at my house on the 26th of July, the same night they committed the robbery, at Mother Red Cap's at the foot of Highgate hill; they drank two pints of cyder; I am sure he is the man; he was not in the house, but at the door.</p>

            . When were the horses brought home?</p>
               <p>Lee. Next morning, about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought them?</p>
               <p>Lee. Elmore; he rode one and led the other, as he did before.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he appear; was he hard rode?</p>
               <p>Lee. No; he was in very good order.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lee the evidence. What time was you taken?</p>
               <p>Lee. About seven in the morning; Penn and I came to town together, to the Spread Eagle, in Gracechurch street, about four in the morning; there we put our horses up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else with you?</p>
               <p>Lee. No; from thence we went to Payne's, and between six and seven Penn got up and went to desire Elmore to carry home the horses, as he hired them. I did not see Penn any more till he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. to Broadhurst. Where did you take Payne?</p>
               <p>Broadhurst. In Hartshorn court, Golden lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with him?</p>
               <p>Broadhurst. The evidence was in bed with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took Penn?</p>
               <p>Broadhurst. I do not know; I went with Penn to Payne's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Payne in the house when you came in?</p>
               <p>Broadhurst. Yes; he was in bed in the same room as we lay down in afterwards; there was only one, and we all three lay down on it.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not know what you had been about?</p>
               <p>Broadhurst. At first we knocked; he said who is there; I said Penn and I have been on the marble, and desired him to let us lie down a little.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by being on the ramble?</p>

               <p>Broadhurst. Being out all night.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not know what you had been upon.</p>
               <p>Broadhurst. No; he said you have waked me out of my sleep; I have got the rheumatism; he soon went to sleep again, and we lay down.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to put the watch and pistols in the chest?</p>
               <p>Broadburst. Because we had not room for them in our pocket; and as the chest was open, we put in the watch in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Was you robbed by one man or two?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. One man; the other was on the other side of the coach; there were two in company; it was light enough to see them; I can be very certain to both their faces; it was light enough for that.</p>

On the twenty-fifth of July, I was informed, by one Barclay, one of our men, who worked in the same shop with the prisoner; that he suspected the prisoner was not honest, for he had seen him go up into the warping rooms, at the time the other men were absent; and that the appearance of his pockets made him suspect he had taken something. I saw the prisoner a going out soon after nine o'clock; I called two or three times to him, and bid him stop; I went into the compting-house, expecting he would follow me; I staid talking to a person there two or three minutes; the prisoner not coming to the compting-house, I kept out; I found the prisoner was not gone up into the workshop; I concluded he was gone into the yard. There is at the end of the shed a tub where the men make water; there is place beyond the tub, so dark, that I could not distinguish any body; there I searched about the yard, but could not find him; I called several times; at last he came out; he was got beyond the watering tub a yard and a half, or more; he came out, and said he had got the gravel very bad; I said he had no business there, if he had. I brought him back to the shop door; then he bent himself almost double, and said he had a very bad fit of the gravel, and must go back again. He went back; I was almost close to him; he had one hand at his breeches at the watering tub, as if he was going to unbutton it; I saw him make a motion, from his pocket, with his hand; then he shifted his hand, and made the same kind of motion from his other pocket; I suspected him, but it was so dark, that I could not see what he took from his pockets. I called for a candle; when the light came, I found six bobbins of silk at the prisoner's feet. I am confident that they were not there two minutes before, for I stood in that place before; when I looked further I found six other bobbins piled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110075"/> up together, about a yard and half from the tub.

               <p>Melone. Yes; I think I could swear to it; afterwards, while the deceased and I were in the room, the door was shut fast upon us; the deceased gave it a shake, but could not get it open, with that, he lifted up the sash, and got out at the window, on the green; being fastened in, I gave the door a shake, and it came open.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not quite sober?</p>
               <p>Melone. I was not, I walked down stairs and stood along with Brackstone; she rapped out a wicked oath, what it was, I cannot say; that the first man that broke the door open, she would knock his brains out with a poker.</p>
               <p>Q. What door did she mean?</p>

               <p>Q. With which end of the poker did she strike him?</p>
               <p>Melone. I believe on the upper end; this was between four and five, or six, in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door open or shut?</p>

               <p>Q. And upon that Brackstone hit him over the head with the poker?</p>
               <p>Melone. She said the first that entered the room, she would split his scull with the poker; the deceased having his foot within the threshold, she hit him with the poker.</p>

They were both a bed; I came down stairs, took my children in my arms, and went to bed. I saw no more.</p>
               <p>Q. from Cole. What time did you go to bed that night?</p>
               <p>Colley. Between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Surgeon. When you examined the head, did you see more than the mark of one blow?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ludlow. There was on the opposite and inside a very small erasion of the skin, but nothing of any consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Where did that blow fall, do you say?</p>
               <p>Colley. On the right side of his head.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Surgeon. Was it on the right side of the head?</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to let him do this when he was in this way?</p>
               <p>Davis. I could not prevail with him to go home; the first night I lit of him; I came up from Woolwich; he seemed very much in liquor, and he desired me to go along with him; we went down to one Mr. Whitting's, there we had two or three pots of beer, I cannot say justly; then we came up Gravel Lane, to the sign of the Swan and Rummer, there we had some bread and cheese, some salmon, and some more beer; after that I followed him and brought him in again; he wanted to get him down to Black Horse Yard; I wanted to get him home to Mr. Seamore's; I brought him in, he fainted away three or four times in my arms; all his cry was, oh, my girl, my girl. I could not prevail on him to go home to Mr. Seymoor's; he went into an alehouse and wanted to fight; he went and knocked at a door in Black Horse Yard; they would not let him in, so he laid down upon the stones at the door; I endeavoured to awake him, but I could not, so I laid down with him. He lived in a very irregular manner for six or seven days. He was seen to drink seventeen half quarterns of gin in two hours.</p>

               <p>- Burton. I am wife to the prosecutor. The prisoner came to our shop on the 20th of July. I keep a cheesemonger's shop; she told me to send a lump of butter, and a groatsworth of eggs, to one Mr. Scott's, a watch-maker's, in a court, in Red-cross-street. I did not know the place by name; she said I must send her change for a guinea; I wrapped up half a guinea, a six and nine-pence, two shillings in silver, and five pennyworth of halfpence. I sent the goods and the change by my little girl; she came back with the butter and eggs, and told me that the woman had led her to a different place; and had taken the money from her. She was taken up the se'nnight afterwards: she denied it when we took her up.</p>

I would not have let her had it, if she had not forced it out of my hand. She bid me go to No. 4, in Nixon's-square, to one Mr. Scott's, a watch-maker; I went there; they knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you cry out?</p>
               <p>Burton. It was in the dead part of the alley; I was afraid of her. On the Monday sennight after I met her in Barbican; I knew her again; I catched hold of her, I called out for assistance; some people came to me, and I brought her home to my mother's; she knew me again; she was not willing to go.</p>

I had hold of Mr. Morgan's arm; before I saw the men I was struck on the breast, and fell down on my back into the rut; one fellow snapt the pistol several times at my head, another turned my pockets inside out, while I was on my back; there was taken from me a five and threepence or a half guinea, three or four shillings, and a few halfpence, and in the pocket where the five and threepence or half guinea was, I had an amothyst ring, set in gold; also a key and a silver seal, which I found afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of their persons?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes, Thompson; he had then on a blue waistcoat; there were two more; there is one turned evidence. I have great reason to believe Hogans to be one; I have some recollection of his person and face; as to Thompson, his face was very close to mine. The next morning a poor woman, going to market, picked up my friend's keys and mine on the very spot. She sold the seal for two shillings, the weight of the silver, which I have got again. They were taken up on Sunday, and I saw them on the Tuesday following before the justice. I pitched on Thompson; I was positive to him; and the other I was almost sure of.</p>
               <p>Thompson. He swore to another man before justice Sherwood.</p>

               <p>- Farrel. I attended at justice Sherwood's office. I have an office in New Prison; an information came to our office last Friday was three weeks; wherein a description was given of the prisoners. There was a man in New Prison said two people came to buy pistols of him; he described one of the prisoners, who I said I believed, I knew. I went down to East Smithfield, to Parrot alley; I went into a house there, and found Thompson and Priestly sitting by a table; they had been eating, I believe. I said how are you, I have a warrant against you, on suspicion of a robbery; no, said one Smith, for shoes; he advised me to say it was not for a robbery, but for three dozen of shoes. We searched the house for pistols, but we could not find any thing; we took them to justice Sherwood's; in going along we met Phillips; he said Thomas, what is the matter; he made answer, nothing of any hurt; he followed them to Fox's lane, Shadwell; he wanted sadly to know what was the matter; he went down Fox's lane; we then went and took hold of him, and brought him with us into a p ublic house; he did not know what he was taken up for; we put them into the watch house till Monday for further examination. On the Friday, which was the last examination, when they were going to Newgate, I said to Phillips, you see the prosecutor has sworn to you; if you know any thing you had better speak of it; he said he knew nothing of any shoes, but he did of some other thing; he told us that Thompson and the other were the first that stopped Mr. Morgan; he said he had not much money; then Thompson run the pistol in his eye, and beat him over his head with it; afterwards he said that Mr. Price was attacked by Hogans, and the little one, while they had Mr. Morgan down.</p>

               <p>Phillips. Yes; we met two gentlemen; I and Thompson went up to the first, and told him to deliver his money, or we should take his life; one of the gentlemen made a little resistance; I and Thompson got one down on his back; Thompson struck him on the face with a pistol, and then took what money he had from him, and his pocket book, and directly when we had done with the pistol's we handed it over to Hogan, and they took some money and a ring from the other gentleman, I don't know how much.</p>

Before the justice we pitched on these four; having heard of the poor woman's having the ring, we went down to Limehouse to her; on coming back we called at the justice's, to tell him of the success we had had; and before we came, they had returned; and one of them had turned evidence.</p>

I searched the prisoner's room, on Sunday the first of this month; I went up into the garret; the prisoner's wife was there; she was just delivered; I took the midwife and another woman into a back-room, and asked if that was Thwaite's lodging; one of the women said no, his apartment was the room under it; and that the landlady had lent Thwaites's wife the garret whilst she lay in. I asked if Thwaites's room was locked; they said they believed it was. I saw the key upon a table in the back room; I took the key and desired the midwife to go with me, which she did: I saw a cupboard, the door of which was half open; there I fo und a pistol, a chissel, and a powder-horn (producing them;) I shewed them to the midwife, and this table clock.</p>

I said, No; the woman of the house said she wou'd take her oath that I had not been out of the room; he whispered me again, and said, the clock is gone; I said d - n you and the clock too; I don't care any thing about it.</p>

            . I am fifteen years of age; my father lives opposite. I saw the prisoner roll fix eighteen gallon casks into the cellar, they were empty I know.</p>
               <p>- Outterbridge. I saw the cellar open; I thought there was somebody in the cellar; the prisoner put his head out of the door; a sailor that was with me asked for some beer; he said he had no mug; I went to borrow a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110090"/> mug, and found the sailor helping the prisoner to get some casks out of the cellar, and I assisted him; he was dressed in a brewer's frock, a red waistcoat, and red cap: I thought he was the brewer's servant. Afterwards I suspected him, and informed the brewer; he was taken up afterwards.</p>

Soon after, the two prisoners, both of whom I had known a great while, came out of Darkhouse lane, and the foreman of the lighter with them; they came to Botolph's wharf, they stood talking together there, and Bowler parted from them; he came as far as Hammond's; they looked about, as if looking to see if the coast was clear; I was standing by at that time; I believe Bowler did not see me; he cried out to the other, come, it will do; Bowler threw his pipe out of his mouth, and Hammock came up; they passed within a yard and a half of me. I got into the crane in order to see what they were doing; I could not see them well there; I went to Fresh wharf, and told what I had seen; they came along to the key with me. I looked over; I could not see what they were doing in the lighters; the watchman left his lanthorn, and he went away; then I called one Collins, and told him what I had seen; he went and told Webster and Clayton; we all agreed to go down the ladder into the hoy; and then we went into the skiff belonging to the lighter, and from there went to the lighter; I lifted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110091"/> the scuttle and there saw the two prisoners; one was stripped, raking out the sugar with his hands, with his head in the hogshead; the other held a candle to him. I said, so then, you are here; I think I have got you now; I know you well. Clayton said be quiet; if any one comes up I'll blow his brains out; he said this to alarm them below, though he had no fire arms; we stood on the scuttle hole, not being aware of any other way by which these people could get out of the lighter; but in that we were mistaken, for Bowler got under the tarpaulin, along by the hogsheads, to the stern of the lighter, and so by a rope, that ran from the hoy to a pole, along side the wharf; he got to that pole, climbed up it, and got on the wharf; I halloo'd out; no assistance came: Bowler began throwing large stones at us; while we were endeavouring to screen ourselves from the stones, Hammock came up, got across the end of the hoy, and so got on shore. Then we got a light and examined what they had been about; we found two bags full of sugar, and a handkerchief that was not full. One hogshead was open, and a quantity of sugar was taken out; Bowler's hat and wig, and Hammock's coat lay there. There was a four bushel bag and two empty bags besides; each held about a hundred weight. I went and called up the merchant's constable, Hinton. There was two hundred and seven pound, including bags. I have known the prisoners between three and four years; they are lightermen, belonging to Wiggan's key; they were taken next night.</p>
               <p>- Webster, the other watchman. I had charge of a lighter there. Butler and Clayton went down into the lighter; Butler opened the scuttle, where I saw a light, then shut the scuttle down again; Butler said here they are, and called for the watchman to assist. After Butler had shut down the scuttle again, the prisoner, Bowler, got under the tarpawling, and so got ashore, and then threw stones at us; while he was about that, Hammock got over the hoy, and so got on shore. I have known Hammock a good many years; I know Bowler's face very well.</p>
               <p>- Clayton. I was informed there were two people a robbing the lighter, they both got on shore, as the other witnesses have described. I did not see them plain enough to know them.</p>
               <p>- Linton. I am a constable. I was called up by the witnesses, they all declared then that Hammock and Bowler were the men that had robbed the lighter; the cloaths have never been claimed.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence.</p>

She asked the price of another piece of lace; I told her 3 s. she offered a less price; Mr. Faulkner answered, rather quick, that he could take no less; she was going out, Mr. Falkner brought her back within two or three yards from where I stood. I had removed from behind the counter, and came and stood at the end of the counter, the further end of the shop. I saw this piece of lace, (producing it,) drop from the prisoner; where it dropped from I cannot take upon me to say. I took it up and said we need not search her, here the lace is.</p>

               <p>Todd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come by it?</p>
               <p>Todd. On the 22d of June, the day that the first came to the post office, the inspectors of franks supposed them to be counterfeit; they brought them to the secretary's office. Mr. Williams, the person it is directed to, was sent for to the post office; he came, and was told that they were supposed to be counterfeit franks.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to avoid an objection to your relating of any conversation that passed between you and Mr. Williams, which would not be evidence to affect the prisoner, I would desire to know-if in-conversation from any thing passing between you and Mr. Williams, the prisoner was sent for?</p>
               <p>Todd. Mr. Williams himself brought him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask the prisoner about these franks?</p>
               <p>Todd. Mr. Todd, the secretary, did, in my presence; he said he had had a frank or two of Sir 
               <persName id="t17710911-101-person1077">
                  George

               <p>Q. to Mr. Fortesque. You said just now, you knew Sir

               <p>Fortesque. Yes.</p>

               <p>Fortesque. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Now is either of these his hand writing?</p>
               <p>Fortesque. Indeed neither the one nor the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they at all like his name?</p>
               <p>Fortesque. They are a very bad counterfeit of his name.</p>

               <p>Q. You think this is not at all like it?</p>
               <p>Fortesque. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Todd. Did this letter come by the post from any place.</p>
               <p>Todd. Yes; from Edinburgh.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say he franked these?</p>
               <p>Todd. At Mr. Williams's lodging, in Walbrook.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- Gibson. I live in Birchin lane; I am a glazier. I have known the prisoner upwards of four months, as long as he has been in England; he came from Edinburgh; he has been remarkably sober and regular since he has been with me; he is appointed a surgeon to an East Indiaman.</p>
               <p>- Dickins. I know his friends in Ireland they live in very good credit; I did not know him till I saw him here; I heard, before I came here, that he is a very good lad; I know by his neighbours, that he has the best of characters.</p>
               <p>- Thornton. I am a glazier in Fleet street. I have known him since he came from Ireland, he is a surgeon and apothecary; I have heard a good character of him.</p>

               <p>I met a friend of mine, who is a gentleman's servant; he said he had a saddle to dispose of; he asked me twenty-seven shillings for it; I said seventeen was nearer the matter. I walked with him to Turnstile, there we stopped. I said I will give you as much as any body; he said it was his own property. I told him I would give him a guinea, and that was the full value; he said he had another that was old, but it had a good bridle. I gave him a direction where I lived, and told him I should be at home in an hour. I went home about twelve o'clock; he had left that saddle and was gone home for the other; there were two women saw me buy them, one of them is ill, or she would have been here; there was a gentleman's servant too that knew of my buying them, but he is gone out of town. I paid for them about one o'clock, at my own house; I would not carry them home because I was going about some business, and being dressed pretty clean, I did not like to carry the saddles. It was in the month of June that I bought them. I intended to buy a horse the Friday following, in Smithfield.</p>

            . I lodge at the Anchor and Crown, in St. Martin's lane. I have been out of place three weeks. I know the prisoner at the bar very well, he lives in - I have forgot the name of the place, but I know it very well. I was there on a Monday afternoon; I went to drink a dish of tea; a young man came there with a saddle; he left that and went for another; they came to a guinea and a half; he had brown clothes on, like a gentleman's servant; I saw him write, but I could not read it.</p>

            . I am a constable, in Shoreditch parish. About twelve o'clock at night, Knight pitched a bag, near the Spotted Horse, Shoreditch; the watchman came and told me he believed it was stolen. Harding was near the watch-house door; he ordered Knight to go away with it; my brother officer said, he believed it was indigo; we asked Harding where he was going with it; he said to Mrs. O'Neale's, in Islington Road. We went with him to Mr. O'Neale's; Harding called out aloud, Mr. O'Neale's, here is a parcel come out of the country. Mrs. O'Neale came down. I asked her if she expected any parcel out of the country; she said no; she had no bill of parcels; so I took them back to the watch-house: Harding<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110045"/> there said he had bought it at St. Edmund's Bury, at 6 s. and 6 d. per pound, and he could not make more than 7 s. and 6 d. of it. The next day he said he brought it to town by getting lists of the waggons. I took him before justice Camper; he brought one Nugent next day to prove that he bought it at St. Edmund's Bury; then he said he was to give 5 s. and 6 d. before he said 6 s. and 6 d. per pound.</p>

               <p>Burridge. He said so I am certain; he said he hired Knight; first he said at Bow, then at Cheapside, then he said at Cheapside Bow.</p>

I saw some indigo out of one cask, that is a particular importation that belonged to one particular merchant; there was eleven casks of it, and nine of them sold to a person that went abroad directly; I had the other two.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sold any quantity of it?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. None of it with the mark on it, not an ounce; there were others; I know very well the particular casks, that had no mark on; it is this I am sure of, and I am sure I parted with none of it in the state it is in; it is marked W. M. it was made by one

               <p>Reynolds. It is some of the best I ever saw; and I believe the other to be mine. When I took some few pieces out of the bag I went home and compared them with several other casks, for indigo has this particular circumstance in it, that you seldom see two casks alike. I compared it with some of mine, and it matched. I went to the rotation-office, and took out a warrant against

               <p>Q. I do not suppose you will swear to any of the other indigo, but the marked indigo?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. I do not chuse to do that; I verily believe it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were eleven casks?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. Yes.</p>

               <p>Reynolds. No.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose that these eleven casks of indigo were hardly all the maker made in his life time?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. I cannot answer that.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that this was all he made with a mark?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. He assigned it all over to Hudley and company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he never set his mark on his indigo before?</p>

               <p>Reynolds. In a cellar.</p>

            ; I bought it at the crown, in Church street; he told me he came very honestly by it, and dealt very largely in it. I gave him seventeen pounds worth of handkerchiefs for it; It was about the 20th of July, to the best of my knowledge. I had occasion to call on several different tanners on the road, about hair I had sent to me from London. I came on to Epping, it was near night; I got into a coach; with the fatigue of the journey I fell asleep. I awaked near Bow Church; I called for a porter, and agreed with him to carry the parcel to Shoreditch. I had directions from the country to get some other goods at the Spotted Horse; I went there, but they were in bed; so I went to this O'Neale's, as I had dealt with him before, to leave the indigo at his house, as I knew it would be safe there. I did not say it was his parcel; I only meant to ask if he had any hair coming out of the country. I have had a licence these nine years; here it is.</p>
