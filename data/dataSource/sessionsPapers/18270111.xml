            . I am a constable. On the 29th of December, about six o'clock in the evening. I was in Greek-street, Soho, and observed the prisoner and two others standing at Mr. 
               <persName id="t18270111-1-person82">Rudduck</persName>
            's shop window - I walked up the street, a little way above the house, suspecting them; I crossed over, and when I came opposite the house I saw the prisoner run away, with something under his arm; his two companions followed him - I pursued, and saw them all three stop at the corner of Frith-street; at the top of Queen-street I observed the prisoner standing against the rails, and his two companions standing before him, hiding him. I pushed them aside, laid hold of the prisoner, and asked him where he got that coat, which I thought it was then, it being dark - he said, "It is my coat;" I asked where he got it - he said it was his coat, threw it at me, and said, "Take it" - he ran away; I pursued; he said to one of his companions, "Trip him up," which he attempted to do. I still followed - he was never more tham two or three yards from me; I caught him in Dean-street - he was never out of my sight; there was a handkerchief with it, which he was trying to wrap it in when I went up - it was very dark; Mr. Rudduck's shop window was not lighted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me break the window? A. No, nor did I see him take the cloth out of it; he ran down Frith-street, across Compton-street, into Dean-street, which is only two streets from where he drew it at me; I caught hold of him two or three times - he was never more than three yards from me - it was very light in Compton-street; I had the cloth in my hand, or I should have taken him before; I kept calling Stop thief! but nobody offered to stop him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am not the person whom he took with the cloth; I never saw the handkerchief that was round it in my life. I was taken four streets from the place. Witness. I took no person but him - he threw the cloth at me - and as I was going to the office he told me that when he had the cloth in his hand he thought it d - d coarse stuff. <rs id="t18270111-1-verdict6" type="verdictDescription">

On the 31st of December, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was in the parlour adjoining the surgery, and heard a weight fall off the lock of the door - we had placed it there to give an alarm when any one entered; the door was shut, and the catch had fastened; I did not hear the door open, but heard the weight fall; I immediately went into the shop, which is part of the dwelling-house, and missed my hat and gloves. I found the door open. I went out, and saw the prisoner turning the corner about thirty yards off, with a hat in his hand; I followed him across Nutford-place - I had lost sight of him for about a minute and a half, when he turned the corner - nobody else was near; I went directly to the corner, and saw him cross Nutford-place into Little Queen-street - he had still got the hat, and is the same person; I followed him across Great Queen-street into Newland-street - I called Stop thief! there - two other persons were standing a few doors down the street; they made no attempt to follow him, and about fifty yards before I caught him he threw the hat away - I still followed; he ran right against a dead wall, stopped short, and turned round towards me, walking, and I collared him - I am quite positive he is the person; I asked what he had done with the hat which he had taken from the shop - he denied all knowledge of it; I called to Poole, the watchman, who took him - a person brought me my hat and gloves immediately after I took him. When we got to the watch-house he said he was sick - we said it was no such thing; he then said, "I am not sick - I am drunk," but he was not so. I returned home, and missed my great coat from the same seat the hat was taken from - I have not found that. I saw nobody but him when I first went into the street. I went to the shop about three minutes after I heard the weight fall.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I went to Lord Belfast's about half-past eight o'clock on this night, and about nine o'clock the butler fetched me down stairs - I found him with the desk and the prisoner in custody; I took her up to her ladyship, who knew her; I asked her name and address, which she gave me - I asked her what had become of the property out of the desk - she told her ladyship she was the person who had taken it, but she had taken nothing out except the watch, which she had pawned for 35s., in Tottenham-court-road, and she gave me 30s. of the money; there were some books, a portrait, and several other things in the desk, which I gave up; I went to Mr. Lowther's, the pawnbroker's, where she said she had pawned the watch, and found it there, pawned in the name of Smith, for 35s., as she stated; she told me where she took the desk, and I went and apprehended Lilly and Owen - she said she came there to borrow a few shillings of the housekeeper, as her family were in great distress at home, and had no bread to eat, and that seeing nobody down stairs the devil tempted her to go up into the library, and take this desk, and she was very unhappy till she brought it back, and put it at the door; she said she had given Owen 5s. for her trouble, and when I apprehended Owen she gave me the 5s. piece again.</p>

I came home about half-past seven o'clock; she went out on an errand, and returned in five minutes, with the prisoner, saying, in her presence,"Here is Mrs. Baldwin, who has found a little box, will you give her leave to open it?" - I examined it, and said,"Have you found this?" she said, Yes, on the step of a door, and would I be so good as to try and open it - I took the hammer, and struck the brass-work in front, but it not coming open I put down the hammer, and begged her to let it be, as she would get a better reward if it was not opened; she said, "No, I am determined to see what is in it, as I have found it," and opened it herself - her back was towards me, and I did not exactly know how she opened it. I saw the watch in her hand; I kept my seat, and did not get up to look in the desk; she asked Owen to accompany her to raise something on the watch - they went out, returned, and told me what they had got for it- I began to think things were not right, and begged her to take the desk home again from where she got it, and as I persuaded her, she packed it up in brown paper, and asked Owen to accompany her; the prisoner took it out under her cloak, as she had brought it in.</p>

            . The prisoner could get to the back stairs through a passage which leads to the kitchen; she could avoid the kitchen. The area-door had been left unlocked longer than usual, but there are two doors before that in the passage - I cannot say whether they were fastened - they might be ajar; if so she could get to the library without opening any door, but there is a door on the top of the stairs, which has a spring-lock - it is possible that might have been open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went down the area, not intending to steal, but I was in great distress - my children wanted bread; I thought I should find the housekeeper in the nursery, but as I went up stairs, seeing this door open, in an evil moment my distress tempted me to take it; the moment I got out I regretted what I had done, but the area was closed, and I could not return.</p>

On Monday morning, the 11th of December, about half-past three o'clock, I was on duty in King-street, three or four hundred yards from Crown-court, which is in the parish of St. James - the prisoner passed me on the other side of the way, and turned own Hayes-court; seeing something concealed under her shawl I stepped up to her, and said,"What have you got here, mistress?" she said a coat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110006"/>and trousers; as I took her to the watch-house she desired me several times not to take her, and said if I would not it lay in her power to do me some good; when we got to the watch-house I found she had this coat and trunsers tied in a handkerchief, in a rumpled manner, and also a towel; there was a half-crown, three sixpences, and a halfpenny in the trousers pocket; she said a man named Rusby gave them to her in Crown-court, and three minutes afterwards she said his name was Burn; I do not know any persons of those names.</p>

            . This coat and trousers are mine; the gloves were in the pocket; the towel was in my room, but it belongs to John Graham, my landlord - there is some blood on it, which came from my nose.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He met me in the court, and took me up to his room; he tied up these things, and gave them to me, saying he was going into the country, and should return in six weeks, and would call for them - that he had earned but 3s. 6d. that week, and was going to the country. I desired the watchman not to take me, not being accustomed to such things.</p>

             re-examined. Mine is a first floor back room; there are some long leads lead along under the window; I do not know how anybody could get on the leads, except through the window of another house, or out of the yard; I could get on the leads - they run up close against the window. Mr. Graham let me in that night, and saw me lock my room door.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. On the 26th of December, I apprehended the prisoner in St. Martin's workhouse - I asked Mr. Clark, who was with me, if he was the person - he said, Yes; I told him I apprehended him for stealing four sovereigns and two watches from Mr. Clark - he said he was very glad of it, for he had suffered a great deal ever since he had stolen the articles. When we came out of the workhouse, he said I had no occasion to lay hold of his arm, for he would not run away - that he told some of his shopmates that he had done the robbery, in order that Clark might hear of it, and nobody else be accused.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On Thursday morning, the 21st of December, I was on duty, and saw the prisoner in a lane leading from Bromley to Stepney, about half-past eight o'clock; he was coming in a direction from the prosecutor's, and walking very slow, with a basket and a copper pump on his shoulder. I asked what he had got - he said it was a pump which he was going to repair; that he was a carpenter, and was going to make a box for it, and that he had brought it from Mr. Miller's, at Bromley - I asked what part of Bromley - he said he could not tell me, but he was a gentleman, and kept two servants and a gardener; that he (the prisoner) lived in a court in Brick-lane, but he could not remember what court, or the number of the house. I found part of a leaden cistern in the basket - as we went to the watch-house, he said he had received it from Mr. Miller's gardener; I asked if he could take me to Miller's; he said he should say no more about it - I delivered the property to Daintry.</p>

There is a cow-house adjoining the out-house; persons could get to my premises from there - I found about 75 lbs. of lead of the same description in the cow-house, but more has been taken - I saw it applied to the gutters, but cannot say whether it matched.</p>

            . I am nearly ten years old, and live in Robinhood-court, Shoe-lane - I am in the service of Mr. Smith, a cow-keeper, whose premises join Mr. Brooks' out-house. About a quarter to eight o'clock, on the night before the prisoners were apprehended, I saw them both come in at our gate with the horse and cart; they work for Mr. Dupree, whose horse and cart stood on our premises - they went to the shed, and unharnessed the horse; I heard Hoare say to Read, "If anybody comes, whistle;" he was then up the cow-house ladder, by the shed - Read stood by the ladder, watching him; my mistress came out, and then he whistled to Hoare, who was up in the loft - my mistress went in-doors, and fastened the door; Hoare then called Read up into the loft, and when he had been up there about five minutes, he came down, and then Hoare threw down some lead; he then came down, took the lead, and covered it with some straw, a little higher up the shed than where I was (they could not see me; I was laying in the cow's manger, and could see what they did) - they fetched a pail of water for the horse, then put out the light, and went away - before they went away they stopped up in the shed a little while: I got out of the manger, and went and told my master, who went for the officers; this was after they put out the light - they were gone when the officers came. I saw Hoare again about six o'clock in the morning, in the shed, and he went up into the loft, and I saw lead thrown down, but cannot say that he threw it down - he got a great stone and beat the lead, and then covered it up in the same place: he was taken on the premises, about nine o'clock that morning - Read was taken that day at his master's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did they leave the premises that night? A. Yes; they could have carried the lead away then, if they chose; I cannot say that they carried any away - there was a penny candle lighted at the end of the shed; there were ten cows there; I looked under two cows' bellies, through their legs, and saw them - the manger is a trough on the ground; I knelt down  - part of the shed and loft belongs to Dupree; he keeps his hay there; but they were on Mr. Brooks' premises: the shed is rather longer than this Court - I saw them throw the lead down, and after they were gone, I went and showed it to master. I said nothing to my mistress when she came out. I could see them plainly, but they did not see me - nobody but their master and his men have access to the shed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who had the care of the cart and horse? A. Hoare; Read was not often employed about the horse. Dupree's other men are employed at plumbing; he is a plumber.</p>

On the evening of the 8th of December, as the wet came through the ceiling of a room in my house, I went on the roof, and I went on Brooks' premises to get to my roof; this was on the Wednesday before the Saturday on which the prisoners were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110009"/>examined - I saw the lead was cut from Brooks' gutters. Crew gave me information on Friday night, between six and seven o'clock; it was after dark - I had not seen the prisoners come in - I went with two constables that evening, and found a roll of lead in the horse-stall, covered with straw; it was in Mr. Dupree's part of the shed - it was fresh cut; the edges were bright - the officers stood outside the door with me that night, and we saw the prisoners come out of the cow-house door; they were suffered to go away, as I had not found the lead then: I was in the shed next morning when Hoare came; the officer took him; I was not near enough to hear what he said - he had the care of the horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On what day was Hoare taken? A. On the Saturday. The lead was not too heavy for one man to carry away - there is no division in the shed - both the prisoners had velveteen jackets on; there did not appear to be any thing about them; Hoare came to his business as usual the next morning; we had not spoken to him at night - I do not think that he saw the constable.</p>

            . I am an officer, and live in Dean-street, Fetter-lane. On Friday evening, the 8th of December, I happened to be in Smith's dairy, which is near this cow-shed - Crew ran into the dairy, and informed me that something was going on wrong; I waited in Robinhood-court, and saw the prisoner come out of the premises; Read came out four or five minutes before Hoare - I afterwards went into the shed, and Crew, in my presence, discovered the lead in Mr. Dupree's horse-stall - my brother-officer put his mark on it, and put it in the same place: next morning I was waiting outside, and Crew came and said that another roll was thrown down - I went into the shed and took Hoare; he asked what I took him for - my brother-officer told him he knew what it was for; I found another roll added to the lead which was there the night before - I went on Mr. Brooks' premises, and about sixty feet of lead had been taken from there - I found a knife on Hoare with marks of lead on it; only 75 lbs. were found - the largest quantity was thrown down on the Saturday morning - I took Read in Mr. Dupree's shop; he said he was innocent.</p>

I was called to Smith's premises, and saw both the prisoners come out before we searched the cow-house - Crew found the lead in our presence; we marked it, and left it covered up as we had found it. Next morning, at six o'clock, I met Hoare about fifteen yards from the cow-house door - I called Weavell, we waited some time, and as Read did not come; we went in and took Hoare - he asked what it was for; I said, "You know what is under the manger, don't you?" he made no particular answer; I searched him at the Compter, and Weavell found the largest knife on Read - there was much more lead added to the quantity in the morning, and that was quite wet; it was a rainy night.</p>

Lyon returned in five minutes without him, and I gave information at the Custom-house. The iron weighed 2 cwt., and was worth about 11s. as old iron; but it was useful, and worth much more.</p>

            . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. On the 20th of December, at eight o'clock in the morning, I was at the end of Circus-street, turning into York-street, and met Pearce with this trunk on his shoulder - Hitchman, who was four or five yards behind, smiled, and said,"How do you do, Webster?" I knew them both before, and think I have seen them together, but am not positive; they were both going in one direction. As soon as Hitchman spoke to me, I seized Pearce with the trunk - Gibbs came up directly, and Hooker took charge of Hitchman - Gibbs took hold of Pearce, and I kept the trunk, which Mr. Sansom himself claimed in two or three hours; we found Miss Sansom's name on the corner of a little trunk inside, which led us to Bryanstone-square.</p>

            . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone, and was with Webster - I secured Hitchman - I saw the trunk opened; there was a box in it, with Miss Sansom's name on it; Mr. Sansom claimed the trunk and contents.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>PEARCE's Defence. My feelings will scarcely allow me to enter into a defence on a capital charge, but it is a duty I owe to my wife and sister, and to my late employer, to assert my innocence; if I should fall into any infirmity or error I hope you will not impute it to any negligence. Only a few years since I was surrounded by friends, and every necessary supply, but unfortunate West India speculations entirely brought my father and family to ruin - he lost 1500l. or 1600l., which was confided to a supercargo; he remained in the country till he became insolvent, and was then appointed master of a school at Knightsbridge; I remained with him till his death, and finding I was impoverishing him, I procured a situation at Mr. Nicholson's, in Bond-street, where I was for six months, and then removed to Mr. Stiff's of Jermyn-street; after that to Mr. Slade's of Hanover-street, and after being there two years I went to Mr. Richardson's, of High-street, Bloomsbury, and after sixteen months he recommended me to Mr. Willis, whom I was with six months, when he went to Dorchester; it is only a few months that I have been in this situation; though obliged to work hard to obtain subsistence I was comparatively comfortable, compared to this disgraceful situation. I had on this morning sold a duplicate of wearing-apparel for two half-crowns; I had for three months been unable to gain the least employ - I went to market, and bought a little butter; I went round to different customers to sell it. On the morning in question I went to search for a young man living as footman in Gloucester-street; he owed me a small sum; I was passing down Adam-street into Seymour-place, when I overtook two gentlemen, in one of whose employ I had been - the other was his brother, and in crossing Adam-street I took possession of this trunk from a person. who no doubt had taken it from Mr. Sansom's premises. I solemnly declare, as I hope for mercy here and hereafter, that I never saw it till I received it from the individual in question, who pointed out to me the road which led to my ultimate imprisonment, and made me the dupe of artifice and design; I had not got into York-street when I was apprehended; if I had been conscious of its being stolen I had plenty of opportunity to prevent my going into the midst of the officers - had they not known Hitchman, no doubt I should have passed unnoticed. I was taking the trunk to where the person who gave it me desired me - had I been guilty I would have thrown myself on your mercy, and have stated my distress which led to the commission of the deed, and should have hoped you would have afforded some asylum to an unprotected young man. I have served my different masters with satisfaction. I hope you will consider what I have said as emanating from my heart; my sufferings since my imprisonment have been acute; I am sorry my feelings should so far overcome me - I have struggled against them as long as I could. At the time this occurred I was depriving myself of every comfort - my little resources were exhausted, and I was in a state of destitution, but I have borne it with all the firmness I could, having been promised by a gentleman a situation after Christmas. I now leave my case to your serious consideration, and instead of consigning me to the horrors consequent on incarceration in the cells, and the suspense of waiting for the report, I hope you will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110012"/>restore me to liberty instead of a lingering imprisonment, and probably the loss of life by my sufferings.</p>

               <p>Prisoner PEARCE. Two of the keys open a trunk left at my lodgings, No. 18, Park-street, New-road - one of the latch-keys opens that house; the other opens the door of another house in the same street; here is a letter which was found upon me, which will prove I was endeavouring to procure a situation; I called on Mr. Careless about a situation, who was obliged to refuse it on trivial grounds. I swear, so help me God, I never had the least idea whose property the trunk was, or where it came from.</p>
               <p>HITCHMAN's Defence. I was going to see my uncle, and in York-street I met Webster; I spoke to him - he left me, and ran after Pearce, and said, "We don't want you, you may go;" I could have got away, but I had no inclination, being innocent.</p>

On the evening of the 29th of October, I was in Kingsland-road; there was a riot at a public-house - I staid there a little while, when three or four officers summoned me, in the King's name, to aid and assist in taking a man to the watch-house; I went with them, and placed three or four men in the watch-house; as I returned some children and women were screaming Murder! in <placeName id="t18270111-17-crimeloc104">Red Lion-passage</placeName>

               <p>The Court ruled that this offence did not come within the meaning of the statute, as, had the prosecutor died from the wound, the offence would not have been murder.</p>

            , and asked what was the matter; the female prisoner was at that time in custody - I told him Ann was in custody for robbing the house of some books; he was much alarmed, and went away. After that I went to his house, No. 72, Castle-street, Oxford-market - I said, "I understand you have got some property belonging to Lord Dufferin;" he said he had, and pointed to a bed, which was turned up, four chairs, and a round table - he said, "That is all I have got - I meant to have sent them home this morning, and have sent for a truck for that purpose;" I asked whose the carpet was which laid on the floor; he said that was Lord Dufferin's, but he had nothing else; I asked whose the curtains were which hung at the windows - he said they were Lord Dufferin's, and four looking-glasses, which were in the room, and the fire-irons and the fender; I sent for a truck, and took the things away - I left him there, but the Magistrate told me to apprehend him, and I went next morning to him, and said, "Mr. Lutman, I understand you are the husband of Ann;" he said he was, that they had been married four or five years, but she wished to keep it a secret.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. When did he come to the house? A. On Wednesday night, about ten o'clock; the woman had been three or four hours in custody. When I went to his house next morning I hired the truck which he had sent for before; he never absconded; he said Ann had ruined him, that she had brought the things there for his use, not that it was against his will; I know that they are man and wife now. When I went to his house on Friday a man named Dennis was present, who was afterwards discharged. I believe, as we were going away, a woman put her head into the parlour door, and spoke to him - Dennis was taken because he had been found in his lordship's house the night before the woman was taken.</p>

I took the prisoners to the watch-house, and then went to Mr. Newton, his lordship's agent, the next day - I opened the porter's-hall table drawer, and found Lutman's marriage certificate, with fifteen duplicates - twelve of which refer to his lordship's property.</p>

            . I am nephew and hostler to Mr. Purdey - he lives over the stables. On the 23d of December, about a quarter-past five o'clock in the evening I left the premises; the up-stairs premises were then locked safe and bolted, and I am sure the coach-house door was shoved to. I returned about half-past six o'clock, and found a number of people in the stable - the lock of the stair-foot door had then been forced open by some instrument, and when I got up-stairs the room where the bureau was was forced open, and the bureau also was open; the lid was forced open, and the drawers all laying about - the lock of the front sitting-room had been attempted, but they had not succeeded. When I went out that evening I had seen the three prisoners standing opposite the Yorkshire Grey public-house, in the King's-road; I had known Cranley six months; he once lived with my uncle - I am sure of him; I knew the others by their dress, which they had on at Hatton-garden; I had not seen them before; I found them the same evening, at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110014"/>half-past six o'clock, at Hatton-garden, and am sure they are the same; they looked me in the face as they went by- I passed close to them, and noticed them. I found my uncle's gold seal, ring, and key in the further coach-house that evening, when I returned from the office, and on the Sunday morning I found a bundle of phosphorus matches, among the straw in the coach-house - they appeared not to have been used.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know the faces of the other two men? A. Yes; I was right opposite the light from the public-house, and I saw them - it was then dusk, and getting dark; Cranley kept his face from me.</p>

On the 16th of December, about a quarter past six o'clock at night, I had been to a coffee-house to see the newspaper, and as I was going home, the prisoner Sullivan came up to me in Soho-square, and asked me to go with her - I said No; being a stranger, I could not find my way home if I had gone with her - she said, "Come with me, I will give you a direction to Somers-town;" I went into her house, not knowing the character of such women; I do not know what street it was in - she took me into a back room, on the first-floor; she shut the door, and then said she wanted my money - I said, "I have no money;" she said, if I would not give her my money, I should not go home that night; I said, if she would open the door I would go home - she said she wanted my money first, and after that she beat me - I said that I would give her 1s., which I did; she said I had more money than that - I said, No; she said, "Let me see your pockets;" I said I would not; she said, "If you will not, I will kill you;" I then gave her 9d. - she then said that I must let her see my pocket - I said I would not. There was then a knock at the door; Bellamy came in and said, "What is the matter?" Sullivan said, "That gentleman will not give me his money;" Bellamy said, "If he will not give you his money, take the poker, and kill him" - I said I had no money; Sullivan said, "Let us see your pockets" - I said I would not; she said, "Well, if you won't, we will kill you to-night" - I had a watch in my pocket, and did not wish them to find it - I then said, "I will show you my pockets myself" - I turned them out, and Bellamy said,"Very well, if you have no money, give me your umbrella," and she took it out of my hand herself - I had a diamond ring on my finger, and Sullivan said I must give that to her - I said I could not get it off my finger; she told me to prove that I could not get it off - I tried, and could not, and she tried, and could not - she then said that I must put my finger into her mouth; I did so, and while I was doing that, Bellamy pushed my arm against the wall, and Sullivan pulled her head away with the ring in her mouth - she had got it off my finger against my will; she took it out of her mouth, and put it on her own finger - Bellamy then said, "Let him go;" she took my umbrella, and went away - Sullivan blew the candle out, took hold of me by the coat, and went away - I went out, and met the witnesses in the next street; I told them what had happened, and they accompanied me to the place - I never saw the prisoners before, but am quite sure they are the women; they were not there when I went back.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you go to their room? Did you know your way home? A. I did not know where I was; I went with her, as she promised me a direction home; that was my motive - I thought her a bad woman.</p>

I found this note in my table-drawer (note read).</p>

I will send you the tickets, and money to redeem them, and also my rent, on Saturday; and most heartily wish you health and happiness.

            . I live in Middleton-street, Spa-fields. I was in Fleet-street, and saw a number of people apparently together, shoving about, or hustling, at the corner of Water-lane, close to Mrs. Jones - I saw the prisoner run forcibly against her; he almost shoved her down. I had my family with me - my suspicion was excited; I watched him, and the moment he left her, I asked if she had lost any thing from her muff - she at last missed her bag, the strings of which still hung on her arm; I saw the bag in the prisoner's left hand, five or six yards down Water-lane - he was trotting away; I overtook him, and told him to stop - he immediately turned up Crown-court; I called Stop thief! and he was stopped by another person; he dropped the bag a few seconds before he was stopped; it was picked up by Bidmead, and taken to the watch-house.</p>

On Friday, the 8th of December, between 12 and 1 o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop, alone, and asked to look at some black silk handkerchiefs - Miss Lambert showed him some; I should not hesitate to swear to his person out of five hundred men. I stood on the right of Lambert - she took down a parcel of handkerchiefs - they were not the shade he liked; he wished a blue-black; she took down another parcel, and immediately on her opening that he selected a piece, from which he wished one to be cut - she cut it off; he immediately said, "Cut another off the same piece," and while that was being done he took the first piece, which he had objected to, and took his own handkerchief off his neck, and measured the width with it, covering the first parcel with his handkerchief; my back was turned, to hold the handkerchiefs for Lambert to cut, and, I suppose, at that time this piece was taken; after the handkerchief was cut off he saw another coloured one on the counter, which he bought, and said, "Now, I have bought more than I intended - lay them by, and I will come back with the money in a few minutes, and while I am gone cut me off some shoe strings;" he left the shop - he was the only customer there, and in two minutes after he was gone Miss Lambert missed this piece of handkerchiefs; he never returned for what he had bought. This was on Friday, and on Monday, in consequence of information, I went out, and saw him in Paternoster-row - I have every reason to believe his eye caught me, for he altered the direction he was going; he was coming straight, as if to come into Cheapside, by my house, but he turned round, by Mr. Dunnet's, towards Newgate-street - finding no officer, I got before him, and came in contact with him at the corner of Newgate-street; I laid my hand on him, and said, "My good man, you forgot to call for those handkerchiefs;" he trembled like a child, and said,"Handkerchiefs; Sir - I don't know what you mean;" I took him into my shop, and he said I was quite mistaken in his person, that he was as respectable a tradesman as me, and lived in Ratcliff-highway - but before he left the shop he gave four different names and addresses. I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. At what hour was he at your shop? A. I think as near half-past twelve o'clock as could be - I was standing still in the shop, waiting for customers. My errand-boy came in on Monday, and said he was in Parternoster-row - I went, and found him about thirty yards down the row, and when he came to the end he turned towards Newgate-street; I believe he did not see me then; he made no resistance: Lambert was in the shop, and said she was sure he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110019"/>the man; she said he had been shaved since, but not that he had shaved his whiskers; I said the person had a long beard, and she said the same; we neither of us said any thing about his whiskers being shaved; his beard wanted shaving when he came for the handkerchiefs. I had his hat put on once, for Lambert to be sure about it - she had no doubt of him before, but when he was in the officer's hands he took his hat off, and I asked him to put it on - he did not say his name was Evans, nor that he was a potatoe-dealer, living in Back-lane, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he did not say that? A. He said a great many things before he said that - he said he was a potatoe-dealer, but when I delivered him over to the officer he said, "No, I am not a potatoe-dealer, my wife's mother is one;" he did not say he was a potatoe-dealer, living in Whitechapel, in my hearing; I heard nothing of his mother-in-law, living in South-street, Spitalfields - I declare I never heard it. I did not hear him give his address to the officer - he had a pair of garters with him, which he said he had bought at Mr. Fisher's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What names did he give you? A. I was so agitated I do not recollect, but the first he gave was John Davis.</p>

            . I was behind Mr. Bunn's counter; the prisoner came in about one o'clock, and inquired for black silk handkerchiefs - I am certain of him. I showed him a parcel of handkerchiefs; he did not approve of them - they were a blue-black, and he wished them without a fringe; I left that piece on the counter, and showed him another parcel - each piece contains six; I then showed him some bandanas, and cut him off one; he said he would take another, which I also cut off - he then asked the price of a coloured bandana, which had been cut off before, and said he would have one - he then said he would go and fetch some more money, and we were to keep them till he returned; I had seen him take his own handkerchief off, but did not observe what he did with it - he was a few minutes in the shop, and had not been gone two minutes before I missed the piece of handkerchiefs I had first shown him; no other customer had been in the shop - he never returned. On the Monday Mr. Bunn brought him into the shop - I was then quite certain of him; he is a very tall man - he said he was never in the shop before; he gave his name as Davis, and said he lived in Ratcliff-highway, and then in Whitechapel; I do not recollect his giving any other name - I never had the least doubt of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When he was brought into the shop did you not remark about his beard and whiskers? A. I said he had a longer beard on the Friday, but not that it was black, and I thought his whiskers were rather longer - I said that was all the difference I saw, but never expressed a doubt about him. I did not perceive that Mr. Bunn was agitated. The prisoner said he lived at some place in Whitechapel, which I do not recollect - as he went out of the shop he said he meant to say his wife's mother kept a potatoe-warehouse; I did not hear him say where she lived - he was in the shop about five minutes before the officer came; Mr. Bunn, the boy, and Mr. Wilkinson, who lives next door, were in the shop. When I was told to look at him he immediately took his hat off; Mr. Bunn told him to put it on, as I had never seen him without his hat. I never expressed the least doubt of him- I have talked this over with Mr. Bunn once or twice, and have heard him mention it to others.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you serve in the shop? A. No; I take out parcels - I saw him close by the Chapter coffee-house, coming towards Cheapside - I do not know whether he saw me - when I returned with master he had got out of Paternoster-row, and was crossing over to Newgate-street - when he was brought into the shop, Lambert said something about his whiskers - I think he said he lived in Back-lane, St. George in the East; it was between 11 and 12 o'clock that the handkerchiefs were stolen.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old, and was in the prisoner's employ last December - I mind the child - he keeps a potatoe-warehouse in Back-lane, which is in St. George in the East; but they give it two or three names. On the Friday, before the Monday on which he was taken, he was at home washing potatoes all day; he got up between nine and ten o'clock on Friday, for my mistress sent me up between nine and ten o'clock to ask if he was coming down to take the shop-gate off; he then had his breakfast, and was washing potatoes all day, and putting them into binns and baskets - he was working in the back part of the shop - he had pork-sausages for dinner, and after dinner he went to the potatoes again and was washing them till eight o'clock that night - he was not out of the house all day; his wife was with him; Mr. and Mrs. Baker called there between five and six o'clock, just as we were going to tea; they stopped about an hour, and I was sent for a quartern of gin; I dined with his wife between twelve and one o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did Baker live? A. In Market-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110020"/>street, St. George in the East; I do not know Mr. Lane; on Friday I always help him to wash the potatoes, as there are so many, and fill the baskets - the children play about in front of the shop; I am in the shop from morning till night - I know master shaved himself, for he sent me out of the room while he did it, that was about twelve o'clock on the Wednesday; he went out, and came home on Wednesday night very tipsy; I do not know that he shaved afterwards; he shaves when he is going out on particular business - he did not shave on Sunday nor on Monday - I did not notice that he had a long beard; I have heard mistress say that her mother lived somewhere in Spitalfield-market; she does not deal in any thing; master always washes the potatoes on Friday, and could not have gone out without my knowing it - I went to Guildhall two or three days after he was taken up, and was examined before the Magistrate, and said the same as I have now - my master had small whiskers, but no beard; he used to shaved all his face, but did not shave from Wednesday until he was taken up - I told this story in a room at Guildhall, where the clerk took it down - I am not certain it was at Guildhall, or whether it was to an attorney I mentioned it.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see Mr. Baker go out with your master? A. Yes, after he had shaved, and it was on that day he came home tipsy; it was the day before master washed the potatoes; I do not know how the days of the week go, but I know on Friday he washes the potatoes that they may be ready for Saturday.</p>

            . I live in Market-street, St. George in the East; the prisoner took the shop, in Back-lane, of me about the middle of November; it is called Shadwell, or St. George's - it is in Shadwell parish - I never heard it called Whitechapel; I heard of the prisoner being taken on the Monday, and went before the Magistrate with the last witness on the Thursday following - on the Thursday, before the Monday that he was taken, he called on me respecting making an appeal against the taxes of the shop he took of me - we went to the British Union school-room - he was in his working dress, but was certainly decent; he was clean about the face - I did not notice whether he was shaved; I should not suppose he ever had a very strong beard. We went from the school-room to the Ship public-house, in Shakespeare-walk, kept by Mr. Scott - I left him there about eight o'clock, rather fresh, and am told he went home in liquor. On the Friday, the day of the robbery, I and my wife were passing his shop, and called in about six o'clock in the evening - his binns and baskets were full of potatoes, which were fresh washed - I staid about one hour with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you kept the shop, did you wash your potatoes? A. Almost always; the general day for washing them was on Friday - Back-lane cannot be called Ratcliff-highway; his mother is a potatoe saleswoman, and lives in South-street, Spitalfields; that is about one mile from Back-lane; Shadwell, and Ratcliff-highway is all in one street - Back-lane runs parallel with them northward.</p>
               <p> - BAKER. I am wife of the last witness. I remember the prisoner being taken - I had called at his shop about tea time, on the Friday evening before he was taken - we staid there about an hour; there was a quantity of potatoes in the shop washed; the baskets and binns were full, and a great deal of Christmas holly about the place - we generally washed our potatoes on a Friday when we lived there, as there is a great demand on Saturday; I never observed that the prisoner had any beard at all; I should suppose he never had occasion to shave.</p>

I found a silver bladed knife in his waistcoat pocket; I went to his lodgings in Bristol - he told me he lodged there; I found under the head of his bed a cloak; and in the room a black waistcoat, a pair of shoes, a great coat, a jacket, a silver Port wine lable, and a red waistcoat. I found six more duplicates there.</p>

I went into the shop, and found three cannisters of black and green tea empty - the tills were both taken out of the counter; one of them had been locked the night before - I found one in the yard, and the other in the shop - some silver and copper was taken from them. I missed 19lbs. or 20lbs. of tea. The other articles were taken from the parlour cupboard.</p>

On the evening of the 18th of December I was at a raffle with the prisoner, at the Ship public-house, from seven o'clock till half-past eleven; I walked home with him - he lives next door to me - and about half-past six the next morning, as I went out to go to work, I saw him come out of his own house - he had no bag, or any thing then - I walked into the Commercial-road with him, and left him at the corner of Bedford-street.</p>

On the 8th of January I was standing just by the side of my own door, about eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner, Jones, on the counter in Anderson's shop - I saw him throw himself across the counter and open the till, and the moment after I saw him come out at the door with the bowl in his hand - I followed him about two doors to the corner of Haughton-street, where I saw him give the bowl to another boy, about the size of Burns, who ran up Haughton-street with it directly - I followed him, neglecting Jones, and as I crossed the way the bowl and money fell; I heard it chink; I still followed calling out, Stop thief! he turned up New-inn-passage into Holles-street and Stanhope-street, then into Newcastle-street, and turned to the right by the Olympic theatre, in Wych-street; and as soon as I turned down there, I saw him stopped by some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110023"/>person; it was Burns - I lost sight of him twice for about a second, and cannot swear that the boy I followed was stopped, as I was rather too far from him in turning Newcastle-street, but I think it was him; I counted the money which was brought back into the shop; I had not picked it up, but I saw it thrown down; and as I returned I saw a crowd stooping down on the very spot; I believe they were picking it up; I swear to Jones, for his head was close to the gas-light, and I was not far from him.</p>

            . I live in Milford-lane. On the 8th of January I was watching the prisoners from half-past six to eight o'clock; they were both together; I did not know them before - I was standing talking to a butcher at the corner of Haughton-street, and suspected them because I saw Jones snap his fingers, and come away from Anderson's window about six times and go up to Burns; I then saw Burns move away up to the corner of a wine-vaults at the corner of Haughton-street, two doors from Anderson's - Jones went into the shop - I saw him run out with a bowl, and his two hands on it; he gave it to Burns by the wine-vaults; he ran a little way up the street with it, and a man hit him on the arm and made him drop the bowl - I was following Jones, and caught him before he got to the end of Haughton-street - I took him to the watch-house; Burns had run off when the bowl was knocked down; it was just dropped at the time I caught Jones; I am certain of them both, as I had been near them before; Jones went into the shop - I walked down from the butcher's and looked at them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When was this? A.

            . I am servant to Mr. Davy. On Sunday morning, the 7th of January, while I was cleaning the brass-plate, outside the door, my mistress called me away; I went up-stairs, leaving the door ajar; I came down immediately, and saw the prisoner sitting in the parlour; she said she wanted to speak to Mr. Davy; I ran up into the drawing-room to my master, and told him the person, who had broken the windows before, wanted him - she had broken our windows a long time ago - I came down-stairs before my master - the prisoner was then gone, and had left the street-door wide open; I found the book-case door open, which had been shut before, and I missed a cruet-stand and castors out of it - I had seen it there ten minutes before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is your master here? A. Yes; the prisoner broke the windows three months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she not had a child by your master? A. I do not know that; I have heard so - she told me she had had a child by him, and wanted something from him to maintain it; she said she was but fifteen years of age when it was born; I was rather agitated when I saw her, as I knew her - she caught hold of my hand and said, "I had a child by him when I was sixteen years old;" she said nothing to me about the parish having provided for it till it was seven years old.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What message did she give you for your master? A. All she told me to say to him was that she wished to speak to him; he did not give me any answer to deliver to her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had she ever been in that room before? A. Not to my knowledge; she has been at the house twice while I have been there, and used very abusive language; and the second time she broke the parlour-windows - I then heard what had happened between master and her.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Giles. Before this happened I heard Mr. Davy had had a child by the prisoner; he settled with the parish officers about it ten or twelve years ago; I believe it is still provided for - I believe it is with the prisoner's sister. Last Sunday I went in search of the prisoner, for stealing this cruet-stand, and found her at the Black Horse public-house, in George-street, St. Giles, six or seven hundred yards from Mr. Davy's house - it was six or seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110024"/>o'clock in the evening - she was not sober; I told her the charge - she said, "D - n the thing, I know nothing about it," but as we went along I said, "You had better let Mr. Davy have the cruet-stand;" she said, "Yes, I will let him have it, if he will send me back my - ."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know nothing of the provision of the parish officers? A. I know he paid a certain sum of money to the parish; I am sure they would not turn it adrift at seven years old; Mr. Davy was before the Magistrate, but the clerk said there was no occasion to examine him - she had the child eleven years ago; she is now twenty-seven years old, she says; she has been an unfortunate woman for some time; she has been before the Magistrate several times, for breaking windows, and her story has always been that she had a child by him; I cannot find the cruet-stand any where - I certainly did not say she had better tell me where it was - it was a slip of the tongue.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Andrew, Holborn; Field-lane is in my beat. On the 26th of December, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was on duty in Holborn, near Field-lane - I heard a confusion, like people wrangling; I ran to the spot in Field-lane, and observed a number of people standing, and the prosecutor in the middle of them, without his hat; his head was cut, and bleeding profusely - there were about twenty people round him; I asked him what had happened; he said he had been knocked down by a party, and been ill-treated, and pointed to the prisoner as the first who struck him - he then said he had lost his hat and handkerchief; I could find neither of them on the ground - I then attempted to take the prisoner; I do not mean to say that he ran, but he sidled away; I stopped him, and took him to the watch-house - he said nothing when the prosecutor charged him with knocking him down; he said nothing to me about the prosecutor having insulted any female, but when he had been two or three minutes in the watch-house, he said he had been taking liberties with his sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he point out where his sister was? A. He did not - I looked out at the door for the person, and there was a woman of loose character at the watch-house door, but when I opened it, she ran away - his brother followed him down to the watch-house, and was about to name something of the kind, but no sister appeared; the brother said he had not seen it done, and no attempt was made to bring forward the sister - I understood that his mother, sister, and brother were all at Guildhall; but they did not offer to give evidence, nor interfere.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the person who was represented at Guildhall as his sister, in Field-lane, when this happened? A. No, my Lord; the prosecutor complained of being hurt about the body with kicks - his head was cut, and bleeding very much; I did not examine the wound; it was on the back part of his head - I never saw the hat or handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not the prosecutor in liquor? A. He appeared to have been drinking a little, but was perfectly sensible - he gave his statement to me very clearly.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen him walking before the prisoner gave him the blow? A. No; I came by at that moment; he appeared to have been drinking a little, but very little - when he was lifted up, he was able to give an account of himself, not as if he was stupified with liquor - the prisoner said he would go and fetch his brother; a young man came up, whom he called his brother, and inquired into the case, and the watchman came up and took him - I saw no man by at the time the prisoner knocked the prosecutor down; I did not see him take liberties with any girl - the girls went away when the prisoner was taken; neither of them said that the prosecutor had been insulting them, or I must have heard it - I think I have seen the prisoner about that quarter before; I know none of his family.</p>

            . I am an officer of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house - Wesson was bleeding very much from behind his head, and accused the prisoner of knocking him down, and said his hat and handkerchief were taken away while he was on the ground; the prisoner denied the charge; he denied striking him; no female came into the watch-house - a man, who called himself his brother, came in, but nobody else - his mother, brother, and a young woman, who he said was his sister, were at Guildhall, but were not before the Alderman; the young woman made no complaint against the prosecutor to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). The prisoner is fourteen years old; he has been employed by Mr. Brittle, of Denmark-street, Soho, glass-blower. On Tuesday, the 26th of December, about ten o'clock, the prisoner was going to his place of residence, Richard's-buildings, Field-lane,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110026"/>in company with his sister, a young girl, twelve years of age, they met the prosecutor coming from Saffron-hill down Field-lane, towards Holborn-hill - he was very much intoxicated, so much so, that he could scarcely stand; he began to take very unbecoming liberties with the prisoner's sister, which induced the prisoner to interfere, and, after remonstrating with the prosecutor for such gross behaviour, the prosecutor made no more ado but knocked the prisoner down, and in the scuffle the prosecutor's hat fell off; some person on the spot picked it up, and ran away with it; it is most likely some person belonging to the Jews' shops in Field-lane had ran away with it. The prosecutor caused the prisoner to be taken to the watch-house, and he was committed for trial. After having the prisoner taken, he could not find his hat, nor could he prove that the prisoner was in company with any other boy that evening, as he was merely going with his sister. The only person who can prove having seen any thing of the affray, is a woman, who says she saw it as she stood at the bottom of Holborn-hill, near the end of Field-lane; the situation of which does not run immediately in a straight direction, and it is impossible the woman can speak the truth. The prisoner's late master can give him a good character, and, if the Court will discharge him, will take him into his service immediately.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother. I live at No. 1, Richard's-buildings, Field-lane, and get my living by crying things in the street. I was not with my brother when this happened, but he ran home to me before he was given in charge; he came to me about five minutes before ten o'clock, and said, "Come, for a drunken man is ill-using your sister."</p>
               <p>Q. This was before ten o'clock? A. Five minutes before ten. My sister is twelve years old - she was coming home with my brother to my house, it being boxingday; she lives over the water, in Christ-church parish - he did not bring her with him when he came to complain. When I came up, I heard a man crying out that he had lost his hat - this was before ten o'clock; he was very much intoxicated, and could scarcely stand; he was reeling about - I asked him what was the matter; he said he had lost his hat, and that was all he said, and all that I perceived.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not see him streaming with blood? A. No, not at the time I saw him, he was not, as I perceived - the watchman came up, and took my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear his head was not cut, and streaming with blood at that time? A. I could not see it - I will not swear it was not so; I saw it bleeding in the watch-house, when he showed it, but not before - his hat was off when I came up, but Field-lane is a very dark place, and there are no lamps: when I came up, my sister was in Field-lane, several spaces from him; I sent her home; I did not attend the examination at Guildhall - I was at work; my sister did not go - she was over the water - I am sure she was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she complain before a Justice of this man having ill-used her? A. No - my mother lives at No. 2, Brunswick-place, Brunswick-street, Christ-church - my sister lives with her - I heard her give an account of what happened that night; I did not take her to the watch-house to state it; they would not let any one in - they shoved me out three times - my sister followed me and my wife; I heard her tell the people outside the watch-house door, of the prosecutor having taken liberties with her - she did not tell the watchman; she was about as far from him as I am from your Lordship; there was no time to complain, for he was dragged away like a dog - she could have called out that he had insulted her, but I do not think she could have been heard at that distance, because there was such a tumult of people and such a bother - I did not hear her say any thing; I was following my brother - I saw the watchman ill-use him very much; he shoved me out of the watch-house - I was afraid to speak, for fear of being locked up myself.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister, and am in Christ-church school - I was twelve years old last September. I and my brother were coming up Field-lane on boxing-night; the prosecutor met us, and began indecency with me, he being so much intoxicated with liquor; I had hold of my brother's hand - my brother asked what he did it for, and he struck my brother - he was terribly drunk - indeed, he reeled up against me, and began to maul me about: he laid hold of the bottom of my petticoats.</p>
               <p>Q. He struck your brother; did he knock him down? A. No; but by his striking my brother, he fell down - he did not fall from any blow; nobody struck him at all he fell from his drunkenness; he fell into a door-way on his back - he got up, and struck my brother a second time - I did not see my brother strike him; I was then crying from his ill-usage - he fell down again, and hit his head against the side of the door-post; he got up again, and said he had lost his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Then nobody touched him? A. No; my brother went to fetch my eldest brother from Richard's-buildings - I staid by the prosecutor; I did not fetch my brother - it was the prisoner who did; I stood by the prosecutor the while.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nobody to take care of you, if he had chosen to be impudent again? A. There was a moltitude of people round; I waited till my eldest brother and the prisoner came back - he did not touch me when the people were there; they were not women of the town who were round; there was only one young woman there besides me, she was a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you out so late at night? A. I came out at six o'clock, and had been getting my Christmas-boxes - I had no other time, because I was at school before - I got the Christmas-boxes over the water, where my mother lives; I have been in Field-lane at night before, and was never insulted - I went to the watch-house with my eldest brother, but they would not let either of us in; I saw the watch-house door open, but could not get in - I saw the watchman lay hold of my brother, but was not near enough to tell him I had been ill-used; I was as near to him as I am to your Lordship; I could not tell him for the multitude of people and the noise - I said, "Please, sir, that gentleman insulted me first" - many people heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110027"/>that; my eldest brother was with my younger brother then - I told the people he had taken liberties with me, and many people spoke to him.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Now, will you persist in this story, after what you have heard? A. Yes- I swear it is true. I did not go before the Magistrate the next morning, for I was ill at home, at my mother's - my mother and sister-in-law went, but I was ill, from the ill-usage of this man, and the blows I got from the multitude.</p>
               <p>Q. Who struck you? A. The prosecutor did; he struck me about the head three times, and knocked me down - he gave another young woman a black, eye thinking it was me; I did not know her - she went away, and I did not hear her complain. I did not tell any Justice or watchman that the prosecutor had struck me, or behaved indecent - he struck me on the back of the head, with his knuckles; I had a low-crowned bonnet on, and it hurt me - I had a sick head-ache the next day, and could hardly get out of bed; I laid in bed till three o'clock in the afternoon - I had no bruises - the place could not be shown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did nobody interfere in seeing a man like that strike a little girl? A. There was nobody there then; the watchman was almost the first who came up, and when he came I was crying - my brother went up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You said just now, there was such a crowd he could not hear you complain? A. Yes - the people in Field-lane were all at their doors, but nobody interfered.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did your sister, that night, when the watchman had hold of your brother, complain that the prosecutor had struck her three times? A. I did not hear rightly what she said; she has complained of it since, scores of times - the first time I heard her mention it was when I went home from the watch-house; I did not hear her mention it at the watch-house door, but there was such a mob there; I do not know that I saw her when I followed my brother to the watch-house - I did not walk home with her; she walked a great distance behind, with my wife; when she got home she said she had been much ill-used by the prosecutor, and he had struck her; I did not attend to state this to the Justice, because my only dependence is on my business. The prisoner had been about a fortnight out of employ, and got his living by selling things in the street. which his mother bought for him; he worked at Mr. Holmes' glass-house three years, and he also worked in St. Giles.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness, and live in Richard's-buildings. The prisoner came to fetch my husband about five minutes before ten o'clock, and said his sister was being ill-used by a man - my husband went out, but I did not follow till after he was in the watch-house; I found my sister outside the watch house door; she did not go there with me - my husband was then in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. This was very late for a young girl to be out? A. She and the prisoner were both going to sleep at our house that night. She told me the prosecutor had taken indecent liberties with her, and struck her - she did not say where; I saw no mark of her having been struck - I blamed her for not giving him in charge. They would not let me into the watch-house; I called out to some of the watchmen who were coming out, that he had struck my sister, but they pushed me out; that was not the watchman who is here; I called out loud enough to be heard in the watch-house, but they would not hear me - she did not tell me where she had been struck. She went home with me that night, and slept at our house - I am sure of that; she did not sleep at her mother's that night; she got up early in the morning, went home, and went to bed again, as she tells me. I was at Guildhall when the prisoner was examined, but they would not let me in, nor yet my mother-in-law - I asked to be let in, and said I could give evidence, but they would not hear us; I said it was my brother who was in custody, but they would not suffer us to go in; my sister was at home, at her mother's, at that time - I did not go home to see how she was that afternoon, for I had business to attend to- I did not know she was ill till I saw her the next day, or two days afterwards; I heard my mother say she was ill, but did not ask what was the matter with her. I recollect now she did say to my husband she was unwell, before we went to Guildhall, when she called for me.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said you did not hear of it till the next day? A. I did not hear my sister mention it till the next day. My mother called for us to go to Guildhall, between ten and eleven o'clock - I think my husband was at home then - he sells baked-potatoes about. I saw nobody at Guildhall, to tell them the prosecutor had struck my sister; I said I had come to speak for him, but not that I came to complain of the prosecutor having struck her.</p>

I have no doubt of its being part of the moulding of that window. The prisoner had it under his coat, in three pieces - I went after him, and found Carter had stopped him.

            . I am inspector of the watch. A woman knocked at the watch-house door, and in consequence of what she said I went and took the prisoner - the woman gave me this property and said she had taken it from him; he heard that, and did not deny it; when I took him he said,"I will go with you, but I know nothing about it;" the woman said he had robbed somebody of it - he did not deny her being his wife - they walked arm-in-arm together as I took him from Guildhall to the Compter, and she asked what she should bring him for breakfast; and he told me to tell his wife what time to bring his breakfast.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. After accusing him of the robbery, she offered to bring his breakfast? A. Yes; she is outside the Court now - she appeared a working woman; she walked to and fro with him at all the three examinations, and she treated him with porter.</p>
               <p>MR. SHRUBSOLE. I saw this property before the Ma<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110029"/>gistrate; it is a piece of coloured cambric - here is the piece it was cut from - it agress with the original measure.</p>

On the 24th of December, he went out with me, with a carriage which I let out, and as it was too late for him to go home, he slept with me that night; we got up together next morning; he went away about eight o'clock, and about eight o'clock on the morning of the 26th, I missed this property out of my chest. He had come into my room with a light about four o'clock that morning, and got into bed with me - my landlady called me at eight o'clock, and said that a pair of my boots, had been found in the garden - the prisoner jumped out of bed, and stood kneeling on the chest which had contained my clothes; he appeared much frightened - I asked him to look into my chest, which he did, and said there was nothing there, but no doubt I should have my clothes again - he said,"Never mind, they are all right" - he then left me, and went to drive a chaise for Mr. Norman; I went to him at Norman's in about an hour, and begged of him to give me my clothes - he said he did not know much about them, but no doubt I should have them again - he went to London with the chaise about twelve o'clock, and while he was gone, I received information: when he returned, I and another man went to the chaise which he had driven; he was then cleaning the harness - I saw a pair of breeches and two pairs of trousers under the seat of the chaise. I fetched an officer, who took him - he had got my shirt on his back: 2l. 11s. was found on him - he said that was what he had sold my clothes for - I found the braces and the waste pieces of some shirts which were taken from my chest, on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. From where were they stolen? A. It is a separate building from the public-house - I live there constantly; the door is not kept open in the day-time; the chest was not locked - I saw nobody but him enter the room. I had been making myself comfortable on Christmas-day - I cannot say whether he drank with me; I was with four or five people, whom he brought there - he did not put me to bed. I have got back three pairs of boots and a box from the landlady - I am sure it was my shirt he had on; but when he came to the office a second time, he had got another on.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Two-penny post department of the General-post; letters brought from the country-office, for delivery by the two-penny carriers, are brought to our office in a box; and account is taken of the postage before they are sent out. A letter put in at Leicester on the 22d would arrive in town on the 23d, and would be delivered that morning; the postage of a single letter from Leicester is 9d. - it is my duty to separate double and treble letters from single ones; an entry is made of them in the North East division. The prisoner is one of the persons employed in the delivery of letters in that division.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this book, is there the entry made on the morning of the 23d, of the double and treble letters for delivery? A. Yes - there are fifteen letters in number; the persons to whom these letters are delivered, sign their names against those they take charge of - three of these letters were delivered to the prisoner, which he is charged with the postage of; here is the entry - (reads) -

            , Prospect-place, Cambridge-heath, post-mark Swansea, 11d.; the prisoner has acknowledged, by his signature, that these three letters were delivered to him: 2s. 3d. would be the postage of a letter from Leicester, containing two bank notes; the post-mark on this letter was imperfect - I could not read it; he would have many other single letters to deliver; this is a security we take from the carrier, to acknowledge what double letters they receive - this rule at that time was only applicable to that division.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many years have you been in the office? A. Seventeen; a great many persons are employed there - there are six carriers in that division.</p>
               <p>Q. Irregularities have crept into the office, which led this new regulation? A. Yes; I am not aware of any men being suspended - I believe some have been - I have heard so, but that circumstance does not come to my knowledge; mistakes certainly do occur in sorting letters for delivery. I did not hear the prisoner give any account of this matter; I heard him examined before the Magistrate - he was bailed, and has surrendered here today; the letters are sorted in a large room - I should think from fifty to sixty persons are employed there, in and out - In the out parts the General letters are delivered by the two-penny postmen; I cannot say how many General letters he would have - they would be in addition to the twopenny ones; this regulation of signing the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110032"/>book has been made about six weeks - the entry is in my writing; after entering them I lay them on a desk, and send for the letter-carriers respectively - he would be in the carrier's office, not in the office where I enter them; I send only for the carriers of his division, which would be five or six; the letters remain before me - he would then take the letters, see the amount was right, and then sign the book, which he has done - he does not bring his bag with him, but takes them away in his hand; he signs the book after taking the letters, to see that they belong to his delivery.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not often occurred, since this regulation, that the carrier takes your word, and relies on your accuracy, without comparing the letters with the entry? A. No - I always order them to examine them with the entry, and think I can safely swear they never sign the book without comparing them, for I always order them to examine it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never seen a degree of negligence in the men which has surprised you? A. I have seen it, but I always say, "See what you have got before you sign;" I only know that he had the letters which he has signed for; the carrier always takes the letter before he signs it - I never knew them sign first - complaints have been made before of the non-delivery of letters - in this division there are six persons who deliver.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Was that complaint the cause of this regulation? A. Yes. I cast up the postage after entering them; a sub-sorter sorts them for me to enter - his name is Burt - I cast the postage myself, and the men account for the postage to Mr. Barret; I give to the Presidents' assistant a paper, called a docket, charging the carriers with the postage, and the carrier accounts to Barrett for the money; it is the carrier's duty to look at the letters, to see that they are within his walk, as he can tell better than the sorter. I now understand that Bird-cage-walk is not in the prisoner's walk - it is his business to see they are in his delivery before he signs - they are not delivered to him with the single ones, but separately.</p>

            . I received from the prisoner the postage received by him on the 23d of November - he paid it to me on the Monday following, the 27th; they account every Monday morning; I received from him, as the postage of three double letters, delivered on the 23d, 4s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the carriers go out in the morning, do they bring you an account of the double letters they receive? A. I have a docket - they report to me verbally, and if that report agrees with the docket I put it down; he reported to me, on the 23d, that he had three double letters, amounting to 4s. 6d. His is called the Bethnal-green walk - I believe that adjoins Bird-cage-walk, Hackney-road, but his walk does not include that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot say it is not in his particular walk? A. I believe not; the account I have is what the carriers are responsible for, for the double letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he had the letter or not you would expect to received that sum? A. Yes, but he reports to me, whether he agrees with the account - if there was a mistake, my docket would not be correct; I receive that from another person, but compare it with his verbal report; if his report was not accurate it would not agree with my account; I expect him to pay the amount on the docket, he having reported it to be correct.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had afterwards told you he had not received this letter, through some accident, would you not expect him to pay for it? A. I expect him to pay according to the docket.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. The charge is made and a check given to you, the carrier comes and says how many he has, and if it agrees with the docket, you mark it? A. Yes, and not without; if a man says there is a mistake it would be inquired into - if he had stated nobody would take the letter in, and he could not find the man, the postage would have been allowed him.</p>

            . I am a President in the Twopenny department of the Post-office. In consequence of an inquiry respecting this letter; the prisoner was called before me on the 1st of December, when Mr. Poole applied - I went into the sorting-office, referred to the book, and found an entry made of this letter; I then sent for the prisoner, and asked him if that letter came to his hands - I do not think I showed him the entry, but asked him if he had a letter for Mr. Poole, Bird-cage-walk, Hackney-road; his answer, to the best of my recollection, was, "No, it is not my delivery - I don't go into Hackney-road;" I said, "Are you sure the letter did not come to your hands" - he still said, No; I said, "Have you no person of that name in your walk, where you could have delivered it, supposing it to have come to your hands;" he said No, but I do not think I showed him the book; he still said he had not received it. I allowed him to go out of the office, but not out of the building; I went and reported it to the solicitor - he was taken before him, and the book produced - when he was shown the entry of the letter which he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110033"/>had signed - he said if he had signed it, it must be a mistake - he did not know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Upon your receiving an intimation that it had not been delivered, you had the means of discovering in whose hands it had been, from the book? A. Yes; I knew his signature acknowledged the receipt of the latter - I did not question him with a view to catch him, but that he might recollect himself if he had made a wrong delivery; I knew it was not in his walk, which made me question him more minutely.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your object to detect whether he had stolen it or not? A. Very probably - it was my duty to discover whether he was guilty or not; I was certainly anxious to discover the guilty person; if I had told him he had signed the book, he might have gone away for what I knew; I meant that the conversation between us should be given in evidence, but in every inquiry I make I do not immediately think of coming here; the questions suggested themselves from the nature of the business; I cannot sayy what impression I had on my mind then - I did not commit this conversation to writing - I trust to my memory.</p>

            . Q. You have been in the North East division ever since this regulation has been adopted? A. Yes; I receive my letters before I sign the book - I do not recollect an instance of any carrier having signed the book first.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). My Lord, the case I am now charged with I am innocent of. I have been in the employ two years, and deliver General-post letters in several walks in town and country, and had many opportunities of committing robberies, without signing my name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The day before I entered on this walk there was a letter lost - it was sent into the East division, and belonged to the North East: the carriers saying it did not belong to them, took it into the clerk's-office, and got it changed; it was lost, and when the gentleman applied about it the note was found to have been received at the Bank; this was the day before I went to that division - it belonged to Mr. Blundell, of Bethnal-green.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. James.

I afterwards went into a room with Mr. Shorey, and found a pair of shears, which appeared to have been employed against some hard substance.</p>

            . I live at Feltham-hill, in the parish of Feltham, and rent the house. Between six and seven o'clock in the morning of the 1st of January, I was awoke by my servant - day-light had not appeared - I got up went down-stairs, and found my house had been entered at the scullery window, next the fields, by taking down a bar of the window; several pieces had been cut out of the kitchen-door by a centre-bit - the bell had been then taken down, and the bolts undone. I proceeded to the butler's pantry, where the plate in common use was kept, and missed fourteen silver tea-spoons, and a plated coffee-biggin; six of the spoons were worth 14s. each. I went to the library, which was open, and missed two guns, three great coats, and three hats - one of the hats belonged to Mr. Curtis: I missed five snuff-boxes and a flute from the drawing-room.</p>

            . I am high-constable of Isleworth. On Wednesday, the 3d of January, about noon, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's house, and saw him there - he lives at Witham, about four miles from Feltham; I told him I had a warrant to search his house, but should first search his person, for goods stolen from Mr. Burnell's - Hill, in my presence, found on him a very large bunch of keys, most of them skeleton-keys; I found another key, which Mr. Burnell claims as belonging to his dairy; and a small bunch of keys, which Mr. Burnell's servant claims - I found two centre-bits on his person, which I have compared with the holes in the pannel of the kitchen-door; they correspond exactly - I have brought the pannel here. I searched his house, and found this snuff-box, either on the mantel-shelf, or a shelf by the side of the fire - we also found several other things, which Mr. Burnell does not claim. I had searched the house before, and know that he lived there with his wife; I do not know of his having any lodgers - it is a cottage with only two rooms and a loft.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Pray what does the family consist of? A.

            . I am a private in the 7th Dragoon-guards. On the 13th of December, at nine o'clock at night, I was sentinel in the St. John's-wood barrack-stable yard, and saw the prisoner return from town to his barracks - he went to his own stable, and immediately he opened the door a mare ran out loose - she got by me, and I went after her - I was driving her back, and saw the prisoner go out at the gate, at the other end of the stable-yard, mounted on another horse - I asked where he was going - he said to catch the mare that was loose - I saw no more of him - I had not then been able to drive the mare back - the prisoner is a private in the 15th Hussars - it was a bay-gelding belonging to 3d Dragoon-guards that he rode away with - the same gelding came back about a week afterwards - I did not see him again till he was brought back by an escort.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you known him? A. Seven months - he had been sent to learn a new sword exercise, in order to instruct his regiment, which is in Ireland - he was not perfectly sober when he came from town.</p>

            . I am a private in the 3d Dragoon-guards. On the 19th of December I was sent to Hussgreen - I found this gelding there at the Queen's Head public-house on the 21st of December, and brought it away on the 22d, and took it to the St. John's-wood barracks - it belonged to a corporal of the 3d Guards, and was a regimental horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose before you got to Hussgreen, you made inquiries? A. Yes; I did not hear of its having been offered for sale on the road - I believe he gave information where the horse was to be found.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Queen's Head, Huss-green. On the 15th of December, between one and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came there on a bay-gelding, which he tied up in the front of the house; he came in, and seeing he had spurs on, I asked if he wanted his horse put into the stable; he said, No, it would do where it was - a serjeant of the 8th Hussars, who was there, said, "Why, you belong to the 15th Hussars, which are laying in Ireland; what brings you here?" he said he had got an officer on leave of absence, at Roberts'-bridge, which is two miles off, and was going to see him - he then said he should walk to Roberts'-bridge, and should leave his horse - he desired me to feed and clean it - he said he should be back in an hour or an hour and a half, if he could get his business done, and should get back eight miles nearer town to sleep that night - he followed me out, and told me to take great care of the horse, for it was very malicious, and might hurt me - he went away, and never returned - Williams took the same horse away on the 22d of December.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he in his military dress? A. In a sort of undress - the serjeant went towards him, as if he took him for a deserter; he then said he had an officer at Roberts'-bridge - Huss-green is in the direct road, between town and Hastings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much intoxicated; but remember going to the stable-door, and the horse ran out - I immediately mounted another horse to catch it; but not succeeding, I went to see my relations - if I had wished to have sold it, I had plenty of opportunities - I immediately told the officer where the horse was.</p>

On the 13th of December, about eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner called on me on horseback - he was very much intoxicated, and almost in a mad state - I could scarcely understand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110036"/>what he came for - when he left me, he rode round the Pargaon very fast - the horse seemed to trip, and he fell off - he returned, and borrowed a few shillings of me - I reprimanded him, for he was very drunk.</p>

On Tuesday afternoon, the 9th of January, at a quarter past five o'clock, I was in the house; my box was then quite safe; I came home again about half past nine o'clock, and went to bed in the dark - the prisoner had lodged there about four months; I never heard from him that he was going to leave; I was called up at eleven o'clock, found my box broken open, and the property gone - the prisoner did not sleep there that night - he was taken into custody next morning; nobody but him and me lodged in the room, nor were there any other lodgers in the house - I saw my watch at Hatton-garden; there had been another seal added to it since I had lost it - I had had it about six months - when I went out about five o'clock, I left the prisoner in the bake-house; he was employed by me at Ausell's, who is a baker; when he was apprehended, five sovereigns were produced - my watch is worth 2l.; it cost me 3l. 10s. six months ago - two gold seals cost me 25s.</p>

No; I am in Ansell's employ, and have been so for three years, and know his name - he has no partner - nobody lives there but him - he is church-warden, and therefore must be the housekeeper - he always signs his name Thomas - the last time I saw the prisoner was at a quarter past five o'clock; he was then in the bake-house; my box was safe then, for I went up to my room within a minute of the time of my seeing him; I then went out, leaving him in the house, and never saw him afterwards - we work at night; he was not in the house that night; nobody else had business in the room, except the servant - I do not know whether he knew I had the money and watch in the box - he knew I had something there; no wearing apparel was taken - we were not at all intimate; I have seen the name of the parish in letters, but they were not directed to Mr. Ansell.</p>

On the 20th of July, 1824, I had seventy-two or seventy-three oxen to take to Brentwood fair - I employed the prisoner to help me; I accompanied him all the way, and at Edmonton, in the night, we missed a lame ox; somehow or other we passed by it. I proceeded to Brentwood, and sold twenty-eight of the oxen to Mr. Mansfield, who lived at Ougar - I believe the prisoner was present - I arranged to sell the stray ox to Mansfield: I sent the prisoner with the twenty-eight to Mansfield - I ordered him to go and find the stray ox, and take that also to Mansfield. I did not see the prisoner again till about the middle of last year, when he was at Wells, in Somersetshire - I asked him where he had been, and what he had done with the stray ox; I did not hold out either threat or promise to him - he said he had found it, and taken it to Mr. Mansfield, who refused to take it in, and he had sold it: I asked who to, and I think he said he did not know - I had not at that time traced it, and did not then give charge of him; he said he had sold it for twelve guineas; I had given him no authority to sell it to any one, but to deliver it to Mansfield, who was not to pay him; in consequence of information, I had him apprehended about six weeks ago - I pointed him out to the officer, but did not hold out either threat or promise to him; he was then in employ as a <rs id="t18270111-57-deflabel339" type="occupation">drover</rs>

The last time I had seen the ox was in Edmonton parish, in the evening; it was missing in the morning - we had brought all the drove to where they rested; it was with the rest of the herd when they were put up to rest at night at Edmonton, and in the morning, when we were going to proceed on the road, it was missing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a cattle-dealer? A. Yes - I buy a good many in the course of a year - I sometimes keep them a good while, and sometimes sell them directly; this was a fine red Devonshire ox - a great many Devonshire oxen are red. I put them up at Edmonton on a high land, at the side of the road - it was in July, 1824. I inquired all I could about it, and inquired about the prisoner, but did not seek him much, as I thought my case was not strong enough till I had found where the ox was. I have seen him several times in Somersetshire since July, but never exchanged a word with him, except when I asked what he had done with the ox. I was before Mr. Alderman Wood on the 18th of December, and before another Magistrate afterwards; I do not know what the Magistrate said, but remember he would have admitted him to bail, if he could have got it - he was apprehended in the open market in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he leave you before his work was finished? A. I had ordered him to take the beast to Mansfield; there was no particular agreement as to how long he was to be with me, but when he had found the ox, he was to have met me at Romford market on the following Wednesday, and he did not - it was a red ox, of the Devonshire breed.</p>

I went with an officer to Mr. Norman's, the pawnbroker, in July last, and found it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you take me up twice to Marlborough-street? A. Yes - I had my witnesses there the first time, but I did not bring them forward, not understanding the nature of it. I summoned her husband, and they told me to go Marlborough-street; it was some months after her confinement; I had seen her in the room several times - the key of the room was put into a place, where my bed-fellow and me could find it. The prisoner and her servant cleaned my room.</p>

I know the prisoner's brother; they are very much alike - his brother wears a coat like the one the prisoner has on; they both wear kneebreeches, but he is not so tall as the prisoner - I should think there is two years difference in their ages; his brother had a coat on like the one the prisoner has on, and when the prisoner was taken, he pulled it off - the prisoner was taken up for his brother once, but I do not think he was tried.</p>

I was there about seven o'clock in the evening of the 2d of January - I saw the two prisoners in company: Smith took up an umbrella at a shop, but a person came into the shop, and he put it down again - they went away, and I saw them attempt several other shops; they then came to Mr. Dutton's - I went ten yards off, and watched them - I saw Smith go into the shop and return; he then pressed Austin forward into the shop; they came away very quick; I ran round another way to meet them, and stopped them - I found the boots on Smith, but I believe Austin took them; I took them into the public-house, and secured them - Austin was running so fast, that he ran against Smith, when I stopped him.</p>

I went again, and she gave me a duplicate of a table-spoon; she offered me another of a spoon and a gown of Isabella Kirk's, and said she would give me that, if I would promise to give her the gown which Kirk had got on; but I could not promise that; she said Kirk had left them with her, saying she had left her place and taken no wages, and that her brother Thomas had given her these things, to make a little money of.</p>

            . I am one of the governors of the poor of Clerkenwell; the overseer took the prisoner into the workhouse. I looked over her box, and found some duplicates; and among others, one for this scarf, and one for this shawl - I knew it was the prisoner's trunk; because I saw it come into the house, and she claimed it - I went into the wash-house and asked her for the key of it, which she gave the matron; who looked over the box, and I stood by.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutors' employ. I saw the prisoner and the other woman in the shop; the prisoner wiped the counter with her handkerchief, and I saw her, at the same time, draw a piece of lace from the counter; she then dropped her handkerchief, took the lace up with it, and put it under her arm. I went to tell Mr. Rotherham - she was just gone out when I returned; I followed, and told her I wanted what was in her handkerchief under her shawl; she shook the handkerchief, and this lace fell from it - she said she did not know it was there; it was quite concealed with the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Have you seen her before? A. Yes; she dealt with us - she drew it down from the counter; there are some pins in it- they could not have caught in the handkerchief; it was half a yard from the place which she wiped. I did not say the innocent should pay for the guilty.</p>

I have known the prisoner all his life; after drinking there I fell asleep in the tap-room - nobody was there then; I did not see the prisoner that evening; this property was in my pocket - two persons came into the room about half-past ten o'clock, and in consequence of what they said I missed my money and watch; I went home, and found the watch in pawn, at Lawton's, in three or four days.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there not several persons in the room? A. No, they were all gone when I fell asleep. I met the prisoner, and told him I did not know who robbed me.</p>

On the 1st of December, at half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was at the door of the Wheatsheaf, and saw Batt pull out his watch to see the time; he put it into his pocket, and went into the house - I went away, and at half-past ten I went to the Wheatsheaf again - Batt was asleep there, in a settle; nobody else was in the room; I saw a corner of his shirt was drawn out, and thought it was by some one pulling his watch out; his breeches pocket was drawn up to the top; the waiter and I awoke him - I did not see the prisoner there.</p>

            . I am a stage-coachman.

            . I live in Spur-street. On the 3d of January, between nine and ten o'clock, I went to my plumber's-shop, and saw several persons there; Mullins, who was my <rs id="t18270111-96-deflabel538" type="occupation">servant</rs>

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"

I went into my counting-house, leaving them in the shop. Mullins and the labourer took this lead in the truck, and went down Whitcombe-street. I went out, to go to Panton-street, but changed my mind, and went along the Haymarket; when I got there I saw my truck stopping, nearly opposite the little Theatre - Mullins held the handle while the labourer took this roll of pipe-lead out of the truck, and this small roll - he put one on each shoulder; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110049"/>then nodded to each other, and Mullins turned the truck to go into Charles-street; the labourer walked towards Pall Mall, keeping the opposite side to Charles-street- it did not strike me that it was a robbery; I thought it might be for another job. I watched the labourer up Suffolk-street, across the mews, into St. Martin's-lane - I lost sight of him at the corner of St. Martin's-lane. I began to think I was robbed, and did not wish to follow him so close. I went to a plumber's-shop in St. Martin's-lane - it is a kind of warehouse, with double doors; the prisoner Baron carries on a plumbing business there; I looked through the window, which was very dirty, and saw my labourer lay down the pipe and piece of lead close to the mould in the shop; I had not been there long when I saw a man in the shop, and the labourer looking stedfastly towards the door; I did not know it was Baron then, but it turned out to be him - I immediately flew from the door, to hide myself; I crossed the road, then went over again, and hid myself in a door-way, about two houses off, and in about five or six minutes I heard the latch of a door pulled - it proved to be the private door of the house belonging to the shop, and I saw a person's head put out at the door, whom I did not know at the time, but from circumstances since I think it was Baron - I would not wish to swear it, but if I did I should say Yes. After looking up and down the street, as if to see if anybody was watching (or for what purpose best known to himself) the labourer, whom I have not found, was coming out at the private door (this was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning); I stepped forward, fearing he might make a rush, and run away; I had seen nobody in the shop but him and the man whom I suppose to be Baron; the labourer saw me, drew in, and the door was shut with violence; that door communicates with the shop; I immediately went to the shop, and the labourer, whose face was towards the door, turned to look into the mould, putting his back towards me; upon coming near him I said, "Pray what do you do here?" he said, "I am come to look for a labourer;" Baron was in the shop, and they stood near each other; I said, "Pray what have you done with the pipe and piece of lead which you stole from me?" he hesitated, and made no answer, but pointed to the scale, where the pipe and lead were; I scolded Baron - I believe I called him a thief, and worse than a thief; I used very strong language; I said, "You thief, you are a receiver of stolen goods - where is your master, where is Mr. Baron?" he made no answer; I repeated the question several times; I was very much agitated at the time; the labourer then said he came to ask for a labourer, and said to me, "You know you wanted a labourer - I came in to ask for one;" I asked Baron if he would go for a constable, or get me one to take the man up; he made no answer till it was repeated several times; then the labourer said, "You may get a constable - I am not afraid - I shall not run away - I have done nothing;" I said I would take care he should not till I had got a constable, but I moved a little way from him; I again begged Baron to get a constable, or assist me in taking him - the labourer escaped while Baron and I were talking: Baron was in front of him, and made no attempt to stop him; he either said he could not or would not assist in taking him; he got out at the private door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long has Mullins been in your service? A. Three months - I know such lead as was put into the truck was wanted in Charles-street; there is this weight of lead entered in my book for that job, but the entry is dated the 2d instead of the 3d. The prisoners were both admitted to bail, and have surrendered to-day; no person out of my employ was admitted at Charles-street - I have a porter there; I wanted another labourer and plumber; I did not hear Mullins say the labourer was to give the lead to the man he was to fetch, to allow him an introduction to the works.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are the master, and employ people to work under you? A. Yes; the men enter all the lead they take out, before they go out - they have no right to sell it - it remains my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you saw your man go into the shop, you peeped through the window? A. Yes; I did not see him go in - I saw him deposit my lead by the mould; I could not see what was going on in the shop after I crossed over - I was there five or six minutes; I do not recollect saying at Bow-street that it was but a minute or two; there was nobody else in the shop when I went in. I have often looked out into the street myself, to see if my men were coming.</p>
               <p>Q. Directly you entered the shop you began an attack on Baron, supposing him a journeyman? A. Yes; he said he was Mr. Baron. and master of the place, but that was after the man had escaped. I did not say at Bow-street that he gave me that answer directly I asked for his master - I said there that he hesitated in answering my questions; my journeyman was a strong man, six feet high.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CUSS. I am an officer. I was sent for, and apprehended Mullins, at work, in Charles-street, St. James', between ten and eleven o'clock. I went and found Baron in his shop; Parker said, "I have come to demand my property;" Baron said, "There it is," pointing against the mould, where it stood; Parker said, "You need not take him - he is to be found at any time." I only took the lead.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday, the 13th of December, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I was coming down Norton-street, New-road, and saw the prisoner running, with something under his coat; he ran into Nassan-street, and shifted it into his apron - I secured him, and found it was a quart pot. I took him to the watch-house, and found another in his hat - they had Moore's name on them.</p>

            . I am a jeweller, and live in Old-street-road. On the 26th of December the prisoner came and offered a gold brooch for sale - he said his mother, who was in the country, had sent him to sell it - I asked where he lived - he said in Liquorpond-street, Lower-road, Islington - I told him to go home and send his father - he said he was at work; but he would send him when he came home - I kept the brooch. Taylor and an officer brought the prisoner to me, and asked if I had seen him before - I said Yes, and gave the brooch to the officer.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 7th of December, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Stepney church-yard, on the north side of the church, and heard something fall very heavy, I looked round to the back of the church, and saw a man going to pick up a piece of lead; I said, "What are you up to?" he immediately ran off very fast - I sprung my rattle, and ran after him, but lost sight of him entirely; I returned, and saw three pieces of lead just over the rails, and one piece on the pavement - I went round the church and saw a man sliding down the water-spout at the north side of the vestry - I ran after him, he turned the corner of the church very quick, and I lost sight of him - I turned back, and in two or three minutes the prisoner was brought up by Dickinson and Gibbs - he is the man who dropped from the water-spout - I knew him by his dress and size; he was not in my sight above three minutes; he had fustian or barragan trousers on, and a smock frock.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is not that a common dress? A. Yes - I saw his face, but do not swear to his features - it was dark; he was brought back in two or three minutes.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was going towards Stepney church-yard, and, about two hundred yards off from the church, heard a rattle spring - I ran, and met the prisoner running from the church-yard, about thirty yards from it I stopped, and asked what he had been doing - he said. Nothing, that he had come from the Angel - he could have come that way - I took him round the church; Beecliff said he was very much like the man, and the prisoner said, "I have not been here;" I got on the roof of the vestry, and found two more pieces of lead rolled up - the prisoner's hands were very dirty - I saw the lead compared next day, and it fitted exactly; I had seen nobody running but him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say he was not in the place, and was not the man? A. Yes: he afterwards said he had come from home - I went and found that was not so - the church-yard is a thoroughfare; nothing was found on him; the dirt on his hands looked like mortar, the same as was on the lead.</p>

            . I keep the Bear public-house, near Hanworth. Early on Sunday morning I was awoke by my dog barking - I went to my window, and saw the prisoner come to opposite my house, with a sack on his back- I levelled my gun at him, and said, "If you don't stop I will shoot you;" I called up my carters - he then said,"I have only got about a bushel and a half of coals." I went down, and secured him with them; he said he brought them from Sunbury; I at last found Farrant's coal-house had been opened, and saw where they had been lifted over the pales; there was a number of shavings among them - Farrant produced some of the same sort.</p>

I went up again soon after - they left the room, and the man went away - I have not seen him since; I saw the prisoner coming down stairs from my room, with something - she wanted to go out the back way, but I followed her, and saw the sleeve of a jacket hanging out of her bundle - I saw D.

The prisoner lodged with me on the 12th of February; she got up early in the morning; my wife<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110062"/>and I called out to ask where she was going - she said to the City, to see her sister; we got up about six o'clock, and went out to work; I locked the door, and had the key in my pocket; the prisoner came to me about two o'clock, and asked for the key, which I gave her. I came home about six in the afternoon, found the door locked, and the key left in it; I opened it, went in, and missed this property; she never returned, and was not found till a month ago. I know all the property was safe when I went out.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was applied to by Mr. Dearlove, of Peter-street, to watch Sharman; and on the 22d of December, a little before eight o'clock in the morning, I saw him come out of the shop with a batch of bread on his head; he went towards Great Windmill-street, and there Jenkins came up to him; he turned round, and said something to her; he stooped, and she took two loaves<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110063"/>off the batch; he went round the corner to Ensworth's shop; she crossed the way, and threw a blue handkerchief over the two loaves. Sharman came out of the shop where he had left the bread, and went home. Jenkins went and stood by a picture shop in Crown-court. Sharman brought out another batch of bread, and went to Mrs. Duncan's, in Crown-court; he left all there except two loaves, which he brought out under his arm; he then passed Jenkins, and gave her a slap on her back with his hand; they went on together to Mr. Walwyn's wine-vaults, in Compton-street; they went in there, and staid some time; I saw Lovegrove and asked his assistance, and when they came out Jenkins had two loaves in her hand, but Sharman had none; they walked a little way together and then parted; Jenkins went on to Coventry-street; I tapped her on the shoulder, and said, "You have got some stolen property;" she said,"I have not." I asked where she got those loaves; she said from her husband, the baker; I said, "Are you sure he is your husband?" She hesitated and said, "No, he is a bit of a sweetheart." I sent her to the watch-house, and marked the loaves; I went to Dearlove's shop, where I found Sharman; he denied all knowledge of the woman, or having seen any loaves but what he took to the shops; I took him to the watch-house, and said to Jenkins, "Which is the man who gave you the loaves?" She said, "That is him." Sharman made no answer. I know Jenkins has borne a good character for years.</p>

We then went to Messrs. Smith and Summers', Tabernacle-walk, where Flint was at work; I saw him there, but said nothing to him; he was taken to Marlborough-street; Mosher was there with the roller; it had been taken from a room where I keep my machinery; nobody had access to it but my family and Wayman; - a person must go through my parlour to get to it - it is worth 5l.</p>

I had a large stock of paper,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110068"/>which I have been missing since November, 1825; when I spoke to Wayman about the roller, he told me, voluntarily, that Flint, who had formerly been a workman of mine, had asked if he could give him a little of my paper - he said Yes, and gave him at first five or six quires - he then asked if he could give him more, and he gave him ten quires, and it went on till he had given him in all four or five reams. We went on the 27th of December and took Flint; Schofield asked if he knew what he was taken for- he said, Yes, he had robbed me of four or five reams of paper, and had not been happy since; I have not recovered this paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he say he had robbed you? A. I beg your pardon - I did not mean to say "robbed;" I was rather agitated; his words were, I believe, that he had had four or five reams; he was five or six months in my service, at the factory where I colour paper, but could not get at this.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you seen him since? A. Yes, once or twice; when he first brought it I inquired if it was his own - he said Yes, that he was a printer, and if I did not like to take it he would leave it while I went to any stationers', to make inquiry - he left it, but I did not inquire. I delivered the paper to the officer.</p>

We went on the top of the houses, and found a piece of lead, which corresponded with part of what they dropped; there was about one yard of lead left on the house, No. 22.

             was my journeyman. He was in my company on that Monday, from half-past seven in the morning till half-past ten o'clock at night - he was at work with me at a house in Stoke Newington - we worked by candle-light, and left work at half-past six o'clock, then went to the Maidenhead public-house, Battle-bridge, and there we remained till half-past ten; there were several other persons in the house, but no one in our company - I do not recollect seeing the landlord - I saw the waiting-maid - it is a house I chiefly use - Cole and I used to go there when he worked for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why are you so sure it was Monday, the 18th of December? A. Because I keep an account in my book of the work I do - I have no doubt that was the day - we worked there the day following and the Saturday before; I had been working there two months only - my apprentice, John Bond, worked with me; he is not here - he is eighteen years old - there is nobody here from the public-house.</p>
               <p>MR. MACLAGAN. My Lord, this witness called at my house and merely stated that Cole was a very honest man, and he had known him a long time - he did not state a word about his being at work with him.</p>

Yes; after I heard what had happened I called on Mr. Maclagan's, and told him he had worked with me the whole of Monday - I went on the Wednesday evening - I heard that evening there had been a robbery, but did not know when it had been committed.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you told him he had worked with you the whole of Monday? A. He worked with me the whole of that day - I told Mr. Maclagan he had worked with me the whole of Monday; I told him so at his street door; I remember particularly telling him so there; no one was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him he had worked with you on Saturday? A. No; I do not know that I had any particular reason for telling him he had worked with me on Monday, but I knew the man could not be at the place he was at, and the other place too.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I again ask you on your oath, whether you knew the charge was on the Monday? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you expect the Jury to believe you should mention that the prisoner was with you on the Monday; and yet you did not know the robbery was on that day? A. No, I did not - I only know that on the Wednesday morning I sent my boy to call him as usual, and he put his head out of the window and said he would follow us - we went on, he did not come, and in the evening I heard of the robbery when I came home; but I did not hear when it was.</p>

            . I live in Boar's Head-yard, Petticoat-lane. On the 20th of November, about nine o'clock, in consequence of a conversation with Lee and Foster, I went to the Flying Horse public-house, Lambeth-street; Foster searched me in Lee's presence - I had no money - Foster then gave me two half-crowns, and one shilling to stand something to drink - I had seen the prisoners before - they lived in Cobb's-yard, Petticoat-lane. I went there directly with Miles - I found the prisoners and a little boy there at tea - they sent the boy out of the way, and both prisoners said that I should be cocked for passing bad money - they said some person had been to Lambeth-street about it, and laid information against me, and I should get six months if I was found out - I said there was no fear of that, they could not find me out - they asked if I wanted any more - I said, "Yes, a score of shillings." I gave the two half-crowns to Cummings - he gave them to Fuller, who left the room for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; while she was gone, Cummings was talking to Miles; when Fuller came back she gave me this paper, containing twenty counterfeit shillings - I put them into my pocket - we had two pots of beer, which I paid for with the shilling - they had asked me, on the 17th of November, to stand some beer - I said I had no money, but would the next time. I then went straight to Lambeth-street, and saw Foster and Lee - Foster took the shillings from me, marked every one of them, and handed them to Lee in my presence. On the 27th I saw Cummings at the Coach and Horses public-house at night - he said I had given information of him - I denied it - I went to Lambeth-street, and left word for the officers to come - they came about twenty minutes to eleven o'clock; I went with them to Cobb's-yard and found Cummings - I entered into conversation with him - Fuller came in, touched me on the shoulder, and told me to get out of the house, for I had brought the Lambeth-street traps down - the officers then came in, and took them.</p>

On the following day I went into the lock-up-room - he said, "I shall only get a twelvemonth for it;" I had followed the witnesses from the Flying-horse to the prisoner's house, and saw them go in.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday morning, the 30th of December, I went with Vann and Brown to No. 214, Whitecross-street, which is kept by the prisoner Benjamin; it is a clothes-shop, and he deals in goods as well - the shop was shut, as it was his sabbath: I saw a go-cart thirty or forty yards from the house - it was afterwards claimed by Hammond in my presence; I went with Van up a passage into the back room, placing Brown at the door to prevent an escape - we found the prisoners all nearly together; I said to Benjamin, "Where is the property just brought in?" he pointed to three large parcels on the floor; two of them were beds and bedding, and the other contained a variety of articles; three chair-cushions and a tea-caddy were on the floor - all this property was there, except two tea-trays, which were afterwards produced from the parlour. We asked Benjamin who brought it there; he said, "These two men," pointing to Taylor and Hammond; Taylor denied it - we then questioned Hammond, who admitted bringing it there in company with Taylor, who still denied it, and said to Benjamin,"You are a pretty fellow, to say I brought it; you will say any thing, if you say that." Benjamin and his sister, who were present, both persisted that they had brought it there - Van then asked Hammond where he brought the property from; he said that Taylor and another man engaged him near the Elephant and Castle, and that his name was on his go-cart; which we found to be so - Taylor refused to tell his name - we asked Benjamin what they were to have for the property - he said they asked 10l., but they did not want such things. We took them all three into custody, and in three days after we compared these three cushions with three others found in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Hammond was the driver of that go-cart? A. Yes, I found he was so.</p>

            . I am in Hodge's employ. I had this coat in a truck, to take to No. 39, Old-street. I was coming out of Cow-lane - the prisoner and another lad followed me, and both pushed behind the truck; I put it down, and thanked them, but wished them to go away; they said they were going further, and would push on. When I got to the pig-market I saw the other running with the bundle, and the prisoner just after him, about three yards from the truck; I ran and collared him - he knocked me down, but I still followed, and had him taken.</p>

            . I am foreman at a slaughter-house, down the yard of the Bear and Ragged Staff, Smithfield. About seven o'clock on the morning of the 29th of December, I went to the slaughter-house, and saw a van standing in the yard - the prisoner jumped down from the back of it, and hopped away as fast as he could; he had a blue coat coat on, and something bulky under his coat, under his arm; I have known him for years, and am certain of his person; I got out, and saw him pass the corner of the pig-market; he had not then got the blue coat on - I had a lantern in my hand.</p>

I found the prisoner at Mr. Galloway's, and he took me to his lodging - I brought a box, containing the articles stated in the indictment, away from his bed - all he said was, that Mr. Galloway might do as he liked; he could not hang him, but transport him, and he could live as well in another country as in this.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What name is on that tool? A. Flynn, and I know it by the form of the tool - I believe Flynn has been convicted here; my father keeps a retail shop for the sale of tools; we never sold a saw finished in the manner this is - it was finished for our own use; we finish them better for sale; we have a number of tools under the care of the store-keeper, who gives them out as the men require them - he is not here. The prisoner never had to take work home; he could not work at home - he had no lathe or vice; I saw the box found; I think it was under a chair, but cannot be certain. I know these taps by the figures on them - we have never sold them with figures for the last two years.</p>
