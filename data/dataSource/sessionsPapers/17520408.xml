I got up and found a cabinet in the parlour broke open, and the things mentioned in the indictment missing. I went to see which way they got into the house, and found by scratches on the inside of the wall, a person had got over that, and down a funnel where I put my coals into the cellar, and from thence into the house. I immediately sent my sister to the prisoner's lodgings to enquire whether she was at home; she returned and said she had been informed there she came in at about four in the morning. I got a warrant, and had her before Justice Lediard; she could not give an account where she had been, but at first denied knowing of the things; she was committed for farther examination. On the Sunday my sister went to her lodging to see if she had hid any of the things; she is here and will give an account of it. The prisoner was re-examined and was shewed the things mentioned, except the gold case of the watch and a handkerchief. (The goods produced in court and deposed to.) Then the prisoner confessed taking them, and that the gold case was in a closet in the room where she lodged: the constable, I, and others, went there and found it as she had said; she gave me the key of her box, in which she said was a gause handkerchief, which I found accordingly; she said she was alone in it, that she got a chairman's horse on which they carry their goods, from whence she got over the wall, and down the funnel into the house, and took the things.</p>

(he produced a knife and soldier's cockade) this is the knife he had liked to have killed me with; this cockade was torn from off him in the scuffle, he took my partner's studded watch out of the cupboard.

I followed him, and knowing there was a house up, I went and called a man, and told him; we went after him; when we came to the turnpike at Hyde-Park-Corner we alarmed the two turnpike-men, they stopped him; I carried the prisoner to St. George's watch-house. After that, as I had seen him throw something out of his hand over Hyde-park-wall, and there being no watch found upon him, I went with

I had a long staff; I said, stop, you sir; he said, what must I stop for: I said, if he would not, I would knock him down; then I seized him by the collar. We led him into the turnpikehouse; we ordered him to pull his gloves off, having been before told, that the turnpike-man had bit the man's thumb that robb'd him. We saw one of his was bit. He was carried to St George's round-house. Then we sent word to the prosecutor we had taken him, and about eleven o'clock he came and swore to the prisoner before Justice Fielding.</p>

She said she knew nothing of it. The constable said, he believed she had dropped something under her; I looked down, and there found my ruby stone; she was taken to the round house and searched, of which the woman who searched her will give an account.</p>

               <p>Adolphus. I had three half guineas and one guinea in gold in my pocket, in my purse, which were gone, when I felt in my pocket.</p>

I was called to take charge of the prisoner, I had her under the stairs at the door, while the prosecutor went up to look for his purse with the gallery keeper: I saw her fumbling about her pocket, then I imagined she wanted to drop something out of it; he came down, and said, he had found the purse, and bid me take her before the justice. I bid him look under her, saying, I thought she had dropt something, he took the candle and looked, and there he found the ruby stone. (The stone produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Charles Batchelder. I was going for a bottle of water, March 23, between seven and eight at night, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Rawlinson's cellar with a jarr of raisins on his shoulder, I saw him cross the way to come round to Mincing-lane, then he came back again, I went into the shop and told the people there.</p>

            . That boy came and told us a man had gone out of the collar with a of raisins, and if I would run I might catch him, I ran and went past him, he was then coming out of Mincing-lane, the boy said that is he, I said hold on the prisoner, the prisoner said he was going into White-chapel, and that he came from the water side.</p>
               <p>Q. How does this cellar door open?</p>
               <p>Holaby. It opens into the street, and was open at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the raisins and jarr were taken out of Mr. Rawlinson's cellar?</p>
               <p>Helaby. It had on it the same mark as the other had which were then near the cellar door</p>

               <p>I was going down to the water side to see for work, it was duskish; there was a man dress'd much like a carpenter, he asked me if I would earn 3 d. or 4 d. I said with all my heart; then he said he would pay me if I would carry that jarr to White-chapel, and said he would be there as soon as I. I came up Mincing-lane, and coming by Mr. Rawlinson's door, they stopp'd me.</p>

As he was looking at them, she employed herself in taking up this piece of lawn; it was lying on the shew-board, just by the door. When they were gone out of the shop, I missed it; I went out after her, and brought her back to my shop door, and called some people to witness to my taking the piece from under her arm.</p>

               <p>Watson. She was gone about ten yards: I took the piece from her, and sent for the constable, and took her into the shop, where she kneel'd down and begged I'd forgive her. (The lawn produced in court and deposed to)</p>

On the 14th of March, I advertised the watch with two guineas reward, after which Robinson sent for me, and said, he and others could help me to the woman and watch too Then we went to Rag-fair, and got a warrant from Justice Gore, and came to the house where I lost my watch in Orange-court, Drury-lane; it was dark; from thence to the Plough again; in a little time they brought me the two prisoners, and the old woman that is released; I said I could not swear to them, for having been drinking about, my head was quite muddled; the old woman said, after the women were gone, why don't you keep them two women? they are the woman that robbed you of your watch; then the thief-takers ran out after them, but could not find them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Stamford. The prisoner came to our shop between two and three in the afternoon, March 20, for some irish stuff, I went and pulled down from a shelf about eight remnants; she said, there were none of them that would suit her, so she said, she would call again on the Monday, and went out of the shop in a hurry: I missed some of the goods; I looked out; she was running up the street. I call'd the maid to take care of the shop, and ran after her and overtook her; but not being willing to accuse her till I was quite sure. I told her I had found a remnant of irish stust that would suit her, and in the mean time I put my hand under her long scarlet cloak which she had on, and felt two pieces, she dropped one of them in the dirt; then I called for assistance and got her into the Cambridge perriwig warehouse, and sent for Master. One of the pieces I had taken down to shew her, another was standing in the window, and the other, which was borrowed, was lying on the counter ready to be carried back again, when she came in.</p>

Something before I came near him, he got nearer the foot path. As I got right against him, the first word he said was where are you going. I made no answer; said, he, I want to speak with you; he said so two or three times. I said, I had nothing to say to him, he came to the foot path with his horses in his hand, and laid violent-hands on me, he put one hand round my neck, and the otehr on my petticoats; my apron he slit in the binding: I begg'd of him to let me go home, for I had a poor family in distress with the smallpox, he took no notice of that, but got me down and swore he would have his ends of me; he said, damn you for a bitch can't you hold your tongue; he used my mouth in such an indecent manner that he set my mouth and gums a bleeding I saw a man pass by on foot; I was in hopes he would help me; I called murder: no help came: the prisoner dash'd my head against the ground, pulled me by the hair of the head; he bit my shoulder with his teeth; I had a great bump on my head the next day: in the struggling I was up once, and then I saw the man that passed by in light colour'd cloaths, standing on the causeway at a distance. The prisoner got me down a second time, and pulled me about so monstruosly, that I can hardly express it; I begg'd of him to shew me mercy, and told him that his mother was a woman. When he had satisfied his lust he let me get up a second time: after I had got from him, he called after me, and asked me, what money I had got about me, I had 3 s. and 10 d. in my pocket; thinks I, this villain will take it, I put a six-pence in my bosom, and said, I have no money; I shewed him my pocket, he took out two shillings, and two six-pences, and four-pence in copper, I had a small parcel of lobsters and cross-buns, and told him it was nothing but victuals, which my mistress had given me where I had been at work ; he said, take it, and go about your business while you are well. Then I went to the half-way houses, all three of them, to get a person to go along with me to Highate; at the Pyde-Bull, which is the second house, they told me, there was a man just gone from thence to Highgate, which they thought I might overtake; at the farthest of the three I got a man to go, and paid him before hand 3 d. out of the 6 d. I had in my bosom; he went with me almost to the Black-Dog at Highgate; I sent him back and went home, but told no-body of what had happened. I did appoint to come home on the Friday night, but on the account of Miss Jeffreys being executed I staid till Saturday: My husband being come from the pay-table and being a little in liquor, I did not tell him my misfortune that night, but on the sabbath-day morning I acquainted him with it; and told him the man was a very particular man, had on a brown stable frock, an hostler's cap, a strip'd waistcoat, and that he had no heard no his face, and a sawney looking whelp, and that if he trac'd the road he might find him.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by sawney ?</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. His face shone yellowish. My husband got up in great wrath, and went to the Queen's head at Holloway ; and as I told him of the two horses, he there was told, the horses belonged to the Dunstable waggon ( she not being with her husband could not be admitted to give evidence of hearsay) after my husband came home he told me he had seen the man, and knew where to find him. On the Monday, which was Easter-Monday, I went to his master's stable, at the White-hart, in St. John's-street, where he was hostler; I saw him, and asked him, if there was a Bedfordshire waggon came in that day; he said, there would be one in the afternoon; I asked him, what the price would be to go to Biggleswade or Temslord: he said, if I came about three or four in the afternoon I might see the waggoner ; then I went out of the yard and told my husband, I was sure he was the man; my husband then went and laid hold of him, and so did I, and I said, you are the villian that used me ill on Saturday night and took my money; he asked me, what money?</p>
               <p>Q. During this ill treatment of you, what became of the horses?</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. They were grasing on the side of the causeway all the while, they were near me, I call'd out in the time, the horses would tread upon me, he said, they should not hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they tied?</p>
               <p>E Humphreys. They were not, except the bridles were tied together, they were near me all the while.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the causeway near the high road?</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. It was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175204080011"/>Q. Which way was he going with the horses ?</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. He was coming from Highgate to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts in the road was this?</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. It was something before I came to the first bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from any house?</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. About two or three hundred yards from the houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no people passing?</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. There was no-body passed by at the time, but that man I mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was up and saw that man, how far was he from you?</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. He was farther than the length of the sessions-house, perhaps twice the length.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you gone from the prisoner when he came up and took your money.</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. I had gone farther than the length of this court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the stranger then?</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mount the horses afterwards.</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. I did not observe that.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he go afterwards?</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. He went for London.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you tell the people where you called, you had been robbed?</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. I was very much shocked afterwards, and have been ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell your neighbours at home that you had been robbed?</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. It was late, between nine and ten, when I got home, and I never had been in such an affair before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not, ask for an hostler, who had a farm to let in the country?</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. No: I never said such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was that stranger to you when he past by?</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. I am sure he was as near to me, as I am to that gentleman. Pointing to a gentleman about two yards from her.</p>
               <p>Q. What prevented your calling to him?</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. I did call out murder and all could cry.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that stranger nearer Highgate or Islington, when you saw him?</p>
               <p>E. Humphreys. He was nearer Islington.</p>

            . I live in Hatton-Garden. I was coming from Holloway home, betwixt eight and nine o'clock in the evening: near the end of the back-lane I heard a woman groan; I staid some time to consider whether I should go forwards or not: I then went on and went close by them: the woman was down upon her back, her cloaths up, her legs open, and the man upon her; she said, for God's sake, master, help; Murder! Murder! the man said, hold your tongue, you bitch. There were two horses grasing on a bank close by them in the foot path.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of horses?</p>
               <p>Tipping. One was a little poney, the other larger, I judge about fourteen hands high: by what I could discover, I thought the man had hold of the bridles, or the halters. I was afraid there was something more in it than should be, so I dar'd not stay to assist.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Tipping. It was a star-light night, but I had not light enough to distinguish so as to know their persons: I saw the man had a pair of leather breeches on, and a hostler's frock and cap.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was the frock ?</p>
               <p>Tipping. I did not observe that.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured cloaths had you on.</p>
               <p>Tipping. I had the same on, I have now ( i. e. very light colour'd.)</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was you going?</p>
               <p>Tipping. I was coming for London.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it, that you saw a man and woman in this situation and did not assist?</p>
               <p>Tipping. Because there are so many traps laid to draw people in, such as stratagems of women crying out, and the like.</p>

               <p>Q. How did this appear?</p>
               <p>Tipping. The man seem'd to be lying with her, and the woman crying out: and by seeing the two horses, I imagined there might be more hard by.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to them, when you first heard it?</p>
               <p>Tipping. I believe I was within thirty or forty yards of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you on the other side, when you made a stop?</p>
               <p>Tipping. I was thirty yards from them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find them out to give your evidence?</p>
               <p>Tipping. I read in the paper that a man was taken up, and hearing the woman was one of a good character, I sent a letter up to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175204080012"/>Q Did you see the woman when she was upon her legs ?</p>
               <p>Tipping I did not, they were on the other side the nor from me; I could not see whether they were up or no.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first relate this affair?</p>
               <p>Tipping I related it to two or three people that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you, when you got to the houses, alarm the people?</p>
               <p>Tipping. When I got to the first house, I did design to go in, but I saw at that time a man, which I supposed to be the man, came riding by full speed, so I did not go in.</p>
               <p>Q. When he pass'd you, had he any similitude to the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Tipping. I had not an idea enough of him to know that.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you send word to the prosecutrix of your coming by at the time?</p>
               <p>Tipping. I sent word on the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the woman before?</p>
               <p>Tipping. I never saw her till I sent the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet any other people on the road at this time?</p>
               <p>Tipping. No, I did not see any body.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he cloathed?</p>

               <p>Capt. Collingwood. I am an acquaintance of my Lord Lempster, and was likewise of the unfortunate deceased. On the 23d of February last, I dined with my Lord Lempster, at the Bedford-head, who told me, he had seen Capt. Gray, the deceased, that morning upon guard; I said, I had not seen him but should be very glad to see him; my Lord proposed to go to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175204080013"/> the Tilt-yard coffee-house to him; I agreed to go. We went about eight in the evening, and there we found the captain alone, and joined company with him in a room above stairs. My Lord had once at a masquerade refused to lend Capt. Gray ten guineas; they had some words after supper, I think about twelve o' clock, between them, about the circumstances of refusing,, &amp;c. I can't tell the particulars; the first affronting words I heard, was Capt. Gray gave my Lord Lempster the lie, which was without any thing amiss, for there had been very good language used before; then upon this my Lord Lempster called him rascal and scoundrel, which Capt. Gray returned with many abusive words. Mr. Gray at last jump'd up and drew his sword; my Lord Lempster had not his sword, upon which he jump'd up and got to it. I ran in between them, and got up to Capt. Gray, and was very busy in keeping them at a distance; there was, no advances made; I insisted upon their sitting down again, and putting up their swords, which they both did, I told them as there was nobody present but me, that I should never divulge any thing that happened, and they were safe in my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they stay after this quarrel ?</p>
               <p>Capt. Collingwood. I believe they might stay an hour, and they behaved very well to each other, seemingly good friends, and had no quarrel that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Whither, during that interval, they did not go into the passage?</p>
               <p>Capt. Collingwood. Not as I remember, we went all down stairs together; we left Capt. Gray at the coffee-house, and my Lord and I went away together, we parted at Charing-Cross, he went towards his lodging, and I to mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hudson. I keep the Tilt-yard coffee-house, I was not in the coffee room when my Lord Lempster and Capt. Collingwood came there, but came in soon after, which was about nine ; they were all three sitting at a table: I paid my respects to the gentlemen, and made them a bowl of punch ; they drank it, and seemed extremely sociable for some time; I cannot tell how the topick came up readily, I know it was something about lending some money. Capt. Gray seemed to harp on it. Capt. Collingwood said, you might have given him a civiller answer; and at such a time when a man is in a hurry at play, the Capt. might have excused him, that it was a hurry, and my Lord had no intention to affront him. Capt. Gray turned his head on one side and said, d - n you. My Ld. Lempster turned and talked to me about some horses, seemingly to evade it: Then my Ld. said, Collingwood, will you go and sup any where? and seemed intirely to evade it, but Capt. Gray at several intervals harp'd upon things. I think he mentioned the Cardigan; said Capt. Collingwood, with all my heart; said Capt. Gray, can't you as well sup here; my Lord said, he had no objection to the house. I went up and got a fire; this was between eleven and twelve: they went up and had some supper and more punch: I waited supper myself, which was over, I believe, about twelve. I was backwards and forwards several times in the room; they called for a pack of cards and play'd; my Lord and Capt. Collingwood play'd, and Capt. Gray sat by; then Capt. Gray came out and went his rounds, and returne d again, after which, I was in my own room a little way off; I heard a noise like showing back of chairs: I then came to their room door, and heard Capt. Gray say, D - n your blood, you scoundrel, come out; you rascal, you coward, you dare not come out. After that, I heard my Lord, who was then sitting in a chair, jump up, and said, No, Gray, I cannot put up with that; he went cross the room: I was cautious of going in, but looked through the key-hole of the door: there was Capt. Collingwood standing with Capt. Gray, he said, I beg you'll desist. My Lord advanced no farther than the table; Capt. Collingwood pacify'd Capt. Gray, and set him down again. I never went into the room at all. Had any thing happened, I could easily have gone in and laid hold on my Lord, his back being towards me: I had the latch in my hand for that purpose. They sat down after this seemingly good friends, and continued together so an hour or more. I did not think it was any more than a little drink, and did not expect it would have come to such a heighth as fighting. After this, they had another bowl of punch, which I made; when they went down stairs I lighted them down ; after this was over, before they went down, my Ld. Lempster, I believe, and Capt. Gray, were in the passage ; the lights in the passage were burnt out that I could not see; Capt. Gray ordered me to shut my room door and go in, which I did: I knew Capt. Gray's voice perfectly well.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175204080014"/>Q. Did more than one person say shut the door ?</p>
               <p>Hudson. There was talking in the passage, but I could not distinguish the voices, there was some whispering like, I can't take upon me to sware my Ld. Lempster was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Capt. Collingwood one?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I can't take upon me to sware he was, they drank a bowl of punch after this. I lighted Capt. Gray to the guard room about five o' clock: he came in again the next day about eight and breakfasted; he asked me, where Lord Lempster lived; I said, I did not know; I looked at him pretty-steadfastly, and said, I hope that little dispute is over, and there is no more of that: No, he said, no more : then I told him where he lived: then I taxed him again, and said, I hoped there is nothing at all in that affair; he said no, there is not; I am going to breakfast with him, and the affair is made up, and if I don't go he'll take it amiss.</p>
               <p>Q. to Capt. Collingwood. Do you recollect your being in the passage that night, when the last witness was ordered to shut his door?</p>

            . I am a barber; I used to dress Capt. Gray: I remember on Monday the 24th of February last, about eight in the morning, I was at the Tilt-yard guard-room; there was another officer on guard, he asked Capt. Gray where he was the night before, he said, at the Tilt-yard coffee-house with Lord Lempster and Capt. Collingwood; to the best of my remembrance they talked of indifferent things; nothing of this affair; he did say Lord Lempster had used him ill; but heard no more of that; he told me to go up to his lodgings and bring his mourning cloaths, and be at the Tilt-yard coffee-house by ten o'clock; and a pair of stockings and a plain hat; I asked him, if he would have his mourning sword; he said, no; (at other times I have brought his mourning sword with his mourning cloaths) he gave me orders to bring a yard of black ribband. I was going in at the horse guards as the clock struck ten; he was on the parade, I waited about an hour, when he was relieved: he went towards the coffee-house, as I supposed, to seek after me; I followed him there, and went up stairs and he after me; I dressed him there, he put on mourning cloaths, but not a mourning sword, he bound the ribband about the hilt of a silver mounted sword.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he appear at that time?</p>
               <p>Fudge. I thought he was confused, his countenance did not apper serene, he throwed things about in an odd manner, and called for some brandy and milk.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he used to drink such liquor?</p>
               <p>Fudge. I never saw him, sir. He went out of the coffee house about half an hour after eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Cross. I live servant with Mrs. Whiy in the Hay-Market. I remember, between eleven and twelve o'clock, Mr. Gray came and asked, if Lord Lempster lodged there, and if he was at home, and also, if his servant was at home; he desired I would go up and tell Lord Lempster his name was Gray; my Lord knocked at the wainscot for his servant and called Robert: I told him his servant was gone out, then my Lord desired I would shew the gentleman up; as I came down stairs I met my Lord's servant: I then walked about my business and said nothing to the gentleman, nor he to me; as I thought my Lord's servant a more proper person to do it than myself. I did not see the gentleman go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember you saw my Lord and the gentleman go out that morning?</p>
               <p>E. Cross. I did not see that.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you think they went out?</p>
               <p>E. Cross. I believe they went out before twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the gentleman say his name was ?</p>
               <p>E. Cross. He said his name was Gray.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the servant been out of the house.</p>
               <p>E. Cross. He told me he was going out to have a coat mended, and I did not know but he was out till I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think Lord Lempster heard Mr. Gray's voice.</p>
               <p>E. Cross. I can't tell that. I was up no more than three or four stairs, and answered through the wainscot. My Lord might hear the knock at the door, but Capt. Gray spoke low.</p>

Gray walking in the fields, on my left-hand; I did not know them then, they were walking side by side very amicably, I looked at them but a very little while, and continued my walk, they were in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175204080015"/> the next field to me about the middle of it, (it was a very fine day.)</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that field they were in, from the Hay-market ?</p>
               <p>Powell. I believe it is a mile or better; a very little time after I had seen them, not having walked above three hundred yards, I happened to turn my head by accident, they were engaged with swords, both naked, Capt. Gray had turn'd with his face toward London, Lord Lempster stood in a line as he had walked, I had a side view of them; immediately I cry'd out to them, not to kill one another, I ran towards them, and had got but a very little way, before Capt. Gray dropp'd on his knee, and got up again, and advanced a step or two, and then fell on his face, he never rose more: while Capt. Gray advanc'd in this manner, Lord Lempster stood then upon a retreat, with the point of his sword dropt; when the Captain fell on his face, Lord Lempster look'd upon him a little time, and said, O Lord! O God! What is this! in a mournful voice like surpriz'd, and then went off; I immediately went over the ditch, the deceased was vomiting blood as he lay on his face, I kneeled down by him and turn'd him on his back, I held up his head with my left hand, and asked him how he did, he opened his eyes very wide, and fix'd them, he vomited a torrent of blood, and died instantly; I wiped his mouth, and hop'd he would have spoke, I open'd his waistcoat and pull'd up his shirt, and saw a small wound in his right side, there was a small effusion of blood: Lord Lempster went off hastily; I follow'd him, and came up with him just at the entrance in the town in the street, my Lord came up to me, and told me Capt. Gray had call'd upon him on this occasion, that the Captain was an officer, and so was he, and said, Sir, what could I do? I could not help it, he made me go out with him, or forced me, and I am sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thrust after the Capt. was fallen upon his face?</p>
               <p>Powell. I did not. The Capt. advanced up to my Lord before he fell, and put out his sword: I was a good deal confused : I could not take a minute's observation of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see my Lord return a thrust, after that putting out his sword?</p>
               <p>Powell. No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up to my Lord, or he to you?</p>
               <p>Powell. He stopp'd and came from the other side of the way rather towards me, and entered into talk of this unhappy subject.</p>

            . The Captain had received a wound on his breast, which penetrated between the third and fourth rib, into the cavity; and without doubt was the occasion of his death; it was impossible for him to live.</p>
               <p>Lord Lempster being called upon to tell the court what he had to say, spoke to the following purport.</p>
               <p>Lord Lempster. I have only to say, I am extreamly sorry to be the unhappy occasion of Mr. Gray's death, as he was a gentleman of great honour, and for whom I had great regard, I made use of all the arguments I could, in order to dissuade him from his intentions, that is not to fight, when we went on our way; when we came to the field, he drew first upon me, and I was under a necessity of killing him, in my own defence; for which I am verily sorry, and wish it had never happened.</p>

            . I am wife to John Saunders. On the 27th of December last, between six and seven in the morning, my husband bade me clean myself, and said, I must go with him and Campbell ; I did, we went all three together; Campbell carried a basket, but what was in it I did not then know. When we came on London-bridge we met a relation of my husband's: he staid to talk with him, and bid me not to leave Campbell. We went together to Long-Lane, on this side the water, near Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live?</p>
               <p>E. Saunders. I live in St. Mary Magdalen Bermondsey parish ; Campbell lodged with us, we went to the sign of the Bull; Campbell left me there, and took the basket with him; and said, he'd go and see for Cordosa: He returned in about a quarter of an hour, and said, he had seen the man, and that he would meet us at the Taylor's-Arms in Duke's-place. We went there and found the prisoner ; he asked Campbell what he had got, he answered plate. He took out a silver quart belly tankard, two pint pots, one a new fashioned one with a belly, the other an old one, and a silver tea pot chased half way down. Campbell asked, what he would give per ounce? he said, he would not give above 3 s. and 6 d. per ounce for the tankard; because there was a great deal of loss in the solder and the handle; and 4 s. per ounce for the two pint mugs and tea pot. They agreed; then Cordosa went out, and brought in a pair of scales and weights,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175204080018"/> he weighed the tankard first, it weighed 25 ounces ; then the two pint mugs together weighed 26 ounces; and the tea-pot, which weighed 17 ounces, he abated an ounce for the handle of the tea-pot, so made that but 16; then he reckoned up the money: it came to 13 l. 8 s. which 8 s. he kept for the loss as he said, that would be in the melting of it down. I was a little surprized. The prisoner turned to me and took me by the hand, and said, Madam, don't be surprized, for your husband is a very clever young fellow, and if he can trust to Campbell not to betray him, he may be worth a thousand pounds in six months time; he need not be afraid of coming to me, for if it were the King's crown I would buy it with safety. My husband was not there. Then he talked to Campbell, and told him he was a very lucky man never to be taken, considering he was the last of fourteen left alive that he was acquainted with, and that he would advise him to keep out of Rag-fair; saying, now you are so happy as to be acquainted with a man, whose name was never brought in question before, he might always be safe; by which, by his looking to me, he meant my husband. He wished him good luck, and then we parted. Campbell talked to him, as though he was acquainted with him.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the cause of your fear ?</p>
               <p>E. Saunders. I had reason to suspect the things were not honestly come by; my husband and Campbell had talked of some things made me think so; and being amongst Jews and strange people, I would have been glad to have been out of the place.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Campbell lodged at your house?</p>
               <p>E. Saunders. From the 8th of September last.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he?</p>
               <p>E. Saunders. He was a seafaring man.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Whether or no, when that witness came to take me, a little girl did not set me, she being uncertain of me?</p>
               <p>E. Saunders. I was sure as to the prisoner; I went to one Buckland's, a house were he used to be at over against the Bull in Long-Lane, where I was the day before. Stanley and Macdaniel, two thief-catchers, were there to take him. Stanley gave me his gold watch, and told me to go there and send for Cordosa to offer it him to sell; that he might have an opporportunity of taking him. I went there, and asked the woman of the house to send for Mr. Cordosa; she sent a girl for him, he came ; I told him I had a watch belonging to the two young men that were here yesterday. The moment he came to the door I knew him. Before I had time to say what I intended, the thief-catchers came, and asked, if that was he? I said, this is the man, and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I can prove where I was at work that very day she says she sold me the plate.</p>

            , the servant-maid said, she should know the man that brought it. I fetched the prisoner to her: the maid said, he brought it. I took him before justice Fielding, there she swore it. The other was found at Mr. Crooke's at Turnstile, ( Both produced in court and deposed to) one marked M. M. S. the other M. B.</p>
               <p>Mary Linch. The prisoner brought the spoon to Mr. Young's, my master: he said, it was his mistress's, and that the mark was for her maiden name. I had not a satisfactory account from him; so I stopp'd it. He said, he would go and fetch a person to prove it, and that his mistress's name was White; I saw no more of him till his master brought him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Crooke deposed, the prisoner brought the other spoon to him, and said, he and another person had won it at raffling, that he bought it of him for 7 s. 10 d. wt. an ounce and half.</p>

            . The firkin of butter belongs to Mr. Child and Company. (He mentions the partners names.) the other evidence had hold on the prisoner, and the butter lay at his foot ; we had ten firkins of this butter that were told and stood ready to be delivered, in the passage ; I went and looked at them, there was then but nine ; this in the street was the other, they were all mark'd J.

I told them I was neither able nor willing to resist them, and hoped they would not use me ill: two of them held me by the arms, whilst the third rifled my pockets: they took from me my watch, and half a guinea, and about nine shillings. One of the robbers was in a white coat of the make and size of the prisoner at the bar; I saw his face very plainly more than once during the robbery, and verily believe the prisoner is the man, but I dare not positively sware to him; but this I do positively sware, that a man was coming up the hill and near us, while the robbery was committing, and the man in the white coat went to him and bid him retire, or he would beat or blow out his brains, or to that effect. I little thought to have heard any thing of the robbers; but the next day, my wife having occasion to buy something in the neighbourhood, heard that there had been a robbery committed in that place the night before: that one Perrin saw the robbery, and knew one of the robbers; he is servant to one Mr. Brumley: I sent for him; he came; I asked him, whether he had seen a robbery on the hill the night before; he said he had; I asked him, what part of the hill: he said, that part that is over against Hog-Island, which was the very place. I saw the prisoner in New prison the day after his apprehension, and I had a strong remembrance of his countenance  but don't sware he is the man.</p>

            . On Friday night the 10th of March, about eleven o'clock, as I was going from Mr. Brumley's still-house to Gray's-Inn-Lane for a pint of beer, as near as I can remember, on Mount Pleasant I heard a gentleman say, take what I have got and welcome, but don't use me ill. I was got near, but drove back by the prisoner at the bar; he held a stick up to me, and said, d - n your eyes if you don't turn back again about your business, I'll knock your brains out; he was in a white duffil coat. I retired and went directly into the still-house, and there staid: I told two of our men, that had just come out of the tun from throwing off the grains of it; and that I knew one of them very well; and that the other men that was with him were rifling the gentleman they were robbing, while he came to me.</p>

I am wife to the prosecutor; I am very certain all the handkrechiefs were safe, lying in the window near the street, forty six in all, and the shop too, over night at 10 o'clock, I saw them so myself, the handkerchiefs were in parcels, in one twelve, in another eight, another seven, &amp;c. I can't tell how many parcels : I having a young child, did not get up when my husband did, I got up between six and seven; I found the window-shutter with a hole in it, likewise the glass, and the handkerchiefs all gone; the men came to our house again between eight and nine, and brought some handkerchiefs, I said I knew them, and could tell the number of them within one or two; before the Justice I asked him leave to ask the prisoners one question, which I did, I asked them, when you took the handkerchiefs out, there were two parcels of yellow handkerchiefs, do you remember that? one said, I don't remember because it was dark; said I, can you remember how many large parcels there were? Hail said, he did not: said I, this is strange, that out of forty-six, I should have but twenty-five; he said, all we took, they took from us.</p>

            . Last monday, Remington, Maryot, and I, all agreed together to watch for George Hall, he having been lately come out of prison, and his wife had got new cloaths; we saw he had a light in his room, it was a lodging-room, in Kingsland Road; we staid in a stable near the place where he must come by, and about the hour of two, the watchman was calling the hour, Hall came by with a bag on his left shoulder, from Shoreditch ward, with the other prisoner, his wife was in bed, and had a light in the chamber, he knock'd at the door, his wife let him in, I had left my shoes in the stable, and followed them up stairs, I heard them whispering, then I went in; I came down again to the other two in the stable, and said, I really believ'd they had got something they had stole, and said, I'll go and break the door open; I went up again, and looked in at the key-hole, I saw a handkerchief lie on a chest of drawers, then I knock'd at the door; Hall said, who is there? I find, it is I; he opened the door, and the handkerchief which I had seen with a bundle in it, was removed away; then I said, I saw you come along with a little fellow, and you had a bag on your shoulder, then Charles Remington came up; I took the candle and looked in the closet, there was the other prisoner; Hall gave a spring down stairs, Maryot was there, and took hold on him, then he call'd out for mercy, and said he was a dead man ; we found the handkerchiefs behind the bed; then Hall told us where he got them: we handcuffed the prisoners together, and they brought us to the prosecutor's house, and shew'd us the hole, and how they got them, then we call'd the people up.</p>
               <p>Hall. We have no occasion to deny it, we did the fact: going along, these men said, the people should not have all the handkerchiefs, we'll keep twenty of them for ourselves: we took forty-six handkerchiefs, and they produced but twenty-six.</p>
               <p>(The handkerchiefs produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor's wife; and that there were twenty missing. )</p>

I told him they had got my watch; he said, don't go out of the house, I'll fetch assistance; he went away and fetched Mr.

Last Monday was se'nnight, the prisoner's own sister's husband lay dead in her house; there was a dispute betwixt the prisoner and her husband, about who should wear a cloak to the burial, which was just about going out, she thought it more proper for him to have a cloak, rather than the man that had it, and told him if he would not, she would mob him to the ground : he said, G - d blast you out of the world, and hit her a back-handed blow on the face; then she flew to the fire, took up an iron holdfast about nine inches long which they used to stir the fire with, and being about three yards from him flung it, it stuck in his side, he doubled himself together, and said, I am stabbed! I am stabbed! it is in my ribs! her sister took it out, he lived a week after this.</p>

I went to this sister's as she called her; she told me I was to give her six-pence and she a shilling to lie with me all night. I gave her sister three-pence to fetch a pot of beer: and while I was busy playing with the prisoner she picked my pocket of five shillings, and said, now we will go to bed presently and jostled me on the bed: I saw her go to the window with money in her hand, to see what it was: I sat a little while to consider with myself: I put my thumb and finger into my fob; there was but 1 s. 6 d. left, she was upon me in a manner when she jostled me on the bed: she came again a second time after she had been at the window and put her hand in my pocket; then I felt her hand plain; I lost 5 s. and upwards; then she went away; I said, I was robbed and wanted to call the watch; then they throw'd my hock of bacon down stairs, and shov'd me down stairs; then as she was gone I charged the sister.</p>

            . I was here and saw Goddard tried in Sept. sessions. I remember the prisoner was a witness examined on the behalf of Goddard. I saw him sworn, to speak the truth and nothing but the truth, After which he said, I met with this Jew near Brentford Turnpike, and asked him if he'd drink a pint of beer; I then took hold of his heard in a joke, and he held up his staff and struck me; a man there said, go along old Jew, or you'll have your drubbing; I ran after him and put him in a ditch, and scratched him in the bushes, then I flung a stone at his head and broke it; he held up his hands and his head bled at that time: being asked at what time this was, he answered this is three weeks ago.</p>

            . On Wednesday the 21st of August, between four and five in the afternoon, as I was walking on foot my leg began to swell; I went in at the Rose and Crown on this use Smallbury-Green to ask if I could lodge there. I saw a witness that is here, Lettice Sergeant, I told her I would pay her for what I had if they would let me lie there, the woman went backwards to ask, in the mean time the prisoner brought some beer out at the door, and asked me if I would drink with him; I would not drink at all; he attempted to pull me by the beard, but never touched my beard: I gave him a shove from me; I had a walking cane in my hand, but did not hold it up; I never meddled with him; after this the woman came out and told me I could not have a lodging. I went away; the prisoner came after me and I began to run, he hollow'd after me, stop thief, and ran after me, there were gentlemen on horseback; I ran between their horses; the prisoner seemed to be a little in liquor; after that I went to Brentford, and there lodged at the Red-Lion; I neither stumbled not tumbled at all; there was no stone throwed after me, nor none touched me: I had no would nor mark of blood about me: it was not above two minutes from the time of Ashley's asking me to drink, and my coming up to the men on horseback.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination he said, he returned to London the day following, that between the 21st and 29th of Aug. he continued there, and set out on Wednesday the 29th for Bristol, and that night he was robbed.</p>

            , on this side the turnpike on Smallbury-green ; I was there from the latter end of April to Michaelmas Day. I remember on the 21st of August Mr. Rickets was starting of beer: Ashley, the prisoner, was there almost all that day, he had been drinking: there are two benches at the door, the Jew came there, he sat on the bench on the left hand and I on the right: he asked me for lodging, as well as he could in broken English, he turned up his linnen and opened his bosom to shew me he was a clean man, and that he would pay for his lodging. I went in and asked Mrs. Rickets if she would lodge him. She made a pish at it; I came and told him he could not lodge there I believed. I went by his desire again; she said, that she could not give an answer till she saw her husband; in the mean time, the prisoner went out of the house with a pint of beer in his hand, and said, old father, will you drink? the Jew shook his head, and said something, but I don't know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175204080029"/> what; he never touched the pot: then the prisoner called him a rogue and a Jew, and endeavoured to take him by the heard, and catched hold on him, the Jew put his hand up and pushed him away; the Jew continued till the gentlewoman came to the door; then I said, can you lodge this man? she said, I will go and ask my husband; he gave him a heavy curse, and said, he was a Jew, and should not, I told him; the poor man got up to go away; Ashley sat down in his place, and called him rogue and Jew: the Jew turned again, and as well as he could, said he was not a rogue, Ashley was a rogue: he got up in great haste to run after the Jew; I said to his wife, it is a pitty, don't let him follow him: she took hold on his sleeve, he gave a jerk and fell down ; the Jew turned round and looked at him, then he went along, I saw four gentlemen on horseback come along, he got between their horses from the time of Ashley's coming with the beer, and the Jew getting betwixt the horses Ashley had not thrown him in a ditch nor scratched him in the bushes, or throwed a stone at him; I never saw no such thing : I was out at the door there all the time, the gentlemen came up to the door to me, after they had stopp'd Ashley. Mr. Rickets at this time was in his shop, learning out at the window where he fells his liquors, he was not at that time out at t he door: the gentlemen on horseback stopped Ashley, and his wife got up there, and took hold of him? then the Jew was got out of fight. Ashley never touched him in the pursuit. The next morning Ashley was in the same house again, a little before breakfast time; the men were laughing at him for running after this man to use him ill: Ashley said, he never run after him, for he was so drunk, he could neither run after, or overtake him. The very night before the trial of Goddard, the prisoner rode up in a post-chaise to Mr. Rickets's house, and called for Mr. Rickets: he was busy, and asked what he wanted? he said, drive on, boy, to the post-boy, and made Rickets no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people saw this affair between the Jew and the prisoner?</p>
               <p>L. Sergeant. The prisoner's wife, one Rose Ford, and one Baily a butterman.</p>
               <p>And on her cross examination she said, The prisoner catched hold on the Jew's beard, the Jew had a stick in his hand, but never offered to lift it from the ground, or offered to strike him: that the Jew said, no heard, no heard : that the Jew did not run till he saw the prisoner running towards him. That the prisoner gave him a heavy curse; that she continued sitting on the right hand side in the poach, but got up and went into the road while they were running: that she saw no stones throwed: that there is a very clean ditch, no briars to hang over it, it is a deep ditch, on one side; but the Jew run more on the other side: that the Jew crossed right against Madam Spire's, having not run above twenty yards before he crossed the way.</p>
               <p>Rose Ford. I remember seeing the prisoner and the Jew at the alehouse, near Smallbury-green : I was at the door when the Jew came up, Ashley stood at the door with a pint of beer in his hand, he asked the Jew to drink; he refused to drink. I came away from there, it may be about thirty or forty yards from the door; I had my little boy with me: I stood still looking about me; I saw the Jew come from Mr. Ricket's door, and in a little time came Ashley, swearing and cursing, stop thief, he has robbed me! they ran strait the road, then crossed into the foot-path ; I gave the Jew room to come by me. Ashley was so fuddled he never could overtake him, neither did he throw a stone at him, nor was he thrown in a ditch: there were some gentlemen coming; the Jew ran between their horses: they asked, what was the matter? I said there was nothing the matter, he had robbed him of nothing. Ashley answered, he has robbed me of my beer. The Gentlemen said to Ashley, you sorry man, let the man go about his business, and do you go along with us to the Rose and Crown or we'll horsewhip you.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a ditch?</p>
               <p>R. Ford. There is a ditch, but very little briars and things grow over it; there is a wall by Mrs. Spires's.</p>
               <p>Q. How did any body know you was able to give evidence of this?</p>

            . I live at the Temple-Muse, Fleet-street, White Fryars, on the 21st of August last, I set out from my house after one o'clock, for Newberry-Fair by myself, till I came on the other side Hammersmith, there Mr. Pain and Mr. Mercer overtook me; we lay at Maidenhead that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175204080030"/> night; we continued in company till we came to Newberry; upon out going between the Coach and Horses, on the other side Brentford, and the Rose and Crown Alehouse, before we came at the Turnpike, I saw one man pursuing another; we might be about two hundred yards from the Rose and Crown Alehouse ; I saw it was a Foreigner by his dress, that was pursued, which made me anxious to enquire what was the matter; the man behind called out stop Thief! stop Thief! which I believe to be the prisoner at the bar; when the Jew got to us, he got between Mr. Pain's horse and mine; the drunken man, the pursuer, scrambled up near, we kept him back, the drunken man said he is a rogue and a villain; we desired he'd tell us what he had done; he said he has drank my beer and ran away, and would not pay for it; said I if that he all, let the poor man go about his business, and what is to pay, I'll pay it; no said he, he would not, and made a scuffle to come at the Jew; I took particular notice of the Jew, he made signs holding his hand up to his beard, we said he should desist; then he said to me, you have robbed me, said I if this is the case you are a villain, and if you say so again I'll horse-whip you; we stopped him there till the Jew got near to the houses at Brentford ; he was very near turning the corner where the bridge is; I believe on my oath, the Jew was at least two-hundred yards off; I turned myself on my horse, half britch, to see whether he was secure, the drunken man swore and cursed, and used many bad words; there came a woman and took hold on him, she seem'd to be his wife, she desired him to go back: he fell down, then Mr. Pain said, the man is safe enough; the last woman that gave evidence told me nothing was the matter, that the Jew did nothing to him, he had drank none of his beer, but refused it, and that he made an attempt to pull him by the beard, with that we advanced towards the Crown Alehouse, I, and I believe Mr. Pain, stopt with me; there was the woman that was examined first, I asked her what was the matter, she said no thing at all; I said if there is anything to pay for beer that that poor Jew has drank, I am ready to pay for it; she said the Jew did no harm to the man, nor drank none of his beer.</p>

               <p>Q. Had there been a stone throw'd?</p>
               <p>Wright. I saw none throw'd, and believe the man was so drunk that he was not able to pursue or over-take him: I saw the woman at the door the time they were running, they crossed the road backwards and forwards; the Jew kept, it may be, fifteen or twenty yards before him, I kept my eye, upon them from the first of the calling out stop thief! On his cross examination he said, When they first heard the alarm, he believed the Jew might be within fifty yards of the alehouse, and they about two-hundred yards from the Rose and Crown alehouse ; that they were nearer that than the Coach and Horses; that they met the Jew about two-hundred yards on this side the Rose and Crown alehouse ; that he saw no blood or mark at all on the Jew, that he made no such complaint or sign to his head, but said my beard, and sign'd to it.</p>

Mr. Wright ask'd that woman, what had happened at the alehouse, saying if he had drunk any beer, he'd pay for it; she said he had drank none of his beer; the other woman gave the same account.</p>

The woman said she was come to support the cause of this poor unhappy man, and added, that in August last there were four gentlemen coming on the road when he was pursued, and he has made all the enquirey he can to find them out, and can't find any of them; said I what time in August? she said the 21st; I look'd at the Jew, and saw he was the same man; I ask'd his interpreter whether he was pursued by any man, he said yes, he was; I said to the woman, I know the men, by which means I was brought to the grand jury about this affair; this bill and mine were in together.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar told me he had been a witness at the Old Bailey for Mr. Goddard, and that Goddard was cleared, and that he took him down to his house to be paid for his trouble: that after he had made him welcome he took him by the hand and led him to the door, and said Mr. Ashley I shall have a respect for you all the days of my life, for you actually saved my life, though I deserve to die, for I actually robbed the man: then he took him in again to pay him for his trouble, and asked him what he must have: he answered, he would trust to his honour: then Goddard throwed him down half a guinea, and asked if that would satisfy him: he grumbled, and then he threw him down a crown more, and at last he made it up a guinea: then as he went away he told him to come again such a day, there would be some gentlemen there. He went, and said he thought there were a hundred gentlemen at the table; that they called for a plate to gather money for him; that a gentleman had gave a shilling, then Mr. Goddard came and took the plate out of his hand, seized Ashley by the collar, and turned him out at the door, saying, he was a rogue: so he went away very angry: some time after this there was a trial to come on at Westminster-hall,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175204080032"/> Ashley was subpoen'd there: he told Goddard he did not care to go, and that if he did, he should do him more hurt than good, unless he would pay him better for it. I have heard Ashley grumble about it many times, that he was not paid enough, that had he known as much as he then did, he would not have spoke till he had been better paid.</p>

I said, I supposed he know'd, but when we came into the chaise I would inform him: I took him into the Inn, where my horses were, and in a room I told him the purport of my warrant was for giving evidence for Goddard at the Old Bailey, I had a warrant from my Lord Mayor, backed by Justice Fielding; I said I suppose you are no stranger to it; you know you ill treated the Jew, and it is a very bad thing you did to a stranger; you ought to let strangers go about their business: you broke his head; pray, whereabouts did you break it? he put his hand to his temple, and said, hereabouts ; I got him into the chaise, and rode with him in it, and let the constable ride my horse; as we were going along, he told me, that the night Mr. Goddard was discharged at the Old Bailey, he went home with him, and after some time, Mr. Goddard took him out into his yard, and shook him by the hand, and said, Mr. Ashley, I thank you for the good office you have done me, you have saved my life, I ought to have -</p>

            . I live at the Rose and Crown, a little on this side Smallbury-Green Turnpike: I remember this Jew came to my house the 21st of August, about three or four o'clock: Ashley at that time was there, he work'd with Mr. Clements ; the Jew ask'd for lodging, I said to him, he was of the wrong country; when he found he could not lodge there, he was going away from the door; Ashley had been drinking a little, he offer'd some beer to him out of his pint: instead of giving him beer, he laid hold on his heard, and shook him by it, Ashley did not deliver his pint to him; then the Jew took himself away, about ten or fifteen yards, he had a sort of a cane, and a black string to it, he shook it at him: then Ashley ran after him, and pelted him with gravel stones across the road, backwards and forwards, whether he hit him or no I can't say, he flung several handfuls of loose gravel stones, a dozen times very likely.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did they run?</p>
               <p>Rickets. Towards Brentford Bridge, there were some horsemen came up, so we could not see whether the Jew was in the ditch or not. The horsemen said when they came to my house, the drunken man had throw'd him in the ditch: they were gentlemen like, they came and asked why the Jew was used so ill? my wife and I both spake to them: then they ask'd if he had left his reckoning to pay? we said he had nothing to drink, nor did he ask for any, only lodging: I saw no more of the Jew, nor did I see Ashley till next morning.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination he said, He was here on Goddard's trial, that Ashley then was examin'd, that he himself was also examined then, and gave the same evidence he does now: that he then said he saw Ashley pelt the Jew with gravel stones, and he told the same then, as to the horsemen telling him Ashley had put the man in the ditch; that he was waiting upon some gentleman with liquor at the door, at the time: that some of the gentleman were on horse-back, some on foot: that some of them live at Windsor: that he spoke with the Jew twice himself before Ashley came out with his beer: that he saw the Jew go to lay hold on the pint pot, and was within three or four yards of them at the time: that the Jew might be twenty or twenty-five yards off, before Ashley<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175204080033"/> could set out after him; that the Jew was about a hundred yards from his house before Ashley took up any gravel to throw at him, and that Ashley might be within thirty yards of the Jew; that he never saw Ashley catch the Jew; that he did not see the horsemen stop Ashley, nor see Ashley fall down on the ground. Being again asked, whether the horsemen did or did not say the Jew was put in the ditch, and bid to be careful what he said, for the gentlemen were in court, he said, they did not tell him so; and added, he had not said they had told him so.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not Mr. Goddard been now out of the court to tell you what the witnesses have sworn for the crown, before you came in.</p>
               <p>Rickets. Mr. Goddard did come out, but I did not hear him say any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Wright. Did you, or any of you, tell this witness the drunken man had thrown the Jew into the ditch?</p>
               <p>Wright. When this witness said so, it gave me a shock: we neither of us told him so. I saw Ashley down: there were none but women at that man's house when we came there.</p>

            . I was present at the Rose and Crown when the Jew applied to Mr. Rickets for lodging; Mr. Rickets said he had none, he was of the wrong sort: Ashley came out there with a pint of beer, and asked the Jew to drink: the Jew went to drink, Ashley catched the beer away and took hold of his beard and gave it a shake or two. The Jew said, Don't, don't, let me alone, in English. He went away about 15 or 16 yards, and shook his stick at Ashley: Ashley ran after him all down the Road, and threatened to knock him down; we stood at Mr. Rickets's door: the Jew was about five or six yards before him; as they ran Ashley threw stones and pelted him all down the Road as far as I could see: I saw him pick up stones, gravel, and one thing or another: I saw none of them hit him: he followed the Jew 200 yards and above. I did not see him throw him in the ditch; he was very near it once on the right hand side: the horsemen stopped all at once, and I could not see him any more.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examination he said, He was servant to Mr. Freeman a brewer; that they were starting beer at Mr. Rickets's house, and putting the butts into the cellar; that he saw the Jew come up first and ask for lodging; that he had not seen Ashley before he came out with a pint of beer in his hand; that the Jew had not given him any offence as he knew of; that Ashley picked up stones to throw when the Jew was about fourteen or fifteen yards from the door, and continued throwing all the way as far as he could see, till they met the gentlemen, now and then stooping and hallooing; that he heard nothing of stop thief; that he did not see the Jew go in between the horses; that the gentlemen might be ten or fifteen minutes talking to Ashley in the road; that he went into the cellar to work, and don't know what became of Ashley; that he did not see Ashley fall; that he saw Ashley's wife go out of the house to stop him, but did not see her come up with him.</p>

I am sure I saw that, but can't tell how often. They ran a good way down the road, it may be a hundred yards.</p>

            . I was by when the Jew applied to Rickets for Lodging. Mr. Rickets denied him; he asked again and pulled out money, I think it was a sixpence, and said I have money to pay. Mr. Rickets said you are of the wrong Country, I can't lodge you. Ashley came out with a pint of beer in his hand, and asked him to drink, he offered to take the beer; instead of that he took the Jew by the beard, and shook him pretty handsomely. the Jew got about ten or twelve yards, or more, off, and turned about and shook his stick at him: then Ashley swore if he did not go along he would break his head; he went forward, and turned round in about ten yards more: then Ashley set out after him, and took up stones, one, two, or three I believe, and throwed at him, and ran after him almost as far as we could see, and kept picking up something, we could not tell what: I did not see any stone light upon him: he pursued him, as near as I can guess, about a quarter of a mile; there was a ditch on each side: I saw some Horsemen come up: I saw the Jew in the ditch, he fell against a bank almost a quarter of a mile from us. I saw Ashley at the same time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175204080034"/> tak up something and fling at him: there were four, five or six people on horse-back came, this might be about twenty yards from them.</p>

               <p>Jelfe Lamb. On the 29th of March, I had been to a relation's house to supper, when I came home our people were gone to bed, I went to return to where I had been, and had not gone twenty yards from our door, when the prisoner met me, she asked me where I was going? I said, home, she said, go with me; I said, where? she led me through several Alleys, till she came to a house in <placeName id="t17520408-59-crimeloc305">Stony-lane, near Petticoat-lane</placeName>

               <p>Barlow Sayer. Mr. Lamb came and told me he had lost his watch, and desired I would go and search for it: we met the prisoner in Leadenhall-street, he said that was the woman, so I secured her : when we were coming along Lombard-street, in order to bring her to the Compter, she told us, if we would desist, she would tell us where the watch was; we got her into the Compter, the next day going before the sitting Alderman, she told me, if I would be favourable, she would send a gentleman to me the next day, and Mr. Lamb should have the watch, (she did not say she had taken it.)</p>

The prisoner came last Monday morning about eleven o'clock into the shop of my father, and asked for two pair of stockings; I understood he meant boy's stockings, I fetched and opened two pair, he looked at them, and said, are these for girls; I said no; then he said he wanted girls; I fetched some, he chose out two pair, val. 2 s. 6 d. then he gave me a guinea to change; I went with it to the desk, he came to the side of it and asked me for an 18 s. piece, I told him I had never a one; he then put his hand into the drawer, in the bottom of the desk, where there were nine guineas in gold, two half guineas, and two 36 s. pieces, he took some, if not all of it, up in his hand, and with his finger and thumb shuffled it over, then throwed it down; he then asked me for crown pieces, half crowns, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175204080039"/> shillings ; I told him I had but one half-crown, and that he should have in his change, and accordingly gave it him amongst the rest of his change, which was 18 s. and 6 d. then he went out of the shop, and in the afternoon about three, when I went to cast up my accompt, as usual, I found a half-guinea missing out of that gold. On Friday, the day after, the prisoner and another man came together, about eleven o'clock; they asked for a pair of girls stockings, they bought a pair, val. 15 d. the other person gave me a guinea to change; I took it and went to the desk and put it into the drawer, and was going to give him his change ; he asked me for an 18 s. piece; I told him I had never a one ; he then came near the desk; my hand was in it; and the lid on my head; I put my hand back thinking to keep him off, he put his hand into the drawer and took up the gold as the prisoner had done before, then there where ten guineas and a half, and two 36 s. pieces, he shuffled it about with his finger and throwed it down again pretty hard, after I had given him his change, which was half a guinea and the rest in silver and half-pence; then he asked me the price of some bays, which was in the window; I told him 18 d. a yard, he offered me a shilling; I told him he should have it for 16 d. he offered me 13 d. 14 d. 15 d. then I told him he should have it; then he said he could not stay, and both went out of the shop: when I went to make up my accompt, which might be about three hours after, I missed three guineas; there had not been any Person there, till I made up my accompt, I was in the shop all the time. The prisoner came again on the Wednesday between eleven and twelve, he came and asked for a pair of stockings ; I opened him some, upon Mr. Willis's coming in, the prisoner wanted to go out, seeming to have some suspicion, but by the assistance of him and others of my neighbours he was secured.</p>

            . I had heard that the lad had been robbed, on Wednesday a little before noon; my son, who was in my shop, called to let me know, one of the men that had robbed Tom, Scart, was there then: upon that I called one of my men to follow me; I took a stick and went; my man was at the door ; I spoke to a boy to fetch one Mr. Phillips ; I don't know that the prisoner heard me, but he seemed not to like our standing there; he was looking at some stockings, and without saying any thing to the lad, he was going away; when he came to the door I laid my hand upon him, at that very time Mr. Phillips came; the prisoner made a push to go, but we got him into the shop again; he desired to know what was the matter? we told him he should hear before a magistrate so he was committed.</p>

               <p>I came there on Monday about ten or eleven o' clock, I bought two pair of stockings for a little girl; he changed me a guinea, and gave me half a guinea in gold, and the rest in silver; I said if you have not silver enough give me an 18 s. piece; on Tuesday I went again, and a strange man, I do not know him, he wanted some bays, the man bought a pair of stockings of him for a child ; after that he gave him half a guinea to change. We went away on Wednesday, I passing by there, asked the boy if he would take the money for the bays, then I wanted a pair of ribbed stockings, he asked me 3 s. and 6 d. I said, I would give him 2 s. and 9 d. We could not agree; mean while this gentleman came in with two more; I went to go out of the shop, they stopped me, and took me to Guildhall, the boy said he lost half a guinea on the Monday about half an hour after I went away; then the gentlemen said, why did not he stop me on the Tuesday, the man that was with me could not speak English, he speaks Italian.</p>
