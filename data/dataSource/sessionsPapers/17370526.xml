              I have known the Prisoner five Years and upwards; he was my 'Prentice. On Sunday the 17th of April between four and five in the Afternoon, he asked me Leave to go and see his Father for half an Hour; I gave him Leave, and his not returning Home, made me have a Suspicion he had done some Mischief; accordingly going into my Son's Room where we keep the Money, I found the Desk broke open; upon which I went to his Father-in-Law to acquaint him of it, but he could say nothing to the Purpose; so I went to the Printer of the Daily Advertiser, to have him inserted in the Papers the next Day, which was done accordingly. Then I apply'd to the Post-Office, to have Expresses sent to divers Places, and on Monday se'enight afterwards, I receiv'd a Letter from Mr. Scroop and Mr. Reynolds with notice that there had been a Person apprehended at Lincoln, which answer'd the Advertisement that was given of him, and that he had made a Confession before them, that he was my Servant, and had robb'd me, but not of so much as I charge him with. I sent down a Friend, and when my Friend came, he was call'd upon again, to a second Confession.</p>

            . My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. After the Wights had received Letters from Mr. Scroop and Mr. Reynolds, at their Request I went down to Lincoln, and I got there the 27th of last Month. I went to the Prisoner in Lincoln Goal, and after some Discourse with him, finding he confessed only 161l I advised him to give an Account of the whole Sum; and the next Morning when I went to him again, he gave me an Account wrote with his own Hand of 172 l. 9 s. 6 d. which Account is here; I saw him write it, and I witness'd the Account. He acknowledged 172l. 9s. 6d. After I had got this out of him, I waited on Mr. Scroop and Mr. Reynolds and it thought proper to take him before them, to get the Confession from him that they might be saved the Trouble of coming to prove the first Confession. This Confession I saw the Prisoner sign, and saw the Justices sign it too, and I witness'd it. After this was done I received from Mr. Scroop 154l. 14s. 6d. in a Bag; Mr. Scroop advised to have taken 156 l. 10s. 6d. but before they sealed up the Money, they gave the Prisoner 36 s to bear his Expences, which Sum taken out of 156 l. 10 s 6 d. makes 154 l. 14 s. 6 d. which was the Money I recieved.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sixteen.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gough. On Friday Night, May 14, a little after 12 o'Clock, I was turning up the Corner of <placeName id="t17370526-2-crimeloc11">Gloucester-street</placeName>

I recover'd my self and snatch'd Sampson's Stick out of his Hand, this is the very Stick: They did not say any thing to me, but only beat me in a very violent Manner. I have now a Wound in my Head two Inches long, and as deep as it can be without breaking the Skull. My Hand was likewise hurt, but whether that was by a Blow or by the Fall I cannot tell; I lost my Hat in the Scuffle, or else they stole it. The Prisoner Sampson confess'd the Fact, and that there was more of them in Company, but I can swear only to Sampson. I have called to him in the Gatehouse, and when he heard my Name, he said he remember'd me, and he told me there were six of them in Company, and he had impeach'd them all to Colonel

            . There were six of us together, and we all went out with the same Intent, to rob who we could. Nugent and Sampson, and Scotch Jack, and Hilliard, and Wheatly, and my self. Going up Gloucester street, by little King-street, a Coach came by, Scotch Jack was first; he knock'd the Gentleman down with a Broomstick; Sampson came up immediately and beat him about the Head with his Stick, and struck him into the Kennel; as he lay in the Kennel he cry'd Wa'a, Wa'a, for he was so abused that he could not speak plain. As he lay padling in the Kennel, a Man came up and asked what was the Matter, so I ran off a little Way, but return'd as if I wanted to see what was the Matter too. The Gentleman said he had been knock'd down and had lost his Hat; we look'd for it but 'twas not to be found. So we went home with him, and when the Maid open'd the Door, he bid her not be frighted.</p>
               <p>Sampson. Speak out George that I may hear you.</p>
               <p>Sadler. After this I went away, and met the Prisoners the same Night in Holborn -</p>
               <p>Q. Which of your Companions did you meet there?</p>
               <p>Sadler. Scotch Jack, Sampson, Hilliard and Wheatly. I asked Sampson about the Hat, and he told me he had thrown it over some Rails in Gloucester-street to prevent Discovery, and its being taken upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you apprehended for this fact?</p>
               <p>Sadler. Yes; Mr. Attley took me and Nugent out of Bed: We were both taken up the next Day, and Sampson was took up afterwards. Mr. Attley call'd me out, and asked me if I had a Mind to save my Life? I told him I could do a great deal (discover a great many) and thereupon I impeach'd this Sampson and all the rest of them. Sampson was the Man that took the Hat off, I saw him take it off, but I did not see him throw it over the Rails; may be he sold it, and only told us he threw it away to cheat us of our Shares.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gough. The Evidence swore he should know Sampson's Stick if he saw it again.</p>
               <p>Sadler. This is the very Stick that Sampson had. I cut it up as I came from Epsom.</p>
               <p>Sampson. Sadler swore before Mr. Deveil, that Nugent went Home ten Minutes before the Thing was done; he perjur'd himself before him, and now he swears the Man was in Company.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gough Sadler did say so before Mr. Deveil, but when he was put to his Oath, he swore Nugent was in Company when the Fact was done.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Gough ) Have you any Memory of Nugent's being among them?</p>
               <p>Mr. Gough. No; I have no Memory of any but Sampson.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Nugent in Company when the Attack was made?</p>
               <p>Sadler. He was one of the Company, but when the Attack was made he was about ten Doors off, and did not come up till 'twas over.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he by when you agreed to attack Mr. Gough?</p>
               <p>Sadler. No; but he was in Sight of us when we did it.</p>

            . Last Monday I was going about my lawful Occasions, and in St. Paul's Church-Yard I met Sampson with a Pair of Boots which he was going to sell; these Boots I suspected he had stole out of a Cellar in St. Giles's, belonging to Mr. Wiltshire; I look'd at the Boots and knew them to be Wiltshire's; so I seiz'd him upon this Account. He told me his Life was in my Hands, and desir'd I would not hang him; I knew him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173705260005"/> be a great Criminal, so I brought him by the Collar to Broad St. Giles's. He told me of several Robberies, and among the rest of this; he said he had robb'd a Clergyman on Friday Se'en night at Night, at the End of Gloucester-street, and says he (the Clergyman) is a very pretty Man; for after we had knock'd him down, he got my Stick and used it very well, and if the rest of my Companions had not been Rogues, we should have got a good Booty from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he name the Gentleman?</p>
               <p>Berry. No, he did not name Mr. Gough, only said it was a Clergyman, and that they knock'd him down at the End of Gloucester-street last Friday Se'en-night. I asked him if he knew the Clergyman: He said, No. I asked him if he knew what Parish he belonged to: He told me, No. Nor did he know where he liv'd: But upon his telling me 'twas done at the End of Gloucester-street, I went there, and found out Mr. Gough, who told me he had been robb'd by some Men, and that he had got one of their Sticks from them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with Sampson?</p>
               <p>Berry. I deliver'd him to this Constable, on Account of the Boots he had stole.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to tell you of the Robberies he had committed?</p>
               <p>Berry. Because he thought to make himself an Evidence, but Mr. Deveil found him a Liar, and that Sadler told more Truth than he did; so Sadler was admitted an Evidence. I can tell you a great deal more-about what he said; but may be you ha'n't Time to hear it.</p>

               <p>Sampson. Did you hear me say I took the Hat?</p>

This is the Note, sign'd Thomas Langley, I believ'd it was a good Note, so I took it, and kept it 'till it was due; then I went to the Prisoner, and told him I did not like to go about getting the Money, he must go and get the Money for me, and I let him know that I expected the Money from him. He told me that Langley was in Buckinghamshire, and another Time he was in Northamptonshire, but last he said he worked with one Mathold in Crutched Friars. I had a threatning Letter sent me the 7th of February, which I suspected to come from the Prisoner, and, upon the Receipt of that Letter, I went to enquire after this Langley in Crutched Friars, and then I found it to be a counterfeit Note; upon this I took the Prisoner up, and before the Justice I asked him where Langley was; he said he was in Bedfordshire; but I had found one of the same Name in Crutched Friars. This is a Receipt of the Prisoner's own Hand-writing, and I have compared it with the Note, and believe the same Hand wrote them both. I saw him write this whole Receipt, and upon my Oath I believe the Hands to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found out Mr. Langley, did he tell you he had had Dealings with the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Manning. Mr. Langley knew the Prisoner, and said he had no Dealings with him; he had apply'd to him to lend him Money, but he had always refused him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I came to Mr. Manning one Morning, and told him, as I ow'd him 3 l. 8 s. I would pay<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173705260007"/> him, if he would take a 5 l. Note; he accepted it, I endors'd it, and he paid me 1 l. 12 s. out of it, and I told him where the Man liv'd. I received the Note from a young Man named 
               <persName id="t17370526-8-person88">

            , who came from Northamptonshire to get Work in London, and I lent him Money till it came to 5 l. within 10 s. and then he gave me this Note, and said, if I would accept of it, he should be obliged to me; so I took it, and gave it to Mr. Manning.</p>
               <p>Q. This Story is suited to your Purpose, but can you make all this out? Why did you send Mr. Manning to one in Crutched-Fryars?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. After I had paid the Note to Mr. Manning, the young Man went down into the Country, and I went to Mr Langley's in Crutched-Fryars, and asked him to do me a Favour; I asked him if he knew Thomas Langley, his Namesake? He said, no. I told him I had a Note for five Pound upon his Name-sake, and I had paid it to Mr. Manning, and if he would be so good as to own the Note, if Manning should come to him about it, I should be obliged to him, and I would give him a Note of 10 l. - to take care of it.</p>
               <p>C. Then you own it was not Mr. Langley's Note in Crutched Fryars.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Langley. About eight Months ago the Prisoner came to me, he sent for me to an Alehouse, and asked me to do him a Favour, and talked something about a Note, but I don't remember the Particulars. I told him I would not do any such Things, - I would not be concerned in a Note; I would rather, I said, lend him the Money; and I told him, if they came to enquire after his Character, I would say he was an honest Fellow.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your Oath, what did he say to you?</p>
               <p>Mr. Langley. He did say something about a Note of 5 l. and that it would be due about Christmas. I have known him upwards of a Year, and I took him then to be an honest Fellow.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Manning) The Note was not due till the 28th of Dec. did you go and enquire about it before that Time?</p>
               <p>Manning. I received the threatening Letter in the Month of February, and I never enquired about the Note, till I came to Justice Jones about the Letter.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the Prisoner) Can you bring any one to prove there is such a Person as Langley in Bedfordshire or Northamptonshire?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mr. Langley if he did not say he would pay the Note when the Man came with it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Langley. No, I never said I would pay it; I said I would tell the Man when he came with it, that I believed the Prisoner would pay it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the Prisoner) You told Mr. Manning that it was Mr. Langley's Note in Crutched-Fryars, and now you own it belongs to another Langley: I would ask you, whether you can produce any Mortal alive, to prove you have such an Acquaintance?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Acquaintance was but slender with him; I let him have Money and Goods, and took this Note from him.</p>
               <p>Q. A slender Acquaintance, and yet you let him have 5 l. Worth of Goods! Who wrote the Directions to Mr. Langley in Crutched Fryars?</p>
               <p>Mr. Manning. I did, a great while after I had taken the Note.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Langley) When the Prisoner came to you, did he tell you any thing about this other Langley?</p>
               <p>Mr. Langley. No, I don't remember that he said any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Several Persons appeared to the Prisoner's Character, who all took him to have been an honest Man till this Time.</p>

               <p>(The Letter was compared with the Receipt, which was produced on the former Trial)</p>
               <p>Seal. I carry'd the Bundle on the Tuesday Night about 6 o'Clock to the Green-Dragon at Stepney. When I went into the House I saw the Prisoner sitting in a Box, I was surprized, and said, John how do you do? My Master had told me of the Thing, but I had no Suspicion of the Man. - John, how do you do, says I; I spoke twice to him, but he would not speak, and turn'd his Back to me: while I went to speak to the Woman in the Bar he went out of the House, and in about half a quarter of an Hour he came in again, - who calls me, says he, I told him I did, and I ask'd him what he had to do this Way; he said he had been at Work at Bow: I ask'd him where about he work'd there, then he told me, that he work'd in Whitecross-Street, and that he had left Work there at half an Hour after 4, then I ask'd him why he came this Way; and he said he was to wait for a Friend who had been with him, and was gone to Spring-Gardens at Stepney, and he sent me there to enquire for a Man, but no such Person had been there, nor did the People know any Thing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the Bundle with the Woman at the Bar before he went out?</p>
               <p>Seal Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come in again?</p>
               <p>Seal. In about a quarter of an Hour: He did not ask for any Thing to be left there. He sent me to Spring Gardens to enquire for his Friend, and when I came back, our Foreman was come in, and had got him in Custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see you leave the Parcel?</p>
               <p>Seal. No, he turn'd his Back to me when I left the Bundle: I was only to deliver it, so he did not hear me say any Thing when I left it, and his Back was turned to me when I gave it out of my Hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any Body call for the Parcel afterwards?</p>
               <p>Seal. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask him whether he left any Thing at the Bar before me?</p>
               <p>Seal. You turned your Back upon me.</p>
               <p>- Negus. I went with the Boy and the Bundle, and he went into the House about a Minute before me. When I got to the Door, I met the Prisoner coming out, I stopp'd and said, - John, what do you do here? He pull'd his Hat over his Eyes, and would neither look at me nor speak to me, but he shook, and look'd as if he was struck with Surprize, and went from the Door. The Woman of the House said, why do you come so soon? I believe that was the Man who was to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173705260009"/> call for the Bundle. While she was speaking to me he returned, and I said, - John, why don't you speak? I thought, says he, somebody call'd me; I told him he must come in, I wanted to speak with him; I hope says he, 'tis not for my Hurt. Then I ask'd him about the Letter, and he said he knew nothing of it: why did you come here to drink says I? I frequently come in here, says he, as I come from Bow: I have been at Work there, and as I came along, I call'd in here to drink. Then he told me, that he had li't of two Friends at Why not beat Dragon, and had appointed to meet them at Spring Gardens, and the Reason he did not go to them was, because he us'd to drink at this House. I sent to Spring Gardens, but no Body waited for him, or wanted him there, so I told him I would send to Bow, and enquire what Time he left Work there; upon which he said, he had not been at Work there, but in Whitecross-Street. I ask'd the Woman of the House, if the Prisoner used to drink there, she said, she could not remember every Body that drank there; but as for him, (the Prisoner) she could not recollect that ever she had seen him in her Life.</p>

            . I live at the Sign of the Ship at Stepney, just facing the Green-Dragon. About a quarter of an Hour before the Prisoner was taken he came into our House, and drank a Pint of Beer; he asked what 'twas o'Clock, and I told him 'twas almost 6: I saw him presently afterwards at the Green-Dragon.</p>
               <p>- Phipps. On the 8th of Feb. last, about a quarter after 6, the Prisoner came into our House (the Green Dragon) and call'd for a Pint of Two-penny; he had not been in long, before Mr. Manning's Boy came with the Bundle; he had not been in the House 2 Minutes before the Boy came. I never saw him to my Knowledge in the House before.</p>
               <p>- Gregory. I went over the Fields with the Boy to Stepney, because we expected the Parcel would be taken from him before he got to the House; I made the Boy stay a little, that I might go in first. I sat down facing the Bar, and when the Boy came in, the Prisoner look'd pale, and seem'd to be in a Confusion. What! John!

             ! says the Boy. He was so confounded that he could not speak, but paid his Reckoning and went out of the House, but he returned in about half a quarter of an Hour, and Mr. Negus laid hold of him, and told him he wanted to speak with him: he asked him if it was for his Good, or for his Hurt? Mr. Negus told him, 'twas not much for his Good, and asked him how he came there? He said he had been at Work at Bow, that he usually call'd in there to drink as he came along; but the People of the House said, they never saw him before to their Knowledge. Mr.Negus told the Prisoner he would send to Bow; then he alter'd his Story, and said he had drank with some Friends at Why not beat Dragon, and was by Appointment to meet them at Spring-Gardens.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Phipps) Did any Body ever come to enquire for this Parcel?</p>
               <p>Phipps. No.</p>
               <p>- Potts I was present at the Green-Dragon when Negus laid hold of the Prisoner. He at first said he had been at Work at Bow, and that he call'd in there for a Pint of Beer, as he usually did; but when Negus said he would send to Bow, he told him he need not give himself that Trouble, for he had been at Work in Whitecross-Street, and work'd there 'till 5 o'Clock that Night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I work'd in Whitecross-Street, but I had been doing a Job for my Mother at Bow that Night; as I came from thence I met some Friends, and I asked them to drink, so we staid together 'till 'twas almost dark, and then I had a Thought came into my Head, that I would go Home to my Lodging just cross the Fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the Prisoner live?</p>
               <p>Seal. In Denmark Street, the other Side of the Fields.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Man that keeps the Ship Alehouse, had once a Note of my Mother's for 4 l. odd Money, which I had endorsed; he arrested me for the Money, but I put in Bail, for I was under Age when I endorsed the Note, so we made that Matter up for 25 s. I went to this House to see the Man, his Name is Townshend, but as I was in Debt, I was afraid the Woman of the House (who knew me) would give Intelligence of me, so I went over the Way to the Green-Dragon, and I had not been there a quarter of an Hour before Mr. Manning's Boy came in and spoke to me; I asked him how he did; but knowing that I ow'd Mr. Manning Money upon this Note, I was afraid he might have Bailiffs with him, so I paid my Reckoning, and went out of the House; as I was going out I met Negus, which made me more apprehensive of being arrested than I was before, but looking about me, and seeing no Body else after him, I returned and went into the House again, and Negus told me of the threatning Letter, and I said I knew nothing of the Matter. <rs id="t17370526-8-verdict47" type="verdictDescription">

On the 27th of August I lost 6 Pair of Kid Gloves, 6 Pair of Worsted Stockings, and a new Silk-Handkerchief No one could take them but her self, for there was no Body in the House but her self and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not prosecute her sooner?</p>
               <p>Lambert Because she kept out of the Way. She came in that Night fuddl'd; I told her she should stay no longer than Morning, and I thought she went to Bed, but she took the Things and went away between 12 and 1, and took the Key of the Street Door away with her: the Till was broke open, and 12 s. and 6 d. was taken out; there was no Body in the House but she and I</p>
               <p>Q. Did you owe her any Wages?</p>
               <p>Lambert. She had her Wages before Hand: She had a Guinea of me, which was more than her Wages came to.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any Recommendation of the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Lambert. Only from a Nurse that look'd after a Child of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire for her, after this 27th of August?</p>
               <p>Lambert. After she was gone, I spent much Time in enquiring after her.</p>
               <p>C. Why, you have indicted her for breaking open your House.</p>
               <p>Lambert. She took away the Key of the Door, she lock'd me in, and her self out. - I was forc'd to have the Lock broke in the Morning.</p>
               <p>C. Was there not a Suit commenced against you for her Wages, after she went away?</p>
               <p>Lambert. Yes; I was serv'd with a Copy of a Writ from the Court of Common-Pleas She dropp'd it one Term, and next Term they brought another. I employ'd a Man to defend me, and he took my Money, but did not defend me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not after you had been serv'd with this Action that you indict'd her?</p>
               <p>Lambert. I told her, before the Action was brought, that if she did not make Satisfaction for the Things taken away from me, I would have her before a Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Lambert. Soon after she went away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said you could not find her.</p>
               <p>Lambert. I never saw her but once, and then I had no Warrant; so I thought I had no Power to apprehend her.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, here was an Attorney prosecuting a Suit for her, how came it that you did not apply to him, to know where his Client was?</p>
               <p>Lambert. I did enquire of the Attorney, and he said, 'twas no Matter where she was, and they hid her from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not this Woman give Evidence on your Behalf in a Cause which was depending in the Court of Exchequer.</p>
               <p>Lambert No; not in the Court of Exchequer. I never had any Prosecution with Regard to my Business, in the Court of Exchequer. I had an I format on against me 4 Years ago at the Excise-Office, and none since. She gave no Evidence for me.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether you have not apply'd a second Time to her to give Evidence?</p>
               <p>Lambert. Not on any such Account. She was with me at the other End of the Town - not at the Exchequer. It was on Account of a Dozen of Candles which a Man had of me, and 'twas a Twelvemonth before he offer'd to pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, if you have not apply'd to her as an Evidence?</p>
               <p>Lambert. No other - than in speaking the Truth. She carry'd the Candles.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Lambert I am not sure whether 'twas in June or July. I am sure it was not since she went away. When I desired her to give Evidence I did not threaten her, I only desired her to speak the Truth.</p>
               <p>A Woman. I know nothing of her robbing him; only one Morning he asked me if I had seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173705260011"/> his Servant? and he asked me if she had brought any Thing to me? I told him, she never brought any Thing to me in her Life.</p>
               <p>Another. I know nothing of the Robbery; - she has been a little given to Drinking, and has us'd him ill; they used to quarrel.</p>
               <p>Defence. He had been up the Night before making Candles, and I thought he would not rise the next Day till late, so I having a little Business to do abroad, of my own, I opened the Shop about 7 o'Clock in the Morning, and clean'd it out; then I lock'd the Street Door, and took the Key with me. I spoke to a Neighbour, and desired her to give an Eye to the House, telling her I expected no body but the Exciseman. I staid longer than I expected, before I could speak with the Person I wanted, and was afraid he would abuse me, as he often has done, when I went home. However, in the Evening I went home, and begged ten thousand Pardons for staying and carrying the Key with me, tho' twas a Door that opens in Half, and I knew he could open it. He call'd me drunken Bitch, and said I should come in no more.</p>
               <p>A Witness. I took the Prisoner Apprentice in 1704 She liv'd with me ten Years as a covenant Servant, and since that she marry'd our Gardiner, and has buried our Family; latterly she has been a little given to Drinking. She is as honest a Woman, and as clean a clever Creature as lives.</p>
               <p>Another. Since the 27th of August I know she has been at Capt Wills's at Ratcliff Cross</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wills. I know the Prisoner to be an honest Woman; I have known her 12 Years When she came from Lambert's she went to a Lodging in Brick-street; since that, she liv'd with me, and was taken out of my House in January last. She had been then with me a Fortnight, and was every Day up and down: I trusted her with every Thing in the House.</p>
               <p>A Woman. I have known her a Twelvemonth. She nursed me in my Lying in, and I trusted her with all the Keys of my Shop, and found her very honest. When she came from Lambert's she came to me, and was with me five Weeks, and I sent her out on Errands every Day. She was openly every Day in my Shop. From my House she went to Madam Wills -</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wills. And she was with me till January last.</p>
               <p>Another Witness. The Prisoner is a very just honest Woman, and never was hid from him, but was up and down in the Streets to get her Bread. Lambert came once or twice to my House in Brick-street to ask for her, and she was never hid from him; tho' when he came to my House, she was out at Work; yet she went by his Door every Day; and as for this Felony, I never heard a Word of latterly.</p>


               <p>Lambert. I did seek after her, and spent Time and Money, but I could not find her. I have the Warrant in my Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it dated?</p>
               <p>Lambert. It was last Sessions.</p>
               <p>A Witness. She was with me some Time, and Lambert has gone by divers Times when she was sitting at my Door with her Knitting. He has gone by divers Times on the other Side of the Way.</p>
               <p>A Man. Mr. Lambert was serv'd with a Copy of a Writ, at

            's Suit; the particular Time I cannot recollect, but 'twas about 8 or 9 Months ago, and he employ'd one king to defend him. This was about her Wages, and he told me he would give her a Guinea to make up the Matter. I went to her and offer'd her that, but she refused to make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. At that Time when he offer'd the Guinea, did he charge her with Felony?</p>
               <p>The Witness. He said she had wronged him of many Things, but he did not say she had broke his House: He only said he had lost several Things, and he believ'd she had taken them. He told me where she liv'd (in Brick street) and I went to her Lodging; I did not see her then, but she came a Day or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>C The Prosecutor is falsify'd in many Instances by every one of these People. In order to convict this Woman of Burglary, and to take away her Life, he has forsworn himself. The Reason why he did not prosecute her before, he says, was because she absconded.</p>

They came up to me with Pistols, which they clapp'd to my right and left Breast, and cry'd, d - n you, - your Money, Sir, you appear like a Gentleman, and we'll use you as such. I told them I had but little Money, - what I had they were welcome to They bid me not make a Noise, for if I did they must shoot me; so one of them put his Hand into my Pocket where the Guinea was, and I told them I would give them the Money The Prisoner took my Handkerchief, and put it into his Pocket, but he took it out again and said, Sir, your Handkerchief is of little Worth, so he returned it me again. After this the Prisoner took out my Deputation (I belong to the Custom-House) and he said, I believe, Sir, these are Writings? I told them it would be of no Use to them, so they said they would not meddle with Notes or Writings. After this they felt in my Pockets again, and took the Ring with the Blue Stone: The Prisoner felt in my Fob, and took out two Notes, which he returned me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know the Prisoner again?</p>
               <p>Bassendine. I was very near Johnson's Globe Lamps, about six Doors from the Bagnio, and tho' the Prisoner had a flapp'd Hat, yet the Brims were narrow, and as he stood fronting the Lamps, I saw his Face. They detained me five or six Minutes, and after they had rifled me, I said, Gentlemen, I beg the Favour of you to give me a Penny or Two-pence to cross the Water, and the Prisoner said to his Companions, - give the Gentleman a Couple of Pence, another of them said, - give the Gentleman Six-pence. I said, Gentleman, I am obliged to you, for it is late, and the Watermen generally insist one something extraordinary when it is late; but another of them asked, whether it would bear? I told them it would certainly bear Six-pence, for, says I, you have taken something very considerable from me, so they gave me Six-pence, and this is the very Piece of Money which they returned me. When we parted they charged me not to make any Noise, for if I did they would shoot me. Some Time after this I was sitting at a Barber's in Lemon street, to be shaved, and I saw them go by; I was so surpriz'd, that the Barber took Notice of it, and asked me what was the Matter? I told him those 3 Fellows were the Men who had robb'd me. Upon that he went out 2 or 3 Doors after them, but I bid him not trouble himself about them; then says he, if you won't trouble your self about them, you deserve to be robb'd again; so the Barber went after them to a Sheeps Head Shop, and when I heard they were there, I went to ask for some Dog's Meat, that I might have an Opportunity of seeing them. They were at Dinner there, and I saw them; so I went to Justice Farmer for a Warrant, and when I came back they were gone; but we found them in the Glass-house Yard, on a vacant Place, among fourteen or fifteen Fellows, who were all playing their Rogues Tricks. When I seiz'd the Prisoner, I could not be positive to the other two, so I charged a Constable with him only.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says my Hat had narrow Brims, - let him go up to Newgate, my Hat is in pawn there for Three Half-pence; - there's not a broader brimm'd Hat in the whole Court than mine is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any People of the House here, where they din'd?</p>
               <p>Bassendine. No, they are People of ill Characters in the Neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>The Constable. Mr. Bassendine came to my House and shewed me his Deputation, and ordered me in the King's Name to go with him and assist him. We went to Dallow's Glass-house, and there we found about a Dozen or Fourteen Slender Carcass'd Gentlemen, and he went up to the Prisoner, who was among them, and said, he was the Person who held a Pistol to his Breast; so we carried him before Justice Farmer, and he sent him to Prison. The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, but I have since heard that he has but a very Slender Character.</p>
               <p>A Witness. I was at Mr. Winstone's, at Well-Close Square, and the Prosecutor came in, and asked Mr. Warrener, Justice Farmer's Clerk for a Warrant; he said he had seen three Men who had robb'd him; we asked him why he had not secured them; he said he could not secure them without Assistance; so Mr. Warriner sent for an Officer, but he not being at Home, he directed us to this Constable's House, and we went to the Dunghill or Glass-house, where the Prosecutor fixed upon the Prisoner directly out of 14 or 15 Men.</p>
               <p>A Witness. I have known the Prosecutor many Years; he is a Person of a good Character.</p>
               <p>Another. I have known him 16 Years; he's a Person of a good Character as far as I can hear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have worked with a great many Gentlemen of Credit, in the Summer-Time, among the rest, with Dr. Edgerton, and in the Winter, I follow Coal-heaving: I was coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173705260013"/> (when I was taken) to Goodman's-Fields, to get a little Victuals; when the Prosecutor came into the Cook's Shop where I was eating, the People laugh'd at him, and I laughed at him too; so he went away, and when I had din'd I went up the Minories, - towards East Smithfield, and seeing some People upon the vacant Place, where the Glass House was, I stopp'd, and the Gentleman seiz'd me for the Robbery. If I had sent to the Lord Leicester or Dr. Edgerton. I could have had some Witnesses to my Character, but I have not, because I have no Money.</p>
               <p>C. But a Letter would have gone by the Post without Money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. But I can't wait, nor have I any body to write for me; and being innocent of the Fact, I thought I should have no Occasion.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Before we carry'd him to Mr. Farmer we waited two Hours, for some body to speak for him, but he could get no body; and when he came before Justice Farmer, the Justice cry'd, - What! are you come already!</p>

            . On the 3d of Sept 1733, I went to the King's-Arms at Fulham to the Nutting Feast, (as 'tis call'd or nominated) with some other People in Company, and there I staid till 6 of the Clock or better, then I came home by my self. When I came to the last House in Chelsea Road, call'd the World's End, I went in there and call'd for a Pint of Beer; while I was drinking, a Journeyman Baker came in, and drank with me, and we both came out of the House together. As we were going up the <placeName id="t17370526-20-crimeloc99">King's Road</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was it dark when you went into the King's Head?</p>
               <p>Crew. There was a Candle brought into the Room, when we first went in. - From hence we proceeded to the narrow Passage that leads to the open Fields, next London, - they call them the five Fields; when we came there the Baker<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173705260014"/> bid us good Night, and went back again; so the Prisoner and I went on by our selves, and after we had passed over one Field, we met the Patrole of Chelsea-College Pensioners, with their Arms. One of the old Men begg'd of us to give him a Dram, and told us, there was a Man in the Ditch who could let us have a Dram of any Thing: I treated them with a Dram, and after they had drank it, one of them took up the Candle and Lanthorn of the Man that sold the Liquor, and held it up to both our Faces; he look'd in our Faces, and we look'd in his. Then we went on to the Duke of Buckingham's Pallisades, and there he told me 'twas too late to go over the Park, but I might go by <placeName id="t17370526-20-crimeloc100">Hyde Park Corner</placeName>

                        targets="t17370526-20-off97 t17370526-20-crimeloc100"/>; I agreed, and as we were going along, he took hold of a Stick which I had in my Hand, (but not in a violent Manner) and I let him take it; so we walked a little farther together, - I was on his Right Hand next the Wall, and all on a sudden he put me on the Left Hand next the Ditch, and we walked 10 or 12 Yards farther, then he turn'd about and said, Sir, I must have what you have got about you, and he rushed both his Hands so violently into my Waistcoat Pockets, that he tore this Flap almost down to the bottom. He took my Handkerchief and some Half-pence; then he rifled my Breeches, and took out 2 crooked Sixpences and some Half-pence; about 19 or 20 d in all. While he was rifling me, I said, Friend, do you know what you are doing? D - n you, says he, don't speak so loud, and out he pull'd a Pistol, and clapp'd it to my Breast: Then he took my Hat, and gave me his in Exchange, and then he left me as fast as he could: I suppose he perceived 2 or 3 Men coming up, or else he would have taken my Coat; for when the Men came up they told me they met a Man, running as if the Devil was in him.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the Names of these Men? Are they to be produced?</p>
               <p>Crew. I don't know any Thing of them. On the Wednesday after I was robb'd, I went to the Baker, and he, (after some Talk) told me he was inform'd the Man that robb'd me liv'd somewhere about Turnham Green, and that his Wife keeps a Chandler's Shop, and that he was a Yorkshire Man. I went to enquire after him, but finding no such Person, I left a Direction in Writing with the Baker, where he might find me, if he should hear any Thing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that Baker here?</p>
               <p>Crew No, he's gone to the East-Indies; but before he went, ('twas in November 1734) I saw the Baker in the Street, and he told me he had seen the Man that robb'd me, leaning over a Hatch at Putney. and that he was informed he liv'd at the House where he saw him. Upon this Information I went to the House, but could not find him, so I left a Warrant at Putney to seize him when he should appear, but he was not taken 'till the Night we had the Storm of Thunder and Lightning, - the 16th of this Instant.</p>
               <p>Q. What House does he keep at Putney?</p>
               <p>Crew 'Tis a little private House; I believe his Mother is the House-keeper. When he was taken up, I was sent for, and I knew him again, and that's the Man upon my Oath.</p>
               <p>Q. The Baker gave you this Information in 1734, how came you not to take him in all this while?</p>
               <p>Crew. He was not to be seen by any Body.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How long was I in Company with you from first to last?</p>
               <p>Crew About an Hour and a half.</p>
               <p>C. I believe you may be right in that, for you have been an Hour in telling the Story.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he was not in Liquor when this happened?</p>
               <p>Crew. No, I remember'd every Penny I spent, and where I spent it. Let me see, - three half Crowns when I went out. Spent at Fulham 4 s. - In the Morning 8 d. - King's Head, 6 d. - World's-End, 3 d - Drams in the Ditch, 1 d Halfpenny, and some Money I lent my Companions, I can't justly tell what.</p>

               <p>Mr. Uthar. I spent two or three Weeks enquiring after the Prisoner Dunnick, and in the Course of my Enquiry, I found that Smith and his Wife had pawned some of the Pieces so they were committed on Suspicion. The Woman is Dunnick's own Sister; he liv'd with them at that Time, and she conceal'd him. Some of the Silver they had pawn'd to Mrs. Gordon, and some to Mr. Wild, who are both in Court. These are the Piece.s</p>
               <p>Mr. Wild. I live in White-Cross Street: Elizabeth Smith brought two of the Pieces to me, and borrow'd six Shillings upon them the 29th of March. Afterwards on the 31st, she and

Smith and his Wife both deny'd that they ever had any Pieces of Eight; and his Wife knew that I was in Pursuit of Dunnick, yet she told me that she harbour'd him and concealed him. Her Husband sent me a Message, that he desired me to give him a Meeting on the 31st of March, and I reproached him with concealing his Brother; this was the very Day upon which he pawn'd some of the Pieces to Mrs. Gordon Mrs. Smith owned she had the Pieces from her Sister Dunnick.</p>

I went with them, and when I got into the House I gave them a Shilling to get a full Pot of Flip: While we were drinking the Flip Wilson got her Hands about my Waist, under my Cloaths, and drew my Watch out of my Fob. I seized her Hand with the Watch in it; she dropp'd it down, and I took it up again and put it into my Waistcoat Pocket, and told them, I would stay no longer with them, because I saw they had a Mind to defraud me of my Watch. Wilson rapp'd out an Oath, and assur'd me, she scorn'd to use any Gentleman so ill; so I staid a quarter of an Hour longer, and she got about me again, and took the Watch out of my Pocket and gave it the little one (Solomon) who stood behind Wilson and me. 'Tis true, I did not see her, but I felt her, and my Watch could go no other Way; beside, I saw her push her Hand by my Side, towards Solomon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and Wilson sit together?</p>
               <p>Glasspool. We were upon the Bed together. - She and I were upon the Bed's-Feet. She threw her self upon the Bed's-Feet, and swore I should - have to do with her, and so she pull'd me upon the Bed to her, and as we lay together I felt her take the Watch, and saw her push her Hand by my Side, towards Solomon, who stood behind us at the Feet of the Bed. I would have got up immediately, but she had got her Arms about me, and held me fast, that I might not pursue Solomon. However, I made shift to slip out of her Arms, and I ran after Solomon; I saw her go into the next House, and a Jew being at the Door, I said, Sir, I have lost my Watch, and the Woman that has got it, is come into this House; and tho'I saw her go into the House with my own Eyes, yet the Jew would face me down, that no body was come in there.</p>
               <p>Wilson. When you found the Watch drawing out of your Pocket, pray why did not you lay hold of it?</p>
               <p>Glasspool. 'Twas done so suddenly, that I had not Time. - I stood at the Jew's Door a quarter of an Hour, and then she came out and run into another House; and while I was waiting at this Door, Wilson came out with her Petticoats over her Head, and went into the House where Solomon now was. I got into this House, and here they offer'd to be searched.</p>

            . Glasspool was at my House that Night about Ten o'Clock, and he had his Watch when he went away. The little Girl has got a Husband, one Solomon (a Jew) and he came to me and said, if the Man would not prosecute, he should have his Watch again.</p>
               <p>Wilson. The Man told me when he and we were together, that he had been in Company with some Women, and had lost his Watch. He wanted me to be concerned with him in a very sad, ugly Thing which I am ashamed to speak of, and because I would not consent, he said he would swear it upon me. He was very troublesome in our Court, and call'd Watch, Watch, and I got a Watchman and a Constable to get him home.</p>

I charg'd a Constable with her, and she charg'd the Constable with me; we were both carry'd to the Watch-house that Night, and the next Morning she was committed to Newgate; then she said, she wish'd it had been 2 Guineas instead of 2 Shillings.</p>

            . I know the Prisoner was marry'd to Steel, I was present when that Affair was transacted. They were marry'd at a Brandy-shop at the Fleet, the Ceremony was perform'd by a Man in a Night Gown; whether he was a Parson or not, I can't tell. He pull'd a Book out of his Pocket, and read a little Bit of it to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the most material Parts of the Office read?</p>
               <p>Crossby. No, not all the Particulars of it; but he read some of it, and then told them they were marry'd. I am sure he did not read half so much as was read to me at Pancras when I was marry'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a Ring?</p>
               <p>Crossby. Yes, there was a Ring, but I don't know whether the Words, - I take you to be my Wife, and I take you to be my Husband, were said. In 2 or 3 Days after the Wedding, she went down to see her Friends in Cumberland, and there she was deliver'd of a Child, and left it there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay in Cumberland?</p>
               <p>Crossby. She went down 2 or 3 Days after the Wedding, which was in March, and she sta'd 'till November. After she came from Cumberland they liv'd together as Man and Wife 'till last June. They lodg'd in my House, and he acknowledged her publickly for his Wife, and she own'd him as her Husband; they both went by the same Name.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to part?</p>
               <p>Crossby. Why, after he had marry'd her, he found she was with Child, so that occasion'd the first Breach, and was the Reason of her going to Cumberland immediately after the Wedding. When he found how it was, he call'd me up into the Room, and told me of it; she was crying in Bed, and asking his Pardon; she told him if he would forgive her, she would be one of the best of Wives.</p>
               <p>Q. After this did he leave her?</p>
               <p>Crossby. No, she left him; she took away what Effects of his she could get, and took Passage with some Men for New England, but he found her out, and one of the Men was try'd here last July Sessions.*</p>

So I met her one Day, when I was a little out of the way, a little in Liquor, and they got me to an Alehouse, but whether I was marry'd or no I cannot tell; indeed she told me we were marry'd, and we liv'd together afterwards. I did go with my first Wife to be marry'd, but what Sort of a Marriage it was, God knows; she left me and went away with other Men the 26th of June last.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know the Mug the Prisoner drank out of from the other?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. The Prisoner drank out of an upright Mug, the other was a belly'd one. As soon as the Prisoner was gone, a Man came in for a Pint of Beer, and I then miss'd it. I found the Prisoner on the 3d of March, and took him up on Suspicion, and carry'd him before Justice Margett's, who discharged him, because I could not swear he stole it. As we were coming from the Justice's, I said, now you are discharged you may tell me where the Mug is; well then (says he) come along with me; so he carry'd me to Degan's a Pawnbroker, where he had pawn'd it for 45 s. and there I paid 48 s. 4 d. The Prisoner asked for the Mug, and 't was produced directly; here it is - the very same that I lost, and found again at Dogan's.</p>

               <p>Stevenson. I drew him the Beer my self in this upright Mug.</p>

               <p>John Ayres. Killcup was convicted last sessions for stealing this Lead; he inform'd me where it was sold, and went with me to Birch's House, and ask'd for it, Birch's Wife at first deny'd it, and told me her Husband should come to me about it In the Afternoon; but instead of coming himself, his Apprentice and a Woman came and perswaded me not to give him Trouble. When he was taken up, he confessed he bought it, and told me 'twas his Method, when he bought such Things, to cut them to Pieces and carry them away; then he inform'd me where he had sold this, and beg'd I would not prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give for it?</p>
               <p>Ayres. A Penny a Pound.</p>
               <p>Juryman. That's pretty near the Market Price.</p>
               <p>Ayres. He begg'd I would not prosecute him, and said, he had but just got out of such another troublesome Affair.</p>
               <p>Spencer Burges. When the Prisoner was taken up, he own'd he had bought the Lead, and said, he was sorry he had done such a Thing, and begg'd he might not be prosecuted, and he told us further, that whenever he bought any Thing in this Way, he always got rid of it as soon as he could.</p>

               <p>It appeared that there was a Dispute between the Prisoner and his Wife, about keeping their Child, that she went away from their Lodging and left the Child for her Husband; he took it in his Arms, and went out to look for his Wife, but being very drunk, the Boys in the Street follow'd him, and teiz'd him; one of whom giving him a Blow on the Legs, he let the Child fall to, or put it down on the Ground (for in this Circumstance the Witnesses differ'd) that he might run after the Boy that had struck him. The Child was taken up, and carry'd into a House, but it dy'd some Hours after.</p>
