               <p>Q. Did he say he bought the lead?</p>
               <p>Moore. No, he did not; he said two men were concerned in taking the lead; they were taken up; then he said they had no concern in it, and they were discharged.</p>

I had, by a woman that was with her when she was taken up; after she was gone, I missed about 17 or 18 l. but I swear to about half that sum; the morning she went away she came down, and while I was busy, she stood loitering; I said, she might find something to do; she grumbled, and still did nothing; my wife being ill, I desired her if she could, to get up and help; she came down, then the prisoner went away while I was in the cellar; after that, a neighbour came, and wanted change for a guinea; I sent my wife to get half a guinea out of the bag; she came and said, there is but one half guinea, and 10 or 12 s. in it; then we suspected the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the bag kept?</p>
               <p>Roberts. It was kept in the bureau locked up, that is in the back parlour below; we in general take the bag up stairs when we go to bed, but we did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176707150004"/> that night; the money was missing in the morning; to the best of my knowledge we left it locked over night; we were suspicious of the prisoner; we searched about, and found her at the Stationer's Arms in St. John's street; I begged of her to give me an account of my money, and said I would be as favourable as I could, having money to pay the Saturday morning; there was an old woman with her; she and the prisoner called me all the rogues in the world; we took her in custody; the constable took her into another room, after that I was called in; then the prisoner confessed to me, she had taken two guineas and a half in gold, and a handful of silver; we took her before the Justice; there she confessed she took the money in the afternoon, when my wife went out; we found upon her a little brass thing, which I can swear to, which was in a pigeon hole by the money.</p>

            . I am constable for the upper liberty of St. John's-street. I was sent for on the 13th of June to the Stationers Arms; the prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoner, for robbing him; she had this bundle with her, (producing a pair of men's black stockings, a pair of women's purple ditto, some handkerchiefs, some silk, some cotton, and a silk hat;) there was an old woman with her; the prisoner said, she had robbed her master of two guineas and a half in gold, and a handful of silver, about 20 s. with which she had bought these things; I summed up the money she said each cost, and found they did not amount to the money; I asked her what was become of the rest of it; then she took out of her pocket a pair of gold ear-rings, a pair of new brass nut-crackers, half a guinea, and two six-pences, (one of them was copper ) which all together made up about three guineas and a half, within a trifle; she always denied taking any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body promise her favour if she would confess?</p>
               <p>Sheldon. I heard the prosecutor many times promise her to be as favourable as he could.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Roberts. I am wife to the prosecutor; I cannot particularly say what money there was in the bag, there was a good deal of silver and gold together; after the prisoner was gone, my husband sent me to the bag to fetch half a guinea, then I missed the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or your husband promise her any favour if she would confess?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Roberts. My husband promised her, if she would return him five or six guineas, he would forgive her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>My master said he would let me go, if I would own I took some; so I thought I had better wrong my conscience than to be confined; my mother had the money by her with which I bought the things, she gave it me.</p>

Between seven and eight o'clock on Friday morning the 26th of June, the two prisoners came into our shop as we were going to hang out the shop. I was in the back parlour; they came under the pretence of buying garters; there was a little girl in the shop, about fourteen years and a half old, she told them we did not sell garters: Bagnell took up some ribbon, and gave it to Fisher, and said, brush it; they went off, but never ran till they had turned the corner; Fisher dropped one piece of ribbon in the shop, but took another away; I saw Fisher give the piece to Bagnell at the corner of the street.</p>

               <p>Is there any farther accusation laid to my charge, if there is, I will answer them all together. I had been as far as Billingsgate; coming back again, I I saw a small bag lying; I crossed over the way, and took it up, there was some dirt on it; I flung it on my back. Is there are any farther charge? (I would not affront the court, but as an Englishman I would plead my own cause.) As I was walking along, (it was a very fine morning) I was in the middle of the road, thinking no harm, something ran into my hand; I found it was a sort of a butcher's hook; I took and put it in my pocket; coming along at the end of Camomile-street, there came three watchmen; one of them said, what have you got there; said I, I cannot tell hardly; said he, then I'll see what it is, let me look at it directly; they collared me; one pushed me one way, another another, and as they were pushing me this hook dropped; they used some vulgar words, which I am not used to, and took me to the watch-house; there were several people in the watch-house, drinking strong beer; they discharged them; there the watchmen said they saw something drop; then another of them said, there is another butcher's hook. I said, gentlemen, I am quite unacquainted in your affairs, I will not give you any answer until I come before a superior court; they carried me before the Right Hon. the Lord-Mayor; I asked him whether I might speak, and like a wise magistrate, he said, speak what you have to say; I told him how I came by it; he said, good man, or honest man, (I will not be sure which) that will be of service to you when you come to the Old-Bailey; accordingly I made a reverential bow to him. Now, my Lord, I hope it will be no affront to the court, only just to speak a word or two, by your Lordship's good leave -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176707150008"/> A proper Englishman cannot be convicted, unless there are two sufficient witnesses to affect him; there is none, you see by your wise enquiry, can say I am guilty of the affair I stand accused of at this bar; I did wish I might fall under a wise and prudent judge, and a good, judicious, tender, conscientious and righteous jury, for I am really innocent of the thing; but I will take care never more to offend my King, my God, or my country; I am a silk-weaver, and live at the upper end of Whitecross-street. I never was in such an unfortunate place as this in my life before.</p>

I brought her to the watch-house; I went and knocked at Mr. Spink's door, and Mrs. Spink came and owned the pot.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were the greatest quantity, in the coal-shed or under the bed?</p>
               <p>Roworth. I believe the greatest quantity was under the bed; I charged the prisoner with taking them, and asked her if she had any body concerned with her; she said, no, but would not say any thing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body else live in your house?</p>
               <p>Roworth. Yes, there is Mr. Stark, a hair-merchant in Bartholomew-close, has a lodging there, but neither he nor any of his family were in the house at that time. I took the prisoner before Justice Girdler; he asked her where she had the things; she made no answer a good while, but at last she said she bought the shoes in Coleman-street; two of the shoes have the maker's name on them that works for me, he lives in Newgate-street; as to the other things she could give no account at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you?</p>
               <p>Roworth. She had lived with me two months that day; the pair of shoes that are not marked, I know well to be my property.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor; I missed a pair of silk shoes; I went up with intent to search the prisoner's clothes, and found several trifling things of mine not worth mentioning; in searching the bed I found between the bed and the sacking some ribbon, some lace and stockings, a good many of them were in the prisoner's pocket which lay there. When Mr. Roworth came home, I told him of it, and shewed him them. I said after that, she might get out backwards; he went to see, and came back, and said he had found a bundle in the coal-hole; I said to the prisoner, Kitty, you are a sad girl, what you have done will transport you; she made me no answer, nor owned to any thing. I had a good character with her, but I had given her warning above a month, and she was to have left me as last night; these things were found but last Monday. She had no box to lock any thing up in at my house</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you gave her warning?</p>
               <p>M. Roworth. I had a young child, and she did not like nursing.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. There was wrote upon the glass with a diamond, Peerless-Pool, pray stop the bearer (some pieces of glass produced) we imagine these to be part of it cut to pieces, to take them words out.</p>
               <p>Croker. When I first took the prisoner he said, what have I done? I said, Joe, you know what you have done; he said, well, I know what I am guilty of. The next day I showed these things to Swindal; he swore to them directly as his master's property (produced in court, all but the glass, and deposed to).</p>

            . I am a goldsmith in Leicester-fields; the prisoner Cox, with another boy a little bigger than Dawson, came to my shop, and brought this ring; I happened not to be at home; this was about three weeks ago; they said they found it; my man said they ought to be charged with a constable; this he told me; he said they must leave the ring till his master comes home, and they to come again in the morning. In the morning Cox and another boy came; I asked them how they came by it; they said they found it in Lombard-street, or some such name; I said, I am fearful you are bad boys, I have a good mind to send for a constable; one said, he picked it up, and the other that he saw him; I said, I should keep the ring till they bring somebody to testify for them. I think Cox said, he worked for somebody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176707150013"/> in Bedford-row; the boy came again on the Thursday in the afternoon, and wanted the ring; I said, I will not part from it, without you bring your master; on the next morning there came a man from Sir John Fielding with the prosecutrix, and asked me about it ( the ring produced in court, and deposed to).</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lie in the house last?</p>
               <p>Baikie. I had not laid in it since last summer; I was there the evening of the 30th of June; on the first of July this card was brought to me (producing one) by which I was directed to come to Sir John Fielding at eleven o'clock; I did not know then that I had left my pocket-book there, the card I had left in it; I went there; I found a small looking-glass with a wooden frame, a pillow-case taken off of a pillow that I had laid on the bed, two napkins, two pair of scissars, and a pocket book, all my property, which were in that house over night; there was a china half pint bason, but as there are others of the same pattern, I do not swear to that; I lost such a one; then I went to the house, and missed the things mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the house broke?</p>
               <p>Balkie. There was no place broke; the house had been new paper'd, and I left the window open, and the door not locked. I know nothing of the prisoners.</p>

            . On Tuesday fortnight I was out at night, and I light of Jones in Bow-street, Covent-garden, the other was with him; they asked me where I was going.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them before?</p>
               <p>Crofts. I did; they said they were going up into the fields to sleep among the hay, and asked me to go with them. When we got into the fields, Jones slept over the pales into this gentleman's garden, and said he knew of some cucumbers there; then Donnelly went over after him, and I followed Jones; finding no cucumbers, he went and lifted up the latch, and went into the summer-house; he slept up upon two chairs, and took a silver spoon out of the corner-cupboard, and a pocket-book; then we took two napkins, and a pillow-case, from off a pillow, two pair of scissars, five china cups and saucers, a half-pint china bason, and a looking-glass in a brown frame. Jones gave me the five china cups and saucers, and I was stopt on the top of Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take these things from?</p>
               <p>Crofts. From the summer-house.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. That is what I call a house; it is a little room where we drink a glass of wine, and sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wright. Did you see Crofts when you stopt the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, he ran away, and threw down the cups and saucers, and broke them; and afterwards he came to us, and the prisoners said they knew nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Jones. It is a designed thing, with intent to take away our lives.</p>
               <p>Q. to Crofts. Do you know me?</p>
               <p>Crofts. I have known Jones half a year, he is a breechees maker; I have drank with him several times on evenings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Crofts. Somewhere by Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. from Donnelly. How long have you known me?</p>
               <p>Crofts. I have known Donnelly about three quarters of a year; I have drank with him many a time; I never knew him to be guilty of any such thing in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you persuade them to do this?</p>
               <p>Crofts. No.</p>
               <p>Donnelly's defence.</p>
               <p>I had been a hay-making, I met a man with some things in his hand; he said, he and his wife had quarrelled, and he would not live with her any longer; he asked me if I would buy the things; I gave him ten shillings for them; we met the evidence; he asked us which way we were going; I said we were going towards London; he asked to what part, I said towards Tooley-street; he brought us down to the Devil's-gap, and while we were talking they stopt us; they never meddled with him, but let him go; and then two days after he came and made himself an evidence against us, for a thing we know nothing of.</p>
               <p>Wright. We had an evidence with us handcuffed, watching for other persons; and seeing the looking-glass at Donnelly's back, and their pockets stuffed out, we stopt them.</p>

The next day I saw six pieces under his bench, there I left them; when he was gone, I went and examined, and they were gone; after that I had information the prisoner had been offering a fishing-rod in Crooked-lane, and after that I was informed he had sold it to Mr. Worthington; I charged the prisoner with it; he acknowledged he had sold him one. On the 7th of this month the prisoner went out with his coat very bulky; I called him back, and ran my hand into the lining of his coat, and pulled out a great piece of charcoal, and two hazel sticks; then I got a friend to go to Mr. Worthington's, and I abode without; he went in, and asked for such a rod; it was showed him; then I went into the shop, and asked Mr. Worthington how long he had sold fishing-rods, and who served him; he said Mr. Collins; I said, did he make this rod; he said, yes, I bought it of him; I said, you did not, you bought it of somebody that stole it; then he paus'd and said, he bought it of a young man that lodged in Wych-street; I said he did, but now he lodges in Bridewell.</p>

I never saw the prisoner before he was committed; when they were before the Justice, the prisoner said to his master, do not you know such a time, I stained a butt in your shop, and a gentlewoman was there, and I said, she must not lay her hand upon it, for it would burn her; the prosecutor did not deny that circumstance, but said nothing to it.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been absent?</p>
               <p>Dermot. I understood he had been absent above a year; I was often in company with the prisoner. On Sunday the 7th of June, in the afternoon, about three or four o'clock, I am not certain to the hour, Mr. Cartwright sent for me; I went to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176707150018"/>Dermot. I live in Bow; the prisoner went into his house along with me; (I believe he was most commonly at Mr. Cartwright's house since he came home from sea, his wife being there) there was another person went in with us; Mr. Cartwright being in the parlour, he whispered me, that the prisoner's wife might escape; he said, there was some terrible affair at stake, and he was afraid he would commit murder, and begged of me to take him away with me, while she made her escape out of the house; I did so, I took him out to the White Horse; he staid there with me about six or seven minutes, and went out from me with a walking-stick in his hand; after he had been absent about twelve or fifteen minutes, he came back without the stick, and had a naked hanger in his left bosom, I saw the handle of it; this hanger I had seen hanging naked in Mr. Cartwright's parlour; when I took the prisoner out with me, the prisoner told me he had done for them both; as soon as he came to the door, he said they both lay dead on the floor, and desired me to go and see; I went immediately to Mr. Cartwright's house, which was about 2 or 300 yards distant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner go with you?</p>
               <p>Dermot. No, he did not; I saw the prisoner's wife in the kitchen, she appeared very low; there was a very great effusion of blood that lay by her; the back of her gown was cut in several places, where I believe he had struck her; her wound was upon her thigh, I did not see that; I could see no wound about her face; I enquired where Mr. Cartwright was; I went up stairs, and found him in a chair at his study-door, leaning on his left side.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he for health before?</p>
               <p>Dermot. He was as hearty and well as ever I saw him, when I took the prisoner away to the White Horse; I found he was wounded very deep on his right elbow, there was a large effusion of blood by him; I asked him how he came by that wound; he told me Mr. Hallgeel had murdered him; this was the 7th, and he died on the 21st; I sent for a coach, and sent him to the hospital; he seemed very faint.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his age?</p>
               <p>Dermot. I believe he might be about sixty years of age; he was a very hale stout man of his age.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the age of the prisoner's wife?</p>
               <p>Dermot. I do not know, she may be about forty, or seven and eight-and-thirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a comely woman?</p>
               <p>Dermot. She is a good motherly-looking woman, she is fat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his wound?</p>
               <p>Dermot. I did, we pulled his morning-gown off and saw it; his shirt was cut through; the wound was just in the joint of the right arm, and his left shoulder was dislocated; I saw him two days after in the hospital; I saw him frequently till he died; I saw Surgeon

            , he told me the wound was mortal, and would be the death of him; the deceased considered himself as a dying man, and told me his time was but short, and declared upon the word of a dying man, that what he was accused of concerning the woman was false. The prisoner was taken the next Sunday morning; I saw him in custody in the watch-house at Bromley, nothing material passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing of jealousy in the way?</p>
               <p>Dermot. There were hints thrown out to that purport; about six days before, the prisoner and I were going from London to Bow; he fell down on the road, and hurt his face and his knuckles on his right hand; I took him in at the Black Swan alehouse at Bow to wash him; words passed between the landlady and him; he called her b - h; what she said I did not rightly hear, but she told me afterwards, that she bid him go home to the b - h his wife that cuckolded him; the prisoner told me the same thing when we were got out of the house; the landlady said to me, why do you bring such a person here; the prisoner told me, she bid him go home to Cartwright's whore, you cuckold; when he got home to Cartwright's house, he began with his wife the same evening, and Mr. Cartwright was afraid he would kill his wife.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Cartwright a married or a single man?</p>
               <p>Dermot. He was a single man.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did the prisoner's wife live with the deceased?</p>
               <p>Dermot. In the capacity of a housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants did he keep?</p>
               <p>Dermot. He kept a servant girl and a boy; she had the command of the other servants.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any intimacy between the deceased and the prisoner's wife?</p>
               <p>Dermot. Upon my word I know of none, nor never suspected none.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not made much noise in the neighbourhood?</p>
               <p>Dermot. I do not know that it has.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176707150019"/>Q. How far does that woman live from Mr. Cartwright's, with whom the prisoner had these words?</p>
               <p>Dermot. About 3 or 400 yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the prisoner's wife's gown cut?</p>
               <p>Dermot. It was about the back and hip above the stays; I saw no cut below, except the hole in her petticoat, where some sharp instrument had penetrated, that was in the hind part; I saw none in the fore part of her petticoat. I understood by the surgeon that dressed her, the wound was in her groin, rather behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Cartwright any instrument in his hand when you saw him?</p>
               <p>Dermot. He had a sword in his wounded hand, with the scabbard on it; I found the stick which the prisoner had in his hand when he went from me in the dining-room, splintered and broke; when I went up stairs, Mr. Cartwright held out the sword, and said, I'll kill you before I die, you have murdered me, thinking I had been the prisoner coming again; that sword he had in his hand I have frequently seen hanging in his study.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a bed-room by the dining-room?</p>
               <p>Dermot. There is a little bed-chamber at one end of it; I believe the woman locked herself in it, because there were three or four places where he had attempted to run the sword through; it opens into the dining-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Cartwright and she were both locked in that room together?</p>
               <p>Dermot. I do not know that they were; the bed was turned up then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased ever tell you how the fray began?</p>
               <p>Dermot. He told me he was going up stairs, to hurry the woman out of the house, and taking advantage of the prisoner's absence, they were talking together about a little family account, and he had hold of the knob of the lock, the door was not quite shut, when the prisoner came and beat him with the stick, and broke it about him, and then he ran down for the hanger; he told me this several times without variation; (the hanger, broken stick, and long sword produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Have you often seen the prisoner at Mr. Cartwright's house?</p>
               <p>Dermot. I have seen him eat and drink there several times.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they seem to behave together?</p>
               <p>Dermot. They seemed to behave and agree very friendly; I believe the prisoner was very unhappy in his temper to his wife after that affair at the Black Swan; before, the prisoner and deceased were as friendly as any two brothers could be.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Cartwright, I lived there eight months before his death; the prisoner's wife was housekeeper there when I came; the prisoner frequently dined and breakfasted there, and lay with his wife every night for six weeks before my master's death; he and my master behaved and agreed very well together.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time you discovered the prisoner showing any ill-will?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. That was on Whitsunday morning; he had used to quarrel with his wife before, but I did not know what it was about; the first time that I had observed it, was about a week before that; he was one of the best tempered men in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened on Whitsunday?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. Then he got up about seven in the morning, and packed up his clothes, and our boy helped to carry them to London; he was then going to his own apartment in London; he returned again about one or two o'clock in the afternoon, I had just sent up dinner as he knocked at the door; I said you are just come in time; he walked up stairs to the fore parlour, the dining-room is up another pair of stairs; there was my master and the prisoner's wife; I went to the parlour to take the things away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner dine there?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. I believe he did; the plates were foul when I fetched them away; he was a little in liquor, he was quarrelling with his wife; all I heard him say, she had pawned his clothes, and pawned his plate since he was gone; my master made answer and said, Poh, poh, poh, what have I to do between a man and his wife quarreling, what signifies making a noise; then the prisoner went with a design to take a walk out; our boy, to the best of my knowledge, was sent to Mr. Dermot; he came; this was about an hour after dinner; when he came, I was not up in the parlour at all; very soon after he came, he and the prisoner went out together; I saw them go out at the fore door as I stood in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this was it that you saw the prisoner again?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. It might be about a quarter of an hour; when he came back again, I was standing leaning against the back door; the prisoner came in at that door, he had only a stick in his hand; he said to me, where is the whore my wife; I said, she is gone to London.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176707150020"/>Q. Was she gone to London?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. No, she was not.</p>
               <p>Q Why then did you say so?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. I said so by her order; she had ordered me, in case he came back, to give that answer, when she was in the back kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your master at that time?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. He was up stairs. Then he asked where my my master was; I said I would go and call him; I went up the kitchen stairs, and called Sir, several times, there was no answer; the kitchen is under ground, the kitchen stairs come into the hall and the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you think your master was?</p>
               <p>E Golding. I thought to have found him in the fore parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner stay when you went up the kitchen stairs?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. He stood in the back kitchen till I came down again</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open the parlour door?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. No, the door was open, there was no body there; I came down and told him, I could not make my master answer; the prisoner made no answer; I immediately went out at the back gate, to see if the boy was coming with the beer; I staid not above five or six minutes at the gate; when I came back again, the prisoner was beating my mistress down the kitchen stairs; he had a hanger, I saw no stick; she was all cut across her stays and gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any blood?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. No, I did not then; then he beat her in the kitchen with the hanger; I saw him give her a prick behind; he did it with a push with his hand, right forward; presently I saw blood; as soon as I saw him beating her down stairs, I sent for Mr. Dermot; I staid in the kitchen, and gave her a little water to drink; the prisoner went out at the back door; soon after that, I heard my master stamping about, up one pair of stairs, that is above the kitchen where the study is; I did not go up till Mr. Dermot came.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your mistress after dinner?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. She was in the dining-room; she said, in case her husband came, she desired to be denied, for he was in a very bad temper, and she told me she should go up-in the dining-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master up into the dining-room with the prisoner's wife?</p>
               <p>E. Golding I cannot say he was; I know she was there, for she had called to me to bring her the chamber-pot, that was before the prisoner came back again; I carried one up to the dining-room, the door was locked when I went up; she opened the door, and took the chamber-pot of me; we have a little room in the dining-room, and there is a bed in it, it opens to the right-hand of the door; when she opened the door for me to deliver the chamber-pot, that little room door was shut; I carried it up from the back kitchen, and I believe the parlour-door was shut at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your master at that time?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. That hanger which the prisoner had, where does that hang?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. That always hangs naked in the fore parlour, I saw it there that morning; after Mr. Dermot came, I saw the wound on my master's arm.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. HOW was the prisoner in general for temper?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. He was always a very good-tempered man before he went to the Black Swan.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never told any body that your master and mistress were in a bed-chamber at that time?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. No, I never saw them in any bed-chamber together in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said they were both in that little room?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she lie?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. She lay in the back-parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did your master lie?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. He lay in a room even with the dining-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lie?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. I lay under the stair-case.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear your master come down in a morning when you have been in bed?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. I have heard him come down at four or five in the morning, when she has been in bed, several times.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you heard that?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. I have heard it three or four times; I used to think it was a thief, he used to come so softly; I used to think he had no shoes on; he came as if he intended to have nobody hear him; they could not move but I could hear them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he stay below?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. I believe he might stay an hour in my mistress's room; I have heard him go up again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear any thing pass between them?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. They could not move nor stir in bed but I heard them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard them in bed?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. I have heard them move in the bed together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before the prisoner came home, or when?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. It was before he came home from sea.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you heard them move in the bed together?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. I am positive I have heard them three times, much in the same way; and I have heard him, after an hour or two, go up stairs again; and about seven o'clock she used to carry him up a bason of broth, and he used to come down about nine.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you call her when you spoke to her?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. I always called her madam, as my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. When you called, Sir, Sir, was it loud enough for him to have heard you?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the parlour then?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the kitchen?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the yard?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. No, I heard the prisoner say he found them both in the dining-room together when he went up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see your master last, before the prisoner came in?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. That was in the fore-parlour, and she was up in the dining-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when he went out of the parlour?</p>
               <p>E. Golding. No, I do not know, for I was washing up my things below.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any quarrel or dispute between your master and the prisoner?</p>

               <p>E. Golding. No, I did not.</p>

            . I am a pupil under Mr. Grindal; I saw the deceased about seven in the evening, on Whitsunday, in the London-hospital; I found him with a wound in the joint on the right<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176707150023"/> elbow, and his left shoulder was dislocated; the wound was cut across the elbow in the joint quite to the bone; a small blood-vessel or artery was cut; the wound seemed to be given by some edged weapon; there appeared to have been a good deal of blood lost; the man was very faint when he came in, the blood was not then stopt; I applied some lint to it, and that stopt it; there was a contusion about his shoulder by the blows, they appeared very black; I could not tell what they proceeded from; I attended him daily.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he die?</p>
               <p>Saunders. He died that day fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. What in your opinion was the cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Saunders. A fever was the cause of his death, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasioned that fever?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Whether it was occasioned by the fever or otherwise, I cannot determine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wound and the injury you saw he had received the cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Very possible they might occasion his death; I rather think they were the occasion of his death.</p>

               <p>Saunders. He told me it was by putting up his arm to defend himself, and he ran against the ballusters of the stairs with his left shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the dislocation was the cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I do not think that alone was; I do not think that alone brought on the fever.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was first called in, would you have thought that kind of wound a mortal wound,</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, I did not think it a mortal wound; that was my opinion then; Mr. Grindal saw him the day after he came in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grindal. I saw the deceased the day after the accident happened, about twelve o'clock; the young gentleman has given you my opinion; I found the deceased in a high fever; I believe, if they had thought of the consequence that has attended it, they would have sent for me over night, (if they find any thing of great consequence they send for us immediately) I have seen many worse wounds than that that have done well; the young gentleman had put his arm in before I came. The second or third day after the fever increased very much, I called a friend of his on one side, to desire him if the deceased had any affairs to settle to get him so to do, thinking him in a dangerous condition.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole of this wound and these bruises, were they the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Mr. Grindal. I cannot help thinking, but upon the whole his death was the consequence of the wound; his fever might proceed from his being so long neglected.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When a fever proceeds from a wound, do you not call it a sympathetic fever?</p>
               <p>Mr. Grindal. We do; at first it was a sympathetic fever, no doubt, we could never by bleeding get it over. For the first two or three days, I thought he stood a chance to do well; but a fever much stronger and higher than that took him, and from that I told his friend I saw no hopes of his recovery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>When I came to Mr. Dermot, before he and I went out, Mr. Cartwright called him in out of the fore-parlour into the back-parlour; then he came to me again, and told me he was going to take a walk to Ham and Plaistow; he said to me, I had better take a walk along with him, it will pass away time; accordingly I said with all my heart; we went out to take a walk; Mr. Dermot's maid was at the door, and said a gentleman wanted to speak with him; accordingly we went to Mr. Dermot's house, and then was told the gentleman was gone to the White-horse at Bow; we went to the White-horse, he asked who wanted him; they told him the person was in the parlour, we went in. Mr. Dermot asked him what he had to say; we sat down, he drank to Mr. Dermot, and Mr. Dermot drank to me, and I to the other gentleman; they fell into some discourse together; I said to Mr. Dermot, I find you are so deep in discourse you will hardly go to Plaistow to night, I want to go home; said he, I would not have you hinder yourself as you are in a hurry; I said, gentleman, your servant, and went out; and as a boy told me before, that he catched my wife and Mr. Cartwright together, if I had gone out to go to Ham, I should have turned back, though I had not mentioned it to any body. I came back again, the maid was looking out at the garden-gate; I said, Betty, where is my wife; she said she is gone to London; I walked in by her; she ran past me, and ran up stairs, and called Sir, Sir, five or six times, as loud as she could; I went into the back-kitchen and took the hanger, and carried it in one hand, and the stick in the other: as the maid was coming down stairs I went up; I first went into the fore-parlour, and then into the back-parlour; I opened his bed-chamber, and saw nobody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176707150024"/> there; then I opened the dining-room door very softly; then I came to the little room door, I found it fast, I got my shoulder against it with the hanger and stick in my hands; I burst it open, there Mr. Cartwright was in the action with my wife; he arose up, she could not cover her nakedness; he was going to get his breeches up, I fetched him a blow with the stick, he got his breeches buttoned, and went to take hold of his sword that lay upon a chair; I took the hanger and cut him in the arm, he ran out of the dining-room and I after him; my wife locked the door against me: I said, you whore, if you do not open the door I'll break it open; I fetched her a blow, and as I was going to give her another, she ran out at the door; there are two stair-cases, she ran down the other stairs, and I after her, and into the kitchen, I gave her half a dozen strokes across the stays; she came to clasp her arms round me; I said, you whore, do not go to take hold of me, and with the hanger as I held it, by her turning, pierced her thigh: then I went and told Mr. Dermot that I catched them both in the action, and paid them pretty well for it; I did not think to do any murder, as I went out with Mr. Dermot; she said to the maid get me some water, I am going up-stairs to shift myself, I am going to London; she heard Betty come up; she knocked at the wainscot, and said, madam, I want to speak with you; said my wife, Betty, can't I trust you with a secret, if my husband should come tell him I am gone to London, and do you bring up the chamber-pot.</p>

On the 2d of July he called me out of the workshop into the parlour, and said the prisoner, who was there, had offered him a pint mug to sell, whom he suspected not to have come by it honestly; he desired me to go along with him to a person that was to give him a character; he had told Mr. Hemmings he lived in the neighbourhood, and there were people near that could give him a character; he took me to the corner of Lancaster-court in Bond-street, to a public house, and said he would send for a friend of his; he called for a pint of porter, and the people of the house sent for his friend; but before any body came, he ran away out at the back door. In our conversation going along, he told me the mug was sent him out of the country to dispose of; Mr. Hemmings advertised the mug, and the person that brought it, and Mr. Jones came and owned it; (produced and deposed to;) the next time I saw him was the Tuesday following, then Mr. Jones brought him to our shop.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live at Charing-cross; the prisoner came to my shop on the 29th of May, about nine in the morning, and asked what I would give anounce for this tankard; (produced and deposed to by prosecutor.) I weighed it, and marked upon it that I would give 5 s. an ounce; he told me he would go back to the gentleman that sent him, and ask him if he would sell it for that, and he would give me the preference; he went away, and the paper came; I was reading an advertisement about it being stolen; he came back at the time I was reading it; he said, the gentleman would let me have it at the price; I stopped it, and told him it was stolen from the Black Lion, Russel-street, Covent-garden; he seemed very cool, not affrighted, and said he would go back and tell the gentleman; he went, but never returned again; I sent to the prosecutor, to let him know I had got his tankard.</p>

            . The three prisoners and I broke the prosecutor's house open, I cannot tell the exact time; we took 23 or 24 s. in halfpence; we changed halfpence at Mr. Curtis's, as he has said, about seven or eight o'clock the next morning, and joined, and had three pounds of eels for breakfast.</p>
               <p>Curtis. They had eels for breakfast at my house, when they changed the halfpence.</p>
               <p>Boswell's defence.</p>
               <p>Since I have been in confinement, I have heard there are two indictments against Ausser, for stealing sheep and pigs; he goes by the name of Bradley; Spires told me, there was a drover would be glad if I would put 5 s. in halfpence off for him; I went to Mr. Curtis, and asked if my wife had been there with halfpence; he asked if I had any more; I gave him 3 s. more.</p>
               <p>Spires's defence.</p>
               <p>I met Ausser in Covent-garden; he desired me to change some halfpence, saying he was loaded with them; he asked me to go and be a penny; Ausser went with me, where were two girls in bed; he went to bed to them, and I left him in the room; by that time it was late; I had rather lose half a day than have words, so I came again to the new alehouse, and sent for Boswell out of bed, and asked if he would change them halfpence for me; then Ausser gave me five shillings worth, and five shillings to Boswell's wife for her husband to change; Mr. Curtis gave her 1 s. in silver, and said it was all he had; she went home; then he came and brought 3 s. more; after that, Harford went and asked Curtis to take 5 s. in halfpence to change; Curtis gave him half a guinea, and then we had eighteen pennyworth of punch.</p>
               <p>Harford's defence.</p>
               <p>The evidence met me in Covent-garden, and took me to Boswell; then we went to Long-acre to two girls; there the evidence gave us the half-pence to change, and in the morning we went to the public-house, and there changed them.</p>

               <p>A. Oakley. No, nobody; my mistress was ill up stair, she never came down; there was a carpenter came in in the evening to need a table; he was not there two minutes and I was there all the time the carpenter was there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I acknowledge myself guilty of the fact.</p>
