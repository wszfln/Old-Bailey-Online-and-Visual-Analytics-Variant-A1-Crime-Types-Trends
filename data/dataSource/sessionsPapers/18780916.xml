                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Henry Weldon—for some years I resided at Tavistock House, Tavistock Square—ten or eleven years ago I tried to establish an orphanage there—I kept poor children there for residence and education—I first became acquainted with the prisoner in 1872, through Monsieur Gunod, who was staying with us for three years—the prisoner visited him; he described himself as a journalist of importance—he said that he had been connected with a newspaper called <hi rend="italic">La Liberte Colonial</hi>—after that I lost sight of him for some little time—I had a book belonging to him, and I sent one of my pupils to say I had got it, and to express my sympathy with him and his wife as to something that had happened; and he came to see me again, I think, on 12th or 13th of April, 1876—very soon after that Madame Menier came to stay with me, with a little child—we were on terms of great friendship, and were very fond of each other—she remained with me at Tavistock House, until October last year, with the child—the prisoner came to see her very often; I thought he was a very honest man, and his wife was quite certain that he was—in October it was arranged that owing to Madame Menier's health we were to go abroad for a time—we were to go to Paris—we left London at 6.30 on the evening of 9th October, I, Madame Menier, and the child, and six or seven other children; some of them had gone before with Madame Menier's sister; We went to Argles, about four hours from Paris, the prisoner accom<lb/>panied us to the station—prior to my departure I had arranged for Mr. and Mrs. Lowther to occupy Tavistock House; I expected them to come in the morning; before I left, but they did not arrive—I left nearly all the servants in the house—I did not give the prisoner any instructions at the station,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187809160002"/>
               <p>before I went there I had given him six pages in English to give to Mr. Lowther, instructions as to different little things that ought to be attended to in the house—I gave him no authority to occupy two rooms in the house—I never contemplated anything of the kind; he could not have lived in the store-room and the lumber-room, because there was no place for him there—he had the keys of those two rooms—I gave him no authority to sleep in the house, or to keep the latch-keys or anything of that kind—I could not exactly say when I received a letter from Mr. Lowther, I think it was in December—I was in Paris on and off, the children were ill, and I was generally at Argles, or at a convent, where five of the children are now—I remained in France till 2nd April—on 9th March I got a letter from my husband's lawyer—I wrote to my mother, and ultimately I returned to England on 3rd April, and went to the house on the 4th—the door was not opened, I rushed in, I got in by a dodge, because my husband was trying to keep me out—the prisoner came up when he heard that I had come home, and he rushed out of the house as fast as he could go—he did not say a word to me—I saw a box in the hall packed and corded ready for removal, it was my box—it contained higgledy-piggledy things, dresses, and linen and lace, but nothing like jewellery, he had cleared off my jewellery-case first—there were several boxes ready packed, crockery, and in fact there was a general clearance—I then searched my jewel case, and he had taken every single thing except some little coral beads not worth much—the things produced by Mr. King, Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Cordell are all mine—they were left quite safe when I went away in October—the articles of jewellery in the first packet were not in the jewel case, they were in another box—when I was at the house on 4th April, I saw a man named Baratti there—I found that the prisoner had a mistress living in the house, I found the address of her father and mother in my box, and I telegraphed to them to come up and look for the girl, and we traced her to where the prisoner had taken her, and that was how we caught him—on 5th April I went to the Hotel Cont at 21, Golden Square, with the officer, I went there first and saw the box there—the policeman found the girl Nicholls there, and the servant also, she is one of the persons I desired Mr. Wontner to subpoena, but he has not done so, she ought certainly to have been subpoenaed—the box at the hotel was not mine, but the contents were; there was wearing-apparel, towels, and other things, the detective has them—I never authorised the prisoner to take them away—I gave the servant into custody—the prisoner came to the hotel while I was there with the officer, at a quarter past 12—I said to detective Cook, "I give that man in charge for the theft of these things which are in this parcel"—he strode across the room, shook his fist in my face, and said, "I give this woman in charge for the murder of little children"—he also said that I was mad, that I was not to be listened to, that I was a miserable woman, and that he would do for me, that I should not have my own way long, or something like that—he did not say a word about the property—he only said I had murdered the children and was mad—he repeated that a great many times, in the room and all the way down stairs, and in the cab, and he kept on threatening me the whole way that he would do for me, that he had got everything in store for me, that I should see, and I should know what was coming and all that sort of thing, and that I was a bad good-for-nothing woman—it was all in French; I told him to speak in English so that the policeman could</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187809160003"/>
               <p>understand him, I translated to the policeman what he said—I charged him at the station—he made no statement as to why or how he had taken the property; he said I had got his balloon; that was his excuse for taking the things, because he said I had got a balloon of his; he told Mr. Flowers that it was worth 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had taken my things as a sort of equivalent—he had given me the balloon, it is a dreadful thing, I wanted it to be taken away, and I wish somebody would send for it—I think it is a very clever invention—he gave it me to benefit my orphanage, if I could get it from the War Office, as I knew several persons there, and if by my influence I could get hold of the thing I was to have it for the benefit of the orphanage, and we were to divide the profits—I was to have one-third, and Madame one-third, and he himself one-third, and we often argued as to what we should do with the money—it was a balloon which he had submitted to the War Office for military operations, it is now in my yard—I should like to state that I have here Mr. Simmonds and Mr. Morris to state that it is their balloon, and not Mr. Menier's, and that they paid 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I saw some furniture belonging to me at Baratti's, it was taken from my house—I wish I knew where Baratti lives; he did live at 372, Euston Road; the furniture consisted of tables, beds, chests of drawers—I had left them all right in the house, when I went to France on 9th<lb/>October; I did not authorise any one to take them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Tavistock House was acquired on 3rd December, 1870—I did not say at the police-court that I had last slept with my husband in 1875; it is not the fact—I did not say I had not slept with him since 1870, you asked me how long it was since I last saw my husband, and I said not for thirteen or fourteen years; I said I had not slept with him for about thirteen or fourteen years—I lived with him under the same roof till 1875—I don't think I had much interest in a house in Bentinck Street I did not take it, it was not taken for the purposes of the orphanage—I did not advance money for it—Madame Menier first lived with me on 19th July, 1876, she has lived with me from that time, and she is with me now—at the police-court I declined to give her address—in October, 1877, I did not contemplate being abroad for many years, I did not intend to expatriate myself for three years, I meant to come back in May—I taught the Rawlings family at the orphanage, music, reading and writing, and other things—I authorised Menier to procure bells and a piano for them—I had nothing to do with their engagement at the Oxford, they were engaged there to play on hand bells—I have signed my name as "Valerie" and "Granny"—these letters marked from A to Q are my writing—Madame and I both gook the name of DeLuz, and so did Mr. Menier—these are parts of letters written by me in October, 1877—some of them were addressed to Tavistock House; many were to Mr. Ray, his cousin—this (<hi rend="italic">marked F</hi>) is my writing, it is a letter which I sent to the prisoner to post for me, and he kept it back—this letter (<hi rend="italic">R</hi>) is the prisoner's writing, I received it in Paris—it is an agree<lb/>ment for the balloon and for the millions in New Caledonia—this is the account the prisoner sent me—it is dated 15th June, 1877—there was another account which I received after he was given in custody, saying that I owed him 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a certain sum of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I put into the City Bank to oblige him, because he said he wanted to appear to have a financial position in the City, but he was most particularly asked not to touch it—I did not know it was for a bad purpose—I wrote to the City Bank</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">about it and also to</hi> Mr. Gunod, thinking he would not like to have to do with such a wretch, but I was mistaken—I let him have a great deal of other money—I did not desire him while I was abroad to let Tavistock House—I wanted him to save a piano of my very own, which I had in Bentinck Street—the wearing apparel that I found at the Hotel Cont was in Miss Nicholls's box—I have never kept an old rag shop, therefore I cannot tell you the value of the articles—I did not charge Miss Nicholls with stealing them—I gave the servant Elizabeth Haseldine in charge—I never saw her before—she ought to be a witness for me—she was Menier's servant—I was so sorry for Miss Nicholls I did not charge her with anything—I said if she did not stop screaming I would make her leave off—I was too sorry for her to accuse her of anything—I identified my watch on that occasion—the prisoner had got it and Would not give it me, and I was determined to have it—I don't know what he said—he gesticulated, and roared, and bellowed, and said I was mad, and that not a word I said was true—I can't say that he said it was not my watch—the detective took it from his pocket—I said it was stolen from me—I never withdrew from that statement—the tickets for. the jewellery were found at Tavistock House—I know that he had no business; he might have had a dozen addresses, one of them was in the Minories—Baratti was a protege of Miss Torreani's—I have tried to be kind to him, as I have to a good many people—I did not allow him to live in the house—I had not given him assistance in money—I had been to the Austrian Embassy, and had helped him when his child died of smallpox, and tried to get him assistance—I had known him about four years—the furniture was not returned at my request; Mr. Wontner told Barratti to send it back, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the cart, and he sent it back—I charged Menier with stealing that furniture—Baratti is not here, the subpoenas were served. so late, there was no time to find him—I did not advance money for the construction of the balloon, Mr. Simmonds and Mr. Morris had done that—the prisoner represented to me that he was interested in millions of acres in New Caledonia—I was, when in Paris, to interest myself with the Minister <hi rend="italic">of Marine there</hi> In getting the property—I think I went once to his brother's <hi rend="italic">office</hi> in Paris, and Madame and I dined with his mother—the prisoner's brother was not the proprietor of <hi rend="italic">La Liberte Colonial</hi>—can you be the proprietor of a thing that is dead? it was all but dead, it only lived nine months—I was not going to edit it, I am not up to that—I dare say I did represent that I would put it in such a shape as that <hi rend="italic">it would</hi> be successful—I think it was on 2nd April that Mr. Neale had anything to do with the case—this is true: "I was barricaded by lire keepers trying to get me to a lunatic asylum, some one having got two doctors to sign a certificate"—will you, my lord, subpoena them? do subpoena them—"the lunacy laws are something awful"—so they are. "Two villains may quite unsuspectingly get into your house and swear away your mind"—it is Dr. Winslow and Dr. Wynne, and Campbell and Rutherford. If you would only bring those doctors into Court, I should be so much obliged to you. It is a conspiracy, I have charged them with it, and Mr. Flowers desired the Home Office to take it up, but Mr. Wontner is a friend of Dr. Winslow's, and therefore he would not do it. It is all very well to laugh, but when a woman's life and reputation is at stake, I will defend myself. I am not wrong. I know perfectly well that three keepers did get into my house and lay hold of me. This man is but the tool of the conspiracy, and why should</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187809160005"/>
               <p>he stand there alone? It is not because he is a miserable adventurer that he is to be the target of these people; there are others more wicked than him who have tried to get me away and get possession of my house. It is not a question of my judgment, it is a question of fact Mr. Neale was actually abetting him to steal my property. Let Mr. Hirschfield be subpoenaed. I know they try to make me mad, they are all connected in conspiring against me. The case has not been fairly tried, and I wish the Jury and the public and the press to know it; the proper witnesses have not been subpoenaed. Dr. Winslow and Dr. Wynne are two villains, and I hope the press will not be afraid to report it I am a spiritualist. It is atheists who run down spiritualism."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. When I first attended before the Magistrate I was not represented by anybody—Mr. Flowers wanted the Treasury to take the case up, but they have not taken it up properly—a man named Nelson had the house in Bentinck Street, he had gone bankrupt for 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he got 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of me under the pretence that he wanted to use it for the benefit of my orphanage—that was how I was always taken in by people—the house was heavily mortgaged; the lawyer made him give me the lease, and Menier said he would give me 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and he gave it me out of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had placed to his account at the. bank—he had no right to use it except for my purposes and by my permission, and he swore he would never touch a penny of it—I believe this account was rendered to me in October (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—this is dated 17th November, 1877; it was only to show to the Minister—the prisoner speaks in this of the money I had lent him and the assistance I had rendered him—the term "granny" is one that the children used to me, it was a term of affection—Madame Menier and I used the name of DeLuz, it was her grandmother's name—I did not want to be known, I was incognito—the letter F is addressed to Ray, he lives at 20, Adelphi Build<lb/>ings, Covent Garden—I handed that letter to Menier to post, but it never reached Ray—the watch was one that I lent to Menier—I had asked him for it dozens of times, but could not get it.</p>

I was first spoken to by Mrs. Weldon on 5th April at Vine Street police-station; I had never seen her before—we went to the hotel and found Miss Nicholls's mother there, and the father came a few minutes afterwards—Mrs. Weldon did not appear excited—the prisoner was very excited—I did not hear Mrs. Weldon charge Miss Nicholls with theft—I did not hear her cry and say she was going to prison—I produce the articles that were found in Miss Nicholls's box; there were some of her own articles in it—I did not hear Mrs. Weldon charge the servant Lizzie with theft—the prisoner said he had brought the box away himself, packed by the servant; it was locked when I saw it—Miss Nicholls was, there at the time—the prisoner had engaged the room at the hotel—I know that he had offices at 35, Minories—I could not say that he lived there—I went there afterwards; he gave me that address—when Mrs. Weldon said the watch was hers he did not deny it—I saw Mrs. Weldon again that same night; she did not give me the pawn-tickets then; she gave me two a week after—she said she had the proper keys of the place—I was led to believe that these were false keys—the prisoner said something about the balloon, but I cannot say what it was; he spoke in broken English—I found this notice from; Mr. Neale on the prisoner, and other papers, some in French; they were given back to him.</p>

September to the beginning of March—I can tell by my books, but I gave Heluy 100 francs at a time for the keep of the children, and to take them abroad—I have asked her for accounts six months since—as to what she saw in the newspapers, she received a telegram from Menier's brother, asking her to go and give evidence for Menier—she said "If I am paid I will go"; Madame was there and told us the whole story—as to Menier being master of the house, I should like to call my servants, who could speak about that—as to dining at the same table, we all, I and my servants, dined together.</p>

I am assistant overseer at the Kilburn post-office—it is my duty each morning to examine the receipts brought back for the registered letters—I examined them on Monday morning, 15th July—I found that one was missing in the name of Young—I asked the prisoner for it—he said "I have given them up"—I then said "I want two in the name of Young, one at the 6 p.m. delivery and one at the 8 p.m. delivery; but I have only one"—I showed him that, and said "Is this the receipt you had?"—he said "Yes"; that was the one of the 6 o'clock delivery; but I did not notice the stamp at that time—Hill had delivered at 6 o'clock—I afterwards saw Hill, and in consequence of what he said I at once communicated with the Post-office authorities—the missing letter has not been found, only the four notes—the prisoner took out letters on the Monday on three deliveries—he had three registered letters to deliver that day, one at the 4 p.m. delivery and two at the 8 p.m. delivery—the receipts for the 8 p.m. delivery he should bring back on the following morning—one of those letters in the name of Cooper was mis delivered; that mistake was discovered, and I delivered the letter myself to the right person—the prisoner came on duty at his usual time on the Tuesday morning—I inquired for the three receipts for the letters he had taken out on Monday—he said he had not got them—I said "What have you done with them?"—he said "I don't know"—I said "It is a very strange thing if you have lost three registered letter receipts"—he said "Well, I don't know whether I have or not; I have not got them"—I said "You will have to explain what you have done with them"—he then said "I have not delivered my last night's letters which I took out on the 8 p.m. delivery"—I then asked him for his bag containing those letters—I at once turned out the bag and found 86 letters and 11 newspapers—I asked why he did not deliver them—he said "I took them out, but I did not intend to deliver them", and he refused to deliver any more—he fetched his receipts in about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and then went away from the office altogether.</p>

               <p>prisoner brought me a letter containing some small coin, and I charged double registration for it—I did not know that the prisoner was about the neighbourhood for three or four days after the Tuesday—I have heard since that he has a mother at Reading—I can't say that she sent him money at times—I paid him his weekly wages, 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on the Saturday afternoon—he was supposed to work at some trade besides delivering letters—I have never known the letter-carriers sort their letters in the street after leaving the office.</p>

I was rather the worse for liquor. We went to the Old Ship, and he said, 'Call for a pint of stout and mild, I'll pay for it' I said, 'No, I have some coppers, I'll pay for it.' He said 'Never mind.' He took out a florin, put it on the counter, and said, 'Pay for it,' putting it to me, and he asked me to call for a cigar. While I asked for it he ran out. The barmaid said the coin was bad, and I said 'I'll fetch him back.' I ran to fetch him back, and believe I ran in the same direction as him. I saw a man turn up a street, but when I saw he was not there I stopped, intending to go back to the public-house. When Mr. Duff came up, he said, 'I must take you back to the public-house. I said,' There's no need, I'm going there. 'Badger then came back, and they took me to the public-house. The barmaid then said,' He is an accomplice, I shall accuse him as well, 'meaning Badger. Some one behind said' Yes, he was in here, drinking with him.' Badger wanted to search me; I objected, as the barmaid said he was an accomplice, and as I believed he was the man who was with me, and do now believe he was the man. Badger took some money out of my pocket in the house, and at the station he searched me, and I gave him a correct name and address, and where I worked."<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner produced a written defence, repeating the above statement, and maintaining that Badger was the man who drank with him, and passed the florin to him</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">

               <p>three prisoners were given into their charge—we searched the room, and picked up 33 counterfeit shillings, some finished and some unfinished, and two "gets"—some of the coins were quite hot—there was a small fire—I saw Thick open this rag and find 17 counterfeit shillings; some were more finished than others, which had pieces of metal on their edges—26 coins were of 1873 and 24 of 1843—under the stoke-hole I found these two pieces of metal, which fit into this ladle which I found on the floor—I found these pincers on the table of the room we first entered, and these three small files, and on a dresser this spoon with some plaster-of-Paris on it, and this copper wire on the floor—I saw Mary Ann Crawley throw on to the floor of the closet, near the back door, this piece of flannel with sand in it—I searched a cupboard in the front room, and found a quantity of plaster<lb/>of-Paris—in the dresser in the back kitchen I found this bottle of liquid—I found this shell containing plaster-of-Paris—I searched the room immediately above, but only found a piece of whitening—those are the only rooms in the house—I took Frederick Callard to the station—before leaving the house I told the prisoners they must consider themselves in custody for having counterfeit coin in their possession, also a mould for making them—Frederick Callard said, "Very well, I will go quietly with you"—M.

Mile End—on 18th July, about 11 p.m., I served Frederick and Margaret Callard with a pint of ale—Margaret tendered a bad florin—I asked her if she had any more of those—she said "Why?"—I said, "You know very well it is not good"—she said she did not know it was bad—a man came in and stood between the two, and called for half a pint of ale my wife served him while I was talking to the prisoner—I saw something pass—he went away—I stopped Frederick and Margaret Callard, and sent for a policeman and gave him the florin—I marked it—this is it.</p>

East India Chambers, Leadenhall Street—I have known the Marquis D'Oliverez about ten years—he consulted me with reference to making Mr. and Mrs. Depledge bank<lb/>rupt, and entrusted to me a bill of exchange, an account for 282<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and the documents attached to the depositions and others—I left them in a basket on my desk with the instructions paper—there were also two copy letters from Miller and Son to Mr. Depledge, and an original letter from Mrs. Depledge to the Marquis of Oliverez, which are not here—I had no knowledge of the prisoner—I gave no authority to any one to take away those documents from my office—I remember the purport of the missing letter—Mrs. Depledge admitted the debt, and acknowledged the great kindness of the marquis to her and her husband—I saw the papers last on the 13th, when I referred to them to prepare a debtor's summons—they were all there—I left about two o'clock to go to Croydon—I returned the next morning, when Austin made a communication to me—I wanted to see if the prisoner would keep his appointment the next day—I put the matter in the hands of the police on the Thursday about 4 p.m—when the prisoner was apprehended he said he was very sorry, it was a rely stupid act on his part, but he had been put up to do it by Depledge, and that he had had a drop or else he Would not have done it—I received this receipt on this envelope from Austin—I went to Hyde Park Gardens—the highest number is 40—I could not find any Mr. Ashley.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I received these documents at the Mansion House—I believe all the documents are returned except Mrs. Depledge's letter and the two copy letters—I have received letters from the marquis since the commencement of these proceedings against Mr. Cox—those are privileged letters—I have only received one asking me to withdrew, not several—I will swear I have not received four—I cannot tell yon how the marquis's letters began—he wrote a great deal—he was my client, not my friend, simply an acquaintance—I might have received a letter with the sentence, "I beg you again to withdraw entirely, as I said to yon before"—I say most decidedly I saw Mrs. Depledge's letter on the Tuesday, and the marquis read several letters to me, but from Mrs. Depledge not one—my bey told me the marquis was there on the Monday—I do not remember seeing him then—I cannot say whether I did or not—the marquis did not read to me on the Monday the letter that I say was stolen—he handed me letters, but clients do not read letters, we read them ourselves—as far as I recollect the</p>

               <p>letter ran thus: "I thank you for the great kindness that you bestowed on me and my husband, and I trust ere long to be able to pay you back what we owe you."(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "I do not require to see you any more. I thank you for your great kindness to me and to my husband, and I hope the day is not far off when I shall be able to repay mine and my husband's debt to you.") I think those are the words I gave you at the police-court—I cannot say if any of it was underlined—it did not begin, "Your letter to hand. You are the greatest fool I ever met with"—I should be sure to have recollected that—I do not recollect the date of it (<hi rend="italic">Reading coutinued</hi>: "I do not care for you or twenty solicitors. Do your best and do your worst, but take care what you do. Your late behaviour makes me forget your kindness to me and my husband, which I hope to repay, with all due respect to old age. Yours very truly, A. Depledge.") That was not the letter—I will swear it—the handwriting is similar—the bankruptcy proceed<lb/>ings are stopped because the documents are in Court—I do not know whether the marquis is here; I have not seen him this week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi> the letter referred to is only one of a number which when taken—unless we can produce those letters we must withdraw the whole case in bankruptcy.</p>

I think I shall have to stop in the rain; if she does not, I think I shall get over, wouldn't you?"—I said it was not my busineas—he went over, and knocked and rang again—I think we went away from the window for a little while, and we went back to it again in five or ten minntes—he was then on the railings of No. 2, just getting over into the area, and I saw a light come in the kitchen—I shut the windows and pulled down the blind—I had no clock, but I should think it was about 9.40 when I saw the light in the kitchen—after some time I went to the window again, and in about a minute I saw the prisoner open the door, look out, and come out with a bundle—I did not see him take anything in—I told the police the same night.</p>

I am a bootmaker of 2, New Road, Clapham Junction—on the morning of 4th September, about a quarter past two, I was walking in West Street, St Martin's Lane, close by Aldridge's Repository—I was suddenly attacked by three men; I did not see where they came from; I was tripped up on my back and robbed of my watch and chain and two half-crowns—the watch was in my waistcoat pocket and the money in my trousers; they were taken from me while I was on the ground—I saw the prisoner on the top of me, kneeling on me; he robbed me of my watch and chain and handed it to one of his confederatea—I could not do anything; I was perfectly powerless; I could not call out, I was stifled; the prisoner had one hand over my mouth—the policeman came up and took him in the act; he was kneeling down on me when he was taken; the other two got away—I feel the effects of the fall now in my side, and my elbow is black and blue—I was not able to work for three or four days.</p>

               <p>—my watch was disconnected from the guard, and was thrown on the ground at a little distance from where I had been lying—the prisoners ran away; I followed them; the police came, and I gave Finn in charge—Murphy picked up the watch and gave it to me; she did not lay anything; that was when the policeman was coming—the blow Finn gave me stunned me for a time—I had had two pennyworth of whisky, that was all, and I had not finished that.</p>

From information on this morning I went to 102, Dean Street; I entered by the door, which had been forced from the inside—I found 95 dozen skins, similar to these, packed up in bundles near the door ready for removal—I found this screwdriver on one of the benches near the counting-house window, it was covered with blood which had dried on—the warehouse had been entered by getting cm a low facia three or four houses off, walking along the leaden facia and opening the first-floor window and forcing open the door, and thus getting access to the warehouse—the window was closed but not fastened—there was no broken glass about—I compared the chisel with the marks and they corresponded—I was at the station before Johnson was charged—I observed his hand, he had a piece of paper round one of his fingers; I did not examine it then; I found afterwards it had been cut and it was bleeding, the paper was wet with blood—he refused his address—he said he was a respectable man.</p>

I am a mantle manufacturer, of 76, Greeham Street—I sell cloth cuttings to Mr. Burt, and a large quantity to Mr. Herbert, three or four tons a month—when we are busy we sell small cuttings once a fortnight or once in three weeks, and large cuttings two or three times a year—Mr. Herbert has been taking both during the last 12 months—I have known Champion ever since Mr. Herbert has taken the cuttings, but I only remember seeing Catherall once—I had written to Mr. Herbert to send and fetch the cuttings away, and on 19th August the prisoners came at a little after 12 and brought bags with them—I showed them up to the third floor, and left them there with my boy 12 years old—there were only small cuttings there, which they packed—they Were there half or three quarters of an hour—four cutters were also in the room, Kingwell was one of them Mr. Newton the foreman was also there—they were about five hours altogether packing the cuttings—these are some of the small ones (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when a bag was full it was sent down to the next floor, and afterwards tied up and weighed—the whole bulk was about 25 cwt in 22 bags—they fetched 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mr. Herbert owed me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I asked the prisoners if he was coming down to pay me—they said he was coming at 5 o'clock, but he did not, and I refused to let the bags go—I said that if they were not fetched in 24 hours I should sell them, as they were obstructing the passage—Mr. Herbert did not come till the next afternoon, and during that time I had asked Messrs. Mallett to fetch them away, which they did next morning, Wednesday, August 21st, about 10</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—Champion called him to account, and told him to be more careful—Catherall said that it was a mistake, and they laughed it off—that piece came from the back of where I stand, at one end of the top room in which the prisoners packed first—there is perhaps a yard between me and the wall—there was a large roll of paper behind</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mallett and Co., of Caledonian Road; they buy cuttings—on 21st August I got 22 bags of cuttings from Mr. Taylor, and found these six pieces of cloth in three of them when they were unpacked—the largest piece was in one bag alone, and the other five were in two of the other bags—they were returned to Mr. Taylor next morning—we do not ordinarily find 3 1/2; yards among cutting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I counted 23 bags, but I believe I counted an empty one in mistake; on a second counting there were 22—I have been employed in the same kind of business 12 or 13 years—I have found two yards among cuttings collected by us, but not often—when I find large pieces I send them down into the counting-house to have it ascertained where they come from, and then they go back—frequently in the hurry of packing pieces or cloth may be gathered up with the cuttings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The piece I once met with 2 yards long had no holes in it; it was similar to this—that is the only piece that length I have met with for 12 years.</p>

I am a piece-broker of Haggerston—Champion has been my partner eighteen months or two years, but we were, children together—we had a contract with Mr. Taylor to purchase his cuttings—Catherall was not in our employ, but I used to employ him casually when we could not manage with our own staff, and he was very straightforward and trust<lb/>worthy—we are not, in such a large way as Mallett's, and we generally supply them with rough goods, and Mr. Taylor's goods being so common it is not worth while to unpack them, so we take them down to Mallett's without unpacking them, and make our profit or loss—it is generally loss—we work for honour: for recommendation—we received a communication from Mr. Taylor, and on 19th August Mr. Champion went there for the purpose of clearing these goods—the packing was done about 5.30, and Champion came back and said something to me, in consequence of which I went next day to clear the goods, by payment of a debt I owed the prosecutor, but I believe if you go into the matter he is indebted to me—I saw his managing clerk and had a conversation with him, and saw Mr. Taylor after<lb/>wards—the names of Dow and Mallett were mentioned.</p>

I am a piece-dealer, at 122, Brunswick Street, Hackney—I am in the habit of receiving pieces in bags, and on one occasion I went with Mr. Herbert to clear Mr. Taylor's premises—you get the goods into the bag in the best way you can; sometimes we have the bag on the ground, and the cuttings are pushed into it without taking them in our hands at all—I generally begin by holding the nose of the bag down to the ground and force the cuttings into it, and then we shake it and put more in, and when it gets half full we take them up in our arms—we do it as quickly as we can, and there is very little room in Mr. Taylor's premises, only just room for the bags to pass in the principal room, in which there are six boards—the boards are near each other; there is just room for the men to work—it frequently happens that large cuttings are returned among the small ones, and various other things; on one occasion I found a large pair of shears, with brass handles to fit round the hand, among the cuttings—they were the property of Mrs. Simmonds, of East Road, and they were returned to her.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 464)—I afterwards saw the prisoner with a number of other men, and said "I do not know any one there, unless it is that man; he looks like one of the men, but I can't swear to him because he seems to have more hair about his face: I am not sure he is the man"—nobody had suggested him to me—I saw three men when I was robbed, but I can only swear to Fitzgerald—I cannot swear to the prisoner being one of them—no third man was arrested.</p>

I am managing clerk to Mr. George, an accountant at Moorgate Chambers, Finsbury Place—he is trustee to Goodwin's estate, which is in liquidation—the prisoner is a possession man, and had nothing to do with Goodwin's estate—he was often at my office, and was sometimes there alone—he had no right to meddle with the papers in Goodwin's case—I did not employ him to collect any money in Goodwin's estate from the persons who owed money—a list of the debtors had been made, and was placed on the table—he had an opportunity of seeing it—I missed it in July—I wrote to Parsons, Edgell, and Gibbs, asking them for the money—I received this paper from Mrs. Parsons.

Directed to Mr. George, and signed "Gibbs.") I never saw that letter enclosing the stamps, and never heard of their being sent—I did not authorise the prisoner to receive three shillings' Worth of stamps from Mr. Gibbs—he never accounted to me for them—this other receipt is in his writing: "<hi rend="italic">Re</hi> Goodwin, 11.7.78.

When I liquidated I received my immediate discharge from my creditors—if we had a meeting, and the prisoner was waiting for a job, I would ask him to assist me, but he was not paid for that work—he never did any work in preparing statements or answering, letters, or any employment as a clerk—he had no time for coming to the office—sometimes I did not see him for two or three days—he might turn up at 10 o'clock or at 1 o'clock—he stopped as long as it suited his own convenience, not ours—he never acted in the semblance of a clerk, except as I have spoken of—when</p>

I swear that the prisoner was noting an active part in the management of Carver's affairs, he did not manage the business that I am aware of—I did not consult him as to any arrangement between the debtor and the trustee—I did not beg him to impress upon Mr. Carver the necessity of meeting me at my office and bringing the amount of cash, the amount of which the prisoner himself knew—I cannot tell you whether I wrote to him: "Dear Sir,—I am sorry I could not go to Forest Gate on Saturday to meet Carver, you, and Lawrence, but the fact is, I was unavoidably detained in town till 8.30, and did not return till 11 o'clock." I very likely wrote: "I write Carver by this post to meet me on Tuesday, by 2 o'clock, when, if he brings a purchaser with, him with the necessary cash, the amount of which you know, I can then settle the purchase, "I very likely went on: "Please see him the first thing in the morning and impress upon him that to-morrow is the last day." I mean to say that that man was nothing but a possession man—I also wrote a postscript—no doubt I wrote to him in the matter of Hagar if you have got it there "Also impress upon Hagar that unless he gets the money to settle with the three creditors the case will fall through." I cannot remember the letters unless you show them to me—I wrote hundreds of letters—there is no pretence for saying that I owe the prisoner a salary as my clerk—I have not brought my diary or cash-book here or a draft statement of my affairs in Gale's liquidation—I had notice to produce them last night at my office in Finsbury Place, but they are at Leytonstone—I did not go there last night—I could have done so—the cash-book and diary are at my office—I was there this morning—there is no entry in my diary about the receipt of cash in Carver's case—it is not entered because it has not been given to us—the diary is not made up with reference to Carver's case—I have not been ordered for contempt of Court to pay over 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had received on an estate in my hands—Mr. Beard is here and he asked me some absurd question—if I had been ordered to pay 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

On 27th August, about 11 p.m., I was at 2, Seymour Street—Mr. Prowen came and went upstairs, knocked at the door, and asked for an explanation about what they had been saying to his wife—I did not hear him fall or hear any blow—the door was shut when I went up, and Papworth, Prince, and I burst it open, and found Mr. Prowen lying on the floor bleeding—the two prisoners were standing close by him; but I did not see the poker or tongs—Papworth and Prince brought Prowen down.</p>

Mason and Addley, the solicitors, last year, and on 9th or 10th January this year I called on the prisoner at Brookley Villas, Lewisham—I said "I have come to inquire what you have done with my 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also to know where the note of hand is"—my husband had given him the note of hand and the settlement—he said he would send a letter that night or next morning to exonerate my husband; and he did not know whether the note of hand was at Forest Hill or at another place—he did not reply to my question about the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we got this letter next day. (<hi rend="italic">This was from the defendant, declaring that he had no personal interest in the money</hi>.) I heard nothing more, and went the end of April, or early in May, and put the same three questions—he said he did not know whether the settlement was at Forest Hill or at the office, and he could not give up the note of hand as he was the trustee; he said "As to the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if I get well enough to go to work I will pay the money back"—I did not know at that time that he had had</p>

I don't know which; and he said "No"—I caught hold of him then and hauled him outside away from the crockery and pulled him up to a fishmonger's next door, and asked him to send for a policeman—he said he had nobody to send—I then saw the prisoner with the florin in his hand—he put it in his mouth—I caught him by the throat and said "My boy, you shall never swallow that"—we struggled, I threw him over my hip, and we both fell, and our heads and shoulders went over the side of the roadway off the kerb, and the florin fell out of his mouth on to the iron grating, and then slipped down the grooves between—I said "If you don't give me my 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I will choke you"—I meant 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. good money I had given him—he said that he would give it me if I would let him go—I let him get up, still holding him by the throat, and he gave me four six<lb/> pences—I then let him go, saying "It is a sin to let you go"—I had appealed to the people round to fetch a constable, and nobody would do it—a con<lb/> stable came up shortly after, and I went with him down Bermondsey and Rotherhithe to see if we could find him in any public-house—I showed the florin to the constable, and I have since lost it—I put it in an old till at home.</p>

Amy?" she said "Oh, don't bother, mother wishes to go to sleep," or "don't want to be annoyed," or something to that effect—they then left the room together—about 10 minutes afterwards Smithers came into my room and said "Where is Amy?"—I said "Gone upstairs, I suppose"—he left the room—I did not hear him go up, but in less than 10</p>

This is not my prosecution, I dare say I shall have to bear some share of the expense with Mr. Morgan—I have known William Cutler six or seven years—unfortunately there have been many transactions between us—I have never advanced money to any one besides Cutler—Mr. Parsons is a solicitor, who discounted Cutler's bill for me—the day after I received the hops I showed them to Mr. Morgan, to ascertain their value—I did not submit them to White and Morgan—I first</p>

I do not myself discount paper; I gene<lb/>rally get it done; I am not in the habit of discounting; if I want to get a bill of my own discounted I get it—I do not as a rule raise money for other persons on bills—Sir William Russell took my bills; I did not get any of his discounted—I should not think my transactions with Mr. Cutler during 12 months amounted to 7, 916<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I will not swear it—I have not had his cheques in blank to fill up for what I liked—I can't swear I never had such a thing; if I did I never made use of one; it was left with me by accident or posted to me for some purpose—I had cheques of his on his bankers, and he had cheques of mine on my bankers, and I used to use it for his convenience and possibly for mine—I don't think I placed a sample of these hops in the hands of Baker, White, and Morgan; I will not swear I did not—Mr. Morgan, the prosecutor's brother, told me that these hops were false, and not Day's of Morden, but that was not the result of any sample; they obtained the information and let me know it; that was a month after I had got them; I immediately went to, Mr. Morgan and told him what they said—I don't recollect the date—this letter to Mr. Morgan is my writing, and is dated 15th February (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—possibly I sent a copy of that to Cutler—I attended on every occasion when Mr. Morgan was before the Magistrate—the hops were ordered to be given back to me, and I sold them on a three months' acceptance for 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got poseession of them immediately on the close of the police proceedings—I don't know whether in all my transactions the cheques were those of William Cutler; Cutler Brothers very likely—I never had any pecuniary transaction with Henry.</p>

The charge was not for obtaining the hops from Morgan, but for disposing of them otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade. Where goods were sold at a great sacrifice there might be something to answer, but here the goods were sold at a profit. Further, the property which the section of the Act intended to cover must be "the property of the bankrupt divisible amongst his creditors." In this case no property passed at all. The forgery of the trade mark by Morgan prevented any property vesting in the Cutlers, and they did wrong in treating Morgan as a creditor</hi>.</p>

I live in Upper Greenwich Road, Bermond<lb/>sey—by direction of Mr. Scott, the landlord, in December, 1875, I went to 23, Snow's Fields, which had been let to a man named May in March, 1875—in November, 1875, May's name was erased and Day's name put there—I put the brokers in for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. rent—the shop was filled with dummies—I have seen other people go there at all hours of the day, but mostly in the evening—there was no sign of any real business—I told Day that I had brought a broker for the rent—he was lying on a bed on the floor, and I told him there was a policeman outside who had been looking and watching the house—he asked me to give him till the morrow, and he would see May and try to get the rent—I told the broker to leave a man in possession, which he did—I said, "You are all as one" (meaning May and Day and others were all connected)—he said May had</p>

"The John Street business was carried on by Humphreys and Houghton—Humphreys has been convicted—on one occasion I went to 21, John Street in February, 1876—I saw Day there and I spoke to Mary Robson, who has been convicted in this Court—I told Day on his entering the shop that a friend of mine had been defrauded in Wales of some pinks, and Day said that he had been defrauded also—I said "Give me your name and address and we will co-operate together to prosecute these fellows"—he said "I cannot do that"—I went away—I watched the shop during that day and night—I saw Day going backwards and forwards to the shop during the evening—when I took him into custody I alluded to the conversation at this inter<lb/>view—I said "Do you remember meeting me at John Street just before Humphreys was arrested when you represented that you had been defrauded?"—he said "I do not," and smiled.</p>

In June last I saw the prisoner at Dunquerque—I reported the matter, and extradition proceedings were taken, and a warrant was issued for his apprehension in France—I received him in my custody on 3rd August—I saw him in the prison, and in the presence of the French police I told him who I was, and said, "I understand that a warrant has been granted against you, and your ex<lb/>tradition has been granted by the Government. You will be charged with stealing and receiving 1160 yards of silk, the property of Mr. Spiers, of the Borough. I believe you are the person who was indicted with Allen and the two Harrises last year, and you absconded"—he said "Yes, I did abscond; the indictment was found against me, and I had the silk. I bought the silk from Allen. There was a man named Mordecai very much mixed up in the matter, and I think he ought to be arrested"—I said "I may tell you that Mordecai is arrested, and is now in custody at the Southwark Police-court"—he said he was very glad to hear that, and "I am very sorry now that I ran away; I suppose I must have been a fool"—he said Mordecai introduced Allen to him—on the vessel on the journey he said, "I wish to have a conversation with you about my case"—I said "Very well, as you please"—he said "I am not a German, as has been stated; I am a Dane; I used to keep a boarding-house in St. George's-in-the-East, and I bought that silk of a man. I think I paid him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard. I think Kimber has the receipt. I never knew that it had actually been stolen, but I knew that it was the property of Mr. Spiers.

                  </hi>. I am a gardener for Mr. James Smith, of Denmark Hill—on Friday, 9th August, a little after 4 a.m. I was going to my work—I have the key of the mews at the back, which runs into the main road—when I went into the mews I saw two men behind the gate—I asked them what business they had there—they said they had been out for a lark in the night—I told them to come out—they went down Denmark Hill towords Cold Harbour Lane—a policeman followed them—there is no outlet at the back of Mr. Astle's garden—any one getting there from the mews would have to cross a field and get over several field gates—the shorter man was lame—the other had tight canvas shoes on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot maker of 15, Leicester Street, Leicester Square—on Saturday, May 4th, between 12 and 1 p.m., I was in Lock's Fields alone, and saw the prisoner smoking a short pipe—I asked him the way to Sarah Ann Street—he said "I will show you"—he stopped a moment and then followed me, and pointed out where I was to turn—he said "That is the street," and turned round and took hold of my watchguard, broke the watch off, and ran away—I halloed "Thief," but every one appeared to be at dinner—I next saw him at Lock's Fields about two months after I suppose—he was placed with six or seven men—I could identify him from a thousand at once—I had described him to the police as well as I could, and gave the number of my watch, which I have never seen since.</p>

I live at 120, Ackerman Road, Brixton—was walking along Newington Butts, going home, at about 12.45 a.m., on 31st July, when I met the prisoners and another man—Dunford asked me for a light—I gave him my fusee-case, and noticed his hands down in front of me—I then saw my silver watch in his hand, which was safe in my waistcoat, with a chain, a few minutes before—I made a grasp at it, and Kemp forced his way between us and forced him out of my grasp—I am quite sure Kemp is the man—Dunford got away—I don't know what became of the watch; this is the chain—I tried to run after them, and Kemp got behind me and tripped me up—I could see him over my left shoulder—I lost sight of the men—I got up—Dunford went in the direction of St. George's Road, and I went through Short Street into Walworth Road and met a constable about 25 yards from where it occurred—while speaking to him Kemp came up, and another man, from the direction of Short Street, away from the place where the robbery was committed—I don't know who the other man was, he ran away—my attention was drawn to Kemp—I gave him in charge; I have not the slightest doubt as to his identity.</p>
