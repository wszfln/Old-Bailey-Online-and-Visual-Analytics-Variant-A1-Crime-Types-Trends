             depos'd, That he going by about half an Hour after Ware, the former Evidence, a Woman sat about fourteen or fifteen Yards from the Road, and she call'd out, Waggoner, Waggoner, have me to Brentford. James Bothune, the Surgeon, depos'd, That upon viewing the Body of Anne Bristol, her left Eye was black, as if she had receiv'd a Blow with the Fist. And also, her Elbow was broken, and her Wrists, one Knee, and both her Ancles, were hurt. She had a Scratch upon her Thigh, two Inches and a half long, and a Contusion, like a Blow, on her Breast. Upon opening her he found her first five Ribs broke, and bent out wards towards the Thorax, and a Pint of Coagulated Blood in the Thorax. Her fourth Rib was broke in the vertebra of the Back, and the End had pressed the Pleura, and the Lungs. And being ask'd, How he thought this might be done he said it might be done by stamping upon, or some such Violence, but could not believe that it was by the Wheel of a Waggon, because, if it had run over her Stomach it would not have broken so many of her Ribs, and there would have been the Impression of the Wheel; and if a loaded Waggon, it must have broke her to Pieces almost, whereas there was no outward manifest Signs of any such Accident. And if a Waggon had run over her Breast length ways, it must also have broken the Collar Bone, which was whole, and in no part of the Body so much as the Scarf Skin broke. That if it had been done by the Stamping of an Horse on her Breast, where her Clothes were not, he was of Opinion, there would have been some sign of the Nails. And that her Pudenda were of a livid unnatural Colour.

            </rs>. The Prosecutor depos'd, That the Shutter of a back Parlor was bored, and cut, and a Bar taken out, and the Goods stolen. That the Prisoner had borrowed a Gimblet about a Week before, which he did believe to be the same which he found near the Wall, where, whoever did the Robbery, came over. When the Fact was done it was wet Weather, and there were Footsteps in the Dirt. That a Stick was found that Morning in the Yard, which he affirm'd he had several Times seen in Patrick Clifford's Hands. Mrs.Harrold depos'd, his Wife came in while he was drinking at her House, and said, That she had maintained him several Years, and if she left him but one Week he would come to be hang'd. Joseph Watson was his Companion. Another Evidence depos'd, his reputed Wife goes out at Night, and he does nothing but drink all Day, and keeps a disorderly House, and the next Morning Watson asked him for something, and he said he had spent eight Pence Half Penny; upon that Watson reply'd, What, must I have nothing of the Booty you have got? Another Evidence depos'd, as they were carrying them to Prison, in the Coach, Clifford said, I wish we had committed the Robbery Yesterday, then I had been far enough out of Town, and then they might catch me if they could. Another Evidence depos'd, That between twelve and one a Clock in the Morning the Robbery was commited, he saw Clifford and another come from the back Yard, which was the Way the House was  when the Robbery was committed. Mr. Robinson the Beadle gave Clifford the Character of keeping the worst House in ten Parishes, in harbouring all manner of ill People. That he had taken out many Children that he us'd to no entertain and encourage in ill Practices. Clifford call'd some to his Reputation, who depos'd he had been a Soldier, but was discharged for being an Irish Man, but they could say nothing as to his way at living since.

But he having before acquainted his Friends, his Father, and some others, dogg'd them, came and seiz'd the Prisoner. The Father of the Lad, and another, confirm'd the latter part of the Evidence, that having had Information of the preceeding Attempt, and of the Appointment, he did, with one or two more, dog the Prisoner and his Son, and at the Place mentioned came upon him on a sudden, and apprehended him, but probably a little too soon. The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, and his ever having seen Nicholas Burgess before that Night that he was apprehended; and also, that he had been guilty of any Indecencies with him. The Court were of Opinion, that the Evidence against the Prisoner was not strong enough to prove the Assault and Intention of committing Sodomy with the Prosecutor; yet, that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172304240006"/> Obscenities he had sworn, and what the other Evidences had deposed of the Lad's having given Information of the appointed Meeting, and their having apprehended him at the Place according, as it seemed, to that Appointment, were strong Circumstances of the Truth of the Evidence.

               defrauding the said Thomas Gravestock of the Goods mentioned in the Indictment
            </rs>. The Prosecutor deposed, That the Prisoner came to his Shop on the 24th of September last in a very handsome Mourning Chariot, with a Footman behind it, and wanted a Sort of Lace called Spanish Point, for trimming for a Suit of Clothes; but that being a Sort that they did not usually keep by them, he was to get it made for him. However, he fixed upon a parcel of Goods for present Use, those mentioned in the Indictment, which were carried home to his Lodgings in Queen's Square, by the Name of Marmaduke Davenport, Esq; That then the Prisoner wanted a great deal more, as much as would trim five Liveries, but could not then tell the Quantity, till he had seen his Tailor. Whereupon he was to go again to his Lodgings, and on the 27th went, and as he was going along saw the Prisoner talking very familiarly with Mr. Hinchley the Mercer. That he went on to his Lodgings, whither the Prisoner soon after came, and among other Discourse, talk'd of gold Equipages, and show'd him one which he was to make a Present of to a Lady, and opening a Drawer, pull'd out a Paper, which had Silver Lace, and Silver Shoulder Knots; the Quantities were so large, that the Liveries would have been as rich as the Duke of Newcastle's. That he was to furnish him with these Things and then to bring in his Bill, but the next Day he was gone off. Mr. Markham deposed, the Prisoner came to his Shop, and fixed upon a handsome gold Equipage for a Lady, value 50 l. which he desired him to carry to his Lodgings. That when he came there the Prisoner asked him to drink Tea with him, which he did; and as they were drinking the Prisoner told him, he wanted several other Things, as a gold Watch Chain, &amp;c. and he having there a Squirrel with a Silver Chain and Lock, he spoke to him for a Gold one; which Things, when he had furnished him with, then he was to be paid. That he observing the Collar, found it was one he had about six Months before sold to a Lady. He admiring at that; and being desirous to know something of his Character before he trusted him farther, went to the Lady, and enquir'd the Character of Marmaduke Davenport, Esq; But the Lady could not recollect that she knew any such Person. Upon which he told her it was very strange, since he had seen in his Lodgings the Collar for a Squirrel which he had sold her. He then describing the Prisoner's Person, she knew him, and said his Name was Alexander Day, and that he was one of the greatest Bites and Sharpers of the Town. Whereupon he presently got Officers and arrested him, and got his gold Equipage again.

             deposed; That the Prisoner's Man came to him to enquire for a pair of good Horses; he show'd him a pair, and he brought the Prisoner to see them, who liked them, and asked the Price, which he having told him, he said it was reasonable enough. Then desir'd that he would furnish him with a good Coachman, he having left his at his Country-seat; would have a lusty Man, that his Coachman's Livery might fit him: He procur'd him a lusty Coachman, on whom his Livery being try'd, was something too little; upon which the Esquire pausing a little said, Well, I will send for my own Coachman out of the country; but his Man Lewis saying they might be let out for a small Matter, he approv'd the Motion, it was done, and having procur'd the Chariot, he had the Coachman and Horses. That the first Day he went out, thinking he should guess something of him that Way, enquir'd of the Coachman at Night what Visits he made; that he told him first to the Duke of Montague's, then to Hannover-Square, to Mr. Law's, then to a Coffee-house in Covent Garden, &amp;c. Upon which he thought it was pretty well, and he was satisfied. But after he had had the Horses about nine Days, he bid the Coachman drive to a Tavern in Red Lion Square; he went into the Tavern, call'd for half a Pint of Mountain, drank it up, told the People there were some Gentlemen appointed to sup there that Night, and he would be there again presently; and going out at the other Door, and leaving his Wine unpaid for, went away, and left the Chariot and Horses, which having waited some time, and no Esquire coming, the Coachman brought home, and he heard no more of him till his being apprehended. That soon after the Owner of the Chariot came, and demanded it, and had it again.</p>

               defrauding <rs id="t17230424-43-viclabel220" type="occupation">Mr</rs> Hinchliff , and Partner, of the Goods before-mentioned
            </rs>. It appear'd by the Evidence, That the Prisoner came in his Chariot to Mr. Hinchliffs, and he not being at Home, he left Word for Mr. Hinchliff to come to his Lodgings, by the Name of Marmaduke Davenport, in Queen's Square, which he did, and found the Chariot standing at the Door, and enquiring of his Landlady, was told he was a Yorkshire Gentleman. That being introduced to the Esquire by his Man, after some Discourse of Packs of Dogs, and other insignificant Affairs, the Esquire fell seriously upon the grand Affair, and desire'd that he would send him such and such rich Silks to his Lodgings, that he might see them. But Mr. Hinchliff telling him he might see more Choice in his Shop, he consented to go, and took Mr. Hinchliff with him in his Chariot; talking by the Way of Sir Marmaduke, and several other Persons of Consideration, and that he was going to be marry'd to a Daughter of Counsellor Ward's. That he was going to furnish a House in Town, and should want considerable Quantities of Goods he deals in, and being come to the Shop, fix'd upon the Goods mentioned in the Indictment, and took them home with him in his Chariot, having look'd upon rich Damasks for Bedding, Hangings, &amp;c. to the Value of near 1000 l. That Mr. Hinchliff telling the Esquire, That Ladies us'd to be thought the most capable of chusing such Things, be enquir'd if he had no Lady of his Acquaintance to assist him. To which he reply'd, Yes, the Lady Davenport his Kinswoman, and desir'd the Silks might be sent to his Lodgings, and he would get her there to view them. That then he (Mr. Hinchliff) being desirous to have some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172304240008"/> Satisfaction concerning the Esquire, sent an Excuse for the Delay, while he sent to enquire at Counsellor Ward's; but was inform'd, that the Counsellor had no Daughter going to be married, but that one Daughter had indeed already been married to one Mr. Davenport (into whose Acquaintance he afterwards found the Prisoner had insinuated himself, accidentally meeting him at a Coffee House, and prevailed upon to call him Cousin, telling him, their Coats of Arms were both the same). This Account prevented him from sending the other great Quantity of Goods, and going to look after him about the former Parcel, he was elop'd, and he could hear no more of him, till he was taken up at Clapham, on Suspicion of robbing the Bristol Mail. The Prisoner, in his Defence, pleaded he did not steal the said Goods, but bought them fairly for his present Occasions, designing honestly to pay for them, which he should have done, had they not disappointed him; alledging, he had an Estate of 200 l. per Annum, in the County of Durham, mortgag'd for 1200 l. but not proving any thing of it, nor giving any Account of himself, nor willing one Witness to his Reputation, the Jury not believing the Honesty of his Intention in all these Affairs, tho' they <rs id="t17230424-43-verdict221" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Just published (neatly printed in a Packet Volume) the 8th Edition (above 12,000 of the former Editions having been sold) of</p>
               <p>ONANIA; or, The heinous Sin of Self-pollution, and all its frightful Consequences, in both Sexes, considered, with Spiritual and Physical Advice to those, who have already injur'd themselves by this abominable Practice. To which are added, divers remarkable Letters from such offenders, to the Author, lamenting their Impotencies and Diseases thereby, as also Letters from eminent Divines, in answer to a Case of Conscience relating theseto; as like wise a Letter from a Lady (very curious) and another from a married Man, concerning the Use and Abuse of the Marriage Bed, with the Author's Answers, manifesting (from Scripture) that a married Couple may commit Whoredom between themselves; as also his Answers, as promised in the 6th Edition, to the Letters of C. T. and Philalethes, urging the Necessity of Self-pollution; and another surprizing Letter from a young married Lady, who by this detectable Practice, become barren and diseased; and two astonishing Cases, in a Letter from a Clergyman, of a young Man and a young Woman, who to his own Knowledge, had so abused themselves thereby, that they died; and three curious Casuistical Letters on that Subject, since, one signed Will. Smith, and another N. Pedigogus, and their Answers, and an Answer to a Letter, subscribed Dives, concerning his Son's Fornication, and Adultery, and of Impotency, by Self-pollution in Men, and Barreness, and other the strange Effects of that Practice in Women, hardly ever till now taken Notice of; with seasonable Admonitions to the Youth of the Nation (of both Sexes) and those whose Tuition they are under, whether Parents, Guardians, Masters, or Mistresses. A very grave and learned Divine and Physician, having perused this Edition before it went to the Press, return'd it with his Opinion of it in these Words, This little Book ought to be read by all Sorts of People, of both Sexes, of what Age, Degree, Profession, or Condition soever, Guilty or not Guilty of the Sin declaimed against in it.
