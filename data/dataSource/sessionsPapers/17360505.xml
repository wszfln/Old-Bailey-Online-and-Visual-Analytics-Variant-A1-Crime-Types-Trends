            . The Time mentioned in the Indictment, my Servant and I were at Work in the Bake-house; I sent him into the Yard for something, and hearing him cry out, I took up a long Pole and ran to the Door; this was about two o'Clock in the Morning; I had no sooner got to the Door, but a Man fired a Pistol at me, and wounded me in my Arm and Breast. A Second fir'd and wounded me in the Face, and beat me backwards. Then I saw three Persons, they took me in their Arms, unbottoned my Breeches, took out my Money, and laid me down; they brought my Man into the Bake-house, tied his Handkerchief over his Eyes, his Hands behind him, and sat him down by me. The Prisoner stood over me, swearing with horrid Oaths, if I spoke a Word, he would blow my Brains out, while the others got Candles and robb'd the House. They took many more Things than are mentioned in the Indictment; all that I had that was Valuable they took with them. The Prisoner was taken at Bridgewater in Somersetshire, and made a Confession before the Mayor and Alderman. One of the Rogues had been my Servant, and, I suppose, he was the Director in the Affair; the Prisoner I am positive was the Man that stood over me; I can't say whether they broke any Lock to get in; I believe they got over the Wall that is next the Fields, but they broke several Locks in the House to get the Goods.</p>

I had occasion to go into the Yard for the Scovel to sweep the Oven, and which hung on the back of an Oven facing the Bake-house: As soon as I had laid hold on the Scovel, I heard a Noise, and turning about, I saw 4 or 5 Men, I am not positive to the Number, for I was much surprised: They rush'd upon me, and knocked me down, and silenced me, by threatning to blow<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173605050004"/> my Brains out, they put a Sword to my Throat, and held Pistols to my Breast. I heard two Pistols discharged at my Master, and heard him cry out. Some time afterwards they took me in Doors.</p>

I sent for the Owner, and went into Turnimill street, to enquire for this Mrs. Warren, Somebody in the House told me she was a Bed; but seeing Hadley, I told her, she was the Woman I wanted: She went up to put on her Stays, and found Means to get to a Brandy shop next Door, whence we took her to Justice Robe's, and she told us where we might find the other Woman. <rs id="t17360505-10-verdict59" type="verdictDescription">

I seiz'd him, and tore his Cloaths; if they had held, I should have got my Watch again; but I saw him put his Hand behind him, and give it to another Man, and his Cloaths rent while he was doing it; I took care of the Prisoner, but the other Man, that receiv'd the Watch from him, got off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask how far distant I was from him, when he took hold of me?</p>
               <p>Morris. The very instant I felt him, I took hold of him, and never parted with him 'till I had brought him before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him why he did not secure the Man I gave the Watch to?</p>
               <p>Morris. It was impossible to secure him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173605050006"/> without losing the Man that took it. I lost the use of this Arm, by pulling and haling among them.</p>

I told my Neighbours of my Loss, and Mr. Pierce inform'd me he had seen a Pair of double-channell'd Pumps sold with the Name Wright in the Inside. I knew they were mine by that, for I made them for a Gentleman of that Name.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there a Door out of your shop into the House?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, my Shop is made intire to myself, and I have no Door but that next the Street, nor any Door into the House.</p>

I saw no Provocation given, for she was darning a Stocking, and he struck her in the Face with his Hands and Feet, and stamped upon her right Side, so violently, that there was a great deal of Blood came out of her Nose. On the Tuesday he beat her again, and stamped upon her in the Entry, drag'd her out of the Brandy-shop, stamp'd upon her again, and she cried out, Dear, God, save my Life, he has killed me!</p>

               <p>On Wednesday I saw the Deceased, and said Katey, how came you to be so used? and she told me, that he came up again at two a-Clock and whipt her so violently, that the Scourges were on her Face when the Coroner sat on her Body. I saw her when she was dying on Saturday Night a Quarter before 9, and she died a quarter of an Hour before 10. She sent

I do believe she might be a little out of her Senses between whiles, because she told me, my Husband lay across the Feet of the Bed, and he was not there. and talk'd of a Child burning in the Fire.</p>

               <p>Smith. From two a-Clock to 8 a-Clock on Monday, I saw him beat her several Times in the Brandy-shop; then she went in, there he locked her in and beat her, and she cried out, Help! Murder!</p>

            . I was coming by on Monday, and I went in for a Farthing's worth of small Beer; and while I was there, the Prisoner came in and tapp'd her in the Face; she said Will, don't beat me, and then he gave her a Punch in the Eye: I believe the Blow might do her a Prejudice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the tap in the Face given with Violence?</p>
               <p>Whitehead. I can't say that; but a Man's Hand is heavy, I can tell that my self. Then he said, Kate come go to bed; says I, do Kate, go up with him, and the Woman in the Shop, said fye upon you, to stand by and see a Woman beat; why says I; if we say any Thing he'll beat us. She went up with him, and the next Morning she told me she was kill'd Will. Stevens had kill'd her; he had laid her down and trampled upon her. On Saturday I heard she was dead, and was so surpriz'd that I have never been myself since. I saw her after she had been dead about an Hour; when she was laid out, and after Mr. Coldham had opened her; her Side very black and bruised, but I cannot tell which Side, and there was a Plaister on it, other Parts of her Body was much bruised, and her poor Eye sunk in her head.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I ask if you never heard of her falling down Stairs drunk?</p>

            . I went up Stairs on Friday to see the poor Creature, and ask'd her if I should do any Thing for her; she desired me to get her half a Pint of Beer. I did, and made it hot, with Sugar and Nutmeg: I am afraid said I, that the Fellow has murdered you Mrs. Thomas. Says she. I am not long for this World, then the World will see this, when I am dead; and on Saturday she died. I was there when she was dead, and pull'd the Plaister off her Side, and there was not a free Place from the Crown of her Head to the Sole of her Feet, all black as a Shoe, and the Stripes in her Fore-head were as big as my little Finger; both Sides were black, but the right side was blackest. About a Month before, I saw her Arms whaled as thick as a Cane; I have seen him beat her so, that I thought no Christian Creature could have lived. About half an Hour before she died, I says to her, Katey, do you want any Thing? Will Stevens was hanging over her, and he said you want something under your Head; and he put her Petticoat behind her Head; there is no Occasion for it now, says she. I saw her after she was dead, and never saw the Fellow of her in my life.</p>

            . I was coming through the Play-house Passage on Saturday Night, and the Prisoner was standing there. I asked him how she did; he said very bad, and told me I might go up to see her. Jenny Hill was with her; her hands were very cold and she in a clammy Sweat. She told me she was very bad, and that she had desired Stevens to get her some Small-beer; but he not coming, I made her half a Pint of Sage Tea. The Woman in the Room help'd me to get her up, and we made her Bed, and aired her Sheets, and got her to Bed again, for she told us she was very faint. When she was got to bed, she put her Hands round my Wast, gritted her Teeth, and with a very low Voice, said he had killed her. After she was dead, I saw a Plaister on her Right-side, and her Body was all over Bruises. I believe she was now and then not in her Senses, for she told me, that Jenny Hall had bepissed her self, and talked of a Child burning. She died with her Head in my Bosom.</p>

I said, Kitty, be persuaded and go home: if I go home, says she, he will murder me. On Tuesday she came again, and said, Will. had beat her with a Broom stick, which he made her fetch out of the Closet, and broke her Arm, and put out her Finger. I said you are a Fool to live with him, you are not married to him; Aye, says she, it is fine talking, if I should go home to my Fathers, he will get me away again; he has threatned to murder me, but he need not do any thing more, he has done enough already.

            . On Monday Morning she was waiting in my Shop for Stevens; when he came in, she desired him to go to bed, for he had been up all Night: He bid her get up Stairs, and gave her some Blows, not very unmercifull, about the Head, but she got a black Eye: I told him, if he must abuse the Woman, he must take her up Stairs. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173605050011"/> saw no more Blows, nor did I hear her cry out; they went up Stairs together. On Tuesday Morning, she had two Strokes on the Forehead, and a black Eye. I had been ill, and the Deceased looked after me. (Dr. Coldham was my Surgeon,) and I was afraid he had beat her for being with me; but she told me no, Griffiths, I wont belie him, he is not against my doing good to any one. The next Day she fell before the Fire, and told me her Pains were too great to bear. I asked her what occasioned her Pains; and she told me, they who laid her out would see how she had been used by him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Coldham. About the latter end of March, the Church Wardens of Covent Garden Parish sent to me, to desire me to open the Deceased. I viewed the Body, and saw several Bruises on her Arms and Sides; I cut into them, and found they went no farther than the Fat, so they could not be mortal. On opening the Body, I found both the Lobes of the Lungs adhered to the Breast, and in the right Lobe was formed a large Ulcer, with a Collection of Matter; the Liver was of a parboil'd Complection, and larger than ordinary, the Stomach much diminished, and the Tone entirely lost. I believe the Occasion of her Death was from a Complication of Disorders occasioned by irregular living.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hicks. I assisted Mr. Coldham, and am of the same Opinion.</p>
               <p>Jane Hill. I was with her two Days before she died, and never heard her complain; she was never easy when he was away from her.</p>

The Prisoner brought these two Spoons to pawn; I seeing a Crest upon them, stopt them: He told me they were his own, but afterwards he said they belonged to a Counsellor in the Temple. I went with him to his Lodgings in (Bennet's Court, Drury-Lane) and the Woman of the House telling me he was a Gentleman and a Man of Credit, I lent a Guinea upon them. The next Morning we had a Bill from Gold-smith's-Hall, and I went immediately and took the Prisoner in his Lodgings; he offered me the Money again and a Crown for my Trouble, if I would not prosecute him. Several Persons appeared<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173605050013"/> to his Character, but the Fact being clear, the Jury found him <rs id="t17360505-53-verdict262" type="verdictDescription">

            . I cheapened the Horses of Talton; he asked me 7 Guineas for the Colt, and 3 Guineas for the Horse, at the Blazing-Star, Feb. 26. I am positive they are the same Horses that Page owne'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knight. The Horses being lost from Penn, I had a Letter from Page to advertise them. I printed 500 Bills, and distributed them in Smithfield and proper Placs, and presently I receiv'd Notice that the old Horse had been put up at the Blazing-Star. I went and view'd him, and made Oath before a Justice, that I believed the Horse was the same that Page had lost. After this I had Information that the Colt was in the Pound at Shoreditch, and the Man that keeps the Pound brought him to me; for I had offer'd half a Guinea for one, and a Guinea for the other. I did not see either of the Horses at the Blazing-Star; the old Horse I saw at the Man's House who bought him, next Door but one to the Blazing-Star. Having been inform'd who he had the Horse of, I took one of the Witnesses with me, and went to New-Prison to see him, for he was sent there, for stealing the Countess of Harold's Turkeys: I found he was to be carried down to Justice Chandler about this Affair. I went to the Justice's, and gave him an Account of the Horses; while I was there, Talton was brought before him, and while he was under Examination, Bully, the other Prisoner was taken. Talton made a Confession before the Justice; and after it had been read to him, I saw him sign it.</p>

I saw him clap three Lustring ones under his Coat, he had two great Coats on, besides his Wastcoat: upon that I ask'd him what he had got under his Coat; why, says he, do you think I would steal any thing? I don't know, says I, and reaching over the Computer, I unbuttoned his Coat, and down dropt the Handkerchiefs: His Companion immediately took them up, and threw them in my Face, and then they both ran into the Street.</p>

            . Thursday Night, March 4. as I was sitting by my Fire-side, I heard an out-cry of Murder, stop Thief; I live in Angel-Alley, Bishopsgate-street: On hearing the Noise, I ran down Stairs, and saw a Woman had hold of

Mr. Caddet, (a Neighbour) came to assist me: Ellard would get in between Freeman and me: Says Freeman, you take hold of the Bundle; then Ellard took the Bundle, and I tript up Freeman's Heels, but he sprung up again, and away he ran: Ellard ran too, but Caddet pursued and took him with the Bundle. With much Trouble I got it from him, delivered it to my Wife, and went back to assist my Neighbour. We carried him to the Constable; Freeman made his Escape, but was taken that Day Week, and brought to me: I knew him perfectly. This is the Linnen, that was first taken on Freeman, and afterwards on Ellard.</p>

Bean made an Offer to put her Hand into my Breech, but I bid her stand off; then Mary Barnes and I sat down on the Bed, and leaning on my Shoulder, she pulled a little down towards the Bed, while Susan Bean put her Hand into my Right-hand Pocket and took 11 Guineas and an half. I missed it as soon as ever I rose from the Bed; Bean ran down Stairs, and Barnes said she had none of the Money, 'twas Bean had it. I believe they were Confederates, for when I got off the Bed they were both standing together: Barnes went away, but the Watchman took her: When Bean was taken, she pulled the Money out of her Shoe.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not left your Spectacles at Home?</p>
               <p>Gainham. No, I have them in my Hand, (reads) Arabella Fast, of St. Olave's Hart-street, Spinster, Aug. 27. 1733. When I marry at any House, I always set it down, for I carry one of the Books in my Pocket, and when I go Home, I put it in my great Book: I entered this Marriage, the very same Minute the Ceremony was perform'd.</p>
               <p>Q Do you never make any Alteration?</p>
               <p>Gainham. Never, my Lord. These two were married at Mrs. Ball's, at the Hand and Pen by the Fleet Prison, and my Name is to her Book.</p>
               <p>Counc. Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Gainham. No, I have married a great many since that Time: I know nothing of him but by his Name.</p>
               <p>Counc. Do you know whether you married him at all?</p>
               <p>Gainham. Yes, it was up one pair of Stairs forwards, and the Ceremony of the Church of England was made use of, and all of it.</p>
               <p>Counc. 'Tis strange you should not remember him.</p>
               <p>Gainham. Can I remember Persons? I have married 2000 since that Time.</p>

            . The Prisoner about two Years ago took a Room in my House for him and his Wife at 2 s. a Week; her Name was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173605050019"/> Arabella: He own'd her for his Wife, and they eat and drank and lay together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What did she say to you when she had been there about a Fortnight?</p>
               <p>Marshal. She said she was ruined and undone, and that she was not married then; but afterwards she was married.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she was married afterwards?</p>
               <p>Marshal. Why the Minister has prov'd it now.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the Year did they come to your House?</p>
               <p>Marshal. I don't know directly; but I remember it was Nut time, for he came in cracking Nuts. They had been about a Week in my House When she made this Declaration; indeed she never told me afterwards that she was married.</p>
               <p>Council. Did any Body visit her while she liv'd in your House?</p>
               <p>Marshal. No, nobody; she sent a Letter into the Country for her Uncle to come to Town, they both call'd him Uncle, about a Fortnight after she came to my House; the Gentleman came to Town one Day about 12 o'Clock at noon, and sent for Arabella to a Coffee-house; she brought her Uncle home and carried him up Stairs to her Chamber, and he desired to lie one Night there; and I said, Arabella, if you will lye with a single Woman, your Uncle may lie in your Chamber, whereof I put a clean Pillowbeer on Her Uncle was a little in drink, so she went up and put him to bed: At past 10 o'Clock her Husband came home, and up Stairs he goes, and unlocks the Door to go to bed, and he calls up Mr. Marshal; bear witness, says he, here's a Man in bed with my Wife.</p>
               <p>Council. Was this after she declared she was not married or before?</p>
               <p>Marshal. After the Declaration.</p>
               <p>Council. What Profession was this Uncle of?</p>
               <p>Marshal. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was a Parson.</p>
               <p>Marshal. He had dark Gray Clothes on; but he had no Rose in his Hat.</p>

            . Arabella was at my House a Year and an half; she went away the 29th of January was 12 Months, and came again in September, and staid till Jan. The Prisoner came several Times to see her while she was at my House, and once when we had a Pot of Beer. I drank to his Wife's well doing; which of my Wives says he? Why Arabella; the other was my first Wife, says he? Arabella was by, but I cannot remember what she said to that: He came to her about half a Dozen Times and not more. One Mrs. Savage in Mark Lane paid me for her Lodging, and Board. The latter Part of the Time she was with me, she was sick, and was to go into the Hospital; I asked him (the Prisoner) who was to be at the Charge of it? he would he said, if I would pay the Money, for he would not be blown for the World. She always declared she was marry'd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What did I say to you, when I call'd you into the Kitchen?</p>
               <p>Shanks. I said, I understand you are married to Arabella Fast.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. And I said, Madam, I am not, I deny it: Did not Arabella tell you that she said any thing when she was drunk?</p>
               <p>Shanks. The Occasion of her tippling, if I must out with it, was your using her so hard: He did say that he was not married to her in her Hearing, and I do not remember that she said any Thing at all to it.</p>
               <p>Rush Lewington. He fetched his Wife Arabella, from my House, to the best of my Remembrance) six Weeks a Saturday last: I thought she was his Wife, only by the Carriage between them. She told me, he was come to fetch her away, and she look'd up her Things: You are very well equipt, says he; to go to Service; this is the last Thing that I will do for you: Says I, can a Man promise that any thing will be the last he shall do for his Wife? Come, come, says he, I want no Documenting.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord! I will begin the whole Story.</p>
               <p>C. You need not give us the whole of your Life and Conversation.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In the Beginning of this Affair with Fast, I lived at the Bull in Spratt Bottom, and had about 40 or 50 l. This Arabella Fast used frequently to come to the House: We soon became acquainted, and she told me, she had something to offer me; if I was in my own Interest, I would embrace it: There is, says she, a Minister, (naming his Name) who often lies with me, and if you'll say you are my Husband, we may get some Money out of him, I thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173605050020"/> 'twould be no more Harm in me to say the Words, than for him to do the Deed; so I came up to London to take a Room for her as my Wife: I brought in this Arabella, and lay with her myself; and while I was in Town, willing to be getting something, I got employed at the Three Artichoaks. Within a Fortnight after our coming to Town, she told me the Parson was come to London, and now was the Time to make him our Prize: Come into our Room, says she, about 10 o'Clock at Night. I did, and found Arabella and he abed. Hey! says I, how came you to be abed with my Spouse, and I called up Mr. Marshal to bear Witness. Sir, says he, I only lay with her to keep my Back warm: O Sir, says I, if she has kept your Back warm, you have kept her Belly warm: However, the Gentleman lay with her all Night, and in the Morning he asked for the Certificate of our Marriage: I must make you a Present, says he, if you can produce a Certificate. I knew not what to say, Guilty Conscience needs no Accuser. Sir, says Arabella, we were married at the Fleet; and, says she to me, for a Crown, I can get a Certificate from thence. I gave her a Crown, and in half an Hour she brings me a Certificate. I can call People to my Character.</p>
               <p>C. You are not called upon here as a Thief: If you call any Persons to speak to your Chastity and Continency, that you have done your self.</p>

            : I was born in Wales and came to London in February last. On the 20th of that Month, I met Williams and I asked him to help me to a Place; he said if I would go with him he would: As we went along be pick'd up a Shilling, which he said he would spend, and I should have part of it: Meeting Bradford, he went with us to a Tavern: Bradford pulled out Money, and they went to Cards, and Williams won. Then he would have me go his halves, which I did, 'till they got every Farthing of my Money. Then Bradford went away, and Williams said he would help me to a Place; I mistrusted they had cheated me. and as I went along, I told Williams I would have him before a Justice; we went to a Gin-shop, and he gave me a Knock on the Breast and ran away; I ran after him, he was taken, and a Constable sent for; and as we were going before the Justice, I saw Bradford in the Street, and took him too, and the Justice committed them both.</p>

               <p>HENRY JUSTICE, hold up your Hand.</p>
               <p>Justice. My Lord, 'Tis my Misfortune to be very Deaf, I beg I may be permitted to come nearer to your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Clerk of Arr. Can't you hear there?</p>
               <p>Justice. I am very Deaf, and have a wretched Cold, which has stuck by me all the Winter: (Then he was permitted to come to the Inner Bar) I hope I shall be allow'd the Liberty of Pen and Ink; and as there have been many Books seized at my Chambers, which can be proved not to belong to Trinity College, I hope your Lordship will order them to be restored me.</p>
               <p>Then the Indictment was read.</p>
               <p>Justice. My Lord, I observe in this Indictment, here is mentioned a much less Number of Books, than was taken from my Chambers; therefore, I hope, those that are not mentioned in the Indictment, may be restored me; or else they may bring another Indictment for the rest; and those that are in the Indictment I must abide by.</p>
               <p>He pleaded Not guilty.</p>

               <p>Wilson. 'Tis all that is in the Indictment.</p>
               <p>Justice. Read the whole Title of the Book: Is it in the Indictment?</p>

               <p>C. K. 'Tis so in the Charter. 'Tis not necessary to set forth every Thing that is mentioned in the Title Page; for the Description of the Book and the Title Page, are two different Things. The Title is set forth, tho' what giveth an Account of the Contents of the Book be omitted.</p>
               <p>Wilson. The next is intituled, Literarum quibus invictissimus Princeps Henricus Octavus Rex Angliae et Franciae, Dns Hiberniae ac Fidei Defensor, respondit ad quandam Epistolam Martini Lutheri ad se missam, et ipsius Lutheranae quoq; Epistolae Exemplum, value 5 s. in the Indictment.</p>

               <p>C. K. 'Tis not material, tho' there be a Contraction in one Place, and the whole Word be set forth in another.</p>
               <p>C. K. What was the Value of the first Book?</p>
               <p>Wilson. 'Tis a curious scarce Book, that Gildas; it has, I know, been sold for 10 s. a curious Man would give more: I value this at a Crown.</p>
               <p>C. K. What is the Worth of Luther?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Half a Crown.</p>

               <p>C. K. Make some Allowance, if there be a Leaf wanting.</p>

               <p>. If they were in the Library bound up together, and have afterwards been separated, they may be said to be one Book, containing four Tracts: Pulling off the Cover alters not the Thing at all.</p>
               <p>Justice. I ask whether or no these Books at the Time of finding the Indictment, and taking them from me, were then in one Book as laid in the Indictment. Can Mr. Wilson say they were bound all together when they were taken?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I cannot say they were. But I had them at my Chamber bound all together; and I lent them to the Master of Pembroke bound all together; and there's an Account of the four Parts wrote upon a Leaf, which I don't find now.</p>

               <p>Justice. If I mind the Indictment right, it says, Book containing 4 Tracts; the Pyramids and Roman Foot: Usher &amp; Robertus Stephanus in Novum Testamentum.</p>

               <p>C. K. Pray go to the next, Sir.</p>
               <p>Wilson. The next are three Volumes. The first is, Prima Pars Romanae Urbis Topograhiae &amp; Antiquitatum; and all the Volumes consist of two Parts. The 2d Part is, Secunda Pars Antiquitatum Romanorum seu Topographia Romanae Urbis.</p>
               <p>C. P. The Title is not compleat in the Indictment, the Title of the Book ends at Accuratissine, and not at Antiquitatum.</p>
               <p>C. K. I believe it is so; lay them by.</p>
               <p>Wilson. The next is, Addenda to the Statutes at large.</p>
               <p>C. P. All the Title here too, is not in the Indictment. (This was laid by likewise).</p>
               <p>Wilson. The next in the Indictment, is, the Statutes at Large, beginning, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>C. P. You have not all the Title; 'tis only the Statutes at Large, in the Indictment. This was laid by also.</p>
               <p>Wilson. The next is the French Plutarch: Les Vies des Hommes illustres Grecs &amp; Romains comparees l'une avec l'autre, par Plutarch de Chaeronee; it is worth two Guineas. The next is Quinti Horatij Flacci a Louvre Horace, worth about a Guinea. The next is an English Field's Bible. The Title is, The Holy Bible, consisting the Books of the Old and New Testament.</p>
               <p>C. K. What is the Value?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Twenty Guineas, both of them.</p>
               <p>C. K. What is the next?</p>
               <p>Wilson. The Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacrements, and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of England; with the Psalter or Psalms of Devil. This and the other I value at twenty Guineas.</p>
               <p>C. K. Go on, Sir.</p>
               <p>Wilson. This is Godefridi Bidleo, Medicinae Doctoris &amp; Chiruurgi Anantomia Humani Corporis.</p>
               <p>C. P. This is a Copper-Plate; and not set forth right in the Indictment.</p>
               <p>Wilson. The next is, De Bello Belgico Decas prima Famianae Stradae, Rom. Soc. Jesu. I value the two Vols. at a Guinea, they are worth more.</p>
               <p>The next is, Vetus Testamentum multiplici Lingua nune primo impressum: &amp; imprimis Pentatenchus Hebraico Greco atq; Chaldaico Idiomate, adjuncta unicuiq; sua Latina Interpretatione: Here are four Volumes, and this is the Complatensian Edition, worth about twenty Guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Richardson. The next is the Aeschylus; but while we were in Mr. Justice's Chamber, that was convey'd away.</p>
               <p>(The Council for the King, did not think proper to take up any more Time in proving the Books, but went to the Fact.)</p>
               <p>C. K. Do you remember that Gildas to have been in the Library?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I cannot say I do; but there is a particular mark on it, by which we know it to be ours. We found many of our Books in the Library defac'd: Prints taken out of curious Books, some of which were found at Mr. Justice's, and made a Report to the College of what we found there.</p>
               <p>C. K. Give an Account how this was discovered.</p>
               <p>Wilson. 'Tis known (I suppose) that there was a Report of the Temple Library being robb'd; this gave us a Suspicion that the Libraries with us had suffered likewise. On that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173605050029"/> Occasion we examined Trinity Library, and found many Books wanting, and many defaced. The Vice-Chancellor then commissioned the Register to consult Lawyers, that we might know what was proper to be done: And according to their Advice, Mr. Allen, Mr. Hutchenson our Librarian, and my self, were sent up in January last, to take the Direction of Council, in order to our proceeding further in this Business: We waited on Mr.

            , and he gave us a Search-Warrant: We search'd Mr. Justice's Chambers, and there we found all the Books that have now been produced in Court.</p>
               <p>C. K. Is there any Marks on that Book by which you know it to be yours?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I found several Tracts taken out of books of Miscellanies: These I laid aside, and gave Account of them to the College: Mr. Jackson examined the Library particularly, and found this Volume in my Hand with the Tracts cut out. King Henry the Eighth's Answer to Luther was cut out of this Book: Upon the Leaves of it (23) being marked, the Belly of the 3 was wanting: And this very Tract we found in his Chambers, and putting it in that part of the Volume, from whence it had been taken, it tally'd exctly, and made up exactly the Figure 3, which before was deficient; and this Volume I had out of the Library</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. The Gildas was cut out likewise of another Volume. On the Inside of the Binding there is a Catalogue of the Tracts contained therein; this was wanting and was found at Mr. Justice's Chambers. It comes in, in the same Order, as mentioned in the Catalogue, the Colour of the Leaves is the same, and it tallies exactly: And for a farther Confirmation there is the Coll. Arms upon it. There is another Tract wanting, which we can't find; but we have got the College Catalogue, which mentions every one of them: this was Numb. 32.</p>
               <p>C. K. Is it a Manuscript Catalogue?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Justice. I submit it to the Court, whether that Catalogue should not be proved by somebody who has compared the Books in the Library with the Catalogue; otherwise the Catalogue can be of no Service: Besides, how does it appear that these Books ever were in the Library.</p>
               <p>C. K. What, must we bring a Man to prove a Catalogue, that was wrote, perhaps, a Hundred Years ago?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I believe it to be a true Catalogue: I found the Volume, out of which these Tracts were taken, by the Help of Catalogue.</p>
               <p>C. K. I would ask you Sir, whether as far as you have compared it, it is always been found agreeable to the Books.</p>
               <p>Jackson. As far as I have observed, 'tis an accurate Catalogue.</p>
               <p>C. K. Have you often seen him in the Library?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I have often seen him there last Summer, but never observed what he was doing; he came from College in October (I think.) He entered himself a Gentleman Commoner, in August was two Years.</p>
               <p>C. K. Was the Postellus Hebraicae Linguae in the Library?</p>
               <p>Jackson. By Mr. Wilson's giving an Account of the Tract, I found the Volume in which it was bound, in the Library thus mutilated: the Tract was missing: here is a Catalogue of the Tracts in the Book, and putting this in its Place, from whence it was cut, it fitteth exactly: and the College Arms are upon it. We found it in Mr. Justice's Chamber.</p>
               <p>Justice. I acknowledge all this; 'tis all true; but I would -</p>

               <p>C. K. Don't confess what you should not. Did not you take this Book from Trinity College?</p>
               <p>Justice. I can't say that I - But before I was sent to Newgate, I would ask Mr. Wilson, whether I did not own to you Mr. Wilson (Here Mr. Justice burst into Tears, and when he had composed himself, he went I would ask whether I did not own I had a great Number of Trinity College Books: Did not I own it, before I was taken up by Warrant from Baron Thomson? Did not I acknowledge it? Did not I give you up the Key of my Chambers, that you might take them?</p>
               <p>Wilson. We had some Conversation with you, and you did say you had many Books<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173605050030"/> belonging to Trinity, and you did say we might take them; but it was thought adviseable not to do so, as there were Warrants out. We were advised to proceed regularly, by Warrant from Mr. Baron Thomson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice. And when you found them in my Chamber, were not many of them directed to my Tutor? Was not Professor Taylor my Tutor? Was there not two Boxes of Books packed up and directed to Professor Taylor? And was there not in one of them, a Letter to him?</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you searched Mr. Justice's Chambers and found the Books?</p>
               <p>Wilson. It was on the Monday. Mr. Justice did say on the Saturday we might take the Books, but we did not obtain the Search-Warrant till Monday. Mr. Justice was in Custody when the two Boxes were packed up, and had been in the Custody of the Constable three Days, at the Bolt and Tun.</p>
               <p>C.K. Were the Books pack'd up before or after Notice was sent to Cambridge?</p>
               <p>Wilson. After.</p>
               <p>Justice. I admit I had a great Number of these Books, and that a great many of them belong to Trinity College: I was so far from altering them or defacing them, that the Arms of the College are in many of them to this Hour. I would not give the Court trouble, I admit them all, and never did deny it.</p>
               <p>C.K. Which Books were in the Boxes, and which were not packed up?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Juvenal was in one of the Boxes; The Aldus Bible, Palladio, the Complut. Bible, the Statutes at Large, the French Plutarch, the Paris Horace, Field's Bible and Common-Prayer, and Strada, were in Boxes.</p>
               <p>Justice. Was there not more in the Boxes than are in the Indictment?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes; Gildas was not packed up, that we found in his Chamber. Henry the 8th's Answer to Luther, Postellus, Beza de Francicae Pronunciationis, Newcastle's Horsemanship, were not packed up: Greaves's Pyramids, the Account of the Roman Foot, Sadeletus, Bonner's Epitaphs, Authores reivenatica, these were not pack'd-up; there are more mentioned in the Indictment, but you have not gone thro' them, so they have not come before you.</p>
               <p>C.K. Were any of the Tracts taken out of the Volumes packed up?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No, none of them.</p>
               <p>Justice. Have you done with Mr. Wilson? I would ask him, whether it is not usual to give Pupils leave to take what Books they have occasion for? Mr. Wilson is a Tutor himself.</p>
               <p>Wilson. It is; to take them regularly sending a Note, Permit such a one to take such a Book, and place it to my Account: None of these were placed to Mr. Taylor's Account.</p>
               <p>Justice. I would ask whether you remember where my Chambers were?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I remember where you liv'd last.</p>
               <p>Justice. I would ask you, how far 'tis between the Library and my Chamber?</p>
               <p>Wilson. The Library is at some Distance.</p>
               <p>Justice. Is it not quite cross both the great Courts?</p>
               <p>Wilson. 'Tis not so: Your Chamber is in the first Court, and the Library is by the River.</p>
               <p>Justice. I would ask how 'tis possible for any one to carry them away unseen? How came I by this Privilege?</p>
               <p>Wilson. That you best know.</p>
               <p>C.K. Do you give leave to any but Members of the College to take Books?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No.</p>
               <p>Justice. And in what Capacity was I?</p>
               <p>Wilson. A Fellow Commoner.</p>
               <p>Justice. What are the Privileges of Fellow Commoners?</p>
               <p>Wilson. They sit at the Fellows Table, and take the other Advantages that Fellows have; they have no Right to take Books ad libitum. You have a Right to take a Book if your Tutor gives leave, and 'tis placed to his Account. Fellow-Commoners we look on as Boarders; they are no part of the Corporation, and have no Right to take Books without this Licence.</p>
               <p>Just There are two sorts of Scholars: A Foundation Scholar, who lives on the Stipend of the College; and one who pays for what they have, and are at their own Expence:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173605050031"/> Don't you look on a Student as a Scholar? did not I on my Admission pay a Guinea, or a Guinea and a half, according to the Custom of the College (as you do) to the Library Keeper.</p>
               <p>Wilson. 'Tis paid upon Admission.</p>
               <p>Justice. Can you swear these Books were all taken in London?</p>
               <p>Wilson. They were taken in your Chambers.</p>
               <p>C.P. I asked before, whether there was any Fastening to these Books?</p>
               <p>Wilson. None, in Trinity College Library.</p>
               <p>Justice. You say, that Tutors licence their Pupils to take Books, and they are entered by Order of the Tutor in the Register Book. Now I would ask you, Sir, whether it is not a frequent Practice to borrow Books without making such Entry?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I have something to do with Pupils my self. I write, Let such a Person have such a Book, and place it to my Account.</p>
               <p>C. P. You are a cautious Man. I would ask whether any Body can go into the Library without the Librarian's Leave.</p>
               <p>Wilson. 'Tis not always open: There are Hours when the Keeper attends. When a Gentleman studies there, he has leave of a Fellow. A Fellow Commoner of a House is indulged with leave to study there; but he can't take them to his Chamber without his Tutor's Note.</p>
               <p>C.P. I would ask whether any one can go into the Library without leave of the Librarian?</p>
               <p>Wilson. When any come to see the Library, the Librarian walks with the Person: If he comes to study; he has leave to sit down.</p>
               <p>Justice. Has it not been common for Books to be wanting in Trinity College Library?</p>
               <p>Wilson. There are many Books out: Because Fellows, according to their particular Studies, have particular Books. I have some; Mr.Taylor has some.</p>
               <p>C.P. Ask him if they don't keep them 20 or 30 Years? And if they don't bring them away with them to London?</p>
               <p>Wilson. If they do, they should not.</p>
               <p>C.P. I ask if you don't know of Books belonging to Trinity, now in London?</p>
               <p>Wilson. There are a great many here now. I know but of a Volume of Stillingfleet beside, and that is charged on his Head; he is a Fellow, and is now in Court.</p>
               <p>Justice. Who is the under Library-Keeper?</p>
               <p>Wilson. The present Man's Name is Harris, he is about 18 Years old.</p>
               <p>Justice. In relation to a Fellow Commoner, I would ask whether they have not more Privileges than other Graduates.</p>
               <p>Wilson. We allow you to go into the Library to study there, not on any other account.</p>
               <p>Justice. Are not Fellow Commoners looked upon as superior to Scholars?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes. -</p>
               <p>Justice. What do you mean by a Fellow Commoner?</p>
               <p>Wilson. One who sits at the same Table with Fellows, and enjoys their Conversation.</p>
               <p>C. P. Pray does Mr. Justice's Name still continue in the Buttery Book? When did you see it last there?</p>
               <p>Wilson. His Name was on the Buttery Boards in October, whether it is now taken off or not, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>C. P. Is it not usual for a Fellow Commoner to have the Liberty of taking a Book without a Note from the Tutor?</p>
               <p>C. K. And I would ask if he knows they are allowed to take them, not only out of the Library, but out of Cambridge.</p>
               <p>C. P. Have you, every time any of your Pupils have wanted a Book, given them a Note?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes.</p>
               <p>C. K. I would ask whether in all your Time, you ever knew leave given to any Body to cut a Treatise out of a Book, carry it away, and leave the rest behind?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brounker sworn.</p>
               <p>C. K. Do you know where Mr. Justice's Chambers are?</p>
               <p>Brounker. In London, in Elm Court. We reckon all the east part of Temple-lane to be in London. Take a Line from Sheer-Lane, and run it down to the Water-side, all on this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173605050032"/> side the Line we reckon in London. All on this Side the Middle-Temple-Lane we call London. New Court and the Garden is called Middlesex. E'm-Court is on this side of Middle-Temple-Lane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Atkinson, the Constable was sworn.</p>
               <p>C. K. Had you any Search Warrant brought you?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. Yes; It was signed by Baron Thomson.</p>
               <p>(The Warrant being proved was read)</p>
               <p>C. K How did you proceed upon this?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. As I am a City Constable, I did not care to serve it in the Temple without leave from the Benchers. I had leave, and with Esquire Taylor, and Mr. Brounker, we found these Books, which I have had in Custody ever since. We took Mr. Justice in his Chambers, and carried him before Baron Thomson on the Wednesday, who asked him Questions, and told him he hoped he could give a good account how he came by them: He said, he thought he could: and the Baron gave him 3 Days to do it in: I was ordered to keep the Books, and he had leave to go at liberty from Wednesday to Saturday: I was ordered to bring him again before the Baron, on Saturday. and he then not giving a good Account how he came by them, he was order'd to get Bail, and 'till he could find Bail, he was to remain in my Custody; I kept him at my House 'till Monday, then I took him again before Baron Thomson, and he committed him.</p>
               <p>C. K. Do you know any thing about his packing up Books?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. Yes. On Sunday in the Evening he desired I would let him go to his Chambers, to put some Papers in order. I went with him, and he then packed up these Books in order to send them to Cambridge, and put in a Letter to one Mr. Taylor I believe: When the Books were packed up, he went home with me again.</p>
               <p>Justice. I don't know whether your Lordship understood him as I do: I think he said, when he came with the Warrant to my Chambers, he found these Books here, or else he speaks of another Parcel of Books.</p>
               <p>Atkinson. I don't know whether the Books that are here are the same Books that you pack'd up.</p>
               <p>Justice. Did you find any of the Books mentioned in the Warrant?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. No.</p>
               <p>Justice. I ask you who it was that pressed you to execute the Warrant?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. I believe his Name was Kinaston.</p>
               <p>Justice. There was a second Warrant granted. When was that? before or after the packing up of the Books?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. The Books were packed up, before the second Warrant was granted.</p>
               <p>Justice. There was no Warrant against me then for Trinity College.</p>

            . I am a Fellow of St. John's.</p>
               <p>Justice. I beg leave to say one Thing; I have an Objection to the Gentleman's Evidence; it will appear that he was Under Librarian, and had the Care of the University Library.</p>
               <p>Taylor. I received Orders from the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge; about Christmas last, to procure a Warrant to search Mr. Justice's Chambers: Baron Thomson granted a Warrant on the 6th of January. On the 7th they were searched, and Mr. Justice taken before the Baron. I saw some Books which were missing in the Library: On Saturday Morning he was before him again, and then he was put into the Constable's Hands; and on Sunday Night I was informed that Mr. Justice was packing up Books: I went to him and asked him the Reason of his packing the Books up; he said, he was advised to do it, but that it was contrary to his own Judgment.</p>
               <p>C. K. How came the Gentlemen of Trinity to suspect Mr. Justice?</p>
               <p>Taylor. The Gentlemen desired me in my Search for the University Library, to look for Newcastle's Horsemanship; I saw it in Mr. Justice's Chambers, and sent them word of it.</p>
               <p>Justice. When you came to search, was not my Study Door lock'd?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes.</p>
               <p>Justice. When I gave you the Key, did you find any of the Books mentioned in the Warrant?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173605050033"/>Taylor. No.</p>
               <p>Justice. My Lord, when they came to my Chambers, tho' my Name was not in the Warrant, yet I freely let them search, and they found none of the Books mentioned in the Warrant. There was a Trunk that was lock'd; I opened it, and there was nothing there that they wanted. I will go farther, to shew how willing I was to give Satisfaction, I let Mr. Taylor and Mr. Brounker the next Day search, even my very Cellar, without Constable or Warrant. On their second coming, they found me at Liberty, and my Doors open, and they can't say there was any Obstruction to their searching.</p>
               <p>Taylor. There were some Covers of Books in the Cellar.</p>
               <p>(The Council for the King rested the Evidence here, and the Prisoner was called on to make his Defence.</p>
               <p>Justice. My Lord, I acknowledge, as I always did, and have now done, that I had the Books. I apprehend, I had Authority to take them. First, a General Authority to take what Books I wanted, out of the Library. Secondly, An Authority in my own Right, as a Scholar of the College; and if this appears, this Matter will be so far from being Felony, that it can't be a Trespass. I intended to return them, and this may appear from my declaring that I had them, delivering up my Keys, and packing them up before the Warrant for the College-Books was granted. There was no Warrant against me for the College-Books, before I endeavoured to send them away. As to the Matter of my being a Scholar; it will appear from the Statutes, there are two sorts of Scholars. From the Statute 25 Sept. 12. Eliz. where 'tis said, Nullus Scholaris quicunq; &amp;c From this Statute it appears, that there are stipendiary Scholars, who receive Money or Victuals, who are supported by the College, and Scholars who live at their own Expence; of which Number I am one: And if any Doubt arises on that, I hope these Gentlemen (my Council) will be permitted to argue for me. But I apprehend, if I had no Right as a Scholar of the College, yet I hope this Clause in the 2d of Eliz. Chap. 14. which says, Omnes Scholasticos, &amp;c. will give me the Right of a Fellow. I beg leave to observe, that the constant Word in all Statutes and Chapters, when a Scholar is spoken of, is Scholaris: A Foundation-Scholar is called Discipulus, and I must be the Scholaris. The Pensionaries are the Stipendiaries of the College. Fellow-Commoners have always the same Privileges with Fellows. My Lord, I was so far from secreting these Books, that 'tis intirely owing to the Negligence of a Child, whom they have made Library-Keeper, that my Name was not entered with the Books, according to my Order. But if I had not ordered them to be entered, yet by the Statutes it cannot be a Felony. They lay openly in my Room; they have the College Arms on them, and have particular Marks: Could any body (intending to secret them) be so mad, as to let them lie about openly, with these Marks. There were many Books I intended to send down, before there were any Complaints against me, but they would not suffer me. I had a Message from my Tutor, to inform me, he thought it proper I should send down the Books I had, belonging to the Library, which I had from him. I sent him word, I hoped I should spend my Christmas with him, then all the Books should be put in order; but this Affair happening, prevented my going, or sending the Books. There is something appears in my Behalf from the very Face of these Books. My Chambers were in the Corner of the first Court, and the Library in the Corner of the other great Court; I appeal to any Man, whether it was possible for any one to carry these great Books, (and some there are which are much bigger) out of the Library to my Chambers without Discovery; here are these Bibles, and Plutarch's Lives; the Thing speaks itself; 'tis impossible to remove these Books in a clandestine Manner. But, my Lord, I never was there, but the Boy, the Library-Keeper, was with me: He is a negligent Boy, and, I believe, 'tis no Wonder that Books should be lost from Trinity Library. When I was at College there was 15 or 1600 Books wanting, and must I be answerable for their Neglect, and be subject to Punishments and Indictments? I hope your Lordship does not think it necessary for me to call any Manner of Evidence; the Books are the Books of the Master, Fellows, and Scholars and I am a Scholar, consequently the Books I have a Right in, and they will be as much mine as theirs, therefore it cannot be Felony: If they have been carried away, it cannot be feloniously. I desire my Council may be heard. But it not being proved that Mr. Justice was a Member of the Corporation, his Objection was over ruled.</p>
               <p>Justice. I would ask Mr. Professor Taylor if he did not give Directions to the Library-Keeper, that I should have what Books I wanted.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173605050034"/>Taylor. Yes, I gave Orders that Mr. Justice should have what Books he had occasion for.</p>
               <p>Justice. You are Greek Professor Sir, and was my Tutor: Is it not an usual Method for Tutors to give Orders, that their Pupils may have what Books they want?</p>
               <p>Taylor. 'Tis not very common; but as Mr. Justice was a Gentleman, I indulged him.</p>
               <p>Justice. I would know whether Fellow Commoners are not indulged with particular Privileges?</p>
               <p>Taylor. We make some Distinction to be sure: They sit among Masters of Arts at Church, and in the publick Schools.</p>
               <p>Justice. Don't they frequently attend the Schools?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes.</p>
               <p>Justice. What do you take a Scholar to be in Trinity College?</p>
               <p>Taylor. They have about 14 l. a Year allowed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take Fellow Commoners to be Part of the Corporation?</p>
               <p>Taylor. 'Tis taken in the College that they are not.</p>
               <p>Justice. I desire to know if 'tis not taken in the College, that there are two sorts of Scholars, and the general Name for them is Scholaris, and that is, because they attend the Schools; don't Fellow Commoners attend the Schools?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes, and take Degrees as others do.</p>
               <p>Justice. There are Scholars in the College who have Pensions, and many others who have not: Well, Sir, I would know the Custom and Practice of the University: There is a Jurisdiction by some of the Charters, granted to the Chancellor, Master and Scholars.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Justice. If I had Money owing me, or owed Money, where must I sue, or where might I be sued?</p>
               <p>Taylor. In the Vice-Chancellor's Court.</p>
               <p>Justice. Why so?</p>
               <p>Taylor. 'Tis always the Way.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a Gentleman at Trinity is not matriculated, how is it then?</p>
               <p>Justice. The very same Thing.</p>
               <p>Taylor. This Question was never asked in any Suit in the University Courts, whether a Man was matriculated or not.</p>
               <p>C. K. Your suing and being sued, is as you are a Member of the University, not as you are a Member of a College.</p>
               <p>Justice. I apprehend what I am upon is material, because in all the Charters of Colleges, Scholars, as I am, are called Scholares, and the Stipendiary Scholars are called Discipuli. As the Distinction depends upon the Charter of the University, I would make use of the Words of the Charter, to describe the two sorts of Scholars. I would ask Mr. Taylor, is not a Fellow Commoner looked upon as a Member of a College?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He is an admitted Member; I cannot say an incorporated one.</p>
               <p>Justice. On the Admission of any one into the College, are there not Fees paid?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Did not you pay those Fees?</p>
               <p>Justice. I cannot tell: 'Tis not material, whether you or I paid them: But I would ask whether the Bed Makers have not Keys of our Chambers as well as we?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes.</p>
               <p>Justice. Then if I had stolen the Books, they would easily have been discovered. But did not you about November or December, send me word, you thought it proper I should return the Books I had taken?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes, I said the Library was to be review'd, and it would be proper to replace the Books.</p>
               <p>Justice. What Answer did I send you?</p>
               <p>Taylor. You said you should come down at Christmas, and then the Books should be replaced.</p>
               <p>Jury. We desire to know if there were any Books enter'd in the Library-Book to Mr. Justice on Mr. Taylor's Account?</p>
               <p>Taylor. The last time he was at College there were some enter'd to him.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were the Books now produced, or any of them enter'd?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Not one of these were enter'd.</p>
               <p>Justice. I hope the first thing we shall go upon, will be to see whether I am a Scholar or not.</p>
               <p>Hutchinson. This is a Register of the Books lent out to the Fellows of Trinity. I am Head Library-Keeper, and keep the Book; it always lies in the Library, and I look into it every Day. There are some enter'd to Mr. Justice on Professor Taylor's Head, and made Return'd. Our Method is, when a borrow'd Book is return'd, the Under Library-Keeper gives a Stroke through the Name of the Book. Rhymer's Faedera, Vol. 1. Ashmole's Order of the Garter, are scratched out.</p>
               <p>Justice. Mr. Taylor says, that Fellow Commoners are so far look'd on as Scholars, that they attend the publick Schools, come to Lectures, take Degrees, and therefore I am a Scholaris.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173605050035"/> I would ask him, whether for neglect of Duty they are not punished?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes, as junior Fellows are.</p>
               <p>Jury. I would ask Mr. Taylor, whether he apprehended he was regular in giving such Licence to Mr. Justice, as he says he did? and whether when he wrote the Letter to him, he apprehended he had more Books than were entered to his Name?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I had no suspicion that he had, at that time.</p>
               <p>C. K. Pray of whom does your Foundation consist? What do you call your selves?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Master, Fellows and Scholars; a Fellow Commoner is not considered as a Fellow, nor as a Scholar.</p>
               <p>C. K. Are Fellow Commoners and Scholars chose in election?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Those that are Scholars in the House are chosen by Election; Fellow Commoners are not; they are examined, but not elected, nor are they considered as Scholars of the House. A Fellow Commoner may be chosen a Fellow, but he must be chosen a Foundation Scholar first.</p>
               <p>C. K. Is there any Form of their Admittance?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes, they write their own Names in a Register Book, and are sworn before the Vice-master</p>
               <p>C. K. Are there any Advancements in the Colledge; to which if a Man be raised, it is necessary that he has been admitted a Scholar Can a Man be Master without he has been a Scholar?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes; in such Cases the King nominates.</p>
               <p>C. P. King Edward VI. gave them a Body of Statutes: and Queen Elizabeth gave them another, which are the Rule of Government; and on one of these Statutes, if I rightly understand, Mr. Justice depends. Here the Charter of the College was referred to, which incorporated them by the Names of Magister, Socii &amp;c Scholares.</p>
               <p>C. K. There is no Description in the Charter what a Scholar shall be. Henry VIII. when he gave this Charter reversed the Power to himself to give Statutes; but dying without giving them, Queen Elizabeth gave these, and there is a Distinction throughout between the Socii and Scholares.</p>
               <p>Justice. In the 14th Chapter of Queen Elizabeth, you may observe the Stipendiary Scholar is called Discipulus, not Scholaris: Scholaris is another Word for Fellow. The Scholares &amp; Socii are the constituent Parts of the Body. Common Pensioners are not elected, they take no Oath, therefore they cannot be on the Foundation. Commoners are part of the Foundation, the others are no part of the Foundation; if there be any Revenues to be divided they have no part of the Profit.</p>
               <p>Here the Statutes were read concerning the Number of, and Distinction between, the Socii Scholares and the Discipuli Scholares.</p>
               <p>C. P. I am far from saying that a Crime of this Nature is not punishable. I do not mean any such thing, nor advance any such Doctrine; but what I would insist upon, is, whether it is not a Larceny; punishable it is, but whether it is Felony is the Question.</p>
               <p>Justice. I believe the University-Statutes may be given in Evidence, to shew the Meaning of the Word Scholaris. I apprehend it may be material to shew there are stipendiary Scholars, and Scholars of another kind.</p>
               <p>(Read the Statutes.)</p>
               <p>C. K. This does not shew that Fellow-Commoners are Members of the Corporation; here are Sociis Scholares and Discipuli Scholares, and these are all that are mentioned, and you don't pretend to be of the Discipuli Scholares.</p>
               <p>There are to be 62 Discipuli Scholares, one of these you will not allow your self to be.</p>
               <p>Justice. No, not a stipendiary Scholar, but a Scholar in general. I desire the Statutes of Edward VI. may be produced.</p>
               <p>C. K. We had no notice of them. Here is the Charter of Henry VIII. and the Statutes of the College with relation to Fellow Commoners. There was a Dispute how far the Statutes of Edward VI. were in force; and they are now in the Bishop of Ely's Hands. He has the only authentick Copy of them; it was ordered by the Privy Council that they should be put in to his Hands.</p>
               <p>Justice. I desire the 29th Chapter of Elizabeth may be read. Mr. Taylor gave a general Order for me to take what Books I had occasion for, and by Vertue of that Order, I took these; I ordered the Boy to set them to Mr. Taylor's Account; 'tis hardly possible I should take them secretly.</p>
               <p>Taylor. I supposed they were to be regularly enter'd in my Name.</p>

The Books always lay about in publick, openly, and my Study-Door always unlock'd; a Man that had stole them feloniously, would have been fitter for Bedlam than Newgate - (Weeps) Do not you remember (to Marsam) a great large Bible lying openly? Shew him the Book.</p>
               <p>Marsam I can't say that ever I saw that Book.</p>
               <p>Taylor. We found Newcastle's Horsemanship on the Floor in the Study, without its Binding, and the Study Door was lock'd.</p>
               <p>Marsam. I can't say I saw that Book.</p>
               <p>Justice. He is no Scholar, and so might not take notice of Latin and Greek Books. My Lord, I hope the Distinction as to the Scholares is plainly express'd by Queen Elizabeth's Statutes, and I hope it will be look'd upon, that Scholar is a Student, and every Student a Scholar.</p>
               <p>The Council for the Prisoner very learnedly spoke to the Points in Debate, viz. Whether he was not to be considered as a Member of the Corporation. Whether a Member of a Corporation could be guilty of Felony in taking the Goods of that Corporation; and though the Prisoner should not be prov'd an integral or Foundation-Member; yet considering the Liberty or Indulgence granted him, whether it would not be too hard to construct his Crime into any Species of Felony. Their Arguments were severally and distinctly answered by the Council for the King, and the whole Evidence and the Substance of the Arguments on both sides being laid before the Jury in a very judicious and learned Charge, they withdrew, and in short time return'd, and found the Prisoner <rs id="t17360505-88-verdict416" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>On Monday Evening the 10th of May, Mr. Justice was brought down from Newgate, to receive the Judgment of the Court; and being asked, what he had to say why Sentence of Death should not be pronounced against him according to Law: His Answer was as follows:</p>
               <p>Justice. My Lord, In my unhappy Situation, I have nothing left, but to plead the Benefit of the Statute, and pray the Favour of the Court, that I mny not be sent abroad, for the sake of the Prosecutors. My Lord, I was so far from denying that I had the Books, that I always ackowledged it; and I should be glad of an Opportunity of making them a farther Reparation, than they have at present. But if I am under a Necessity of going abroad, it will be absolutely impracticable. As therefore it will be more for their Interest than my own, I hope that will be considered. I speak not from any Desire I have to stay here; for I declare, that if I was to be discharged immediately, no one should see my Face more. (then wept) I own I took these Things, but with no Design to keep them: And I have many more belonging to them; which, if I must go abroad, they will never come at: Therefore, I hope, as the Law gives a discretionary Power to send abroad, or to punish at Home, by burning in the Hand, I hope for Punishment here, that I may be of Service to People with whom I have great Transactions. The Situation I have been in in Life, has occasioned my being intrusted with the Affairs of other People, and the Notice I have of my being to be sent away, is so short, 'tis impossible for me to settle them, or put them into any Method, whereby they may know what Course to take. I have also a young Family to take care of; and, I hope, for their Sake, as Justice has already had its course, and taken Place, your Lordship will think proper that Mercy should take its turn: And, indeed, it will be more Mercy to others, than myself. I have the Honour to be acquainted with many Gentlemen of the same Honourable Profession; I am not unknown to your Lordship; but this fatal Error has been a terrible one to me, and the Consequences of it will always lie upon me; and has deprived me of the Profits and Satisfaction I had Reason to hope for from an Honourable Employment. Instead of being punished, by being sent abroad I beg for Punishment here, for the first Reason assigned; viz. that I may have it in my Power to make Reparation to the People injur'd. I never deny'd the Books; always acknowledged them, and took them with an honest Intent; yet, I have been obliged to remove a great many: I ow'd Rent to my Landlord, and was under a Necessity to send them into the Country, and afterwards to Holland; If I am sent away, they can never come by their own, therefore I hope they will not be averse to what I offer. I have not much more to offer: But as I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173605050037"/> have the Honour to be known to some Gentlemen on the Bench, I should be glad to have the Favour of the Court, that I may be useful to the People I have injur'd.</p>
               <p>My Lord, there is one thing which bore pretty hard upon me at my Trial, and which I mention now, not to extenuate my Guilt, but for the Preservation of those who otherwise may fall into my unhappy Condition: In Relation to the Bibles and Newcastle's Horsemanship, I solemnly declare, that I did charge the Librarian to put them to my Account. If a Man goes and takes a Book according to the Rules of the College, and orders the Book to be set down, if it should be neglected, no Gentleman can be safe: I mention this that they may take more Care, and that Accidents of this kind may be prevented for the future. I am now going to suffer the Law, and the Sentence to be pronounced. The Act gives a discretionary Power to the Court, and if they think fit, the Offender may be burnt in the Hand: But whether the Court will use that discretionary Power with Mercy to me, I know not.</p>
               <p>For my own Part, I had now rather go abroad, than stay at home; but there are some Reasons which make it better for me to stay at home. I have been confined half a Year already, and I don't know whether I shall have Opportunity to make Application for Mercy, or to make any Discoveries before the Transports go.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Mr. Dell ever your Customer, but for Candles?</p>

               <p>Pris. What Quantities of them were broke?</p>
               <p>Grigson. Near half of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to Dell, or did Dell apply to you?</p>
               <p>Grigson. I went to him, and asked him if he wanted any Candles; he asked what Candles they were I told him there were 17 or 18 to the 3 Pounds; he asked me whence they came; I said, they were Perquisites of the King's Servants.</p>
               <p>Council. Perquisite Candles! have all you sold been li't or broken?</p>
               <p>Grigson. I can bring some People who have had Candles neither li't nor broke.</p>

               <p>Council. Other Candles you sold for 5 d. a Pound, how came you to sell these for 4 d. when they were thicker and larger?</p>
               <p>Grigson. They were indeed thicker and larger, but I believe there was almost one half of them broke, and Dell said he did not think them any great Penny-worth on that account.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you tell me they were Dutch Candels?</p>

            . On the 21st of January, I was sent for and told, that the Excise-Officers had seized a large Quantity of Candles, supposing them not to have paid the Duty: Upon Enquiry I found them to be my Mother in Law's Candles, They were seized about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173605050038"/> Two o'Clock, and about Eight I was sent for, and then Dell came to me and said, I have got some of Mrs. Greswell's Candles that were stole; this was after the Discovery. I am surpriz'd, says I, that you should encourage any Thing of this Kind, I have 10 or 11 Dozen, says he, I bought them for Perquisite Candles: They must be broke or lit then, said I. No, he told me, that there was not one broke, nor one that had been lighted. I asked him what could tempt him to buy such Quantities, they were more than could be Perquisite Candles fairly, the King should not be here any more than a private Person; but now the Thieves are tied, you make the Discovery. However, I would have thought as well of Mr. Dell. as I could, and hoped he would have assisted me in the Prosecution of the Persons concerned, but he told me he would not come. I had put this Woman into the Indictment with the two Yates's, but I knew I could not convict the Prisoners without him: He came at last, and was in the Court when the Bill was drawn, but went away, and I was forced to have another Bill drawn, and to admit the Woman an Evidence in this, who was a Principal in the other, else I could not have made any thing out.</p>
               <p>Council Are you sure Dell told you, that none of the Candles were broke, nor lit?</p>
               <p>Willoughby. On my Conscience and Oath, he told me they were not; and that he bought them as Perquisite Candles from St. James's. After the Trial was over, I asked him what he designed to do with the Candles: he said he would keep them. What, says I, after you have heard the Property prov'd? Do you act like an honest Man?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I freely own I bought the Candles, and told you the Price?</p>
               <p>Willoughby. He did, and threatned me if I did so and so, if I went on with the Prosecution, what he would do.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you apprehend this Indictment was Felony?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not I bring this Letter to you, which Grigson sent to me, by which means the Thief was taken?</p>
               <p>Willoughby. I believe I might see this Letter, but, I believe it was a Day or two afterward. Clerk reads the Letter.</p>

               <p>Sir. 'I am in the Concern in Life to ' hear of the Trouble you are like to have on my ' Account, but depend on my appearing to ' you.

Sir, be satisfied, I will appear ' whenever you have necessity for me, or I ' should think myself the worst of Creatures; ' or if it was that which would hang me, I ' will appear and own I sold them for Perquisite ' Candles, and he brought them to me open, ' and I unhappily brought them to you unknown ' to him: When I see you, I will give ' you a more particular Account, which shall be ' whenever you fix the Time.'</p>

            . I sold good condition'd Candles at that time for 4 s. 4 d. if these Candles were in the condition they have been sworn, I would not have given 3 s. 6 d. The Victualling Office a little before, gave 3 s. 11 d. I offered them at 3 s. 11 pence half penny per Dozen.</p>
               <p>- Bracebridge. Mr. Willoughby told me this Prosecution was owing to Dell's Obstinacy; if he had not been obstinate he had never gone so far.</p>
               <p>Justice Richards. I heard Willoughby say he expected Dell shou'd have return'd the Candles; that he was concerned at what was done, and had not had a Wink of Sleep all Night; but Mr. Dell he said, had not used him well, for he had told him, he had paid for the Candles  and would keep them, had he returned them, Mr. Willoughby said he should not have prosecuted him, and if the thing was to do again, he would not do it for the World.</p>

             in my hearing own'd that his fellow Servant told him, Mr. Dell had shewn him the Candles, and asked him, if his Mistress would sell such Candles, so cheap; that he told him, there was a great deal of Stuff in them, to put him out of conceit with them, but that they were indeed as good Candles as ever he saw in his Life. Mr. Willoughby I believe might say at the Sessions House Gate that if Mr. Dell would not deliver the Candles he would proceed in another manner.</p>
