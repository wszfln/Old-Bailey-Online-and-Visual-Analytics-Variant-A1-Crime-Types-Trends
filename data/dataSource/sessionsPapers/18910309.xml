Mr. Madge spoke to me about this matter, in consequence of which I made certain inquiries—I called on Saunders several times—this letter (<hi rend="italic">marked F</hi>) was handed to me by a young lady at 68, Crowndale Road one evening when I called—I gave the name of Edwards—on the 27th I called again and saw Saunders—I showed him the letter I had received from the young lady—I said, "Mr. Saunders?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I am a police officer from Bow Street. You have had a gentleman from the newspaper office to call upon you several times, and he has not been able to see you"—he said, "I stayed in one night to see him, but he did not come"—I said, "You left a note for him"—he said, "Yes"—I showed him this letter (<hi rend="italic">marked F</hi>), and said, "Did you write this?"—he said, "Yes, I wrote that, because I did not know who he was or what he wanted"—I said, "I think Mr. Norton has written to Mr. Madge, the editor, about an insertion in the newspaper respecting your death "—he said, "Yes, I have seen it in one or two"—I said, "Mr. Madge did not know there was a Mr. Saunders; I suppose you are Saunders"—he then produced an envelope on which was written, "Saunders, 68, Crowndale Road," and said, "There is no mistake about my being Saunders. I told Norton not to have anything to do in the matter, it did not hurt me"—I said, "Do you know Mr. Drew?"—he said, "No, I don't know a Mr. Drew"—I then left him—I did not at that time say that I was a Mr. Edwards connected with the paper, he understood so—at five the same day I took him into custody on a warrant for attempting to obtain money from parties with intent to defraud—I told him I had a warrant—he said,</p>

               <p>"What for?"—I said, "For attempting to obtain money from the <hi rend="italic">People</hi> newspaper "—he said, "I have not attempted to obtain money; I do not intend to incriminate anyone; I did not want Norton to obtain any money"—I said, "The letter of Drew is very similar to the letter you left for Mr. Edwards"—he made no reply—he was taken to Bow Street station and formally charged—I searched him, and upon him I found this letter marked H (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Dear Saunders, I hear that the <hi rend="italic">People</hi> representatives have called again to see you; they are no doubt very uneasy, but you need not worry yourself, as I am aware you are busy preparing for the event. I will call on them for the 10 guineas. They ought to think themselves fortunate to get off so lightly; their object, no doubt, is to get you to take less.—Yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">A. W. NORTON</hi>. P. S.—Do not work too hard; have plenty of stout and oysters")—I went to Saunders' lodging, and there found these letters marked "I" and "J." (<hi rend="italic">Both these were from Norton to Saunders; the last letter stated:</hi> "There is a good chance of making a few pounds")—Saunders was brought before Mr. Vaughan, and Norton was subpoenaed to give evidence against him—I saw Norton on 31st December at his house in Wrotham Road, and had a conversation with him, which I made this note of at the time. (<hi rend="italic">Reading it:</hi> "I said, 'I have this from the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> newspaper office; I want to see you respecting a letter you sent to the editor of the <hi rend="italic">People</hi> about a man named Saunders.' He said, 'What has the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> to do with it?' I said, It is the same people; the report about Saunders is false. Do you know him? are you a solicitor?' He said, 'No; I am Mr. Montague's clerk; I have been with him over twenty years; Saunders had asked me to take the matter up for him; it also appeared in a special edition of the <hi rend="italic">Star</hi>.' I said, 'I will tell Mr. Madge what you say; I should like to see Saunders.' He said, 'Don't see him; he has placed the matter in my hands; if the <hi rend="italic">People</hi> don't recompense him for the injury they have done him we shall take proceedings")—at that time I had no idea of arresting Norton—after Saunders had been arrested I took Norton—I read the warrant to him—he said, "I can't understand this."</p>

I believe it is true that Norton has been twenty years with Mr. Montague; he was invalided and in a hospital, and Mr. Montague allowed him a sort of pension—Norton was first summoned as a witness, and then was given in custody—all these letters were written from his correct address, where he lives with his wife and children—at the time of his arrest he was engaged with Mr. Tickell, a solicitor, at 63, Strand—he has been out on bail.</p>

I called several times at Crowndale Road before I saw Saunders; I saw Miss Thompson, the lady who handed me the letter, twice; that is not the lady he is engaged to—I mentioned that I had called from the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>—the letter was addressed to me as Mr. Edwards—I have made inquiries about his character, and found it very satisfactory; he is in the employ of Vincent Brooks, Day, and Company, of Gate Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields—they still have the utmost confidence in him—I found on him a bank-book, showing that he had a balance of about £20.</p>

I am Inspector of Coin to Her Majesty's Mint—these nineteen florins are all counterfeit, and from three or four different moulds—the coin Johnson is said to have tendered to Mrs. Johnson is bad, and from the same mould as two of the nineteen—a coin being gritty between the teeth is one sign of it being bad.</p>

A florin was handed round, and some bit it; I looked at it and said I was sure it was good. I told the inspector I did not know Larkin. As to Rogers, he was not near me, he was never in the room. The constable may have seen three men together, but I was not one. As to Mrs. Johnson, I do not even know her shop; it is clear that she did not know the coin was bad till the next morning; I had no more to do with it than anybody hi this Court. I do not know Rogers, and never was in his company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Larkin's Defence.</hi> I had walked from Watford to Edgware. I bought some cheese. Mr. Cross gave me my florin back, and I paid him with a half-crown. I showed the florin to some men, and they said they did not think it was bad. I took it back to Mr. Cross, and said, "You don't know good money from bad," and sat down in the taproom—when the constable came I went up to him and showed him the coin—I had never seen these two men before.</p>

I am a merchant, and live at South Norwood Park—in 1883 I came across a book written by the defendant, a history of the family of Glanville from the Norman Conquest—I had in 1881 published a book called "A Record of the Leete Family"—I was brought into contact with the defendant through my being a co-trustee for a member of his family—on 3rd May, 1883, I received this letter from him, in which he gave an extract from some work referring to the Leete family—on 13th May, 1883, I received this other letter from him, and another on 28th May. (<hi rend="italic">These letters had reference to certain manuscripts in the British Museum, showing a connection of the Leete family with that of Avenel</hi>, <hi rend="italic">and expressing a readiness to make research on the subject, adding that he was working hard for his ordination, and that his means were of a limited character</hi>)—that letter, I believe, enclosed a scrap of information upon the subject. (<hi rend="italic">Several other letters were put in and read</hi>, <hi rend="italic">all bearing on the same matter</hi>)—I sent him £5 and other sums on account of current researches—the letter of 16<hi rend="italic">th</hi> August, 1883, enclosed what purported to be a copy of part of a manuscript from one of the Harleian Collection, 6164, showing a connection between the Avenel family and the family of Leete—the letter also enclosed a reading-room ticket, it has his writing on it—that letter contained the first and only informa<lb/>tion from the manuscripts—I cannot remember whether I acknowledged the receipt of that letter; I may have seen him afterwards—I think I was absent from London at the time—I think after that there was very little correspondence—possibly I sent him in all three sums, amounting to £20 or £30, in the course of six months—some time that year his researches on my behalf entirely ceased—the documents were sent to me from time to time while he was making his researches; I put them away—his last letter, of 27th September, suggested that I should recast my book altogether and publish it afresh—some time in the spring of 1890 I handed over all the notes and docu<lb/>ments to Mr. Corbet Anderson, and he reported to me the result of his investigation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the Keeper of the Manuscripts and Egerton Librarian at the British Museum—the whole of the MSS. there are under my charge, I am responsible for them; I am intimately acquainted with the Harleian MSS.—I have before me No. 6,148—turning to folio 108 I find that certain parts have been interpolated; in the right-hand lower corner there are a number of entries in modern ink of the present century of an entirely different colour to the original—the object of that interpolation is to connect the family of Avenel with the family of Leete; that would be the effect of it—it is my duty to have an inti<lb/>mate knowledge of handwriting—I have had placed before me a number of letters purporting to be in the handwriting of the prisoner; I have compared them with the interpolations here, and I say the writing is identically the same, there is not the slightest attempt at disguise—turning to 6,164, folio 64, I find that five genera<lb/>tions have been interpolated in modern handwriting and modern ink, and did not form part of the original MS.—they are entirely spurious, the handwriting is the same, but slightly disguised, with a few flourishes and alterations to make it look more ancient and more like the genuine entries on the same page—I find running through the undoubted handwriting of the prisoner that he always makes his capital L like a small h; that is most remarkable; it occurs not in every case, he gradu<lb/>ally drifts into it on many occasions, but keeps out of it on some occa<lb/>sions—in the additional MS. 5,937, folios 43 and 44, a whole leaf has been interpolated, two pages; that is absolutely spurious; it is fitted in with tracing paper; if it becomes necessary to insert a page we do not do so, we guard it with a small piece of paper on the left-hand side of the page; this is numbered 44a, we should put 43 and a star—the whole of this is spurious—the effect of the interpolation is to give the family of Avenel an entirely different character—it appears to be slurred and blotted over to give it the appearance of age; it is headed "Avenel and Leete"—these MSS. are useful for the purposes of art and literature, and are of priceless value and curiosity—they are carefully examined by me to detect forgeries—attempts are made to palm off spurious MSS.—I am responsible for their genuineness before they are purchased—the MSS. are allowed as evidence in the Courts of Law—in pedigree cases, the Heralds' Visitations are taken as evidence—the Visitations commenced in the reign of Richard III., and terminated with Charles II.; they were generally made in the reign of Elizabeth, as late as 1634—readers in the Museum have to obtain a certificate of good character—anybody whose name is in the Post Office Directory can give a reference—readers can get out what books they require—in 1883 the MSS. were examined in the,. large room, the same room the readers used; since that they are only used in a small room—a reader requiring a MS. had to get a green ticket, which contained the place named, the number of the seat, the date, and the volume required—the ticket was deposited in a basket and was collected by the attendant; when the volume is returned the ticket is given back to him, and then his responsibility ends—when the MSS. are returned to the attendant they are brought down to the examination de<lb/>partment and examined by two assistants the next morning; they are not examined carefully, for this reason, that they only have between ten</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189103090016"/>
               <p>minutes past five and ten next morning, and in those fifty minutes they have over two hundred to examine; they turn them over hastily just to see if any damage has been done, which would catch the eye; such altera<lb/>tions as these might very well escape observation unless their attention is particularly drawn to them—seat L 9, which was occupied by the defendant in August, 1883, was as near the door as could be—it is perfectly possible that these interpolations could be made in a short time at the Museum; the double page could not be done there, that must have been' done at home, and afterwards brought to the Museum; it bears traces of haste, the tracing paper is torn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Additions have been made to the Harleian MSS., not many, but of this class, more or less, some are invaluable—it would be malicious to add or correct notes—no reader is allowed to make any mark on any MS. or book—I do not say it was gross carelessness on the part of the officials not to have discovered these additions at once; they have so many to look through and so short a time in which to do it—all these MSS. were entered and indexed before they came into the Museum—these insertions are not indexed, showing that they were made subse<lb/>quently to their coming into the Museum—the MSS. are not all of equal value—the giving up the ticket would not release the reader from all liability—in the winter months the seats are fully occupied; in the summer months the seats are half empty—I have nothing to prove whether these notes are right or wrong—I have merely to say they are additions to the MSS.—we did not purchase these MSS.; they were given to us by the nation—the Government bought them in 1879 as genuine.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a student at the Museum upwards of forty-five years—I have given a good deal of time to antique researches, and have written works on the subject—in the course of 1890 Mr. Leete handed to me letters, documents, and notes relative to the pedigree of the Leete family—Mr. Leete's book had been printed two years before—the documents were handed to me for the purpose of going through them, throwing out what was of no interest, and pre<lb/>serving what Mr. Leete thought of interest—I took them to the Museum and examined the records referred to in the letters—I inspected the Harleian MS. 6,164 and 6,148—I immediately detected that alterations had been made in the MSS.—I called the attention of the authorities of the Museum to them—I have studied both ancient and modern handwriting—I have compared the hand<lb/>writing of the defendant's letters with that in these MSS., and I say they are identical; without a doubt the handwriting is the same.</p>

I lived at 16, Upper Rathbone Place; now I live in Drury Lane—I am an unfortunate—on Saturday night, 21st February, I met the prisoner at the corner of Rathbone Place, Oxford Street, about a quarter to twelve—he was not able to speak English; he put up his five fingers; I understood him to mean would I go with him for five shillings—we went and had a drink, and then I went with him to his room on the second floor at 65, Newman Street—he was the worse for drink—he went into the room first; I followed him; he was at the door—I said, "You no light," and I struck a match—I saw he had this knife in his hand; he kissed it—he took me as if he was going to get hold of me, and he tore my boa to get to my throat; and as he took up the knife I caught hold of the blade and screamed "Murder!"—two lodgers came to the door and burst it open—I had no light in the room till the door was burst open—I then got out of the room and went down the stairs, leaving the prisoner in the room—I remained on the stairs till a constable came about five minutes afterwards—I went to the hospital, where Dr. Soulby attended to me, and then I went to the station and charged the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>, B. M., 4, Lambton Road, Hounslow—on 18th February, about a quarter to eight a.m., I was called to 15, Lamb<lb/>ton Terrace, and in a bedroom upstairs I found an infant on a bed; a little frothy mucus was exuding from the right side of the mouth—the lips were livid; the face was slightly livid, not quite so marked as the lips—the eyes were closed; the body was still warm—the child seemed to be about five or six months old; it was a well-nourished child—there were two little marks on the left side of the neck, where it joins the chest, in front by the side of the windpipe—they were about the size of a six<lb/>pence—they were such marks as might have been produced by pressure on the throat by fingers—I saw no other marks on the face or body—it seemed a healthy, well-nourished child—it seemed to me at that time that the cause of death was strangulation; next day, the 19th, I made a post<lb/>mortem examination—the windpipe contained a small amount of thickish greyish-white fluid—there was some similar coloured fluid in the stomach—there were a certain number of small extravasations on the surface of the lungs—all the other organs of the body were healthy—the post-mortem appearances induced me to modify my opinion as to the strangulation—I came to the conclusion that if there had been strangulation, suffocation had been superadded to it; the appearances were consistent with that condition of things—I consider that there must have been some suffocating agent applied to the face, such as a hand, or a pillow, or anything to stop breathing—if this piece of brace had been put round the mouth that would cause it; it is long enough to go round the neck and over the face; that would prevent the child breathing—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189103090025"/>
               <p>do not think that the marks on the neck would be occasioned by the brace; they were more like finger-marks; pressure by the fingers might cause them—the post-mortem appearances confirmed my opinion that strangulation and then suffocation were the causes of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have heard that the prisoner is a wheelwright—the marks on the neck were not larger than would be caused by his fingers; they seemed to be about that size; the greyish fluid in the mouth and windpipe was partially digested milk, slightly curdled; some of it had gone down to the lungs—there was no injury to the interior of the throat—if the child had been choked I should have expected to find injuries inside, and I do not think the milk would have been in the throat—I do not think there was sufficient fluid to cause a fit—there was nothing to point to violent death except the two marks—the skin of a child of five months is very tender—if there had been any pressure round the neck I should have expected to find redness or some signs of it; the marks were bruises—I think they had been caused within twenty-four hours; you might say within twelve hours; I could not say nearer than that—this is the first time it has been put to me about the brace over the mouth having caused death; the slipping of a pillow or blanket would have been sufficient without the brace—I have examined the brace; there is a slight stain on the outside from ink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The actual cause of death, I think, was suffocation—the neck must have been grasped by some agent, so as to constrict and cause those marks; there was a mark of two thumbs—to cause suffocation the brace must have been held there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Croxley House, Hounslow—I have attended the prisoner for about eleven years—in October, 1880, he had an accident from a fall in the course of his employment as a carpenter—I attended him down to November, 1880; I saw him on and off after that, but I did not attend him again professionally until 1889—I cannot say that I saw any change in him—in June, 1889, I was again called to attend him, for an epileptic fit—I attended him for three or four days, he got better and went back to work—on 15th March, 1890, he had another epileptic fit, on 1st May another, on 13th July another, and also on 22nd September and 16th December—after that he remained, away from his employment for some considerable time, he went back to it about 13th February this year; between those dates I attended him for disease of the nose—he was not strange at that time, he was in his ordinary health—I talked to him, and he answered perfectly rationally—I should hardly say his mind was unhinged down to that time, only after the fits; after the fit he was always in a profound state of melancholy, you could hardly get any answers out of him the next day; the melancholy would gradually go off, till he began work again, each day he would get better, it averaged about three or four days as a rule—I believe I saw him this year, he used to come to my surgery—I did not notice anything peculiar about him then—a man subject to fits one might come on at any time, there would be a tendency to melancholia without actual fits—during the fits a patient is quite irresponsible for what he says and does—while that condition lasted he would be unanswerable for what he said and did.</p>

I am surgeon of Her Majesty Prison at Holloway—the prisoner has been confined there since 19th February—from that time down to yesterday I have had him under my observation—on his admission I made an examination of him in order to arrive at his condition of mind—he was very depressed; I thought him suffering from melancholia—he was dazed and confused—he did not know where he was, and he had no idea of the flight of time—he did not know how long he had been there, or how long he was to stay—he complained of sleeplessness—that is very often the case in melancholia—he said at times he felt so miserable that he contemplated suicide; that often accompanies melancholia—he said he had thought the night before this occurrence that the child was cold and dead—he said he was very fond of the child—he has improved during his confinement; he is rational now, but is still very depressed—he fits apart, and is disinclined to conversa<lb/>tion; takes no interest in what is going on—in my opinion he is not now of sound mind; I do not think he is altogether capable of dis<lb/>tinguishing between right and wrong—on 19th February I think he was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of any act he did—I have heard Mr. Ball's evidence—I have no doubt that the prisoner is an epileptic subject—I agree with Mr. Ball that melancholia almost in<lb/>variably follows an attack of epilepsy, and that during and after such an attack the patient is irresponsible for what he says and does.</p>

I was in Union Street when Haskett made a statement to me, and at the same time pointed out the two prisoners, who were standing on the pavement in Old Street, forty or fifty yards away—they at once ran away—I followed them over a fence, and afterwards found them in the w. c., Elliot pretended to be doing up his trousers; he had not had time even to undo them—Newman was behind the door—when I took Elliot outside he put his hand inside his waistcoat pocket and took some<lb/>thing out—I took hold of his arm, and asked him what he had got—he said, "Nothing," and dropped this watch—in answer to the charge at the station Elliot said he knew nothing about this watch—the prisoners made no answer to the present charge—I found this pawnbrokers ticket on Elliot—he said he had pawned the article himself for a friend.</p>

I live at 70, Temple Street, Hackney Road—at a quarter-past nine on a Monday night I was in the Bethnal Green Road, standing outside the shop next to Mr. Stevenson's, a watchmaker's shop, which is opposite to the police-station—the shop was open, with gas burning in the window—I saw the prisoners come and bash the window in, and put their two hands in and take some jewellery out and run down the next turning—it was done very quickly—I had never seen the prisoners before—I ran after them down Ponderson's Gardens, Jude Street, Old Bethnal Green Road, Poyser Street, to a model lodging-house, where they went in—a policeman ran after them too, and he went into the house and told me to keep downstairs in the area—I waited there till the policemen had searched the house—they came down by themselves, and I went with them to Bethnal Green Police-station,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective J</hi>). On Monday evening, 2nd February, at twenty-five minutes past nine, I received information about this burglary, and I made inquiries and received a description of the prisoners; as the result, at half-past eleven or twenty minutes to twelve I saw Birmingham walking in Cambridge Road, smoking a cigar, and with two other men—he was the worse for drink, and. eating some fish—I saw him throw a fish-bone at a lady, and I took him into custody, and charged him with being drunk and disorderly; and I said, when that was disposed of, he would be detained on suspicion of having broken the jeweller's window in Bethnal Green Road—he said, "Yes, it is all right this time; but you b—, I shall kill you; I will cut your b—guts out one day"—that was in answer to the charge of burglary—I took him to the station and charged him—I left the station and met an informant, and from what he told me at ten minutes to one I apprehended Haley—I told him I should take him into custody on suspicion of having smashed the jeweller's window in Bethnal Green Road, in company with another man—he said, "It could not be me, I have been in the Camden Head public-house, Bethnal Green Road, all the evening"—the Camden Head is immediately opposite Stevenson's shop, next door to the Police-station—he did not say a word about going to the Belmont Music Hall—Haley was taken to the station and detained, and the following morning the prisoners were both placed with other men; Bolton at once identified Birmingham; but he could not say as to the other one—Birmingham was taken to the Police-court to answer the charge of being drunk and disorderly, and an application was made to the Magistrate to discharge him, in order that he might be re-arrested and brought back on this charge—between six and seven the same evening the prisoners were placed among eight or nine other men, and Rothschild identified them—when charged they made no answer—I communicated with Cornish, and met him at the door of the Police-court; he was there to be examined; but the case was remanded, and he was examined on 11th February—I have traced this plan from the parish map hanging in our office—the Belmont Music Hall is about 600 yards from the shop—I could run it in about two minutes—the constable who saw the boy at the dwellings is in the hospital—this watch was found in Ponderson's Gardens, where the prisoners are alleged to have run.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective J</hi>). On Monday evening, 2nd February, it twenty-five minutes past nine, I received information about this burglary, and I made inquiries and received a description of the prisoners; as the result, at half-past eleven or twenty minutes to twelve I saw Birmingham walking in Cambridge Road, smoking a cigar, and with two other men—he was the worse for drink, and. eating some fish—I saw him throw a fish-bone at a lady, and I took him into custody, and charged him with being drunk and disorderly; and I said, when that was disposed of, he would be detained on suspicion of having broken the jeweller's window in Bethnal Green Road—he said, "Yes, it is all right this time; but you b----, I shall kill you; I will cut your b----guts out one day"—that was in answer to the charge of burglary—I took him to the station and charged him—I left the station and met an informant, and from what he told me at ten minutes to one I apprehended Haley—I told him I should take him into custody on suspicion of having smashed the jeweller's window in Bethnal Green Road, in company with another man—he said, "It could not be me, I have been in the Camden Head public-house, Bethnal Green Road, all the evening"—the Camden Head is immediately opposite Stevenson's shop, next door to the Police-station—he did not say a word about going to the Belmont Music Hall—Haley was taken to the station and detained, and the following morning the prisoners were both placed with other men; Bolton at once identified Birmingham; but he could not say as to the other one—Birmingham was taken to the Police-court to answer the charge of being drunk and dis<lb/>orderly, and an application was made to the Magistrate to discharge him, in order that he might be re-arrested and brought back on this charge—between six and seven the same evening the prisoners were placed among eight or nine other men, and Rothschild identified them—when charged they made no answer—I communicated with Cornish, and met him at the door of the Police-court; he was there to be examined; but the case was remanded, and he was examined on 11th February—I have traced this plan from the parish map hanging in our office—the Belmont Music Hall is about 600 yards from the shop—I could run it in about two minutes—the constable who saw the boy at the dwellings is in the hospital—this watch was found in Ponderson's Gardens, where the prisoners are alleged to have run.</p>

I am assistant to the post-mistress at Sudbury—in consequence of a telegram about stolen orders I was directed to look at every order which came in—on 20th January the prisoner brought an order for 10s. and another for 5s.—I am quite sure of him—noticing by the numbers that they were two of the stolen orders, I rang for the post mistress—I asked the prisoner where he got them; he said, "My brother sent them to me"—I asked his brother's name and address, and he wrote down, "G. Clements, 6, Colne Road, Twickenham"—I asked if he could call again; he said, "What time?"—I said, "Three o'clock"—he did not call at three.</p>

               <p>had no idea of that section, but it was done and he must abide by it—he said he held the lease of the Pall Mall shop, and the landlord wanted possession of the premises, and he thought he should get some respectable compensation, and should be able to pay his creditors; that the lease was charged to the extent of £200, and he was willing to charge it to Messrs. Porter, to secure their claim of £364 and a bill coming for a greater amount—I arranged to see Messrs. Porter, and to communicate with him again, and in the evening I called at Pall Mall and informed him that Messrs. Porter were willing to give him time, provided he could secure their plan; I suggested that he should give a second charge on the lease, and he arranged to obtain it for my inspection, and I told him if he could induce Mr. Bolingbroke to accept bills at a shorter date, so as to become marketable, Messrs. Porter might accept them—he said he would send the lease, but he did not send it till after I issued execution—I made myself acquainted with it, and returned it as valueless; I asked him how much of Porter's goods were at Cockspur Street—he said, "About £300"—this is the judgment-paper for £365 4s. 5d.—another bill fell due shortly after that—I did not see Chapple after judgment was signed, but after the bankruptcy he called and made the proposal of 6s. 8d.—Porter and Son's debt was £680.</p>

I am managing clerk to Wilson, Bristow, Carpmael. and Co, solicitors, of Copthall Buildings—they act for the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company—I produce the assignment of the lease of 29, Cockspur Street, dated 3rd January, 1891; Francis Broomfield and Bolingbroke joined in it; the consideration was £600—this does not refer to the fixtures—the other papers are an equitable charge of February 24th, 1890, by Chapple, and another equitable charge of May, 1890, and a mortgage of August 20th from Chapple to Bloomfield.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Crown Court, Cheapside—I was the solicitor to Mr. Bloomfield in the legal mortgage; the other two were put into my hands after they were executed—I prepared the mortgage of August 20th—I did not then know of the agreement of 16th August by which Chapple handed over to Bolingbroke the whole of the stock—I was not present when the £350 was paid on the equitable</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi>. Bolingbroke's solicitor had the balance, £80 or £90—it is possible that Bolingbroke did not receive a farthing of it after paying the solicitor's and agent's costs—there was £509 mortgage money, about £9 4s. for interest, and £13 9s. my costs—I know nothing about the auctioneer's charges—I should think £31 very excessive—I know nothing about taxes to be paid; there were probably Mr. Tuff's costs—I had given seven days' notice to pay off the mortgage, and threatened to foreclose if he did not—I subsequently took pro<lb/>ceedings in Chancery to foreclose, and Bolingbroke had ultimately to pay £21 costs; he should not have defended it if he had no defence—I do not think that Bolingbroke would have been there still carrying on the business but for the proceedings on my part; he desired to get rid of the premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chartered accountant, of 8, Old Jewry—I was appointed trustee on 23rd October in Chapple's bankruptcy—the official receiver collected £110, and handed over £64 or £65, which came over after he had deducted his expense—I proceeded to realise the estate; I sold the stock-in-trade at 1, Pall Mall for £329; Mr. Harroway was the nominal purchaser—Mrs. Chapple conducted the business, but she did not have the stock, a lot of stock was transferred from Cock<lb/>spur Street, since the sale to the Royal Mail, I believe—the policies realised £24, and there are £50 or £60 worth of debts—we have declared a dividend of 2s. in the pound—£3,415 debt was proved—I expect to pay another 2s. 6d. in the pound if Bolingbroke's two other bills are paid, which are due next year—I have had all the assets from the first bill; they formed part of the 2s. in the pound—the landlord had to be paid, because he had a preferential claim on 1, Pall Mall—no household furniture was delivered up to me—I never had possession of the stock-in-trade and fixtures at 29, Cockspur Street—I took Counsel's opinion as to setting aside the sale of 29, Cockspur Street and taking possession—I was aware of the circumstances of the transfer before Bolingbroke's examination at the private sitting; but I found he was selling the stock and not replenishing it—I had a committee of inspection to assist me—I applied through my solicitor for the order to prosecute both the defendants—but for this transfer I should have received whatever the stock at 29, Cockspur Street would have fetched, and the balance of the mortgage to Fracknell and Co.—the lease at Pall Mall was nearly out, but there was a bankruptcy clause; I tried to get a fresh lease.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi>. But for the bankruptcy clause, it would have been reasonable to assume that the lease of 1, Pall Mall was worth something—pulling down that corner block has been talked about, but a person having that lease would not be entitled to compensation with that clause in the lease, it is open to some doubt—I might, if I chose, have carried on the business till I saw it necessary for the beneficial winding up, and I did so for a fortnight—I sold the stock-in-trade—I made no objection to Mrs. Chapple carrying on the business; the only point was as to the transfer of the stock from Cockspur Street there—I actually sold the stock at Pall Mall, and had nothing more to do with the business—if the Cockspur Street business had come into my hands as trustee I could have made more than £600 out of the lease and stock—I sold the fixture and such of the stock as remained, as a going concern, at much higher than I could have sold it at a bankrupt sale—I do not suppose I could</p>

               <p>have got more than £630 for the lease and fixtures—I knew there was a mortgage of £500 which I should have had to pay off—I should have had the solicitor's costs, but not the auctioneer's, if the Cockspur Street business had formed part of the assets; I should not have earned on the business—I said at the Police-court, "Considering all the circumstances, 1 cannot say whether I should have adopted or disclaimed the lease if it had been in the possession of the bankrupt when I was appointed trustee"—if a lease is charged, that is one of the things which would influence me in disclaiming it—it was in conjunction with the committee of inspection that I decided not to take any proceedings in bankruptcy to set aside these transfers to Bolingbroke after Bolingbrokes private examination and after legal advice, and the committee of inspection would not give me leave; they said they did not consider it advisable, as the stock was reduced so low, to run the risk of being beaten—there always is a risk of being beaten—I have no reason to dispute and no reason to believe that Bolingbroke paid £100 to Chapple for the furni<lb/>ture—the bill for £120 was the first bill of Bolingbroke's, which was met in February, made payable at and honoured at the Consolidated Bank, Charing Cross; that is Bolingbroke's bank—the other bills are mad payable at the same bank—beyond the furniture and the stock sent to Cockspur Street I do not think there is any other asset which has not been delivered up to me—one reason of my complaint of this transfer and of my not taking over the business is that the stock has been reduced at Cockspur Street—there was not so much stock there when Chapple was bankrupt as when the place was originally stocked—if Chapple had been carrying it on all the time, I do not think the effect of keeping up the stock would be simply incurring more debt, because he would have to buy cheaper than he sold, and would make a profit.</p>

I am a cabinetmaker, living at 31, Bridport Place—about one o'clock on Sunday morning, 15th February, I was in the New North Road, just against Christ Church, when the prisoner and two others accosted me—the prisoner called me a dirty dog, and said I had indecently assaulted a woman on the New North Road Bridge—I had not seen any woman—the prisoner caught hold of me by the throat and threw me to the ground, and knelt on my chest, while his two con<lb/>federates rifled my pockets, and took two shillings and fivepence from my left trousers pocket—when the prisoner caught me by the throat it prevented me from calling out—I did not suffer very much pain, but just enough to know it was so—I felt it next morning, and I merely put it down as a cold, as I suffer very much with my throat—the two men got away—a constable took the prisoner off me—Page was in the roadway at the time.</p>

Barlow," and on the London Trading Bank, Coleman Street—that is the same bank as that on the cheque sent to Mr. Yates—while I was looking at it the prisoner suddenly rushed from the bed where he was sitting, pushed the table on to me, and snatched the cheque from my hands, tore it, and put it into his mouth, and threw himself face downwards on to the bed—I, Abbott, Wackett, and the prisoner struggled; we could not get the cheque out of his mouth—as soon as we released him somewhat he said, "It is gone"—my hand was injured—when he calmed down a little I said, "You have done yourself no good by that act"—he said, "What do you mean? It was the receipt for the last quarter's rent"—he was conveyed to Moor Lane Police-station, and later in the day he was charged; he made no reply to the charge—this cheque for £3, purporting to be signed by Becker, was brought to me on 16th December, the day it is dated, and the day follow<lb/>ing the robbery—these cheques, signed "H.

               <p>corner; but I was doing something else at the time, and do not remember what was said about it—m opportunity for seeing the cheque was momentary; I merely picked it up and opened it—when we were told it was a receipt the woman did not say, "I have got another," nor did she show us another piece of paper—I said, "Never mind that, I have got some more in my pocket exactly like it;" when the prisoner said it was a receipt for the last quarter's rent; I referred to the other cheques I had in my pocket—it was in answer to the man, not to the woman—she said, "That is a receipt for £5, part of a loan I owe," mentioning to whom she owed it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I was with Lythell and Abbott at 27, Howe Street—Lythell told the prisoner he would be charged with breaking and entering the office, and stealing and receiving a cheque-book, and forging and uttering cheques from the book—the prisoner made no reply, but went on dressing himself—Abbott went upstairs—Lythell found something, which I took to be a cheque like this, with a pink part about an inch wide, behind the glass on the mantelshelf—the prisoner jumped, pressed the table towards Lythell, and snatched it, tore it, and put it into his mouth, and dived into the bed face downwards—Lythell said, "Stop him, he has got a cheque," and before I could do so, I called to Abbott—we struggled violently for some time, and then the prisoner said, "It is gone"—afterwards at the station Russell picked out the prisoner from twelve others without difficulty.</p>

Clerkenwell Police Court against the lad for absconding from his work. I have also received several insulting letters from his parents.

On 28th October I was in charge of the door of the Old Court on the right hand side of the dock, the door by which solicitors and their clerks are allowed to enter—about three p.m. I saw Baker at the door—I said, "Who are you?"—he said, "I am a witness in the Boaler case"—I said, "Have you a subpoena?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Then I cannot let you in there," and closed the door again—a few minutes afterwards I saw him sitting, as if he were a juror, in the place where the jurors-in-waiting sit—I had had a communication from Pierce, and in consequence of that, and of what had passed between myself and the prisoner I went to the constable at that door, and in my presence the prisoner was requested to leave that place—he did so—about two minutes afterwards I happened to look up in the gallery, and saw him sitting in the front, leaning over.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a juror on the trial of Bernard Boaler in October last in this Court—I was duly empanelled and sworn with the other jurors to try Boaler's case—two of the other jurors were Mr. Hasted and Mr. Perry—I live at Hammersmith, and am a visitor to the London School Board—I first saw the prisoner on the first or second day of Boaler's trial in this Court—he first spoke to me on 28th October—after the adjournment on that day Mr. Hasted and I left the Court, and were walking towards Ludgate Hill, when the prisoner came up and said to us that he thought Boaler was badly treated, or was a badly used individual—he volunteered that statement—I had seen him in Court before, but I did not know him, and I had never spoken to him—I believe I asked him who he was, and he said he was a former policy-holder in this company—I said it was a wonder the policy-holders had not supported Boaler by finding him counsel—we said this going down Ludgate Hill—he rather vilified the directors, calling them, to the best of my belief, b----y</p>

               <p>rogues or blasted rogues—he said Boaler had done a good deal of good in unravelling these matters; he thought he had gone a little too far in. this case, that he was wrong in this case—when we got to the bottom of Ludgate Hill the prisoner asked us if we were going to have a glass,. and I had had the intention previously of going into the King Lud to have a glass of refreshment—we rather hesitated at first when he invited us, but Mr. Hasted, myself, and the prisoner went in; I had a glass of ale, and Mr. Hasted had some ginger beer or something of that kind; the prisoner paid—we continued in conversation for a few minutes—the prisoner asked us where we lived, and I told him at Hammersmith—just as we got outside the door coming out (we were only in there about two minutes) he told me that if I went and saw Mr. Piatt, of Hammersmith, he would be able to tell me all about it, all about the company—he told me Piatt was an auctioneer, and described where he lived; he did not tell me the number of the house—he said, "If you will go and see Platt, the auctioneer, at Hammersmith, he will tell you," or "give you information about the company"—I told him I might go an A see him—the prisoner said he could see that the jury were against Boaler very much, and he was very sorry to see it—Mr. Hasted said to me in the prisoner's presence that if he lived as near Mr. Piatt as I did he should go and see him; that he thought it was a pity, if Boaler were innocent, that he should suffer—I did not go and see Mr. Piatt—I went away then—on Monday morning, 3rd November, the day the trial was resumed, I saw the prisoner just outside the door of the Court in the Old Bailey, about 10.15—he came up and asked me if I had been to see Mr. Piatt—I said. No, I had been better advised—I also advised him not to have anything at all to say to me or to any of the rest of the jurymen, or he would probably get into serious trouble—he pooh-poohed the matter, thought it was rather a light matter, he did not think anything of it—then I left him—I had no further conversation with him till the case was over and we had returned our verdict, and were coming away—he was coming into Court, and he asked me what the result was—about the middle of the day that the verdict was given the prisoner was in the gallery of the Court, and I told the Recorder that I had been spoken to on the evening of 28th—something had cropped up previously that made me volunteer the remark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, at Twickenham—I had the misfortune to be one of the jurymen on the trial of Bernard Boaler—on 28th October I was leaving the Court with Mr. Stevenson, when the prisoner came up and began a conversation by saying it was rather a rough time for Boaler, or "things are going rough," something of that kind—he addressed his conversation to Mr. Stevenson mostly; I heard what he said—he said he had been a policy or a shareholder in this company, and that he had lost £400 or £500 in it through the directors, and he said something about a rough time for Boaler and about the money that Boaler had lost—Stevenson asked why, if he had such an interest in the affair, he did not have counsel—the prisoner said he was too poor, the shareholders ought to support him or something—this conversation was going down Ludgate Hill—he asked me to have a drink, and I refused—he asked Stevenson, and he said, "Yes, come on," and we went into the King Lud, and I had ginger-beer and Steven<lb/>son had beer, and the prisoner, who paid for it all, had something—in the King Lud he gave us an account of how the directors came to get into the position they were in; he said something about b----thieves or scamps or something of that kind, and that one of the leading men in the Chancery matter owed the company some money—there was some conversation about the affairs of the company, and he suggested that Stevenson had better see two or three men belonging to Hammersmith or Hounslow—he mentioned Mr. Piatt, of Hammersmith, and said he should see him to know the position of affairs of these directors of the company, and about Boaler—I said if I lived as near as Stevenson I should go, it would be a shame to see an innocent man prosecuted—he also spoke of Boaler losing £11,000 through this affair—I or Stevenson asked where he had got the money from—he said it was not his money, it was his wife's money—we came out, and he went away—on 3rd November, the day our verdict was returned, just before we came into Court, a little after ten, I came up Ludgate Hill and turned into the Old Bailey, and saw the prisoner speaking to Mr. Perry—I went and had a word with Perry, nodded, and beckoned to him—I did not hear what the prisoner said to him; I know he was speaking about the case—I and Perry then went into a public-house, and left the prisoner standing there—when we came out of the public-house I saw the prisoner again; Perry was not with me then—the prisoner told me he thought the case would fall through, as the opposition pr prosecution thought of compromising it; something of that sort—there was something about offering £8,000, and Boaler wanted £10,000, and he said, "I did not get the information through Boaler; I got it through some of his friends"—I cannot say if Mr. Clay's name was mentioned—I went into Court, leaving the prisoner in the street.</p>

               <p>did not say Boaler had lost his wife's money in joint stock companies, but through this company—he spoke of the Grosvenor Bank, and said Boaler had brought the directors to prosecution and got them fourteen years—I believe £11,000 was mentioned going down Ludgate Hill as the sum Boaler had lost through buying shares in this Briton Company and being done out of them; I reckoned that was what he was trying to impress on us; that the £1 1,000 was lost by the directors being dishonest and doing him out of his shares—I cannot say if he said Broadhurst and Holman were highly honourable men—he said that Boaler had overstepped the mark that time, and had gone too far—I and Stevenson were going to have a drink; we usually did when we came out of Court—the prisoner being a stranger, I refused when he asked me to drink with him, but when we got further down the Hill he asked Stevenson, and Stevenson said he would, and he said to me, "Come on, old man" and we went in—I should not think a bottle of ginger-beer would buy me—he asked us to have another drink, we refused and came away—on 3rd November, I believe, I spoke to the prisoner before I went into the public-house with Perry—I did not want to have anything to say to him, and I gave Perry a wink and went away—on 28th October Stevenson told the prisoner he thought he would go and see Piatt, after my suggesting that I should go—I was not there on 3rd November when the prisoner spoke to Stevenson.</p>

As far as I can see, I cannot see that he has proved anything"—he said, "Well, you know, he has lost all his money in public com<lb/>panies"—I said, "Had he any money to lose?"—he said, "Oh, yes! it was his wife's money"—I said, "These directors at all events seem very honourable men"—he said, "Oh! but I know, I was on the committee of inquiry "or" the committee of investigation, and I know them well; they are far from what they should be, "or" not what they should be"—a great deal of evidence was given as to the committee of inquiry—the prisoner said, "I always opposed the sending out of that circular, it was a mistake"—he asked me if I recollected the Grosvenor Bank affair; I said, "I have some recollection of it; was not there a conviction in that case?"—he said, "Yes, and Boaler was the man that brought conviction home to those directors, only, unfortunately, he got himself entangled in the matter, and got himself two or three months," I forget which—while I was talking to the prisoner Mr. Hasted came up and gave me a slight push, or he may have stopped there half a minute or less and then given me a push, and he said,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The committee was brought to inquire into the rob<lb/>bery by a secretary of the company of £120,000 and interest paid on mortgages, altogether about a quarter of a million; the robbery extended over about twenty years—it was found out after his death—I was only connected with the company at that time as a policyholder—I think Boaler was not interested in the matter till after the death of that secre<lb/>tary; I am not sure there were not proceedings earlier—the result of the loss of a quarter of a million was that the policies were reduced in value by order of the Court—Boaler did more than harass the company, he lost about £30,000 for the policyholders—he was prosecuted by order of the board—after Boaler's conviction and the mention in open court of this matter by a juryman, it was determined to lay the facts before the Treasury solicitor, who said that if the association would issue a summons and get a committal, the Treasury would take the matter up—the board on that got a committal—since the indictment against the prisoner in January was quashed there has been no resolu<lb/>tion of the board to go on; we have nothing to say about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary and actuary of the Briton Medical—I attended as a witness throughout Boaler's trial—before the Court opened on 3rd November I was with Mr. Clay and saw the prisoner outside—Mr. Clay drew my attention, and I saw him in conversation with Perry and Hasted—after the jurymen had gone towards the Court I, being then alone, saw the prisoner; I kept observation on the prisoner in consequence of instructions from Mr. Clay—when Perry and Hasted went into the public-house opposite the Court, before going into Court, the prisoner planted himself on the other side of the way, right oppo<lb/>site the public-house—I observed him from the archway through which the judges enter—when the jurymen came out of the public-house the prisoner walked across and spoke to them—afterwards as Boaler was coming into Court the prisoner saw him and took him into the vestibule, and they had a lengthened and evidently important conversation for three or four minutes.</p>

I am the aunt of the last witness, and live at 49, Adolphus Road—I occupy a sitting-room on the half-landing on the first floor—on 9th January I was occupying the same bedroom with the prisoner, with two of my little nieces—on that day I left the bedroom about half-past two all right, made my bed and dusted the room—on Friday evening, 20th February, I went out about twenty minutes to eight—before doing so I went up to my bedroom to put my bonnet on—it was perfectly safe when I left it—I came back about ten minutes past nine—on 23rd February, about half-past six, I was in my sitting-room with my three nieces, Lillian, Ethel and Bessie—they had been there about three quarters of an hour when I noticed that something was burning.</p>

I received instructions, and on February 9th, shortly after 9 am., I saw Lovejoy leave the Queen's Music Hall, High Street, Poplar; I followed him to the Midland Junction Station, and saw him go into the ticket collector's box and sit down—Cook, the ticket collector, was apparently sorting tickets—Cook came out of the box and cancelled some tickets—Lovejoy went to the desk and appeared to be sorting tickets—an up train then came in, and he came out of the box with his hands in his pockets and assisted to shut the doors—he had no business whatever in the box—he travelled by the 8.40 train to North Greenwich, where I got out with him—he passed the ticket collector, Inspector Coote, and gave up no ticket—he went into the ticket office, and came out and crossed the ferry, and gave up a single ferry ticket—about six o'clock that evening I was watching at South Greenwich Station—he lives there—he crossed the ferry and gave no ticket to the pierman; he went by the 6.15 train to Millwall Junction, where Cook was again on duty, and gave up a single buff ticket—next day he did the same; the process was repeated, but he did not go into the box at Millwall Junction—Mr. Lee, the station<lb/>master, handed me the ticket he gave up on February 9th—he knew who I was—it was a green ticket, No. 7,228, dated February 9th, and available to the 18th—on 11th January I again saw him shortly after 8 a.m.; the same thing occurred, and he went into the box—no ticket was given up, but he went into the ticket office at North Greenwich and booked for the ferry, which belongs to the Steamboat Company—on 12th February the same thing occurred; Herbert was with me—on getting to</p>

               <p>South Greenwich he gave up ferry ticket 9,565—I went up to him and said, "I am a detective officer; I want you a minute"—he said, "I hope so, I hope so"—I said, "I am going to give you in custody for stealing the half of a ticket from the ticket collector's box, Millwall Junction"—I knew nothing of Lain then—I told him I was also going to charge him with travelling without a ticket—he said, "Don't you usually send a letter in cases of this kind?"—I said, "Not if it is a case of felony"—he said, "What would you do if the tickets were planted?"—I understood planted for him—I handed him over to the detective sergeant, and he was taken to the station and charged—coming back in the train he said, "There are more in this besides me"—I said, "You know best"—on the same day, in consequence of information, I saw Lain at Poplar Station about 12.30—he was a collector at Millwall Junction and Poplar Station—it was his duty to receive tickets—Herbert was with me—I said, "Your name is Lain?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "A man named Lovejoy, a fireman at the Queen's Music Hall, has been arrested this morning for stealing a ticket from the ticket box at Millwall Junction; he has made a serious accusation against you; I think you had better come with me and clear yourself"—he said, "Very good"—I said, "Lovejoy says you have sent him tickets to enable him to travel without paying his fare; do you know him at all?"—he said, "Yes; I only know him as a frequent passenger going through"—I said, "Have you ever written to him, or given him tickets?"—he said, "No; I have never written to him or sent him tickets in my life"—on 12th February Lovejoy made the written statement, in my presence, to Superintendent Robinson, which is attached to the depositions—I cautioned him; it was read over in Lain's presence—it was signed in my presence. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I, Charles Henry Lovejoy, fireman, Queen's Palace, Poplar, state:—I have been travelling by the Great Eastern Railway from South Greenwich to Millwall Junction backwards and forwards daily. I come to Millwall Junction in the evening and return in the morning, as I am night fireman at the music-hail. For a little over the first two years I paid my fare, but J. E. Searle, booking clerk, Millwall Junction, one day said to me as I was giving my ticket up, There is no occasion for you to pay your fare, as the other firemen, policemen, and postmen do not pay theirs; we shall make it all right for you. ' and he then gave me three or four tickets (green) to enable me to travel from South Greenwich to Millwall Junction, and said, 'When I am not here go to Lain, and he will give them to you. ' Shortly after that I heard Searle had left, and J. C. Lain has supplied me ever since with tickets, two or three of a morning when going home. I have occasionally given those tickets to others who were employed at the hall with me, and others I have destroyed. I have never given money to Lain, but I have occasionally given him drink, and passes when he wanted them for the hall. When Lain was on evening duty he has sent the tickets to me at the hall by a boy (a dock messenger known by the name of Punch). The last time was on Tuesday evening, 10th instant, when he sent me three, two green ones, and the yellow one found in my possession with the date clipped out. I used the one yesterday, and the other is the one found on me with the yellow one I have mentioned. The green tickets are avail<lb/>able from South Greenwich to Millwall Junction, and cover the next day; and it was some of those, that were given up in the morning, that Lain</p>

               <p>gave to me which enabled me to come back the same night, The baff tickets are available from Millwall Junction to South Greenwich. I used to obtain these tickets from the boatman, but recently I have been unable to do so, and have got tickets from Millwall Junction to North Greenwich from a porter whom I can identify at North Greenwich station. The last occasion this man gave me a ticket was on Monday or Tuesday last. I have no recollection of receiving any railway tickets from Inspector Coote, but I have received boat tickets from him; I always pass him without giving a ticket up. I thought he must have known that I received tickets, as he allowed me to pass without giving tickets up. There was a porter, Franklyn, at the Millwall Junction, who used to, give me tickets, but he left some time ago, and I understand that he was at Fenchurch Street. I have never given any tickets for the hall to either the station<lb/>master at North Greenwich, Millwall Docks, or Millwall Junction, or any other station.—<hi rend="smallCaps">CHAS. H. LOVEJOY.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 55, Old Broad Street, and have acted for Sir Eustace Piers, who brought an action for an account and several other things against the defendants—this is an official copy of the writ—there was an order on 29th May, 1889, that it was to be tried by Mr. Ridley, the official assignee—this is it—it was tried on 29th July and. subsequent dates, and Read was called as a witness on his own behalf, and said that he had paid Sir Eustace Piers a cheque for £812 14s., dated. September 1st, 1887, in discount for a promissory note for £1,212 14s.—lie said that the £400 was for his profit. (<hi rend="italic">The promissory note was here put in; it was for</hi> £1,212 14s., <hi rend="italic">repayable by instalments, and in default of one instalment the balance was to become due; it was endorsed</hi> 26,619)—I had inspected Bead's books, and he afterwards admitted that no cash had passed in respect of it—the £812 14s. appeared on each side of his bank pass-book—he said he had cashed the cheque himself on 3rd September,. 1887—he was asked how he cashed it; he explained that he had debited Sir E. Piers with the amount of an overdue bill and some expenses and interest, and had paid him the balance in cash, £275 3s. 6d.; he also said he had not enough cash in the office, so he</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor—before 1885 I was the proprietor of, and the only existing partner in, St. George's Mineral Works—the name of the firm was Ormerod, Grierson, and Co.—they are extensive works, the aggregate income up to 1887 was between £5,000 and £6,000 a year profit for the whole works—in 1885 I decided to raise some money—I became acquainted with Mr. Hanrott, a solicitor, who introduced me to Read, the defendant, who was a money-lender, at 71, Fleet Street, under the name of the London Bank—I had advances of money from him—on 15th July, 1887, I raised £500 from Read and Hanrott, for which I gave two deeds securing in form a bonus of £3,500 for the £500 that was lent me for two years, afterwards the. £3,500 was reduced by letter to £2,500. (<hi rend="italic">An indenture, dated June 17th</hi>, 1887, <hi rend="italic">between E F Piers and E. J. Read was here put in; also another of July 15th, between the same parties.</hi>)—bills were given for £1,750, but the amount really advanced was £250 each—the debentures are of the nominal value of £3,050 each—having given those securities, certain advances were made to me on the hypothecation. of the debts, and on September 1st I saw Read at his office in Fleet Street about some executions which there were in the works at Man<lb/>chester—an arrangement had been made for paying them out, and I required to raise money for the purpose of carrying out that arrange<lb/>ment—Read. arranged to advance me £812 14s. on my promissory note for £1,212 14s., and a charge on debentures which he had—this is my promissory note—I signed it and handed it to him, and he drew this cheque for £812 14s. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I endorsed it, and he took it back—I received no money from him—Mr. Read and Mr. Hanrott went to Manchester to pay out the execution, and I went down next morning and met them—one of them, in the presence of the other, said that the arrangement of the day before would not be carried out; he gave no reason, but said that Mr. Hanrott would purchase out and out, the £5,000 worth of debentures which had been mortgaged for the advance at 9s. in the £1, and an account of £2,250 was produced—Mr. Hanrott's costs were £200—other payments had been made, that left a balance of £1,849, and £1,430 was wanted to pay out the execution creditors—Mr. Bead was to advance that to Mr. Hanrott, provided I guaranteed the re<lb/>payment</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was a statement of amounts due from Ormerod and Co.</hi>)—advances had been made to the company weekly—I do not know what this £912 14s. is; I thought it referred to "bills; I made no observation to Read about it, he read out some bills—we went into the account, and I accepted his figures, and signed this statement that the company were indebted to Read £588 2s. 10s.—the company had nothing whatever to do with the note for £1,212—an indenture was signed by the company on April 10th, giving Read security for the balance of £281.</p>

I was sole proprietor in Ormerod, Grierson and Co. in 1885—I have been in the business since 1868—I was thirty years of age when I joined it, and until then I had had no experience of the business—it was returning from £5,000 to £6,000 a year; it was in a bad condition when I joined it, and it improved—it went from bad to worse when I got into the hands of your clients, not before—I cannot swear that the profits were £1,600 per annum, or an average of three years, because I have not the books before me—it was not being carried on at a loss from 1885 to 1888; between £5,000 and £6,000 a year was the average profit for ten years—I think the first time I saw Mr. Read was at the close of 1886—I have known Hanrott since 1883; I did not press him to find me money on almost any terms, but I paid very ex<lb/>orbitant terms—in 1886 I had a good many writs served on me for the claims in the business—I think the Sheriff first entered into possession of my premises at the end of 1886—I cannot tell you whether it was early in 1886—he was in possession for I should think a dozen writs in 1886; he was never out of possession from 1886 to September, 1887; he stayed in more than a year; I think the sum he was in for was £3,040; there were about thirty creditors; I daresay some were under—I was not pressed for my own private uses—I could not meet the wages of the men at the concern at Manchester, and before I met Mr. Read at the end of 1886 I could not keep out the writs and executions, or provide for the wages of my men—I had moved in a good position in Manchester,</p>

               <p>and was apparently in the possession of a good business, and it is a good one now—I had bankers at Manchester—I had not tried everywhere to raise money before I had transactions with the London Bank, Fleet Street—if I had called my creditors together I should have had all the money—I had applied to my banker before I went to Mr. Bead; he did not do it because he objected to my transactions, because I had got mixed up with money-lenders, and then, I am sorry to say, I decided to have transactions with Mr. Bead—I ceased to have a banking account any<lb/>where about 1st September, 1888—I was in the hands of money-lenders—I had not been to eight or nine loan offices to try and raise money before I went to Mr. Bead—I turned the business of Ormerod, Grierson and Co. into a limited company in January, 1887; the capital was £100,000—Mr. Hanrott and I signed the articles of association—I regarded him as my friend—the capital consisted of 500 debentures at £60 each, and £75,000 in shares—I took the whole of that for the business which I assigned—the trade debts of Ormerod and Co. were between £5,000 and £6,000, but there was £28,000 altogether—the debentures were to be allotted to me under the contract; I do not know whether the contract was obliged to disclose that—I first knew Mr. Eley, the solicitor, about 1882 or 1883, and I am glad to bay he has been acting as my solicitor since then—he was also to be secretary to the company at £3 a week; it was a private company, and did not require much of his time—thirty signatories constituted the board of directors-two formed a quorum—Mr. Hanrott did not do much—Mr. Eley, Mr. Hanrott, and Mr. Rowbottom attended to the business, but with the exception of signing, Mr. Rowbottom did not attend to it—I sold some of the debentures at four shillings in the £ to a client—I cannot give you the date—I believe I wanted £200 on 12th February, 1887, and sold some debentures I believe at over five shillings to the Sheriff's officer—Mr. Collis was my manager for many years both before and after the formation of the company—in 1887 I was still further pressed, and it is quite possible that I agreed on 25th April, 1887, that if £5,000 could be raised for six months on debentures I would pay Mr. Hanrott £2,000 for procuring it—Mr. Ward was the Sheriff's officer—I asked Mr. Hanrott to get me money; I was not particular upon what terms—Mr. Ward was still in possession in the spring of 1887—in 1887 I pressed Mr. Hanrott to see Bead to help me—Bead always insisted that before he made a further advance the Sheriff must go out of possession—I got the £500 in July, for which I promised to give £250 premium—the arrangement may have been made in June—I was pressed on 23rd June, 1887; I believed they were going to make me a bankrupt, and again in July, so much that I was willing to pay £7,000 if I could get a loan of £2,500—I was also very much pressed in private matters during July and August—I understood that £1,300 was wanted in September, 1887; that was not to get the Sheriff out—Mr. Turnbull is a solicitor—possibly Mr. Read told me that he had received a telegram from Mr. Turnbull, that £1,300 was required to make the Sheriff withdraw, but my mind is a per<lb/>fect blank about it—I cannot tell you whether he also said that Mr. Turnbull required him to go to Manchester that night to make arrangements—I did not then ask Bead to let me have some money on my own private account—I daresay I did in</p>

               <p>£150 short, and Read said he would advance that money, provided he was paid back by weekly instalments at the rate of £10, which I agreed to—£150 was to be paid him in respect of money coming for the £812 cheque; it was out of the £812 for a particular purpose—it certainly was not to come out of the moneys coming from the £812 cheque; the £812 formed part of what was to go to the creditors—my case is that that transaction of 1st September, which contemplate! one method of raising money to pay claims, was abandoned because of what took place at Manchester, and did not become operatives—it was not agreed that the £150 required should come out of the money from the £812 cheque; I misunderstood your question before, when I said it was—I came back to London—I will not swear I did not visit Mr. Bead on 3rd September; I don't think I did—it is quite possible I called at 71, Fleet Street on 3rd September, because Read paid the wages weekly; I should say I did not, but if I did I may have gone to see if the wages were paid—by what took place at Manchester the whole of the negotiations of the 1st September came to an end, and all these documents of 1st September became of no value—the cheque and promissory note became of no value—I ought to have had them back again—I never asked for them, and never got any documents back—it would not be right to give effect to any of them—the transfer for shares ought to be given up to me—I don't know whether within five days of being at Manchester I effected a transfer of those very shares to Read—the transfer given on 1st September being of no avail, Read was not entitled to call for a transfer of those shares into his name or that of his nominee—I should say I did not on 8th September, as chairman, pass that transfer into Read's name; I don't know from memory unless you show me the document—Eley acted as secretary to the company; I was chairman—I have not seen this document before; I should say it is in Mr. Eley's Jerk's writing—I don't remember that the transfer of shares from 12,301 to 13,800, dated 1st September, had come to the office of Grierson and Co. for registration and transfer into the name of Read—I suppose as chairman I ought to know of transfers taking place—the charge on the debentures equally fell through—this is the instrument I gave on 1st September for interest on deben<lb/>tures, where Cochrane's name appears; it is null and void—I find on it Cochrane's name as the person who had had a charge on the debentures in respect of which I was going to charge Read—MESSRS. Hepburn, Son, and Cutcliffe were solicitors acting for Cochrane in Sep<lb/>tember, 1887, within two or three weeks of my return from Manchester; I know them—interest was in arrears in respect of the debentures—I don't know if I asked Cochrane to take promissory notes for the interest; I think not, they would not—I think that a bill was given, because they would not wait—I don't remember if Cochrane were willing to do it, if other persons who had a charge on their shares would not object; I have a good memory—I think I have seen Mr. Lord, an accountant, on this business; I don't think I met any member of Hepburn, Son, and Cutcliffe till afterwards—I saw a member of the firm with Mr. Lord, about the end of September, I should say—I daresay I wished that gentleman to ask Mr. Cochrane to give a receipt for the interest on the debentures on Ormerod, Grierson, and Co., taking a bill for the amount; it is possible—I don't remember if the gentleman from Hepburn's informed me that</p>

I know nothing about it—I have had no account of interest outstanding in, respect of three transactions at the end of August—I cannot produce a single cheque of mine for payment of interest between February and September, 1887—I will not swear that there was not £200 at the end of August owing for interest or money which had been lent me—Read did not tell me with respect to the advance of money on the private account that there would be about £512 due and owing for outstanding items, expenses and costs, and that there was about £300 which I could have—I agreed to pay £400 for the company's purposes—on September 1st I signed a promissory note for £1,212, and endorsed a cheque for £812—I did not produce the guarantee of the company—I did not say that although this was for my private business the company guarantee could be procured—I never procured the company guarantee, Mr. Read produced one signed by Mr. Hanrott on September 1st—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave him a charge on that day on certain debentures—I do not think some of them had been charged four times; you have got the documents—I also gave this further charge on my debentures of September 1st (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mr. Read got all the security he could out of me—I believe I gave him a transfer on November 1st of certain shares standing in my name—before going to Manchester on 2nd September, in addition to the arrangement made with respect to the £812 matter, there was also a discussion with Hanrott to meet the claims at Manchester by a sale of debentures—the whole of the claims, includ<lb/>ing the Sheriff's, were not to be met by a sale of debentures to Hanrott; there was no such proposal—£1,300 was all I thought was requisite at Manchester—I had negotiations before going to Manchester to raise the money by a sale of debentures to Hanrott; they fell through—I had previously seen Hanrott and Read—I went to Manchester on the 2nd—I had left the promissory note and cheque in Read's possession, with the documents—he was not to keep those for the private advance until the claims at Manchester had been paid off—all the money Read was to take to Manchester was £812 148.—it was not arranged on that occasion that Hanrott was to raise the money from Read if he purchased; it was arranged at Manchester—it was not proposed that Hanrott would purchase, and Read supply the money for the purchase, before I went to Manchester—when I got "to Manchester I learnt that Read took over £1,400 in bank notes there; that was not by arrangement—I found when I was there that £1,300 would not do; another £150 was wanted, I believe; I cannot say the exact amount—I asked Read for another £150 at Manchester to meet certain claims; I did not press him; there was no discussion about it—he said he would let me have it if he could be paid out of the moneys that would come to me when I returned to town in respect of this promissory note for £812—the money to come from Hanrott for the purchase of the debentures was not sufficient to meet the claims we found when we go to Manchester—on 2nd September there was a balance of, I think, about</p>

               <p>£150 short, and Read said he would advance that money, provided he was paid back by weekly instalments at the rate of £10, which I agreed to—£150 was to be paid him in respect of money coming for the £812 Cheque; it was out of the £812 for a particular purpose—it certainly was not to come out of the moneys coming from the £812 cheque; the £812 formed part of what was to go to the creditors—my case is that that transaction of 1st September, which contemplate! one method of raising money to pay claims, was abandoned because of what took place at Manchester, and did not become operative—it was not agreed that the £150 required should come out of the money from the £812 cheque; I misunderstood your question before, when I said it was—I came back to London—I will not swear I did not visit Mr. Read on 3rd September; I don't think I did—it is quite possible I called at 71, fleet Street on 3rd September, because Read paid the wages weekly; I should say I did not, but if I did I may have gone to see if the wages were paid—by what took place at Manchester the whole of the negotiations of the 1st September came to an end, and all these documents of 1st September became of no value—the cheque and promissory note became of no value—I ought to have had them back again—I never asked for them, and never got any documents back—it would not be right to give effect to any of them—the transfer for shares ought to be given up to me—I don't know whether within five days of being at Manchester I effected a transfer of those very shares to Read—the transfer given on 1st September being of no avail, Read was not entitled to call for a transfer of those shares into his name or that of his nominee—I should say I did not on 8th September, as chairman, pass that transfer into Read's name; I don't know from memory unless you show me the document—Eley acted as secretary to the company; I was chairman—I have not seen this document before; I should say it is in Mr. Eley's clerk's writing—I don't remember that the transfer of shares from 12,301 to 13,800, dated 1st September, had come to the office of Grierson and Co. for registration and transfer into the name of Read—I suppose as chairman I ought' to know of transfers taking place—the charge on the debentures equally fell through—this is the instrument I gave on 1st September for interest on deben-tures, where Cochrane's name appears; it is null and void—I find on it Cochrane's name as the person who had had a charge on the debentures in respect of which I was going to charge Read—Messrs. Hepburn. Son, and Cutcliffe were solicitors acting for Cochrane in Sep<lb/>tember, 1887, within two or three weeks of my return from Manchester; I know them—interest was in arrears in respect of the debentures—I don't know if I asked Cochrane to take promissory notes for the interest; I think not, they would not—I think that a bill was given, because they would not wait—I don't remember if Cochrane were willing to do it, if other persons who had a charge on their shares would not object; I have a good memory—I think I have seen Mr. Lord, an accountant, on this business; I don't think I met any member of Hepburn, Son, and Cutcliffe till afterwards—I saw a member of the firm with Mr. Lord, about the end of September, I should say—I daresay I wished that gentleman to ask Mr. Cochrane to give a receipt for the interest on the debentures on Ormerod, Grierson, and Co., taking a bill for the amount; it is possible—I don't remember if the gentleman from Hepburn's informed me that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189103090082"/>
               <p>that could not be done unless the fifth mortgagee, the London Bank, would give a letter agreeing that Cochrane should not be charged with such payment till he actually received the cash—I don't know if I agreed that a letter should be written in respect of it—I don't remember if I went on 26th September to get Read's consent to his allowing the receipts for interest to be given by Cochrane on the terms that he should not be charged with cash until the bill was paid—I went to Read to ask him to take up the debentures—Read, Mr. Lord, and I went to negotiate taking up these debentures which were held by Cochrane, Mr. Hepburn being Cochrane's solicitor, and Mr. Read subse<lb/>quently took up the debentures—I don't remember if I treated with Read as having the fifth charge on the debentures held by Cochrane—the securities were not valid—I had not asked for any of them back—I paid no £10 a week—it would have been very wrong to have paid £10 a week under that security, which was signed by me and Hanrott of 1st September, to take Hanrott's money for my purposes—I found out after some weeks that Read had deducted £10 a week under that agreement of September 1st; that was quite wrong—I may have been at Read's on 3rd September; I believe not—we had no settling up on that day with respect to the £812 cheque; no conversation about it—the outstanding interest of £199 3s. 10d. was not calculated and fixed; nothing of the kind—Read was at Manchester on the second—he incurred expenses going to Hull and Manchester; I don't know about other places—the costs and expenses were not agreed at £46 6s. 8d. on that or any other day; nor that there was a balance left to me of £275 3s. 6d. under that £800 cheque—I know a Mr. Rand by sight—I have often seen that gentleman now in Court—Read has a little box, his own office, at his offices—I did not converse with Read on 3rd September, and therefore Mr. Rand did not come in; if I was there Rand might have come in, but I don't remember—Read did not in my presence give the items £199 3s. 10d. and £46 6s. 8d. to be entered by Rand in the book on that 3rd September as amounts due for interest and costs and expenses; I swear that Rand did not bring into the room where Read and I were a sum of money which purported to be £273 2s. 6d., nor any money at all—Read did not on that day sign a cheque for £200 in my presence; I never had any money—I had forgotten all about the cheque for £812 till about March, 1889, when a discovery was obtained in the proceedings, and I saw the document and recognised this amount after some time, and I said to Mr. Eley, "This amount is wrong"—I did not on 3rd September agree either that it should be taken up by money out of the £273 cheque or hand back myself the sum of £150 which had been advanced by Read at Manchester—I did not take away the remainder of the £273—m August, 1888, a petition to wind up Ormerod and Grierson was presented by Read, a petition by Mr. Willans, and a petition by Mr. Eley to save my property—I allowed him to obtain judgment—the writ was served on me personally at the office of Eley—he presented ten other petitions week after week; it was the same petition re-presented ten times—I commenced pro<lb/>ceedings against Mr. Read on 11th March, 1889, for an account of what was due and owing to me; and in March, 1889, I also caused an action to be commenced against him in the name of Ormerod, Grierson and Co. on behalf of the company—Read's liquidator would not go on with that latter action—Read took £700, and would not go on with it—I suppose,</p>

               <p>technically, the suit was dismissed for want of prosecution—I don't know if Read's costs were taxed at £103 11s.; he has got £500 out of me which he has not yet accounted for—I suppose none of the costs were paid—I heard Read give his account of the transaction before Mr. Ridley—he said I had £275 3s. 6d. on 3rd September, and took it away in my pocket—I was called to deny it—that suit ended by a compromise—not nearly all the accounts were gone into—I gave my account of what had been received under the £812 cheque, and I heard Read's account—I think it was compromised before he was re-examined—Read's counsel said they thought of making inquiries at the Bank to ascertain to what extent, if any, trace could be made of the notes and gold which had been got under that cheque—Read presented a claim against me in that action of £7,218—I made an affidavit denying that I owed Read a farthing—I don't think I can find in this claim any reference to the promissory note for £240 of 11th February, 1887, or to the £52 balance in respect of the promissory note of 26th February, 1887; it is not here, nor is there any claim in respect of interest, £199; the general claim is all made up of interest—I can find no claim for costs and expenses—the claim for £1,250 by way of premium is in—the inquiry before Mr. Ridley lasted three and a half days—the terms of the compromise were entered into between Mr. Bovill (my counsel) and Mr. Kent (Read's counsel)—I don't know what Read agreed to give up; 1 don't think he agreed to give up the £1,250; I know we agreed certain amounts—Read consented to take a judgment for £5,200 in respect of his claim of £7,218—the costs were to come out of £500 that I had. paid into Court, and the balance was to go against the principal. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">read an extract from the shorthand notes</hi>)—I was in Court when Mr. Bovill addressed Mr. Kent, and said, "The charges on all sides are to be withdrawn," and Mr. Kent said, "oh, yes"; but I distinctly and Openly said that I would not withdraw—my counsel said that I had not the money—I agreed to what my counsel spoke for me—in August, 1889, Mr. Read said that he was a judgment creditor for £5,200—terms were actually signed between us, stating the conditions on which I could have the debentures for my own use—I nave never paid a farthing of that £5,200—I brought an action against Bead in November to restrain him from dealing with the debentures he held as security for the £5,200, on the ground that I had complied with the tonus; it was referred to Mr. "Wolstenholm, and he decided against me; the costs have never been paid—after the order of Mr. Ridley, Mr. Butt was appointed to act, and he parted with the debentures, and they gave power to seize the business—he got Mr. Nightingale turned out—I had mortgaged the whole of the land and the fixed plant to the University Life Insurance for £20,000, with incumbrances—all the debenture-holders could take would be the patterns, the stock-in-trade, the fixtures,. and £4,000 in cash—a bogus company was formed with £35,000 capital—in August, 1889, I had 200 debentures standing in my name; I do not snow whether they were mortgaged—on 29th July, as soon as Alderman Phillips had read the statement of claim, he adjourned the whole pro<lb/>ceedings for six months, to allow the litigation to be concluded before he would deal with the matter—I became bankrupt in July, and got the whole of my property—Justice Stirling did not dismiss the suit against St. George, nor did he invite every debenture-holder to take up pro<lb/>ceedings—there was no person who would take it up; Mr. Eley was not</p>

               <p>invited to do it; he received, as a debenture-holder, a portion of the money which was paid for the purchase of the loose plant and patterns, the proceedings having all been stated in the civil action—you came before Alderman Phillips at the end of January and on the 5th, 19th, and 23rd February, and at the end of the four days' hearing he dismissed the case without you asking me a single question; you declined to cross-examine me, you said you would reserve it—the Magistrate dismissed both informations, and then I had myself bound over in £500 to prosecute—I swore in an affidavit of March 2nd, 1889, that it was untrue that Mr. Hanrott purchased the debentures for me, and never paid me any money for them—this account was made out by Mr. Hanrott and signed by me. (<hi rend="italic">This mentioned the purchase of</hi> 900 <hi rend="italic">debentures at nine shillings in the pound</hi>)—that was brought down from London pre<lb/>pared—I did not see it in London, but I went down by the 5.45 a.m. train, and it was already there—it is dated the 1st, and they went down on the 2nd—it is written on paper belonging to a gentleman at Man<lb/>chester—I knew on 4th April, 1888, that Mr. Read was writing to Mr. Eley about the account; he wanted it settled—Mr. Rowbottom and I signed this account between Read and the company—we went through several items of it; Mr. Read counted up the amounts—the £914 over<lb/>due is a wholly fictitious item in it—Mr. Read read out the number of bill s, and I took down the amounts—he did not give me £26,619 as the item—the bill was not overdue—I did not ask him what he meant by "Overdue, £914"—if he had produced the bill I should have spotted the fraud—he did not go through it with me and explain the £914—I know now that 10 per cent, deducted brought it to £912 14s.—I came forward two years afterwards and charged these men when I discovered the fraud.

                  </hi>. I have been Mr. Read's cashier since 1883, in a business known as the London Bank—Mr. Ernest James Read was the manager—there was a committee of management: James Charles Bead, John Searls, Henry Darking, and Mr. Beckett—there were two other clerks in 1887—there were two rooms at 71, Fleet Street—a portion of the large office was partitioned off as a private office for Mr. Read—I kept the cash—it was my duty to balance the cash each day, and to make entries in the cash-book—I kept the book of repayment of loans—I entered them into the day-book, and the total into the cash-book in the evening—this is the cash-book—I had balanced by cash-book on the previous day, and brought the balance forward as the first item of September 3rd—I made an estimate of what money I should require during the day for management—I got it by cheque from the manager, sometimes over-night and sometimes the first thing in the morning—on 3rd September, 1887, Sir Eustace Piers came to the office early in the morning—call-books are kept—he saw Mr. Read in his private room—whilst he was there I was called in—Mr. Read said he wanted £275 3s. 6d. in cash, and referred me to the till—I found I could not spare it—he drew a cheque for £200, which he handed me—Sir Eustace Piers was present whilst this was going on—I sent and got the cheque cashed—the money was brought to me—I took £275 3s. 6d. into the room where Mr. Read and Sir Eustace Piers were sitting—I cannot say whether that was before or after I got the £200 cheque cashed—I put it on the table at which they were sitting—I received from Mr. Read papers relating to it; a promissory note for £1,212 14s., a cheque for £812 14s., and a rough slip showing how £812 14s. was made up, including £46 6s. 8d., £199 3s. 10d., and two items in the day-book of £240 and £52—I was instructed to debit Sir Eustace Piers with a loan of £1,212 14s.—the day-book entries are mine—I made the entry to show the difference between the payment made direct from Ormerod and Co. and the payment made by debtors; I had as security a £365 bill—I debited myself with the £812 14s. cheque as having received it and paid it into the bank—this is the slip—I got credit as appears in the cash-book—the difference between what I debit and credit myself with is £275 3s. 6d., which I charge in payment of the debt—I found the cash, balance properly that Saturday afternoon—I did not touch or see that £275 3s. 6d. again—I got £150 from Mr. Read after Sir Eustace Piers left—I gave credit to Mr. Read for £1,950, which was made up of this cheque for £1,800, and the balance would be this £150, probably in noses—on the 1st Mr. Read took £1,450 to Manchester—I went through</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189103090087"/>
               <p>the account 26,619 with Piers and Rowbottom when they called in April. (<hi rend="italic">The witness explained where he had commenced, and showed the items in the books</hi>)—I also showed them the promissory note for £ 1,212, and the items that made up the £912—I have conversed with Piers as to the weekly £10 payments on account of hypothecated debts—he asked that they should be suspended, as he wanted the money for wages—we referred to the £1,212 promissory note and the balance of Earle's contract.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can show in the books the settlement of the £240 bill—the item as entered shows it—the bank keeps a separate ledger account with each customer—each item is separate—that has always been our system—it is not mixed up. (<hi rend="italic">The witness pointed out several items</hi>)—"Solr." means the matter is in the solicitor's hands—Mr. White was the solicitor—he is not here—the only entry is £240 as paid at some time—we sometimes have a settlement drawn up and signed; not generally—we do not keep a book of statements—the statements are entered, filed, and put away in the office—I do not think there is any statement showing the settlement of the £1,212 14s. bill, the receipt of £125, and the rest going off old debts. (<hi rend="italic">The witness here explained further items in the book</hi>)—the £52 is entered as paid—it was merely a payment on account—I gave no receipt for it—I do not remember giving up the £240 bill—if we have produced it I did not; possibly because Piers did not ask. for it, or it may not have been handy—I have no entry showing how the £199 3s. 10d. was made up, nor the £46 6s. 8d.—I do not know of any receipt for it—I have no entry of the Manchester transaction—it was not our transaction—I have only an entry on the 1st where Read took the £1,450—that is debited to Read on 1st and credited to him on the 3rd—I have no entry showing the debenture transaction—Piers understood the books when I explained them—there is no entry to trace the £150, except that I re<lb/>ceived it from Read—I think the £150 was debited to Mr. Read as a private matter, and then he is credited with it—there is nothing to show the receipt by Piers of £125; if you are right in that amount—I paid the whole £275 over—I have no receipt for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Read accounts to me for the money he takes away—he accounted for the £1,450—I have also credited him with £150 which he handed me on 3rd September—that had nothing to do with any loan to Piers by a bank—on 3rd September Hanrott is debited with £1,800—that would be in the loan-book. (<hi rend="italic">Pointing it out</hi>)—the loan on the 3rd was carried out by Reads going to Manchester—I have no doubt I took the £275 3s. 6d. into that room, where Piers and Bead were sitting—I had no other money than the £150 I referred to from Bead that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SEAL</hi>. I am the solicitor for the defendant—I was his solicitor in the matters which came before Mr. Ridley—there was an inspection of documents, and everything was scheduled—Sir Eustace Piers with his solicitor came to my office on more than one occasion, and inspected such hooks as I had, and the books in my client's possession were inspected at the bank—I furnished a copy of the particulars to Mr. Eley, Sir E. Piers' solicitor, in respect of the £1,214 bill, also particulars in respect of the £2,000 transaction; and with respect to the £2,400, they were ordered by the referee, and I delivered them—my client was not re<lb/>examined, before the conclusion of the case his counsel asked that his cross-examination might stand over till Sir E. Piers had been examined, after which I got instructions from my client to make inquiries, and I</p>

               <p>sent my clerk at once to do so, but a compromise took place, and there was no necessity—I was present when the settlement took place in August, 1889; Sir E. Piers did not intimate in any way his dissent to Mr. Bovill's withdrawal of the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the coroners for the county of Essex—on the 16th January I held an inquest as to the death of Sarah Ann Pedder, in order to ascertain the cause of death—on that day the prisoner was called as a witness; he was sworn and cautioned—this is his deposition—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>. "The deceased was a single woman, and forty-seven years of age. I have known her between six and seven years past. I first met her in a public-house, the Custom House; and I have been living with her off and on since then up to a fortnight since. I am married, but have been living away from my wife thirteen years. I have had three rooms at 36, High Street, North Woolwich, on the first floor. I and the deceased slept in the middle room, my mother occupied the front, and we all used to have our meals in this front room. Nobody slept in the back room where the body is now lying. I have six children, all grown up: two sons at sea, one son at Capetown, one is at Yarmouth, one son employed in a fish-shop at Canning Town; one daughter married, one single, now living with my mother; a man comes to see her, but he has not stopped there all night to my know<lb/>ledge. The deceased was of drunken habits, and had been drunk every day for a fortnight before she died. I last slept with her on 29th December, in the middle room; she had had some drink. We had some beer in a glass bottle in the room. On Tuesday afternoon, 30th December, I went to the Royal Standard about three; I found her there drunk. I went out and left her there, and I have not slept with her since. I returned home very late at night, about half-past twelve; whether she was in the house I don't know, she did not sleep with me. I did not see her again till the Thursday following; I found her at Mrs. Collins's, the Prince Albert. I put my hand on her shoulder and led her out, and gave her a good talking to and left her. I did not see her again till about half-past eleven last Sunday morning, 11th February, when I went into the back bedroom, lying on the floor, she had the pail under her head for a pillow; she had her dress bodice on, but unfastened from the waist. I said, 'Come, get your things on, and go out of this. ' I called a policeman, one came, not further than the passage, and advised my going to a Magistrate. I told my mother what I had done; she advised me to go for another constable; one came and roused her; he tried to get her on to her feet, but she could not stand; she was the worse for liquor. I went to my mother and slept till nearly five; I then went to look after the deceased again, and found her dead. Since the 1st of January I don't know where she had been sleep<lb/>ing;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189103090089"/>
               <p>since then I have been sleeping in the same front room with my mother. The deceased's nose was disfigured, as it is now, when I first met her. I have never kicked her or knocked her about; I can't account for any bruises or blows on her legs. On the Sunday morning she kept calling out, 'Take these dogs away'; there were no dogs there.")</p>

I live at 38, High Street, North Woolwich, that is next door to 36—I had known the deceased some ten years—I was well acquainted both with her voice and the prisoner's—last December I very frequently heard their voices in the house next door, jangling and quarrel<lb/>ling—I have heard and seen blows from 8th of December—I have heard it as early as four in the morning—I could not say who was striking the blows, only I heard—the words; I heard the deceased saying, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Alf</hi>, don't, don't!"—I have heard that frequently—on the 8th January I was in my back room, the deceased was in the water-closet, and the prisoner went there and said, "Come out, you b—cow," and he pulled her out by the hair of her head, and kicked her once on the bottom part of the loins—she went out at the back door, and went into Mrs. Williams's part of the house—on the 11th, between twelve and one, I went into my back yard; I had previously heard the prisoner say, "Get up, you b----cow," and I heard her say three times, "Oh, Alf; don't, don't, don't!"—I threw a stone at Mrs. Williams's back door or window, and she came out, and I spoke to her about it—between twelve and one the same day I was again in my back yard—I then heard the deceased cry for mercy, and beg him not to hit her again—I did not see him; I heard his voice—between one and two I went to the police-station and gave information—I did not see the deceased after she was dead—on the evening of the last day of last year I saw her between my window and the prisoner's window—I could see the front door of his house from where I was—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of High Street, North Woolwich—I did not attend the deceased in her lifetime—I was called to her by the prisoner on Sunday afternoon, 11th January, about half-past five—I went with him and found the deceased in a small back room on the first floor at 36—she was dead and cold, she was dressed—she had on her boots and her bodice—there were marks of dried blood on both temples—they were recent, I should say within a few hours—I took a cursory glance round the room—it was very dirty and foul-smelling—there was no furniture and no fire—the window was closed—I noticed on a shelf a few dried crusts of old bread—on Thursday, 15th January, I made a post<lb/>mortem examination—externally she was a well-developed woman—I saw marks of bruises on her leg, arm, and head—those bruises had been created within a fortnight—they were in different stages of development, some more recent than others—they were such bruises as would be effected by blows and kicks—I saw a contused wound below the right knee about an inch long, probably caused by a kick—I opened the head, the brain was healthy, there were old scars on the head, whence had come the dried blood; when I was removing the scalp there was a strong adhesion which bound it down—blood came from each temple—those bruises were probably caused by blows, might be by a fall, by any violence—on opening the chest the pulmonary pleura were adhering to the ribs on</p>

I think she had been in the habit of drinking—I think the violence I have heard stated would be almost fatal to her, consider<lb/>ing the weak state of her heart; I would say it was calculated to accele<lb/>rate death—the heart was in a very far gone state of disease; her life was in peril at any moment from that; she might have died at any moment from natural causes; the only thing that surprises me is how she could have gone through such an amount of violence, exposure, and excitement; the heart was very much degenerated and fatty; but for the violence to which she was subjected I do not think she would have died; I cannot say she would not; there was no reason why she should have died; sooner or later the diseased heart was likely to terminate in death.</p>

               <p>Arkley Road, Penge—the prisoner lived with me about four months from last August—she was there in January—she came with a baby—for the first month the child was very well treated—it was not quite half a year old—it was not healthy, it always seemed to be a delicate little thin baby, it was never a big fine baby—the first month my old mother minded the child—after the first month Mr. Davis came home and said. he had been hopping, and the child was given up to them in their own room—the prisoner used to leave it in her husband's care, but sometimes it was left alone from one to three or four hours or longer in the evening—that occurred every week—more than once a week it made a mournful noise—I went to it several times—the husband sold the bed, but she had a mattress or palliasse, with a little flock or something, on which the baby used to lie, on some rags—sometimes it would have a bottle of food, sometimes not any—this went on to about Christmas—she came home drunk—she was very intemperate—when she returned sober was when she could not get the money—she returned in this state without her husband—her husband was supposed to look after the baby, but he was occasionally as she was, and when she went to sleep you could not wake her—I have seen her husband go out for the night—the child was extremely dirty—I used to wash it the first month—when I went to her room the child was filthy—I first noticed its dirty state a week or two after they took it; it was not changed after the first month—I did not often go into her place; when I did the child was dirty—after Christmas I took it to the station—I first noticed its condition the end of August or beginning of September—the prisoner seemed afraid to wash it; she seemed timid of it when it was ill—I took it to the station because Mrs. Davis was so drunk—she brought another man in the house, and Davis broke the doors, and she broke the windows and threw the furniture through the windows—when she came into my room with a broken finger I was frightened—Mr. Davis turned the man out of the house—I gave the baby a bottle of milk, and went straight with the child (as my neighbours said I ought to take it) to the Police-station—she was very drunk—the child had wasted to nothing since September, and boils broke out—six weeks or two months after they took it it got so very bad—that was between October and November, it seemed to go worse when the cold weather set in—she used to buy for it brandy and condensed milk—I saw them—there was plenty of food, but it was not given to the baby in a proper manner; it might have food one hour and for seven or eight hours have nothing—I have seen it very hungry when she has been out drinking, and it has grabbed at the food when I made it a bottle of milk—when she was there she was not able to feed it—she was often tipsy—I took it to the infirmary on the Wednesday, and it died the following Tuesday—I went with the prisoner to the doctor's the Saturday after Christmas—she got no medicine that night—she got a bottle before that, at least she had it in the place—one teaspoonful was given it as I went upstairs to go to the doctor's, I got it myself—that bottle of medicine was some time in the house—she gave it some arrowroot on one occasion—the policeman took the child to the infirmary after I took it to the station.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I live at 77, Croydon Road, Penge—I attended the child on August 27th, 28th, and 30th, and September 1st—nothing then attracted my attention—on 8th December I attended it at 60, Arkley Road on behalf of the prisoner—the child was very thin, but it was clean; it had a great deal of boil irritation, and from inquiry of the prisoner I considered it had been fed improperly—that would produce violent irritation—she had given it bread and biscuits—it had no organic disease—it had one or two boils about its body—I next saw it on 7th January at my surgery—the prisoner brought it—it had more boils—that would arise from its weakly con<lb/>dition—it was naturally a weakly child—it was well dressed and clean—on 8th December I advised the prisoner to get some charitable or parish medical relief—I gave her instructions how to treat the child—I was under the impression they had not been carried out; I could not say for certain—I did not see it again till after death—I assisted Dr. Thompson in making a post-mortem examination—the child died of pneumonia—inflammation in the left lung—it was very emaciated and devoid of fat—the stomach was thin and attenuated and semi-transparent;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189103090098"/>
               <p>the mesenteric glands were slightly enlarged—that indicated want of food and improper food—the child having been seven days in the infirmary the irritation from both insufficient and improper food would then have subsided.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer of 9, Charles Street, Blackfriars Road—in October, 1889, Abrahams and Levy came together to my shop and asked if I had a bit of string to tie some canvas up; Levy was carry<lb/>ing a shade of flowers; I said I had not got any string—Abrahams went out to get a drop of brandy, and meanwhile Levy pulled the canvas off—Abrahams asked if I knew Captain Clark—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "Somewhere about Blackfriars Road, I can't exactly say where"—he said he had saved his life when he was going out to South Africa, and he promised to make him a grand present when he came to England again; he said the present was the shade of flowers; he said he had brought it from South Africa—Levy said that they had called in Waterloo Road, and were offered £8 for the shade, that Abrahams would not take the money because a Jew offered it, where they called in Waterloo Road to buy the canvas; he said they had paid £8 for duty on the flowers, and if he could not get that back he would throw the flowers away—he said the nuns in South Africa had made them, and it took</p>

               <p>them twelve-months to make; that another party had offered £5 and some clothes for them, and if I liked to pay £5, he should be glad of a jacket—while this was going on Abrahams came in now and then, and he said, "If you like to have the flowers you shall have them for £8"—I said, "They are no good to me—he said, "What will you give me for them? I cannot find Captain Clark, and rather than smash them or let a Jew have them you shall have them for 50s. "—Levy said it was a very good thing—he said if I bought them he would come back in half an hour and go and get the man who would give him £5 and a jacket—he said he was a porter, and carried the things for Abrahams from the station, and Abrahams had just come from Liverpool—I gave him the 50s., and Abrahams went on his knees and wanted to kiss me, because I was a Christian—I did not know his name at that time—he was dressed the same as he is now—he did not say what he was—these are the flowers—it was placed on a chair with paper over it, and I only saw the front part—he said he did not want to have the trouble of taking them back—he took his hat off and began to beg and pray me to have them, and he would come and see me again—I believed his statement, and parted with my 50s. on it; I next saw them at the Court.</p>

I live at 45, Doddington Grove, Kennington Park—in December, 1889, I was in business as a draper at Kennington Park Road, in partnership with Mrs. Newton—about eleven one morning I was called into the shop and found Abrahams there and another man, neither of the prisoners; he was very much like Jacobs, but younger; he had a vase of flowers similar to these—Abrahams was seemingly in very great grief; he could not find a certain man who, he said, had saved his life on board ship—he appeared very much concerned, and there were almost tears in his eyes—he said he had brought him home a present, and he was living somewhere in Kennington Park Road—he went out and left me with the young man with the shade, and came back and said he could not find him—while he was away the young one said he had been offered £8 for the vase, but would not sell it to the party because he was a Jew, and they had <hi rend="italic">had</hi> him several times through giving him drink, and had taken his gold watch, and given him a brass</p>

               <p>one, and he wanted to get back to his ship at Liverpool; that he brought the flowers from Africa, and it took the nuns three years to make them, and cost him £10 to bring them over here—they were all done up at the back, but he said they were the same all round—he went out again to have another look—I think he went out three times—he said rather than sell it to those cursed Jews he would break it up—he named Harris at the corner of the London Road as the man who offered him £8 when he said he would break it up—he said if he could find a poor Christian woman he would give it to her—Mrs. Newton, who was there, asked him what he wanted for it, and after a while he said he would take £4, as he wanted to get back to his ship, and he had got to pay the young man who had been carrying it about two days for him—the young man said rather than let him break it up he would very likely find a customer who would take it off our hands—I was cashier—I handed the money to Mrs. Newton, and she gave it to Abrahams—she had to swear that she was a Christian before he would do that—Abrahams gave the man 1s., and gave us all his blessing—he had a short pilot jacket and a cap with two little things in front, just as I have seen firemen on board ship—it was laced up so elaborately that we could not get the back undone; but not ten minutes after he was gone I found it was a fraud, and they hunted the neighbourhood but could not find him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a son of the prosecutor; I was engaged in the business at the branch office of which the prisoner was the manager—on 1st December I received £1 1s. from Mr. Meets, due to the office; I gave it to the prisoner shortly afterwards—I have examined the ledger with my father, and find no record of it—during the whole of the time the prisoner was managing the branch office at Balham and Wandsworth Common I was engaged there assisting him—this account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the prisoner's writing—I see in it the names of Dr. Clark, Rogers and Clarkson, Steel, and Hodges—the prisoner claims commission of £17 10s. as doing business for them, and £7 10s. for Hall, £50 for Barrow, £2 for Dut on, £41 5s. for Steel, and ten per cent, commission on £30 due from a Mr. Hodges, and ten percent, on £13 15s. due from Dr. Clark in December last—during that month no business occurred with Rogers and Clarkson, or Hall or Dutton or Steel, Hodges or Clark—I don't know what the Barrow £50 refers to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was principally at the Balham office; I was there all the time the prisoner was there, and at Wandsworth—during that time I had the opportunity of being continually in communication with my father—I had access to the books sometimes; they were locked up sometimes, sometimes they were with my father—the prisoner was sometimes at Wandsworth, sometimes at Balham, and sometimes going seeing people about letting houses, or attending appointments with regard to fixtures and distraining in different places—I cannot say that he had difficulties with my father about money matters—I don't know of my own knowledge, only from hearsay, that he has given the prisoner cheques which have been dishonoured; I have not heard my father say so—I have not heard the prisoner press my father to go into the question of commission—the prisoner used to keep small memorandum books in his pocket, and made entries in them—my father came there once a week—the books were sent to him sometimes; I never told my father that the prisoner was going to start in business for himself; I told him I had heard so about a week before he gave notice to leave—I never heard my father tell him he had better look out what he did, for if he barked he would bite—I believe he was going into business with Lewis Stoner, who had been in my father's business some time; he is in business at Clapham—I don't know that he sued my father for wages—I don't know when the prisoner started in business—we have had two managers since the prisoner left, one now and one before, not satisfactory—I don't think I have ever been present when the prisoner has discussed money matters with my father—commission is paid when the purchase takes place—the prisoner claimed commission upon all work done at the office—I know he had some negotiations with the post-office at Balham; not a long one, he wrote a few letters and saw them once, I believe—I know the prisoner claims a commission on some property in Ramsden Road—we have not been doing anything striking in business lately, about £10 a month; it has dropped, certainly—Mr. Clark let his house to Mr. Truefit, with the option of purchase, for £1,200—that was through the prisoner's intr<lb/>oduction—I don't know that Truefit has purchased, I will not swear that</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor—I am a house agent and auctioneer, at 189, Victoria Street—I took the auctioneer's license out in the prisoner's name; I have not been in the business very long—in August, 1889, I appointed the prisoner manager of my branch offices at Balham and Wandsworth Common at a salary of £2 a week, and 10 per cent, commission on all gross commissions earned at those offices, less bad debts—I don't think there was a written agreement—these are copies of our letters. (<hi rend="italic">One of these was the prisoner's letter of</hi> 10th <hi rend="italic">August, accepting the appointment at</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">per cent, commission on the gross amount of moneys earned by him</hi>)—I specially excepted bad debts afterwards in conversation with him—he was entitled only to commissions on the amounts actually received by the firm—his salary was afterwards raised to £2 10s. a week—I have not given a large number of dishonoured cheques, only a very few—I never gave the prisoner a cheque which was afterwards dishonoured—his duties at the branch offices would be to take the general management and superintend the collection of accounts, as I paid all the wages except the prisoner's, and all the accounts from the head office; he would simply retain in hand sufficient for daily disbursements of stamps and fares—afterwards I allowed him to keep enough in band to pay his weekly wages and something on account of commission, but excepting those all accounts, and expenses, such as printing, advertisements, rents, rates and taxes, were paid from the head office—he was entitled to deduct money for his wages and petty office disbursements from cash only; I gave him cheques from week to week as he happened to be short—cheques he received were to be sent to the head office and not dealt with by him in any way—he had no authority to endorse cheques or to use them for the expenditure of the local office; I constantly gave him money, either by cash or cheques, on account of the local office—on 15th December I had an interview with him at the Wandsworth Common office—J complained very much of his being away on the Saturdays when I went down there to get the cash account; and also of his being away from the office for the previous two weeks, and I told him I was informed that most of his time was spent with Stoner; I complained that the cash-book and ledger had not been made up, and I told him peremptorily that I must insist on the books being made up, especially the cash-book and ledger—these are the two books I refer to; they are kept in his writing—on one side of the page is an entry of every business transaction and the amount charged—on receiving money his duty was to enter it in the cash-book, and then post it to the person's, account on the other side of the book—on 16th December, the day after our interview, I received one of these books</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189103090108"/>
               <p>through my son from the prisoner as being made up and showing the state of persons' accounts, and the other was left at the office several days afterwards—I have never had the cash-book at all—I requested the prisoner in very strong terms to send it to me—about 3 p.m. on 17th December I met him with Stoner in Basinghall Street—I said, "I am very much surprised to see you here, Mr. Child, in Stoner's company after what took place on the 25th. I have not had the cash-book, and I must insist on having it, as I wish to post up my own books and know the state of parties' accounts"—he said he had not had time to attend to it, but that he had the book at home, and he would make it up that night and send it to me—I have never had it—on 19th December I heard from the prisoner, giving me notice—he did not send nor refer to the cash-book—after other correspondence on 29th December I received this letter—previous to receiving it I had made inquiries with reference to certain entries appearing in the ledger, and found a number of sums of money bad been received which had not been entered—my son directed my attention to the case of £ 1 received from Mr. Meets; no entry of it appeared in the ledger—there was no entry of £1 1s. paid by Mr. Whyte on 15th November, or of £4 2s. 6d. paid by Mr. Fletcher—I pressed the prisoner several times to know why Fletcher had not paid for certain fixtures in a house he took; he said he had applied for it several times and could not get it—I found no entry of £3 17s. paid by Hewett on 6th August, or of £3 15s. paid by Court on 14th October—the endorsement "E. Richards and Co." on this cheque for £3 17s., drawn by Hewett, is in the prisoner's writing; he had no authority to endorse in that manner or to use the firm's signature in any way—the endorsement "E. Richards "on this cheque for £4 2s. 6d. from Fletcher is the prisoner's writing, and also the endorsement "E. Richards and Co." on this cheque of Baxter for £5 5s.—the receipts for those cheques are signed by him; Whyte's receipt is signed "E. Richards and Co.," Hewett's is "E. Richards and Co. per A. J. C," Baxter's is "E. Richards and Co.," and Court's is "Richards and Co., per A. J. C. "—this account attached to the letter of 29th December is in the prisoner's writing—on the first page I see among accounts received, Best, £4 3s. 6d.—there is no entry in the ledger of that nor of Ferguson, £1 Is.; Camden, £2 17s.; Holmes, £3 12s.; Kerrinden, £2 2s. 6d.; Wise, £1 16s.; Farlow, £3 10s.; Orm, £1 Is.; Muir, £1 Is.; Bryant, £1 Is.; Cooper, £1 9s.; Brown, £1 6s.; Lambert, £1 5s.; Hobbs, £5 5s.; Gilchrist, £1 Is.; Lidicot, £1 14s.; Williams, £1 12s. 6d.—none of the people on the list are entered in the ledger; there are thirty-one accounts, amounting to £72 16s., not entered, and which have not been accounted to me for—the prisoner never complained to me of his inability to get on without more money—there were no bickerings about money; we never had any bickering till after 15th December, when the thing was ripe—he was entitled to deduct from the cash money for wages, petty expenses, and part payment of commission; he usually drew £1 a week—at the end of every month he sent me a commission account; I produce them from August, 1889, to September, 1890; some are in his writing, and others in the clerk's—I have compared, as to the majority of items, the monthly statements of account furnished by the prisoner with this account, which he forwarded with this letter of 29th December—I am ready, if necessary, to point out discrepancies between them—I checked the</p>

               <p>prisoner's commission account in my private ledger upon the basis of his monthly accounts, with the necessary modifications and corrections; I should correct it by the accounts themselves—I and the prisoner never came to any settlement, but I intimated from time to time that he was overdrawing the account, and charging items on which he was not entitled to commission. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The account I have given to-day is, as far as I know, the same as I gave before the Magistrate—I was told that the prisoner was going to start in business for himself just prior to my interview with him on 15th; while he was in my employment and drawing my money he was spending his time at Stoner's office—I told him on 15th December, in reference to his accounts, when I found they were so bad, that he had better take care what he did; if I barked I should bite—I found his accounts were so bad just at the time I found he was about to start in business—I got this letter from him on 20th December. (<hi rend="italic">This said that he had put up with the prosecutor's irregularities and the odium attaching to his name for some time, but that after his disgusting treatment it teas impossible to remain as his manager and he would take a week's notice</hi>)—I first went to the place where he was carrying on business at the end of the first week in January; I went to Stoner's place; I did not know it was the prisoner's place, or that he was connected in business with Stoner—I went there with a detective in the daytime—Stoner was there; he had been in my service; he had summoned me at the Police-court—he sued me at the County Court for his wages—I paid one week's wages into Court, and he took it out; he did not recover what he sued me for—I think that was last spring—within a day or two of my going to Stoner's office with a detective I saw the prisoner's brother, a solicitor; he said if I had any complaint to make about him the prisoner would be willing to go to the Police-court; he did not say he had gone—it never crossed my mind that by going to the prisoner I might be able to frighten him out of the neighbourhood—having heard from his brother that he was willing to attend at any time, I applied for a warrant against him; it was not granted—he was taken into custody by the sergeant, who had the conduct of the case, by the Magistrate's advice; I was present—I never asked the Magistrate for a summons, he said I could arrest him—I gave sufficient evidence that day to get a remand; it was read over to me, and I signed it as correct—"I always paid him his salary, and never told him to deduct it from the amounts he received," is a mistake—I said I could not find the cash-book—the two charges I made against him then were embezzling £1 1s. in the case of Mr. Whyte, and £1 1s. in the case of Mr. Meets—I heard from his brother that he offered to attend at the Police-court at any moment I chose to appoint—I did not hear it from the man who arrested him—I heard the man swear at the Court about his going to the Police-station, but not prior to that—I have a letter which the prisoner wrote to me on 29th November, 1890, before this matter arose. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that as the prosecutor still had the prisoner's petty cash-book, the prisoner sent with the letter a rough statement for the last few weeks, and also receipts for rent and a demand note for taxes</hi>)—that rough statement was handed back to the prisoner with the cash-book, that he might enter it into the cash-book—no third person was present when the cash-book and statement were handed to the prisoner—I swear these two amounts of Meets and Whyte were not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189103090110"/>
               <p>set out in the statement, because Meets's account was paid subsequently—Whyte's was on a piece of loose paper—I read the statement—I have seen one memorandum book of this kind which he kept, and checked it—the rough statement was not the same as this—I see an entry here of Whyte, but this book has been mutilated—I handed the cash-book to the prisoner at the Wandsworth Common office on 15th December, with the memo<lb/>randum, containing two or three weeks' entries, about 10 o'clock a.m.—I had made a special appointment by letter for him to meet me—I was examined on each of the remands at the Police-court—I swore on the second occasion that the prisoner was not represented as Richards and Co. at auction sales; the meaning I intended to convey was that he had no authority to represent the firm as its principal—I swore he did not sign the contracts; he signed some with A. J. C. under the signature—after I swore it I remember contracts were produced; I do not remember after that swearing that he did not sign them—I know he kept memo<lb/>randum books of his own, in which he made entries from day to day—before the solicitor representing the prisoner produced these books I said I did not know of the existence of these latter books—he would make entries in a book of his own, and post them up when he had the cash-book—I did not know he kept a duplicate of the cash-book—I said, "In the small green memorandum books the initials pointed out to me are mine; I may have seen that book from time to time; right through that book my initials occur "—it was a slip of memory when I said I did not know of any memorandum book being kept—I said, "Of course the prisoner was authorised to deduct his salary from the money he received; any statement that I made last time that he had no such authority is false;" it was a mistake, the word "false" is too strong—it was a mistake to swear he had no right to deduct his salary—I swore, "Whenever he had not enough in hand to pay his salary I gave him a cheque on the Saturday; he never made disbursements on my behalf out of his own pocket to my knowledge"—two or three weeks there was a balance of a few shillings against me—he was not entitled to claim commission for matters that were in the office while he was there, when the money was paid after he left my employment; I was so advised—by his letter before he entered the employment he stipulates that he is entitled to commission on every matter—if a house were let or a purchase completed after he left he was not entitled to commission—I said, "I told him I did not often show my teeth, but when I did I bit"—I don't think I swore, "In no single instance has a cheque that I have given been dishonoured"—if it is on the depositions I must have sworn it, but it is a mistake—I afterwards said, "I gave a cheque which was brought back in consequence of the irregularity of the signature "—that was the case of Simmons—I said one cheque on my private account had been dishonoured; that was one I lent him to pay his rent—he did not say he must have money on his commission account—he did not at that time ask me for money on his commission account; his commission account was overdrawn—my private account for domestic matters is at the Peckham branch of the Imperial Bank; I have had it there for three or four years—I have only one account—I have one for business at the Victoria branch—I don't know how many of my cheques have been dis<lb/>honoured—when I swore that no cheque of mine had been dishonoured I had not thought anything about the getting a copy of a</p>

               <p>banking account; I was not aware that there was a process by which a copy could be got—I don't know if from 1st May, 1888, to the present time bills and cheques of mine to the number of seventy, amounting to £2,253, have been dishonoured—they have all been paid since—I have no means of checking this bank account now; it is a respectable bank—the cheques were taken up directly afterwards—the prisoner has not from time to time pressed me for money for expenses—I have not told him I had no money to give him, nor have I told him when he asked for money that he must go out and get money somewhere—I must have said, if it is on the depositions: "When he has asked me for money for petty expenses I have told him to go out and get money"—I did tell him that—I had no recollection of sending him for money, because I knew money must be provided to carry on the business—I gave him. money from time to time—I do not remember once when he asked for money saying I had. only got ten shillings, and changing that and giving him six shillings out of it—I said, "I did not tell him to got out and collect some accounts "—he had no authority to sign the name of Richards—I did not in<lb/>variably sign myself at auction marts—contracts were shown me which the prisoner had signed "Richards" in my presence; they were private sales, not in auction marts—I remember a memorandum of the sale of 123, St. James Road being produced to me signed by the prisoner, and saying I had never seen it, because I never had; he conducted the transaction privately—I saw the contract in the case of Roseneath when it was produced in Court, not before, because that was sold privately—I did not say before the Magistrate that when he asked me for money I gave him £10, and told him to do as well as he could to put matters straight—I am not in the habit of changing everybody in my employ<lb/>ment with being a rogue as soon as he has a dispute with me—I never make a charge until I have occasion to do so—I did not charge Stoner with being a rogue; he was only with me a fortnight—I received this letter from him after this prosecution was started. (<hi rend="italic">This complained of the prosecutor coming into and prowling about Stoner's office</hi>)—I returned it after writing on it, "I return you this with the answer that you are as great a rogue as Child "—I sent back this tradesman's account after writing on it, "You must be a rogue or a fool or a compound of both to send in this *** You ought to go where Child is"—that was because he applied for an amount that had already been paid—I have never signed the prisoner's name to any cheque to my knowledge—I endorsed this cheque of 20th December, 1890, in the prisoner's name; because it came to me after he left my employment, it was my money—I used to have business transactions with Harvey and Richardson, of Leicester—there was a dispute with them about the signature to accept<lb/>ances many years ago—I aid not then go to Spain; I went to Paris, and through France and Spain, and back to England—I was away about eight weeks—the question of the acceptances was not settled by my brothers in my absence; I settled it myself before I left England.</p>

J. C. under it; never "E. Richards and Co."—it is quite untrue that he had frequently pressed me for money—when I made the statement about his not being entitled to deduct his salary from the cash received by him at the office, I had no legal assistance—on the second Saturday that Stoner was with me he came into the office half drunk, and was very abusive and insolent, and I discharged him—I offered him his wages for the current week—he took out a summons for two weeks; I paid one week's wages into Court, and he took it in satisfaction—I have heard that he and the prisoner are now carrying on business as "J.

"—it is untrue that I am in possession of the cash-book—I had not seen it since 15th December—I only heard of the suggestion at the interview of 15th December and in the letter of 20th December—I applied to Mr. Denman for a warrant, and then to Mr. Partridge, who said it was unnecessary to have a warrant, I could give him into custody at once, as it was a case of felony—at the office there were all the ordinary books for such a business as I carry on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at the Wandsworth office nearly all the time—the prisoner was backwards and forwards there—I believe the prosecutor "had the cash-book sometimes—I heard there was difficulty in getting the book before any question of this kind arose—I once went to the railway station with the prosecutor in order that he might change half a sovereign and give me 6s. to bring back to the prisoner—I think that was a Saturday, I don't remember the exact amount—the prosecutor's son was sometimes at Balham, sometimes at Wandsworth—he had full opportunity of seeing what was going on.</p>

               <p>called it Nellie, it was about three years old—she said this child Nellie had fits, and asked me to prescribe for it; it was markedly emaciated, but clean, and its clothing, it had evidently been washed and dressed that day—I told her to send for medicine, which she did—I went again on Monday, the 15th, and saw Stephen and the infant in arms, but not Nellie—Stephen was worse again, there was a good deal of vomit and diarrhœa on his clothing, and in an offensive condition again, and the same with the infant in arms—each time I went I insisted on the importance of keeping the child cleanly—she said she was doing her best—on that day she paid me 8s. 6d., my charges up to that time, from the 10th to the 15th, including the visit I was to pay on the 17th—I had arranged with her to attend for that week at 7s. 6d.—then there was the extra medicine for Nellie—I called again on the 17th, and again saw the infant and Stephen; the infant was then in a dying condition—Stephen was the same as last time, no better; he was still in the same offensive condition—I spoke to the prisoner very strongly about it once more, and told her I did not consider the children were being properly attended to—she said she was doing her best for them—I said I would come next day, the 18th—on that morning some one came from the house to say that the infant was dead—I went to the house, but could I not get in; I tried for some time; there were people in the house, I heard them moving about and talking, and I heard a child crying—not being able to get in, I went away—I returned next day, the 19th—I was admitted, and saw Stephen, and the prisoner with an infant, two or three months old, in her arms—I asked her whose child that was—she said it was her daughter's, who had been left a widow with five children, and had come to reside with her, and this was the youngest—Stephen was worse as regards his health, and in the same disgusting condition—I told her she ought to send him to the hospital at once, that she could not properly attend to him in the condition he was—she said she thought there would be a difficulty in getting the children admitted to the hospital, because she had not a letter—I said I would myself write a letter to the house physician of St. Thomas's, which would no doubt get the child admitted at once—I told her the child would die if left under her care; I was certain it would, that was my opinion—I said I could not undertake the responsi<lb/>bility of attending any longer, unless the child was sent to the hospital—she said she would send for the letter at once—on getting home I wrote the letter—someone called for it; her son brought it back unopened the same morning, with a message from the prisoner that the grandmother of the child refused to have it removed to the hospital—I sent word back that I could not accept the responsibility of attending the child any more, as it had not been sent to the hospital—I did not attend again—on Christmas Eve I considered it my duty to give certain information to the police—and afterwards, on the 6th or 7th January, I saw the child at the Harpur Street Shelter, belonging to the Society for the Protection of Children; it was then suffering from pneumonia, and was practically in a dying condition—it died on 8th January—I attended the post-mortem exami<lb/>nation on the 13th; it was made by Dr. Pepper and Mr. Gabe, Dr. Reid and myself being present—pneumonia was the cause of death, probably accelerated by neglect and cold—the body was extremely emaciated—there was no disease to account for the emaciation; it was due either to improper</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Pneumonia was the immediate cause of death—pneumonia was common with children last winter, produced by cold—I found that where there was no neglect bronchial catarrh would predispose to pneumonia—improper feeding would produce symptoms similar to those from having no food—diarrhœa would produce emaciation, but not quite so extensive as I found here—I may have said that I saw the prisoner give the child eggs and brandy—I saw her give the infant the juice of beef steak; that would not be improper, but the way she pre<lb/>pared it I considered wrong—the bone of the meat was extremely dirty and greasy—the prisoner asked me if she should get beef-tea for Stephen—I said, "No, not for the present"—that was about the second or third time I saw him—she said all she gave him he brought up again—she expressed great anxiety about him—she asked if she should get a bronchial kettle for him—I said it was not necessary.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D., 16, Mecklenburgh Square. On 2nd January I went to see a number of children at the Shelter of the society in Harpur Street (my assistant had seen them the night before)—I examined all of them—they were in a very emaciated condition—that applied especially to Stephen Simmons; he remained there under my care between the 2nd and 8th January, and then died—on the 13th I assisted in the post-mortem—I have been present to-day during the examination of Mr. Simpson—I entirely agree with the evi<lb/>dence he has given with regard to the condition of the child and the cause of death, and to the contributing causes of death—there was no organic disease to account for the emaciation—the pneumonia was of about eight days' standing—the emaciation was due to insufficient or improper food; most likely to insufficient food—the child had no chance of life; it appeared to me to be dying, before the pneumonia came on; it was in a dying condition on the 2nd January—on the 16th Lewis died; on the 20th Albert died; Nellie died, I think, one day last week; she was removed to the hospital in Great Ormond Street for an abscess on the thigh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't know what she died of—Lewis and Albert died of measles, but we came to the opinion on the post-mortem that it was accelerated by want of proper food—there was no measles in the Harpur Street Shelter; it was not contracted there—it was brough in by the children—when I saw Stephen on the 2nd he was not suffering from pneumonia—when he was dead he had pneumonia of eight days standing—he had a little bronchial catarrh when admitted, that would predispose to pneumonia, and exposure" would cause it—it is a very fatal disease in infants; recovery is not sure.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In Albert's case pneumonia followed the measles—he was in such a weak condition that he could not withstand the illness; it was brought about by want of care and want of food.</p>

In Stephen's case I could not detect any pneumonia on the 2nd—exposure to a child in his condition would cause bronchial catarrh, and that would lead to pneumonia; it is impossible to say for how long emaciation had been going on, possibly several weeks; the child was simply skin and bone—the fact of a healthy child becoming emaciated would be noticed by anybody about children.</p>

I am a Fellow of the College of Surgeons, Master of Surgery, and late Examiner in Forensic Medicine in the London University—I have had very considerable experience—I made the post-mortem examination of the child Stephen—I have heard the evidence of Mr. Simpson, Dr. Reid, and Dr. Gabe—I agree generally in the opinions they have expressed, with slight exception, not so much by way of correction as by way of addition—there is one condition on the postmortem which has not been mentioned before, that there were acute tubercles in the apex of the right lung; a small group of tubercles, in the same lung, affected by pneumonia, probably of a fortnight or three</p>

               <p>weeks' standing—I think that probably determined the localisation of the pneumonia in the right lung rather than the left—beyond that I have nothing that I desire to add; with the exception of the lung there was no organic disease anywhere—I noticed the emaciation—I weighed the child, it weighed 12 lb. 2 oz.; the normal weight of a child 18 months old would be 20 lb.—there was no sufficient disease to cause that emaciation—I think the disease of the lung might probably account for the wasting of three or four pounds—I take it that the lung had been affected about a fortnight; I don't think the pneumonia had lasted so long; I think that had been there from about eight to twelve days; it is a very insidious form in such weak children, and progresses slowly; it gradually spreads throughout the lungs; the emaciation was obviously due either to insufficient or improper food—I came to the conclusion that it had not been properly fed, and that was a contributing cause to its death—it would render it more liable to pneumonia, and much less liable to recover from it—its chance of life would be next to none.</p>

I took one to the hospital three weeks ago, but they would not take it in "—I took her to the station; the charge was read over to her—she said, "I have said too much, I shall say no more; if you want to know any more you must find out"—on 16th January she was charged at the Policecourt with the manslaughter of Stephen Simmons—she made no reply.</p>
