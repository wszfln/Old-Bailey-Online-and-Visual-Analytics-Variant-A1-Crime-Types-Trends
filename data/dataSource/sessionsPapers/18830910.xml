                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had only opened my shop on 23rd March, and I was in a great bustle—I am sure he said he was canvassing for Platt and Burdett—he gave his own address as 34, Stanstead Road; that is on the receipt—I did not look at the receipt at the time; I was too busy—I heard from my predecessor that Platt and Burdett printed a local directory—they had canvassed me for orders, but I had not given one—I was con<lb/>versing with the prisoner for about an hour and a half—I believe he showed me two or three directories; I did not see the outsides of them; he opened them in the centre, and said I could have the page opposite the Court Guide.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been manager at the Golden lion in Dean Street, Soho, for about six months—on Monday, 6th August, Bank Holiday, between 8 and 9 o'clock, the prisoner came into the bar and called for some gin and paid for it, and then called for a second lot; he did not pay for that, he was asked to pay—I came round the bar and he offered to toss me, and threw up what I took to be a half<lb/>sovereign—I said I did not toss—he offered to put it on a horse for me—I said I did not bet on horses—my wife asked him again for the money—he began abusing me and called me a bastard—I went and sat down in the taproom, he followed me there—there was more abusive</p>

M." and "D.

                  </hi>. I am a prisoner in Her Majesty's Prison, Clerkenwell—I pleaded guilty last July to stealing certain wool the property of my masters, Messrs. Buxton—I have known James Sait about four years and William six months—I had been in Messrs. Buxton's employ as sample man for nearly eight years—I was with James Sait one evening last March talking of a man named Martin, who was then in custody for receiving stolen wool—Sait, knowing where I was employed, and that I had sold stolen wool to Martin, asked me to give him a turn, and he would pay me the same price as Martin, and said he could do with any amount of it, and he would send in the morning to fetch it away before business hours—he said he was in partnership with his brother, and sometimes the wool went to his brother's place and sometimes his own—I sent them wool from about the beginning of April to about the end of June by a carman named Holliday—he was sent by James Sait—I sent the wool off about 7.30 or 7.45 a.m. in rag bags—after the third trans<lb/>action William Sait proposed to send some of his rag bags, as they looked dirty, and there was less chance of detection he thought—I was paid 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

               <p>per pound for it by James Sait in the presence of his brother William, mostly in cash—James's shop was 89, Roman Road—I believe the name "W. Sait" was over the door—William Sait carried on business at 76, St. Stephen's Road—I went with James Sait to William's shop on one occasion, when William produced a cheque-book, and James filled it in, making it payable to bearer on account of bottles—on this occasion I grumbled about the price of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and they said they could do no more, as they only got 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. themselves, and they thought 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound was little enough profit for them, considering the risk they ran—they gave me at different times cheques for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and, I believe, one for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—William Sait would sign the cheque—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was cashed at a neighbouring public-house midway between the two shops in the Roman Road—I should know the publican—I sent some wool during June—it was taken away by the carman Holliday—I sometimes sent two bags, sometimes three—each ballot would weigh about 90 pounds more or less, according to the size of the bag—the last transaction was near the end of June, when I believe three ballots were taken away—when I was in the House of Detention awaiting my trial James Sait said to me one day if I were convicted and he got out he would help to support my wife and family—he said if I said I never sold him any wool and he got out he would do as he said.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 98, Estcourt Road—I was for about two years in the service of Messrs. Curtis and Thomas, butchers, of 10, West Kensington Terrace, and 2, Clare Terrace, Westbourne Road—Hughes, Stewart, and Field were in the same employment; Hughes was foreman, Stewart was carman, and Field was a lad, like myself—Pym was em<lb/>ployed as a journeyman at 2, Clare Terrace, which is about half an hour's walk from the other shop—on Saturday morning, 21st July, about 6.30 Mr. Curtis was away—I saw Hughes hand a loin of mutton to Field—I did not hear what he said—he also gave him a black overcoat, and something else, which looked like a latch-key—Field went to the right of the shop, in the direction of May Street, where Hughes lives—about half-past I the same day, when Mr. Curtis was away at dinner time, Hughes asked me if I wanted anything(I understood what he meant; he had given me meat before, on other days)—I said "This evening will do"—about supper time, half-past 9, he gave me a loin of mutton—I showed it to Inspector Leach, at Edith Villas, and then took it to cedar Mews, where Stewart lives—about a fortnight before 21st August I had made a com<lb/>munication to my master—I knew that Leach was waiting to see me, I went there by appointment—it was only about two minutes' walk from the shop—he made a cross on the mutton—I then left it at Stewart's house—I had been there before—Stewart did not know that I had taken it there—I did not tell him that I was going to take it there—I left it there so that I could fetch it after the shop was shut—I had left meat there on previous occasions—before I went there this time Hughes was</p>

               <p>outside the shop selling meat to casual customers—I did not see Hughes hand anything to Stewart at that time—about 20 minutes to 10 that same evening I saw Field take away a loin of mutton—Hughes handed it to him—it was not chopped—loins are generally chopped when sent out"—Field took it away in a basket in the direction of May Street—I had seen Hughes and Field in conversation two or three minutes before—Stewart was in the habit of driving a cart—on Saturday night it was his custom to take in the cart a portion of meat from the West Kensington shop to the Richmond Terrace shop, so as to be kept there in an ice safe—on that night I said to Stewart "Where are you going to leave it to night?"—he said "At Pym's house"—I helped load the cart with meat—Hughes, Stewart, and Field assisted—it was usual to weigh the meat before it was put in the cart, and book the weights—Hughes weighed the meat that night, and called out the weights—Stewart was within hearing—I did not notice what weights Hughes called out—I had never had any con<lb/>versation with Hughes as to the calling out of the weights; I had with Stewart about six months before—I asked him how it was managed at the other shop—he told me they deducted the weight here, and when it was weighed at the other shop they could not tell the difference—I am not able to say whether the weights Hughes called out on this night were correct or not—Stewart would sometimes call out the weight; at other times he would load the cart from the scale—a ticket would be made out for the weight, which Stewart would take to the other shop—I don't know who would receive the weight there to see if it was correct—Pym was employed there.</p>

I am the husband of last witness—I know Hughes—he formerly lodged with me—I know Field—on the night of 21st July, when I came home at 12 o'clock, my wife made a statement to me, and I found two loins of mutton in the house—I threw them into the water tank next morning—I took them back to Mr. Curtis—I have seen Field once or twice when he has brought meat to my house, and he or one of the others has called for it—I mean Spencer—no one else to my knowledge—it has been left five or six times between them, I should think.</p>

I live at 8, Canal Road, Shoreditch, and am a wheelwright—on 19th July, shortly after midnight, I had been in a public-house near the high road, near Hoxton, and was going home—when near the corner of the high road the prisoner, whom I had not seen before to my knowledge, came behind me, took hold of me, said "Halloa," opened my coat, and took out my pocket-book from a side pocket—I said, "What are you doing of?" and took hold of the end of his coat and collar—he dragged me on to the side of the road—I called out "Police"—he said, "I will give you your pocket-book back if you will let me go"—I said "No," and called out "Police"—they came and took the pocket-book out of his hand—there were a cheque for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a few of my cards in it—I did not notice any people about when this occurred—I cannot say if the prisoner was sober.</p>

I live at 8, Chipperham Place, Kilburn—I am 25 years old, and have been a cab-proprietor ten months—on Wednesday, 1st August, I went to Aldridge's Repository with my cab and horse, and got a catalogue of a sale there—while I was looking at it a man asked to borrow it, and I heard him speak to the prisoner about two horses—the prisoner then came and said that his master said something about two horses which they had got outside, but could not bring into the sale—I heard him say to the other man, that his master was in the office—he asked me to go outside and have a look at the horses, and as we were going out the prisoner said "Oh, here is the master!" and another man appeared on the scene, who I afterwards knew as Jall—the prisoner told Jall that he had brought me out to show me the chesnut mare—Jall said "All right; come along"—he and I and the prisoner crossed the road, and went down Castle Street, and at the corner I saw in a cart a dark chesnut mare, about 15 hands high, fat and good looking—she appeared to be all right—a man was standing at the near side of her, holding her head—Jall said that he was going to sell her because she was not fit for breeding, and not big enough to put to the plough, and that Sawyer had driven her 18 months—the prisoner said "Yes; and I never drove a better"—I asked Jall the price, in the prisoner's presence—he said he would take 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that it was too much, and I had not sufficient—he asked how much I had got; I told him 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—we went into a public-house, and I arranged to exchange my mare for his mare, give him 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and security for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was to try his mare as soon as they were changed—he asked me to hold the ink for him while Sawyer took my mare out and put his in—Sawyer went out while Jall wrote out an agree<lb/>ment; I signed it, and handed him over 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and signed this note of hand (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then went out to try the mare, and found her in my cab—my mare had disappeared, and Sawyer also—some men then came out and claimed half a sovereign from mo for doing them out of a bargain—I got up on my box and found the mare was lame in her near front leg, and I was afraid to let her trot—I found that the nerves of the feet had been cut, and that she had been fired—I got her as far as Leicester Square, and walked her all the way home, and found she was no use whatever—I sold her for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have seen no more of my mare—I applied to the police, and the prisoner was taken on the 8th.</p>

               <p>her legs, which I might have done—I was quite satisfied with my in<lb/>spection—I believe the mare I drove away was the same I bought of Jall—I told Wootton, who sold her for me, that she was lame—I did not say that she was unstrung—I did not fix any price—I should have honoured this document if the horse was right—I have said "I could not pay the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when it became due as I have not the money"—I went to Bow Street on 1st August—I said before the Magistrate that in my opinion Jall was the more guilty party, and I wished to withdraw the charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I called the attention of police to the mare before I got her home—I did not conceal that she was lame—I told Wootton to sell her for what he could get—I had given 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my horse, six weeks before—I stated the facts to the Magistrate, and a warrant was granted against the prisoner and Jall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer—on 12th July I was at a horse sale at Paddington—it was raining very hard, and the prisoner came up to me in a shed—he appeared to be bargaining with another man, and said "This man has offered me a sum of money and wants to deduct 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the auction duty; I am not sharp enough for London horse dealers; my father is a farmer at Godstone; I was with him some years, but not liking a country life I came up to London and started in a glass and china business; I bought this young horse, and it is not strong enough for my work; my people frequently give him a load of two tons' weight, and I want to sell it"—he said that he brought it from Mile End to put it into Mr. Rymer's sale, but he refused to allow it as it was a private auction, and the man he had been talking to was going to give him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; but he had refused it because he wanted to deduct 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. auction duty—he said "You don't want a horse, do you?"—I said "I want a rough horse for the farm"—I went out and looked at it—it was tied to a cart—I said "Trot it out"—he said "I have trotted it out for the man who came to me, and a policeman told me he would take the horse and me also if I did it again"—I thought it was a young horse, and offered him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for it—I gave him a cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and arranged that the horse should be sent to me at Waterloo Station—the prisoner gave me this paper: "July 12th, 1883. Sold to Mr. Sparks, a horse for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., warranted sound and quiet. F. Sawyer." I went to "Waterloo Station and the horse did not arrive—I had given him my address, and when I got home I found a telegram, and he came down with the horse next day—in the mean time I had stopped the cheque—I saw him just outside my bank at Guildford—he had been there, and he told me that the horse was at the station—I, thinking it was all right, gave him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and he returned my cheque—I sent for the horse and found it utterly useless—I went to the prisoner's address in London, and saw the man who he had been talking to at Paddington, but he jumped into his cart and drove off—I went back, and then received this letter from the prisoner: "July 17.—Dear Sir,—You called at my residence yesterday.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188309100061"/>
               <p>I am sorry I was out. Please let me know your business, as I shall be at home on Thursday to meet you if you are coming to town." I did not go to town, but I wrote—I then received this letter: "Dear Sir,—In answer to your letter respecting the horse, I am sorry to think it did not suit you. I am willing to take it back if you will send word when he will be at the station, and send a man to meet him and pay expenses." I wrote again, but got no answer—the doctor did all he could for the horse, but he was beyond all cure—on 10th August I went to Bow Street to see a man examined in a horse-coping case, and recognised the prisoner, and gave evidence against him—after the remand some one came down to Guildford, gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and took the animal away.</p>

I live at 5, Bryanston Square—I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> for a lady to join a gentleman in a light profitable business—the address was "H.

Do you want this for yourself?"—I said "No, it is for an old friend of mine. What business is it?"—he said "Drapery"—I said "That will not suit my friend"—he called again on the 13th, and said "I think you will be glad to hear that I have met with a lady partner who has a capital of 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I have 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., will you kindly allow me the use of a sitting-room, as the lady lives at Hastings, and wishes to come up to<lb/>morrow morning to meet me in town to see the landlord, and it can<lb/>not be done at a restaurant or at any of the railway stations?"—I said that my dining-room was quite at his disposal for half an hour or so, and he left—the appointment was for 11 a.m., and a little before 11 on the 14th Pugh came and said "I am going to wait for Mr. Harding and a lady"—shortly afterwards Mann and Harding appeared, but no lady—I heard Pugh talking very loudly, apparently vexed that the lady was not coming, and Mann came out of the room and said to me "I have been down to the station, and the lady has sent me a telegram saying that she could not come up till Thursday, and the landlord had had another offer for the house, and is going straight there to see the party, and unless I can pay a deposit I shall lose the house, and the lady will be so disappointed; I don't want to break faith with her, can you lend me just sufficient to pay the deposit?"—I said "What does your landlord want?"—he said "Well, I think he will be satisfied with 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or so; I will go and ask him how little he will take"—he went into the room where Pugh was—the door was not open, but I was in the hall, and Pugh spoke very loud, and said "I won't take less than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—Mann came back, and said "The landlord won't take less than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I wrote this cheque for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave it to him, believing his statement.

Dear Miss Brent,—When I reached home yesterday I found a letter to go to Hastings at once. I am staying here till Friday, and will call on you when I return. C.

I should not think of parting with my money unless I see the landlord himself"—Pugh said "I am the landlord's son; my father is in Manchester till Monday"—she said "Well, I would rather wait and see your father"—they all left the house together—I never received my 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

Adams, Esq., Discount Office, Bank of England, to say that our establishment was bond fide, not because I wanted to borrow money of you—you said that you would send patients to me—there is a crack in the dining-room door, and Pugh was so excited that I heard what he said—I did not hear the landlord's name mentioned, but each time Pugh came my maid said "Here is Mr. Steddall"—I did not borrow 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of a young woman named Yate—I received 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from her to train her as a nurse, but she changed her mind, and I told her I would return the fee—she is not serving me—I am not in great difficulties—I did not want to borrow 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay her off.</p>

I am assistant gamekeeper to Sir Charles Mils—on the evening of 23rd; December, 1878, between 5 and 6 o'clock, Halford came to my cottage; he was smothered with blood and bleeding from a wound behind his left ear; he had no hat, I lent him one of mine—I went with him to Mr. Gould, the head keeper; he felt faint—Mr. Gould gave him a drop of brandy—I went with him to the station, and after<lb/>wards to the doctor's—next morning I went to the plantations; the snow was all beaten down, and blood all about—I got on the track of the footsteps of three men and a dog—I traced them about 500 or 600 yards away from the cover, and then I got on some going back to the cover—I found a fork broken in the handle, a big knobbed stick, and a cap torn all to pieces; there was blood on the fork handle and on the iron—I had seen the prisoner once before, I saw him at Axbridge.</p>

               <p>was the difference between 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the alleged amount of the cheque given to me; and he claimed that 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the action—112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was all I had, and I waited twelve months for that—he was present, and drew that cheque—there was no discussion at the time as to the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never promised him any portion of the preliminary expenses—I was en<lb/>titled to 271<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as dividend—it is not true that I had promised the prisoner certain shares out of the shares of which that was the dividend—I gave him 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of shares—I suppose the dividend on those shares would amount to about 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I had received the whole 271<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was going to pay in the cheque, and he asked me to hold it over, as he expected two or three heavy payments in shortly—I said I would do so—at every meeting after that I mentioned the cheque to him, and its not being paid—we met every Wednesday—he replied that he expected those payments, Tagg's for one, every day, and asked me to hold it over from time to time—I was never paid—Mr. Pierpoint, Mr. Messent, and several of the directors were present when he asked me to hold it over.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am manager of the stationery department, and I think ail the departments are worked on the same principle—there are a permanent and a relief cashier to each counterman—I think Rhodes was the prisoner's permanent cashier—if I have said that customers, from him would go to Dawson's desk that is right—I was told the cashier was Dawson at that date, I don't know from my own knowledge—the relief cashier would take the post of cashier for the dinner hour—I believe a special relief cashier was told off for days or weeks, as might be—the customer would give the relief cashier the two invoices, and he would keep one and give the other back—the relief cashier would give an account before he leaves to the cashier, who would have to account at the end of the day—I don't know how the relief and permanent cashiers settle it—at the end of the day the foreman checks the totals of the cashier's and counterman's summaries, not the accounts, only the totals—he has other duties—he does not add it up—it is no check if the men like to conspire—if a man made a mistake and the other found it out that would not be a check—the counterman adds up his own castings—the castings and the totals in the cashier's book are checked in the chief cashier's office on the following day, the sum<lb/>maries were not checked at that date—the counterman's totals are only checked by the foreman—the counterman's and cashier's summaries were not checked by anybody, the foreman looked at the figures at the bottom to see if they corresponded—no one checks the cashier's and counterman's summaries with the counterman's book—with reference to these entries in pencil instead of carbon we charge the prisoner with falsifying the books, I believe—it should have been written in carbon; the members' names and numbers and description of goods should have been given—the figures in every case are put at the bottom, purporting to be the amounts received by the prisoner for goods sold and delivered, and every one of those amounts has been carried into his summary and also into his cashier's daily summary, and subsequently into the cashier's book—I have been carefully through this book, and I believe I have given you every instance where he has used pencil instead of carbon—14299 in book 63 is in pencil, I have not given that, it is a complete bill, Lark<lb/>ham, Esq., a letter-balance, pen, &amp;c.; it is with pencil—he may have had some reason to fill it in afterwards—there are not dozens of cases in these books where pencil has been used—the next one, 14300, is in pencil; that is charged in the indictment—he has there given particulars of the goods, and cast them out, but omitted name and number, and we have no means of checking it; if the name of the ticket-holder had appeared there I would have undertaken to check it—each ticket-holder's name and number is registered—I am not aware that scores of people use the ticket of one person; they may lend them—people are supposed to produce their ticket, and we refuse them if they have not one; a</p>

               <p>notice is up, and has been for months—I cannot say how many in a thousand are asked to show their ticket; sometimes we have special orders for a certain time to ask for them—it is a practice for persons who hold entirely different names to that of the registered number, to go and buy goods under that ticket, but not in scores of cases—if Snooks had gone in the name of Brown we should have known to whom the ticket was given and have gone to him; if he said he gave it to many persons we should have gone to each one; we could easily find who it was—if you came and bought goods under the guise of No. so-and-so we should not find fault with you afterwards if we found it out—the chief grounds on which I suggest we have been defrauded is that the amounts are very small—the number of leaves torn out from the book are 15, I think, altogether—I say that the Stores have been defrauded in the case of this bill where the goods and the amount are mentioned, and the amount entered in the counterman's and cashier's daily summaries and in the cashier's book, because the bill is imperfect and we have no means of checking it; that is the chief reason—we find a few discrepancies which we are able to check, and so we pick these out as well—the third leaf is not perforated—I do not know whether Mr. Winter was a ticket-holder; I find in the invoice, "Ticket 14025, S. Winter, Esq., 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—no goods are mentioned—when a person becomes a member we take his name and address—I have not communicated with Mr. Winter to know whether he did pay 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on that day, it was not my business; I simply say this bill has been tampered with—he has accounted for the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the incorrect entry—I cannot say that is the amount he received from Mr. Winter—I had the means of testing the account if the particulars were correct—we have a shareholder's register, in which the number of each ticket is registered, but I don't think it is here—August and September is the time when we are preparing for the Christmas cards—it is not the prisoner's department, but he might be one of the men sent to mark the cards off—he would be taken away from his counter till evening—his book would remain on the counter—the men who remain would put down in their own books what they supplied customers with, and account to the cashier—if we wanted him he would be sent for from upstairs if there were not sufficient men to serve—I have tested "Sworder, Esq.," and believe it is the proper name—the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the bill agrees with the bill the member took away; the member says that he paid the same amount—I am not aware that anybody is here who made these figures—I cannot tell anything about sheet "R."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If the daily summary agrees with that of the cashier, that is. supposed to be the check, and if they both did their duty it would be—it was not considered necessary to compare the daily summary with the accountant's book—with the exception of Winter's accounts, we have no means of telling the true amount received from the counterman—those amounts are carried into the cash book so as to agree—in the other instance, where the leaves are destroyed, all I can say is, the amount agrees with the amounts the prisoner has put down on his slips.</p>

               <p>after I came out, acting under advice, I made a communication to Mr. Dutton, the solicitor—I was employed as a cashier in the stationery department—I was stationed at desk "B"—the cashier at desk "A" in August and September last year was named Dawson—the relief cashier was named Canning—during August and September the prisoner was a cashier in the same department in the room I was in—his cus<lb/>tomers, in the ordinary course of business, would have to go to desk "A" to pay their money—at the end of June, or the beginning of July, last year, I met Barnes in a public-house in Rochester Bow, in the evening—I cannot fix the date nearer than that—I can't say the exact words, but I made arrangements with him to embezzle money in the Stores—I asked him if he would help me <hi rend="italic">work</hi> the bills in the stationery department, and he said, "Would there be any chance of getting found out?"—I said no, if we were very careful it would be almost impossible—he said he would try, and he would have another conversation with me—I explained the system if his bills were to to paid at my desk—I told him if he was to place his carbon so as to leave the third bill blank, I could detain the first two bills which were paid into my desk, and destroy the bills; and he could enter any amount agreed upon on the blank third sheet—that would to the odd pence; but if it was 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he would put down 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and if it was 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he would put down 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said if be could send the bills to my desk, I would enter the amount of pence we agreed upon, and pay it to the cashier at the other desk. I arranged some names—"Day," "Martin," "Wilson," "Bird," and "Hewett"—I don't remember the name of "Gordon"—we did not always keep to those names—sometimes we would enter a name agreed upon the slip of paper—I would enter the amount on paper, and pay it to the other cashier; I was bound to pay in something—I was to destroy the bill; but sometimes the customer would take one bill away—I generally tried to get both bills to destroy—I ought to have filed one and given him one back—in the case of an accident in packing up and the customer coming back, they would not know which counterman served him—we afterwards went to a music hall together, and the matter was again discussed between us—we arranged it—I commenced these operations on the bills at the end of June or the beginning of July—I was not the cashier; I was at desk "B"—this was done at any part of the day I was able to get the bills—when a customer brought me a bill it would have a letter on it—when a bill came to my desk with "A" on it, and it was marked with Barge's number, I should look to him for the sign which we had previously arranged; if the bill was to be embezzled he would take his handkerchief out and wipe his face; and if not, he would scratch his head—sometimes he would nod his head, and use his handkerchief at the same time—after that sign was given I would act in the manner I have detailed—that practice continued up to the beginning of October, last year—the money would be divided between me and Barge in the evening, after business hours—I should take the money—altogether, I should think the total amount divided during that period would be over 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I see that page 14210 in book 63 is missing—Barge told me how the leaves could be torn out of his book—he said if in any case he omitted the blank paper under the carbon, and I got that bill, he would tear the leaf out in every case where we had embezzled the money—he told me that several days after we had arranged to do it—I came out of prison on 17th March—</p>

               <p>after I came out, I met Barge in Rochester Row, about the beginning of may—I was with my landlady, Mrs. Kettringham, when I met him—he came up and said "How the devil are you?"—I told him I was all right, and promised to meet him in a quarter of an hour—I went in with him and promised to go round to his place to see him—he was living at Mrs. Flirt's, 4, St. John Street, Westminster—I went there, and he asked me how I had been getting on—I spoke to him, and he said, "I have been <hi rend="italic">chaffed</hi> by several of the countermen at the time of your arrest, saying that I shall be the next taken"—I said, "You need not have any fear, as I have said nothing concerning it"—he said, "I think it is all right now, as I don't think there are any bills left, but there may be one; I have destroyed the best part of the bills"—I went about four times to his rooms.</p>

               <p>Barge—the first time I started was with Barge—I had not robbed the stores before I entered into conversation with Barge in July, 1882—when I said that it was four or five months after I entered the Stores that I commenced robbing the Stores, I might have made a mistake—the first time I began to rob the Stores was with Barge—I have had cause to think over my robberies from the Stores since I was convicted, but I cannot give the first sum I defrauded the Stores of in conjunction with Barge, or any details—I have no memory of the first sum—I cannot give the amount, not when we first started, or who the customer was—lean give one trans<lb/>action, either in August or September—it was nearly the last bill we had, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it was paid in on Saturday morning by two ladies—I think the article was a scrap album—I entered the sixpence on paper, and paid it in to the other cashier—I cannot swear that that is the bill I allude to (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); I think that it is the entry—this is properly entered, "Mrs. Taylor," the number of the ticket, the description of the goods, and the right amount paid—I have been spoken to about this case by the solicitor for the prosecution, Mr. Dutton, and my uncle has strongly urged upon me that I should give evidence—this very entry was shown to me by Mr. Dutton with all these particulars, and then I made a statement about this one—I cannot think of the customers in any transaction which Barge and I had together, and which is not entered in this book—we had a bill for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I received the money and paid it to the other cashier at the other desk; it was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I cannot tell exactly—that was several weeks before this amount of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I asked him at night, what he had done with the bill, and he said he had destroyed it—one item was an ink well for a lady—I cannot refer to the entry in the book, because if the bill is torn out I should not know where it is, but I think it was in August—I entered either 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., some very small amount—Barge would enter that in his book—I am quite sure I entered it so that either it would appear as 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I entered it on a slip of paper, and I handed it to the other cashier—if I had his bills, he would nod his head and wipe his face if I embezzled—if he scratched his head I should know that I was not to do that particular bill—that was the sign between us—the counterman is behind the counter, and I am in a little box, but he could come up to my end of the counter—he could serve the other part of the counter if he liked—he did not move up to the part of the counter nearest me every time he intended to embezzle, and he was not generally at the end of the counter nearest to me when he did embezzle—the nod. was to embezzle a bill—a great number of people were passing between the prisoner and me—there is one counter on one side and one on the other—there was no trouble whatever to see the prisoner—I could very easily see him, but in some cases I could not see whether he was going to embezzle a bill till I got it to my desk—sometimes when the goods were sent I would do it, but I had no right to take the other cashier's bills, except when he was absent from his desk—a great many of the customers run away without taking the bill, and sometimes they say "Will you keep the bill?" and I say "Yes"—a great many customers are careless of the bills, and don't take them—I think I destroyed the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bill, but I cannot swear it—I destroyed one of the bills—I think the lady threw it on the floor—I might on one occasion have beckoned to customers with the idea of getting them myself, to rob the Society—I</p>

Barge was standing close to my desk, and he nodded—I was not quite confiedent, and went down and asked him if I should do that particular bill, and he said "All right"—if I saw it was Barge's customer I would say "Pay at this desk, Madam"—I have asked them to come to my desk, whereas they would have gone to the "A" desk, which stands in the centre of the room—I did not say at the police-court in reference to this 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "Barge made no sign at all"—I said he nodded, and I did not know whether he was going to do that particular bill—I was not certain about his sign, or I should have gone—he was not in conversation with a lady; I was—I went to a public-house afterwards with Barge—this conversation, with Barge after I came out of prison, was in his bedroom at St. John Street—the first time I went to Mr. Dutton was 27th June—he sent me a letter, and I went with my uncle—Mr. Dutton said that there were several other cases against me—he did not tell me that inasmuch as they were not men<lb/>tioned in the indictment at the Middlesex Session to which I pleaded guilty, it was quite competent for the Stores to prosecute me again; nothing like it—he did not say that I had not been punished for these, but that I might be; nothing like it—he asked me to tell the truth, and in accordance with my uncle a wishes I did so—I made a statement—I don't know what else he asked me or told me—in the letter he said there were several other cases against me—the letter is at home—until I received his letter I had not said one word about what I have said to-day—my uncle did not begin to act until I had shown him the letter—he had no knowledge that there was anything else against me—we were generally in the habit of dividing the money in the Albert public-house; we might once or twice have divided it somewhere else—I have sometimes sent it by one of the boys to him—I cannot tell how much I embezzled; I dare say 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. between me and Lloyd, in the grocery department—I have divided about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or more with Barge in one department, and 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with Lloyd in the other—I can give you the details of another case—I had several bills one day, and there was a similar one of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it was about the beginning of October—that was the last bill I had with Barge—I have not seen it in his counter-book; it has not been shown to him—I mentioned it to Mr. Dutton.</p>

In taking an order from a customer for goods to be taken away, I will place between the second and third sheets, under the carbon paper, a sheet of paper to stop the impression from going through on to the third sheet.

I did carry on business as a coal merchant 357, Goswell Road; I have changed now—I engaged Rogers as a traveller on 4th November, 1882—he gave me as a reference the firm of Norton, Bower, and Co., 66, Holborn Viaduct—I applied to them and got this answer. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that they always found him honest and considered him a very respectable and persevering young man.</hi>) I went there and spoke to a man who said he was Norton, and he said he knew Rogers to be a very respectable man, consequently I engaged him as a traveller—as soon as he was engaged I got an order from Miller, of 39, Warwick Road, by post, on an order sheet, along with other orders—before executing the order, I sent another traveller to look at the house; he came back and said he was in a beautifully furnished house, and he believed it was all right; but before I executed the order I asked Rogers, and he told me that Miller was a man in a position, and that his would be a first-class</p>

Wontner at the earliest opportunity; that was all I had—I never had the goods which Rogers represents me to have had.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Hamilton, and am a monthly nurse; we live at Walthamstow—I knew the prisoner and his wife and three children; they had lived at Walthamstow at the house where this matter occurred, occupying two kitchens and one back room, for about eleven months—I had lived there about ten weeks up to that time, occupy<lb/>ing the front room on the same floor, with my husband—their three children were, Charles, about 3 1/2 years old; Herbert, 2 1/2 years; and Frederick, 16 months—the prisoner was a whitesmith by trade, I believe, and used to go every day to his work in London—on 1st August I attended his wife in her confinement; she was delivered of two male children—up to that time the prisoner attended regularly to his work—the confinement took place on Wednesday, at 10.30 at night—he went to his work on the Thursday and Friday, but not after the Friday—on two occasions before the following Wednesday, the 8th, I noticed him very strange and quiet, and sitting crying—I only saw him once the worse for drink; that was on the Friday after the babies were born, after he came home—up to that time he had always been a sober, industrious man—on Wednesday, the 8th, I was in the bedroom attending to the prisoner's wife and the babies; he came home about a quarter past 5 in the evening, and went into the bedroom; I went into the kitchen, where the two eldest children were playing; the third child, Frederick, was in the bedroom with the wife and babies—the prisoner came into the kitchen; I said "I wondered who it was; you did frighten me"—that was about a quarter past 5; he made no answer; his usual time for coming homo was 7.30—I, did not say anything else—I went back into the bedroom and left him with the two children in the kitchen—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188309100135"/>
               <p>was there three or four minutes, not longer, and then came into the bedroom—his wife said "What makes you home so early?"—he said he came out while the manager was gone to dinner—she said "Did you tell them I was confined?"—he said "No"—she said "Didn't you tell Mr. Graves?"—he is the foreman at the works—the prisoner said "No," and then took little Frederick up off the bed and went out into the kitchen, which is on the same floor, with him—I did not notice anything in his manner or demeanour at that time; he seemed very quiet—I went on washing the babies, and when I had washed one I went into the kitchen to fetch something—the prisoner was sitting on the fire-guard, which comes all round the grate and rests on the floor; the fire was alight; the prisoner's back was towards it; the children were play<lb/>ing about there—the prisoner had a piece of string or thin twine in his hand; I did not say anything to him, and went back again into the bed<lb/>room—I was away from the kitchen for about ten minutes, and then returned and asked him if he had had his tea—he said "No"—I said his tea was ready then; it was on the table and the tea was on the hob—the three children were then playing in the kitchen—I went through the wash-house to the other kitchen on the same floor—the prisoner was still sitting on the fire-guard, and I noticed the perambulator was moved from under-neath the cistern, and a chair, which usually stood by the side of the cistern, placed there—to reach the cistern you had to get on a chair—I asked the prisoner who placed the chair there; Charley said "My <hi rend="italic">dada</hi> put it there"—I went back again into the bedroom, got the prisoners wife out of bed, remade the bed, and was there some little time—I might have been there twenty minutes before I saw the prisoner again; then he came along the passage and looked into the room; I told him he could come in; he said something to himself, I could not distinguish the words, and went into the kitchen again—I thought he wanted to say something to his wife, and so I spoke to her and left the bedroom and went downstairs—the kitchens are on the first floor—when I was on the stairs going down I heard the kitchen door open and I heard the prisoner go into the bedroom—I had got to the yard door when I heard screams of "Murder" from the prisoner's wife; that could not have been more than two or three minutes after I had left her—I rushed at once up to the bedroom door and tried it and found it locked—the prisoner's wife said "Come in; he is murdering my children"—I could not force the door; I called for help; Mrs. Clark was at the bootom of the garden; she came, and we both tried to force the door, but could not—I called to the prisoner to open the door, but I never heard him answer—after we had been at the door about three minutes he opened it—I said "Mr. Gouldstone, what have you done, you wicked man?"—he said "No, I am a happy man"—I passed into the bedroom to his wife, and he passed me and went out into the kitchen—he did not say anything about the other children—I then went up to the bedside and saw the babies; they were both alive, bleeding from the mouth and nose, and appeared to be dying, seriously injured—I took a small sheet and covered them over, so that the mother should not see them, and sent for a doctor—then from what the wife said I went into the kitchen—the prisoner was there with the youngest of the three elder children in his arms, wringing wet and apparently dead; he laid him on the floor, and then I turned round and saw the wife coming into the kitchen, and I went back with her and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188309100136"/>
               <p>remained with her in the bedroom about a quarter of an hour I dare say, and then went out again into the kitchen and saw the three, Charles, Herbert, and Frederick, lying there on the floor side by side, all wet and dead—the prisoner was standing there—I went back to the bedroom and remained there some time till the policeman brought the prisoner into the bedroom—he said to his wife "All your children are dead, and I shall be hanged, and you will be single again; you wished they were dead, and now you have got your wish"—he had not said anything as to how they had come by their death—he then kissed his wife—she asked him if he had any money—he said "Yes," and put his hand in his pocket and gave her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then he was taken away by the constable—I remained behind—previous to that one of the constables asked me for the hammer, and I afterwards picked up from the floor by the dressing-table and near the bed an ordinary large hammer for knocking in nails, and gave it to the constable—I had never seen the hammer before—I attended to the mother and the two babies; one died half an hour afterwards in my arms, and the other at 2 o'clock the next morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I first went into the kitchen the children were sitting on the floor playing, and the prisoner was sitting with his back to the fire looking down at his hands, not at them—both his hands were holding the twine; he was turning it round and looking at it—when I came back on the second occasion he was still looking at the twine and playing with it—the room was a small one—the children seemed happy—when I left the wife, before I went up and found the door locked, I left the two babies in bed; she was sitting up—since I have known them I have had opportunity of observing his demeanour towards his wife and children—as far as I can say up to this time he had always appeared a good husband, and very fond of his wife and children, and they seemed very happy together—I have seen him play with the children—on the Sunday he used to sit in the kitchen and amuse them—I have seen that several times; I was a good deal in there with them—after the twins were born I noticed he was very strange; he seemed so quiet, and used to sit still, and if you spoke to him he did not answer you; he seemed absent, and far less cheerful than he had done before—I have heard his wife say he had come home with a headache that came on suddenly—I have seen him put his hand to his head a great deal, and he would then complain of pain—I have never heard him complain at all about being short of money, or of not being able to support the children—as far as I noticed he was always a sober, well-conducted man, and always came home every night; never missed since I have known them.</p>

I am the wife of Charles Clark, a carpenter, and the tenant of 8, Courtnay Place, St. James's Street—the prisoner and his wife and family had lodged with us about eleven months—they were strangers to me before they came to lodge there—the prisoner has always been a steady, quiet man, very fond of his wife, and kind to his children—Mrs. Gouldstone was confined on Wednesday, 1st August, about 10.30 p.m.—the prisoner was not at home then—when he came in I told him his wife had been confined, and that there were two—he looked strange when I told him so—he did not say anything—I did not see him the night after the confinement—on the Wednesday afternoon, the 8th, about 5.30, I was in the garden hanging out the clothes to dry, when I heard the nurse run upstairs and call for help—I ran up after her, went to the bedroom door,</p>

I suppose some of you gentlemen have been round?" Dr. Gould replied "Tolerable"—the prisoner said "Are the two young ones dead?"

I reside at Leyton—about 6 o'clock on the evening of the 8th I was called by Inspector Folkard, and went with him to 8, Courtney Place, and into the front room on the first floor—I there saw a bed in which were two male children, apparently a few days old—I examined them, and found them both suffering from fractured skulls; blood was issuing from the nose and mouth of one of them—they were living, but in a dying state—I then went into the kitchen and saw three children lying on their faces on the floor, dead—the clothes of two that had clothes on were saturated with water—on the eldest, Charles, there was a mark as if a piece of thin string had been tied round his throat—the others had no marks whatever—the same night, shortly after 8, I went to the house, and found there that one of the younger children had died, and next morning I found the other of the twins dead—I made a post-mortem examination on the 9th of all the bodies—the two younger died from injury to the skull and brain; the three in the kitchen died from suffocation from drowning—before this injury they were apparently in health and fairly nourished.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am physician at Bethlehem Hospital—I have examined the prisoner, and from the examination alone I should consider him rather weak in mind, as evidenced by a slowness of apprecia<lb/>tion of questions concerning the crime of which he is accused; when speak<lb/>ing about it he seemed not to appreciate in any way the gravity of the charge—beyond that from my personal examination I can say nothing—I have heard the evidence as to his being a steady workman, quiet, and fond of his wife and children, and the details of the killing of the children—from that I should think his mind was unsound at the time he 'committed the act—such symptoms as have been deeailed by his fellow-workmen are frequently present with persons of unsound mind—I suppose they are to be found in persons of Bound mind, but certainly not as a rule—I have heard the evidence as to his mother and aunt; the insanity on the mother's side having been proved, I should say the prisoner has a very great tendency to become insane, and if insanity, however remote, were proved on the male side, it would considerably increase the liability in the offspring.</p>

I am the son of William Lake, and live at 6, Con<lb/>way Terrace, Stratford—on 25th January I met the defendant in High Street, Stratford, and next day I saw him in the little cottage at Merton, where he lives—he asked if I wanted to buy any machinery, I asked what it was; he said an 8-horse-power steam-engine, nearly new, which cost 200 guineas a little more than 12 months before, and that there were two saw benches, 13 saws, and all the gear—I went home and spoke to my father, and he and I went down to Merton again on Saturday—the prisoner took us to a place at Tooting to see the machinery—on the way there he said "I have got these things to sell for a man; he has promised me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I want you to pay me, that I may not lose the money"—we saw the engine only, and I asked him where the other things were; he said "They are a long way off, but you can take my word they are all sound and complete, as I have told you"—we were satisfied with that, and walked back to his house, where I saw my father pay him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—that was Saturday, June 30, and on the next Monday or Tuesday I received this letter and took it to my father—on the Wednesday I saw the prisoner at Stratford, and said "My father is not willing to give up the things he bought on Saturday"—he said "I don't know what I shall do; I will get him another saw-bench"—I said "He won't look to you, he will look to the owner for the things he bought on Saturday"—I believed he was a mere agent—I then came out and my father went in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I am a builder, of Stratford—I went to Merton with my son on Saturday, 30th June, and he introduced me to the prisoner—we went with him to Tooting and saw an engine in a shed—Mr. Margoram went with us—the engine was not working; I did not see any gear, benches, or saws, and the prisoner said that the gentleman to whom they belonged had taken them away—we asked to see them; he said that they were a long distance off, but we might take his word they were what he represented them to be, and that the engine cost the owner 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and with the machinery 315<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as we walked back he said that the gentleman had bought the estate which the shed was on for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to cut up the wood for building purposes, and that he got in his debt and lost 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by it, which was the reason they were for sale, and the lowest the gentleman would take was 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "Will the gentleman take 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>?".—he said "If I take 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I shall not get the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he promised me for selling them"—I said "Then I will give you 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I went to his house and gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, and he gave me this receipt.

I knew that he had sold the saws and saw bench—I brought Mr. Andrews to be a witness, and he tendered the cheque to the prisoner first, and the prisoner said to him "Who are you?

                  </hi>. I am a journalist, and live at an hotel in Westminster Road—on 27th August, about 25 minutes to 12 at night, I was in the Lower Marsh, Lambeth, walking to my home—I cannot walk fast, I am a cripple for life—I had on a felt hat and was carrying a stick—as I was walking along Cotton came up to me in the opposite direction—I felt that there was mischief in the man's face, and I got as near to the kerbstone as I could—he did not pass me, but stopped—I went off the pavement into the middle of the road, and endeavoured to walk as fast as I could—he quickened his pace and kept close behind me—I turned round to him and said, "I know your game, wait till I find a police-officer"—he then gave the call for Brannan; he called "Johnnie Brannan," and I was attacked and pinned from behind; my hat and stick were taken, and I was bruised in the most fearful manner on both sides, and my hearing is very indistinct at present; I was shaken all to pieces—there were numerous hands trying to get into every pocket—they knocked me down; I was picked up again—Cotton and John Brannan are the men that struck me—I had a parcel with me containing some shirts, and in the struggle that was taken from me—I was struck in the jaw; the left eye was entirely closed, and the left side of my face was twice its original size the next day—some civilians came up, and then the police—the prisoners made their escape—I would not swear to James Brannan, but I will swear to the other two—about 3 o'clock in the morning I was called to the station, and I there identified Cotton and John Brannan—I have not the slightest doubt of their being the men—I have since seen and identified my hat and stick; these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); my name is inside the hat—I have not seen the parcel since—I had done nothing to provoke this attack.</p>

I am a master baker, of 33, Lower Marsh, Lambeth—about 11.40 on the night of 27th August I was standing at the door of my shop with my wife and Alfred Jarrett—I saw Mr. Rodd coming along the pavement—he crossed into the middle of the road and was followed by Cotton—Cotton called out "John Brannan, there he goes in the middle of the road; on him, him with the parcels under his arm"—John Brannan was standing on the cellar flap, and he followed Cotton and the prosecutor up—I saw Cotton go up and strike him in the face once or twice, and he fell down—John Brannan made a pretence to go and pick him up, but he held his hands and held him round while Cotton punched him and rifled his pockets—I said to my friend "You had better be off"—the prisoner could hear what I said; I was close to them—Joseph Brannan was standing among the crowd—I saw the parcel going away down the turning—I don't think it was either of the prisoners that had the parcel—I could not swear to the man that had it—I went up and said "It is no use your running away; I know you all, and I will be sure to have you," and he gave me a push and away they all went—I should think there were seven or eight of them—Cotton carried the stick away; he held it in his hand while he punched the man—my friend fetched a constable while I stopped there—the man would have been murdered if I had not been there; I stopped to protect him—I did not know Cotton before; I might have seen him two or three times—I knew both the Brannans; they are very bad characters.</p>

I was standing against my shop door about 20 yards off, when my attention was first attracted—the prosecutor and Cotton walked about 15 yards towards me before John Brannan was called—I did not move till I heard the name of Brannan called out, and saw them both running after the prosecutor—a number of people rushed up about three or four minutes after the prosecutor was knocked down and ill-used—I dare say there were a dozen and a half, and more than that—you soon get a mob there—there was not a great deal of confusion and struggling, it was very nearly all over when the mob came round—they found the man had nothing in his pockets—the attack was made two or three minutes after he passed our door, and the mob came round as soon as he was knocked down.</p>

               <p>—we have been in business about three years—we had not had a balance actually struck since about March, 1881—the advertisement was put in somewhere about last December—we gave the prisoner a week's notice because he did not do his work properly—he begged, on account of his parents, to stay another week, and we gave him another week's notice—I could not have said that it was no use attempting to make a balance, as no one could do it, not even my brother—the balance is not now finished, another few days will finish it—I did not tell the prisoner that my brother had been trying to balance them and Had failed; he had been writing them up and posting them, which I did myself—I have not got our cash-book here—I can swear that there was not a large discrepancy between the pass-book and the cash-book last year—I said on the last trial that the exact amount of the prisoner's deficiency was 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—all our trading accounts balance, it is simply the stock account that is incorrect, and that will be balanced in a few days; there are four or five accounts that will not balance now—it has not been necessary to insert fictitious entries in order to make something like a balance—my brother made an advance of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a firm in the north, of which no account was taken by us; it was not paid twice over—I have not been out in my accounts through betting—I once had occasion to speak to the bankers about a mistake, they made the account overdrawn when it was not so—I spoke to them about keeping the prisoner there so long; their reply was in writing—this is the letter; they complained pf our sending him just at clearing time, and they also said that during the time of these defalcations the prisoner had never left the book to be made up—I never took the book myself to the bank more than once, if I did then—after the complaint by the bank we arranged that he should get the pass-book from the bank every Wednesday—that was acted upon nearly, on some occasions it might not be—I should say that no payments in were made by my younger brother in the prisoners time; if it was so, it was only on some special occasion when the prisoner could not go—I took the pass-book home once; I did not keep it for a week; that was when I dis<lb/>covered the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner has sometimes been out collecting; he has not brought back as much as 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should say—the office cash-book was copied from the file of paying-in slips and the cheque-book—I did not leave money about on the desk—when there was more cash than was wanted I have sometimes sent the warehouseman with it to a public-house, and got a cheque for it, or kept it till next day; that would only be very seldom, when it was very late—I once put a cheque into a wrong envelope, and we once paid in a post-dated cheque that we were asked to hold over, because we were afraid we should not get the money if we did not; our bankers cleared it, and we got the money—I have not complained to the prisoner that my memory was getting bad about business matters—I have no recollection of his calling my attention to a mistake in the paying-in slip which the banker altered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I always made out the counterfoils myself except on one occasion, when the prisoner went to get a new book; that was the only one he made—he never complained that I gave him less money than I put down on the slip, I always made him count it in the office before he took it away—there has never been any complaint of my younger brother paying in short.</p>

I am a tin wire manufacturer, in partnership with my father, at Long Walk, Bermondsey—on 30th July the prisoner came into our service as traveller by a written agreement—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the copy which he signed—he commenced his duties on 2nd August, and on 4th August he gave me this order from J. J. Norman for 50 gross of tin boxes—he had brought me a box on August 2nd, and said "I want you to quote me 50 gross of these boxes to-morrow morning"—I wrote to him, and on the 4th he came with the order and said "I received your letter too late yesterday afternoon to see Mr. Norman. I saw him this morning and secured the order"—he asked me to give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the commission.—I said "It is rather unusual to pay on account; it is rather a large amount"—he said "I am very much pressed for money, and as Monday is a holiday I should be very much obliged by 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—my father consented, and I then gave him this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) believing the order to be genuine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a packing-case maker, of 53, Farncomb Street, Bermondsey—on Sunday morning, 29th July, I was with my brother in Jamaica Road coming from one of my uncles' benefit—it was rather dark, and I slipped off the kerb and laid on my back in the</p>

I live at 48, City Road, and am a lithographic printer in the service of McCorquodale, printers, Thomas's Street, Borough—they have been employed for some time past to print race-course tickets—I know John Taylor—I have seen him and his brother together on several occasions—I met him one day some time ago, and he said "This is my brother"—John Taylor had been in the employment of the firm, and knew all about the printing of these racecourse tickets—I used to see him at home; I was sent there when he stopped away from work—after he was discharged I used to meet him at Goswell Road—I remember the order coming just before the August Bank Holiday, to print the tickets for the Bank Holiday meeting—I received the cardboard for them to be printed on—each card would contain 12 tickets—I printed 179 of the 180 cards, and kept one in the office for a copy; that left 178—172 of those I placed on the bench before Mr.</p>

               <p>Lindsey—that left six cards of 12 tickets each, 72 tickets—about 7.30 on the Monday week before Bank Holiday, I met John Taylor at the bottom of Fore Street—he asked me if the Croydon tickets were in; I said "Yes"—he said "I dare say you will have to print them;" I said "Yes"—he said "Will you bring me out some?" I said "Yes"—he said "I will meet you on Wednesday evening at the same place"—I gave him the six cards in the street, and he asked me if I would go and have a glass of ale with him; I did so—he had left the employment; I think he was discharged at Whitsuntide—I know he had printed the race cards when he was in the employment—then they would not come into my hands at all—he had spoken to me at Whitsuntide about the race cards; he was at work then at the same time as I was on the premises—the cards I gave him on the Wednesday were of this descrip<lb/>tion (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) when I gave them to him, but they had no number whatever on them—they were printed on both sides, and the number and "6 Aug., 1883" is on both sides—it is a card printed for this parti<lb/>cular meeting, from a stone prepared for the particular card.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector, Criminal Investigation Department</hi>). In the course of my duty I have attended a good many racecourses including places like Croydon, where there are tickets for the enclosure—prior to 6th August complaints were made with regard to the tickets, and in consequence, on 6th August Bank Holiday, I went with Denny to the race meeting at Croydon and kept observation on people leaving for Croydon at the Cannon Street Railway Station—I first saw Cooper and Thomas Taylor together—I did not know them by sight—I saw them with a number of others whom I did not know and watched them—I followed them to Woodside Railway Station adjoining the course alone—Denny had left me at Cannon Street—they went on the course with two or three others, and I saw them go into the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. enclosure and come out and go in again as the second race was run—the course was being cleared and I saw Cooper pass something to some one else on the course, and I gave the signal for their arrest—I did not know the man to whom the thing was passed or what the thing was—that was outside the en<lb/>closure, on the course—I saw him go in and out of the enclosure twice—I took Cooper with the assistance of Denny, who had joined me on the course, to some buildings adjoining the racecourse—I had given the order for both of them to be arrested—I searched Cooper first and found on him 10 of these Tom Hoodless's cards, these instruments, for printing, I believe, and 26 brass numerals, this piece of wood, two enclosure tickets and two pieces of paper, one containing black and the other red printing ink—the numerals and ink were in his inside coat pocket, and the bottle con<lb/>taining some fluid and the tickets were in the outside pocket—the numbers had been erased from nine of the 10 cards so that other numbers could be printed on them—when bookmakers on a racecourse give out a card to indicate the receipt of money for a bet, the man does not go back with the ticket if he does not win, he will throw it away—the brass numeral letters are not of the ordinary make, they have a number at each end; some of them are smaller at one end than the other—these 329 would correspond with Hoodless's ticket—the larger numbers corre-pond best with the enclosure tickets—I found marks on the oblong piece of wood, of numbers having been stamped on it, such as would be made by stamping a numeral on an intervening card—I have tried an experiment with the fluid in the bottle—it will rub off printing ink and enable it to be removed—I said to Cooper "How do you account for</p>

Wontner, the solicitors to the Race Committee—the night he was taken I made inquiries about Cooper—I said at the police-court "I have not seen Cooper at other race meetings; I find he is a tool-cutter, living at 25, St. James's Walk, Clerkenwell"—he works at the shop of a telescope-maker—I found several tools in his shop—when I asked him to account for the possession of this type he said "That is my business."</p>
