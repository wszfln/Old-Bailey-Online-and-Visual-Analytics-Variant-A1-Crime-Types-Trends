I engrossed this probate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from this will, before 9th Dec. 1841, before the will was deposited in the public office—that is the practice—after I had examined the probate with the original will, I took it for registry to Doctors' Commons; I have no memorandum of the day, but probably it was deposited two or three days before the grant of probate, which bears date 9th Dec, 1841—I have now looked through the sheets of the will separately, and as far as I know it is in the same state as it was when it came to our hands—I took more notice of this will than I do of wills generally, because there were several alterations and interlineations in it when it was first brought, and they are here now, and</p>

               <p>there was an affidavit annexed to the will accounting for those alterations, which is here now—the testator died 2nd Nov., 1841—the will was in one possession about a fortnight before it was proved—I believe it was deposited with us by Messrs. Watkins and Hooper—every sheet is not signed and attested, but the initials of the witnesses are to the principal part of the inter-lineations, not to all; and there is a memorandum at the end, "I declare this to be my last will and testament, contained in this and the nine preceding sheets"—there are nine preceding sheets—shortly after the wills are deposited in the public office, it is the duty of one of the clerks to attach the whole by a silken string, and also to attach a seal—when I engrossed the probate I took a memorandum of all the alterations and interlineations, but I did not pre<lb/>serve it—we prepared an affidavit from that—I examined the affidavit—it was made by Mr. Mundell, a notary—I did not accompany him to swear it—it was sworn on 24th Nov.—it had been prepared a day or two previous—the will would probably be in my custody from the time the affidavit was prepared—I have access to the chest where the original wills are placed—after finishing the engrossment, I deposited the original will in the Prerogative-office, most likely about 1st Dec, two or three days before the probate would bear date—there was about a week or ten days between the preparation of the affidavit and the deposit of the will at Doctors' Commons—during that time it was in a chest in our office; I myself deposited it there—I have no doubt whatever that it is in the same state as it was when I engrossed the probate from it—there is apparently nothing that is different from the stats in which I deposited it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to the record-keepers at Doctors' Commons. It is my duty when an original will is required to be produced in a Court of Justice, to take it from the proper record-room, and deliver it to the wit<lb/>ness who is to produce it—this will comes from the strong-room of the Pre<lb/>rogative Court of Canterbury—I took it myself from that room this morning, and delivered it to Mr. Rawood—when wills are delivered in from the senior Stamp-office clerk, to the clerk of the current or unregistered wills, he puts on them a seal, all the sheets being attached by a silken cord—that would be done before the will was registered—I cannot say that no portion of it could be abstracted after that, because it has been done when anything informal has transpired; the clerk has been requested to take it apart, and put on a fresh seal—it could not be done without the knowledge of the parties at the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and have resided at Lam<lb/>beth all ray life—I am solicitor for the Rector and churchwardens and some of the other officers there. On 13th April last, whilst in my own office, I was taken into custody on a warrant, charged with forging the will of my father-in-law, Mr. M'Gowran—Girdlestone was with the policeman who had tie warrant—I was detained at the station-house that night, and was taken before a Judge next morning, who immediately admitted me to bail—Swan was there in the outer chamber, and Girdlestone went before the Judge—he opposed my being bailed, and said that the Judge had no power to do it—I attended before Mr. Justice Coldridge, when my two brothers-in-law, Messrs. Francis and James M'Gowran, applied to be admitted to bail—they were in custody on the same charge—it was opposed—Saunders, Girdlestone, and Swan were there on that occasion together—they did not go before the Judge—they were talking together in the outer room—I saw them for a very short time, as I was obliged to go away—I and the two Mr. M'Gowrans surrendered here on 17th May last to take our trial—Mr. Huddleston ap<lb/>peared on the part of the prosecution—Girdlestone, Swan, and Saunders were called on their recognizances by one of the officers of the Court—neither of them appeared—the Court, on the proposition of our counsel, postponed the case for a time—it stood over three quarters of an hour—they did not then appear, and the Judge directed the Jury to acquit us—we were all three obliged to stand in the dock—on the application of Mr. Clarkson, the Court ordered the brief for the prosecution to be impounded, and Mr. Huddleston handed it to the officer of the Court—I married a daughter of Mr. M'Gow<lb/>ran's, after her father's death—I was paying my addresses to her during her father's life-time—he was a very old friend of mine and of my father's also—his family consisted of two sons and two daughters—his two sons are persons of property, the elder one the more so—one daughter, named Smith, is a widow, who had five children, one of whom lived with the deceased—the other daughter, Sophia, is my wife—the deceased also had a niece, who married Girdlestone—she was living at the time of the testator's death, but</p>

Watkins and Hooper of Sackville-street, acted as solicitors to the executors—in, 1843, the executors took proceedings against Girdlestone, to make him pay the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ground-rent—they had litigation with him lasting for some time—in the course of those disputes I have seen Swan with Girdlestone occasionally; he was at the trial, and apparently acting with him—I had nothing to do with the preparation of this will (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I have not interfered with it in any way—I did not take out any sheets and put others in, nor alter it in any shape or way.</p>

Mr. M'Gowran's daughter he wished me to go as his friend—I think I saw Mr. M'Gowran at the. latter end of Sept. 1841, I received instructions from him which I took down in writing at the time, at his bed<lb/>side—these are the original notes which I took at that time (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I drew up the. will on those instructions—this is the will (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I read it over to Mr. M'Gowran after it was prepared—it was. engrossed by Mr. Charles Mullens—the draft was read over to the testator—I attended thrice—there were alterations made in it by his directions—Mr. Clay, the family surgeon, was present when the will was executed—he came in at that moment—it had then been read over, and the alterations made-they were made at the testator's-desire in the engrossment—I afterwards made the affidavit, which is now attached to the will with reference to those altera<lb/>tions—there seemed to be some few alterations with reference to Mrs. Girdle<lb/>stone's property; for instance, "Southwark" is substituted for" Westminster," "such" instead of "each"—there is no alteration in the effect of the will, as far as Mrs. Girdlestone is concerned—the whole of the alterations are in my writing, and have my initials to each in the margin—Mr. Clay's initials are there also—all the alterations, and tie initials, were on it at the time the testator executed it—the testator signed the final sheet—my initials are to each sheet, so that no sheet can have been substituted—there is writing of mine on every sheet—not the least alteration has been made since it was executed—I am certain it is in exactly the same state now as it was when it was executed by the testator—I am one of the attesting witnesses.</p>

"No"—he told me that an affidavit had been made in my name respecting this will, but I find none has been made—I made the affidavit before a Justice at Wandsworth—he did not say what he wanted it for—he called on me again a day or two after, and wished me to go before the Grand Jury to. prove that I had made the affidavit, but I said I would not; I thought.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, in partnership with Mr. Watkins, in Sackville-street. I acted as solicitor to the executors of the late Mr. M'Gowran, and took this will to the proctor, for the purpose of being proved in the ordinary way—I had before that prepared a will for the testator, of which I have the draft here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—after that he executed another will—I have not seen the will in question since it was deposited—I am aware of the nature of the distribution of the property under that will—I believe there is some difference between the two wills as to Mrs. Girdlestone's inter<lb/>est, but I cannot tell what—(<hi rend="italic">the witness was here directed to examine the two wills</hi>)—the result appears to be this, that No. 2, Webber-row, and a black<lb/>smith's shop behind, were by the first will given to Girdlestone, and Nos. 1</p>

               <p>and 3 to Charles and Caroline and Rosa Collins, nephew and nieces of the testator; and under the second will, Girdlestone takes no interest, but No. 2, and the shop, is given on trust to Mrs. Girdlestone, subject to the pay<lb/>Bent of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, the entire ground-rent, and a power is given to the trustees to demise with the consent of Mrs. Girdlestone (<hi rend="italic">reading the pas<lb/>sages.</hi>)</p>

"—he said, "If you will give me the two houses next to mine, and make me an allowance for the back rent, I will not prosecute "—with that, I said I would put an execution in for the rent, and went out—he called me back, and said, "Well, as the houses belong to you, you will not like to give them up; there is plenty of money in your family, if your family will give me 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and you will refund the back rents you have received, I will not take pro<lb/>ceedings against you; if you don't, you must understand me that—I will indict both you and your brother for forging the will you have forged"—I then walked away—I was taken into custody at Brentford, at my own house—I did not see Swan at the time I was taken—he came to my house after<lb/>wards, and served me with a notice that I was to appear, to take my trial; and when I went to be bailed Saunders was there, with Girdlestone, to oppose me.</p>

H." on it, a brooch, an eye-glass, several teaspoons, some black clothes, a silk handkerchief, and shawl, one sovereign, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver—I gave information to the police.</p>

On 11th June I heard of the robbery, and went to Bennett's cottage, which adjoins the canal—I traced some footmarks from the canal side, five or six yards from the back door, to a field and to a hole in the edge—I went into the garden—I noticed top pane of glass broken and the bolt pulled down, and the bottom pane broken and the bolt slipped up—on going into the house I saw the things all turned upside down and scattered about—my brother constable apprehended the prisoner on the 14th—I took him to the place, and put his foot down close alongside the old footmark, and they corresponded—I noticed the impression of pretty well every nail in the shoe—it was hardly so plain when we came back again, because there had been a little rain, but the length of the foot exactly corresponded.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Great Charlotte-street, Black friars-road—I am in the habit of reporting for the public press, and have been so employed for five or six years. In the course of my employment, I attended a meeting on Clerken well-green, on Monday, 29th May—I got there about half-past six o'clock in the evening—there was a van, on which a platform was placed for the speakers—I saw the defendant, Fussell, in the van—there were eighteen or twenty persons in it, and between 2000 and 3000 persons were assembled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What class of persons 'did they appear to be chiefly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were Mine working men; the others I hardly know how to describe, the lower orders I suppose; they were very dirty and very ragged—I noticed a person named Williams there—he spoke first to the meeting—he was on the van—I took a note of what he said, such as I should take if I gave a newspaper report—I did not take it all, only a portion—this is the note I then made (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is not in short-hand, but in abbreviated long-hand—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>) "My friends, tie bloody aristocracy <hi rend="italic">have now done its</hi> work at last," or "at least," I am not positive which; "they have sent John Mitchell from his country. I trust while you remain here you will be peaceable, and obey my injunctions as to the course you shall adopt—all the arrangements have been made; and when you have been addressed by two or three speakers, I shall give you a signal, when you must fall into marching order, four abreast, and follow me where I shall lead you; you will know where when you are there. I shall take you then to a place where you will meet ten times as many as are here, and then you will be told what to do. I have made up my mind on a course of action. I fear banishment no more than that brave patriot and noble man, John Mitchell, who has been <hi rend="italic">nailed</hi> by these base, bloody, and brutal Whigs, by partizan judges, packed juries, and a perjured sheriff"—that was all I took of Williams's speech—it was spoken loud, so as to be heard by the people assembled—a man named M'Carthy then addressed the meeting—J have a note of portions of his speech—he commenced something about the base, brutal, and bloody Whigs—I did not take that; but he continued, "If John Mitchell is allowed to leave his country, other brave <hi rend="italic">men</hi> will fall victims to that bloody <hi rend="italic">Gagging</hi> Bill. It is now your time, if you value liberty, to strike the blow. Ireland may, for aught I know, at the present time be in arms; but if she is not, she is only remaining quiet in order to recruit her strength the more effectually to strike the blow, and release herself from tyranny and oppression"—that is the whole of his speech—these two speeches were received by the mob with clapping of hands, and apparently with great satis<lb/>faction—Fussell</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030028"/>
               <p>then proceeded to address the meeting—I did not take all he said, only such parts as struck me—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>) "The Government have succeeded in convicting honest John Mitchell. How have they accom<lb/>plished it? Why, by packed juries and partizan judges. I tell Lord John Russell that I have no sympathy with his damnable government. John Mitchell had asked if the Queen had not forgotten her duty to her country—I now ask the same question, and adopt his views. If the Queen forgets to recognize the people, then the people must forget to recognize the Queen. If John Mitchell is sent out of his country, every Irishman must rise and revenge the insult, or they will no longer be worthy the name"—the next part of his speech consisted of some abuse of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and accused the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of being in the pay of the Government, and keeping back the Irish news—I did not take a note of that, not thinking 1 should be required here, and a newspaper would not require that—he went on: "The Government is not worthy the support of any honest man; it is too contemptible to be recog<lb/>nized, and you must use your best endeavours to overthrow it. And now I wish to impress upon you that there is one safe way of getting rid of bad rulers, who forget their duty to their country: I openly avow that I mean private assassination. What made the Emperor of Austria fly from his country? Why, the fear of assassination; and it is by these means that other bad rulers will soon fly. I have five sons," (I am not positive whether it is five or four, I suppose I was knocked on the elbow at the time;) "and I now declare that I would disown any one who would refuse to assassinate any person who may be instrumental in banishing me from my country for such an offence as John Mitchell was convicted of"—that is all I took of Fussell's speech—Williams then said, 'How, my lads, fall into marching order, four abreast"—the people obeyed that order, and Williams placed himself at their head—as far as I recollect, the three speakers toot the lead—after forming in that way, they marched down Aylesbury-street, into St. John's-street—I left them there, went down Wilderness-row, and met them again in Goswell-street, at the corner of Old-street-road—they west down Old-street into the City-road, to Finsbury-square—they walked round Finsbury-square, I suppose half or three-quarters of an hour, apparently waiting for some other parties; in fact, it was stated that there was some meeting at Stepney, and they expected the parties from Stepney down there—I did not see them joined by any other body of men there—after they left Finsbury-square, they proceeded up Chiswell-street, Beech-street, Barbican, Long-lane to Smithfield—they then went down Snow-hill, along Holborn to the corner of New Oxford-street, till they came to the Land and Labour Bank, where there was a stoppage, and three cheers were given—they went along Broad-street, and turned off one of the streets near Monmouth-street, in the neighbourhood of Seven Dials, diagonally, towards Leicester-square, through Cranbourn-street, into Leicester-square, and up Princes-street—from there they turned off, I think, by Macclesfield-street, they took the street from the bottom of Dean-street, and went into Soho-square, where I left them—they stopped at the Chartist Assembly-rooms I think it is called, in Dean-street, and I believe they were addressed from the window—I cannot speak posi<lb/>tively—I saw men at the window—I cannot say whether they were address<lb/>ing them, but it appeared so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of about how many persons did this procession consist? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When it started, I should say about 3, 000, but it was almost impossible to say the number at the last, you could not see them—it was increased by large numbers at every street—the party said, "Fall in," and the people did fall in, as they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030029"/>
               <p>went along; in fact, there might be 50, 000 or 60, 000—I could not speak positively—Dean-street was completely filled from one end to the other, and they turned into Oxford-street—it was about a quarter to ten, or half-past nine, when I left them in Dean-street—they left Clerkenwell-green about quarter to eight,</p>

Now, my friends, fall into marching order, four abreast"—this is the way in which I do whatever I do for the news<lb/>papers, and thirty or forty first-rate reporters to the daily journals write the same system—that is the ordinary way of a reporter, not of every reporter—it is not the way in which a short-hand writer reports—there is a difference between a reporter and a short-hand writer—I have been employed for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and all the papers—I reported this meeting for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—I was not employed to do it—I attend any meeting I like, and send my copy to the newspaper, and if they use it, they pay me for it—that is the case with the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, or any other paper—I attended this meeting on speculation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you ever specifically employed by any paper, to take what passed at a meeting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, frequently—I have been employed by them all—I have attended many meetings for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—I go and ask the question, whether I shall go to a particular meeting, and they say, "Yes," that is what I call employing me, and they use my copy in preference to anybody else's—no other person would stand a chance, if I got engaged first—I call that an engagement, going to the office, and asking the editor to attend a particular meet<lb/>ing—I have asked the editor; I have seen the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—I am no ac<lb/>qaaintance of his—I have seen him—I never said that the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> tad engaged me personally—I never spoke to him personally about it—the system of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> is, if you have any communication to make to the editor, you must send it, and you get your answer in the same way—I have cer<lb/>kinly communicated personally with the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know the distinction between a person charged with a lesser offence, who is called a defendant, and a person charged as a prisoner with a crime? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know what you are aiming at—I was charged with felony—there is no reason for beating about the bush, if you will allow me to explain it—six or seven years ago, as I was going home one night with my brother and another person, I knocked a lighted cigar against the door of the <hi rend="italic">Morn-ing Chroniclc</hi>-ofnce, the porter came out and asked, "Why are you knocking the ashes of your cigar into our letter-box?" I said, "I have done nothing of the kind," he said, "You have, and it has been done two or three nights—it is a good job that no policeman is here, or I would give you in charge—the parties with me fetched a policeman from the opposite sice, and said, "Here is a policeman, if you have any charge to make"—the porter immediately said to the policeman, "I give this person in charge for putting the end of his cigar into our letter-box"—the policeman said, "I know nothing of you; I must take the charge from your employer'-we went round to the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle-office</hi> for the purpose of taking the charge, and my brother, who was with me, Wished to go into the office—the porter said he could not come in—the policeman said, "Yes, he must; he saw the charge, and he must be present;" but the porter insisted he should not, and he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist and knocked my brother down, and the policeman took him in charge for the assault, having witnessed it—Dr. Black, who was then the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>, came down, and I was given in charge to the policeman on a charge of arson, taken to Bow-street, and locked up—the porter was given in charge for the assault, and he was bailed—the case came before Mr. Hall, at Bow-street next day, and I was dismissed; the Magistrate saying there was no ground at <hi rend="italic">all</hi> forgiving me in charge, and the porter was fined 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the assault on my brother—that was the charge of felony—I commenced an action against the proprietor; but the policeman who took the charge had left the force in the meantime, and I could not com<lb/>plete the evidence, and abandoned it; and not proceeding with the action I was <hi rend="italic">let into</hi> the costs, and had to pay 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But there was a case with the Sun Fire-office, where there was really some burning, was there not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a house which I held in conjunction with my brother was burnt down—my brother was with me on the occasion at the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>-office, and saw the whole—I do not know that any<lb/>thing particularly happened to prevent my brother being a witness—the solicitor who had the business advised us that we could not safely go to trial without the policeman who took the charge—I do not think my brother was examined as a witness, but I forget now; it is seven or eight years ago—I claimed 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Sun Fire-office—I got none of it—I was insured for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the defendant recovered a verdict upon some points—there were six pleas on the record—they got a verdict upon three, and we upon the other three; but I know that our three precluded us from getting any money—I do not know whether one of the pleas was that I had set fire to my own house; I never looked at the pleas, but it is not very likely, or they would</p>

               <p>not have offered to settle it before we went to trial—they offered to settle it, and to arbitrate—I was at the trial—I did not hear that I was charged with setting fire to my house—there were a great many things said by counsel, but I "never pay any attention to those things—I did not, after I had become an editor, find it necessary or desirable to leave London for some time—I have been out of London once or twice; I have been all over England, I cannot tell when, reporting—I never absconded, in consequence of having committed a fraud on the Messrs. Spicer, the paper-makers—I was never chared with having defrauded them; I am not aware that I am indebted to them—I have never been out of London as much as two months; never more than a week altogether—if any debt was contracted with the Messrs. Spicer it must have been while I was in business—I had nothing to do either with contracting the debts or the settlement of them; I merely had the manage-xent of the printing department—I was the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Theatrical Chronicle</hi>, I was not the proprietor—I never ordered the paper from Messrs. Spicer; I never had anything to do with that portion of the business—I never bought 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, and sold it in a day or two for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; nor was I aware of it—I do not believe any such transaction took place—my brother was the proprietor—he is a reporter like myself—he reports for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> also—I have been a bankrupt, and I obtained my certificate immediately; there was no opposition at any of the hearings—I do not know how much I paid in the pound—they consisted of railway claims; when collected I suppose they will pay—the assets I have handed over are 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than the debts—by assets I do not mean money, but railway claims—I have never seen hand-tills posted up in the neighbourhood of the Kent Theatre, offering a reward for me; it is not very likely, or I should have gone for the reward, and claimed it—I took the Kent Theatre; that—was years before the <hi rend="italic">Railway Telegraph</hi>—Iam paid for the reports I take at per line—I report for all the pipers, not for any particular one—I send copy on the chance of their in<lb/>serting it, and if they insert it they pay me per line—I was never in the employ of the Black wall Railway Company, nor was my brother—I was never charged with robbing them or anybody—I have attended nearly all the Chartist meetings from the commencement on Kennington Common (Wil<lb/>liams, by-the-by, was there,) up to the present time—I assisted in reporting the proceedings at Kennington Common—Mr. Potter and myself reported them for the <hi rend="italic">Express</hi>—we had been previously engaged to do so by Mr. Duke, one of the editors or proprietors of the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>—we did not send copy to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on that occasion—we do not send to the papers when they send their own reporters—they do not generally send their own reporters to cut-door work—I have sent an account of other meetings to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> over and over again—I reported the election of Dr. Hampden, at Hereford, for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—it was inserted, and I was paid seven or eight guineas for it—I was not paid by the line for that—I went upon speculation, and supplied all the papers with it, which I do not always do—we go by what we consider will pay us—Potter was with me at this meeting, on 29th May—he reported the meeting for the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>—he reports for all the papers the same as myself—mine is a sort of general discursive engagement; it is a toss up whether we get our reports in or not, the same as it is with barristers, whether a solicitor gives them a brief or not—if we do not do our work well, we do not get work again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And if you do not send in a report with something in it, you are not 'My to have it inserted or to be paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I see your drift—if there is nothing in it the editor does not put it in; but he docs not find fault with us</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4. Great Charlotte-street, Blackfriar's-road, and am a reporter. I report for all the daily papers—I report in short<lb/>hand—I attended the meeting at Clerkenwell on 29th May—I got there about seven o'clock—the meeting did not commence till ten minutes afterhere was a van in the centre, which served the purpose of a platform—I was on it—there were about 3, 000 people assembled round the van when the proceedings commenced—there might have been about thirty on the van, it was full—Williams, M'Carthy, and Fussell were there—I took a note in short-hand of pan of the proceedings—I did not take the whole—I took as much as served my purpose—Williams addressed the meeting first—these are my original notes, which I took in the van—I did not take all that Williams said—I took the salient points for newspaper reporting—he said, "Friends, the b—y aristocracy has done its work at last; although we have got a Government spy among us, we do not care; that man (I believe allud<lb/>ing to a policeman in the crowd, my impression is that he pointed to some<lb/>body in the crowd, but I do not exactly recollect,) has transported his own sons; but keep the peace, my friends; but if any man disturbs you, I hope you have sufficient energy to defend yourselves; now, keep the peace and 1 will take you to a place where you will meet five times the number of men that are collected here; I will take you to a certain place, and we will hold a meeting there; when I give you the signal, I want you to fall into march<lb/>ing order, four abreast, and to follow me where I will lead you; I will the: take you to a place where you will meet ten times as many persons as are here, and then you will be advised what to do; until then I ask you to be obedient to orders"—that is all I have on my notes, but I recollect that he advised them to be orderly and steady, and not to be riotous, but to conduct themselves peaceably, to follow him, and place implicit reliance on his direc<lb/>tions—I do not recollect that he said anything about Mitchell—he did not say much more than I have got down—the speeches were all very short; and Williams requested them to be brief—M'Carthy spoke next; I beg your pardon, I have taken a large M. which I put down for Mitchell, as the beginning of M'Carthy's speech—Williams went on to say—" I do not fear punishment more than Mitchell; he does not care for his punishment; he feels proud of his punishment, although he is manacled, and although the Whig Govern<lb/>ment have determined to murder that honest patriot; the <hi rend="italic">Gagging Bill</hi> was brought in for no other purpose than to murder him; honest John Mitchell has been murdered by these base, bloody, and brutal Whigs; through the instrumentality of packed juries and partizan Judges"—then came the direc<lb/>tion of Williams, which I before alluded to, and subsequently M'Carthy's speech—he agreed with Williams in his condemnation of the Whigs:-"Would the people of Ireland allow John Mitchell to be sent away from his native shores; if they allowed John Mitchell to be taken away from his native land, many other brave men would fall victims to the diabolical <hi rend="italic">Gagging</hi>

               <p>Bill; it is now the time for all who value liberty, to strike the blow, and Ireland will rise in arms; if that country has been quiet, it is only that it might recruit its strength to make a bold effort to release herself at the proper time"—that is all I have of M'Carthy's speech—Fussell followed; he said, "The Government has succeeded in obtaining the conviction of honest John Mitchell, by means of subservient Judges and packed juries; John Mitchell had asked whether the Queen had not forgotten her duty to her country; and I advocate the same sentiments that John Mitchell has uttered; Govern<lb/>ment, it has been said, has acted upon expediency; but that is a ridiculous sad false plea for so great a crime; I have been told that I must not use such language, because I shall bring the Government into contempt; but that is ridiculous, for the Government is so contemptible at present, that it would be impossible to bring it into greater contempt;—I should like to tell the meeting that there is one safe way of getting rid of rulers—those rulers who forget their duty to their country; and that is by private assassi<lb/>nation; if my sons were not capable of assassinating any person who sent me out of the country, I should be ashamed of them; these are the means of chastising the most evil nations on the earth; the fear of private assassina<lb/>tion made the Emperor of Austria run; and it is the fear of that might make rulers, in this country run also; if John Mitchell was sent to Spike Island, then it is quite evident that you may use <hi rend="italic">spikes</hi> for the Government; I have five sons, and I would disown them if they were not ready to assassinate men who sent me out of the country for such a crime as that of which John Mitchell was said to be guilty"—that is all I have—I have another note here, of Williams's—he then said: "Now my friends, fall into marching order"—they obeyed his directions, and fell in four a breast, and marched through the streets—Williams was in the front rank, and M'Carthy and Fussell', I think, but I am not quite clear about those two—I went down Red Lion-street, I think it is, and met them again at the corner of Wilderness<lb/>row, and then at Finsbury-square—they then marched round the square two or three times—I should think there were 7, 000 or 8, 000 people then—I then followed them up Holborn, down what used to be Monmouth-street, and down a street into Leicester-square, up Princes-street, and into Dean-street, where the Chartist Hall is situate—they there shouted, as they had done on the road previously, and were received by a party, who appeared to address them from the window of the Hall but on account of the noise, I could not distinctly ascertain whether he was addressing them, or whether it was a mere dumb-show—I then left them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where do you say you live? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 4, Great Char<lb/>lotte-street, Blackfriars-road—that is the same house as the last witness lives in—we do not live together, but we have both been there six or seven months—my engagement is pretty much the same as his—I have not heard him examined—I send my report to any of the papers—I was not engaged by any paper to attend this meeting; I went voluntarily—I did not observe any other reporters at the meeting—I am not aware that there were any but myself and Fowler; but among so large a crowd there might have been without my seeing them—I did not observe any other person taking notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What induced you to go there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The same reason that induced me to go to other meetings, to report them for the papers, on the chance of getting an account of it inserted, and to be paid for it by the line if inserted; that is the nature of my engagement with the papers I send copy to—I had agreed with Fouler in the morning, when we saw the announcement, to be there for this purpose—Fowler might have done it by himself, and so might I, and so</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030034"/>
               <p>might you conduct this case yourself; but you have some one to assist you<lb/>I send my copy to all the papers—the speeches lasted thirty or forty minutes—I write short-hand—this report is in short-hand—I could have reported for forty minutes without assistance—I do not usually require assistance when reporting for forty minutes—I could have done it alone, hut we heard of the announcement at the same time, and as it was likely to be a matter of profit one could not justly take the whole of it, so we agreed to divide it, and take the meeting between us; we were, in fact, partners, and shared the proceed:—we go shares in many things; it is convenient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it true that if you send a false report to a newspaper you are never again employed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not in the habit of sending false reports—I should imagine that if I sent a report to the newspapers which turned out to be false the proper course for the editor to adopt would be not to employ me again; that is the course; I do not, therefore, find it necessary to fortify myself in making a report, by having a partner—I retired with Fowls from the meeting—we did not compare our notes; I did not read over to him what I should send to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, nor did he to me—I will tell you the manner in which it was done, and that will get rid of that difficulty—I wrote out me portion of the meeting while he wrote the other, so that we had no occasion to compare notes—I do not recollect what portion of the meeting Fowler wrote—sometimes one writes the beginning, and the other the speeches—I recollect writing some of the description of the procession, but whether I wrote it all 1 do not know—the procession was quiet enough—I have an in-pression that I wrote Fussell's speech, but I am not positively certain-there was a great noise at intervals—while Fussell was speaking I was in the van, immediately behind him—he spoke for about ten minutes, as near as I can recollect—they all took about the same time—there was a noise, unless there was anything sprightly said—there was nothing very sprightly said, to my mind, but that is a matter of taste; but I mean any point—when I say I only took the salient points, I mean the points that I thought most likely to be of use in a newspaper report.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> May I take the liberty of supposing that that means, likely to induce the editor to insert it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, you may suppose that—of course if it was all nonsense they would not put it in—I think the newspaper did put all in that I sent—Fowler and I did not compare our copy before we sent it—we could not compare it, because they were different parts—I wrote a portion and he wrote a portion—there could be no comparison; one was grafted on the other—Fowler wrote that which was appended to my portion of the report for my papers, and I wrote whatever my portion was for the papers to which he sent—I reported on that occasion for the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>—the last part of that report would be Fowler's composition.</p>

               <p>to have left oil so soon, and Williams said, "Now, friends, fall in four deep," and the mob formed into the procession four deep, as he desired, and marched off the Green—I did not see who walked in front of the procession until I got to Compton-street, Clerkenwell, a short distance from the place, and I then saw that Williams was in front of the procession—I saw Williams leave the front of the procession in Compton-street, and come down the sides—he spoke to the people who were walking on the pavement, and said, "Now, friends, if you are friends to the cause, you will fall into the procession, and not walk on the pavement"—I do not know whether any one fell into the procession then—the procession was marching along at the time—they proceeded along Goswell-street, Old-street, and City-road down to Finsbury-square—they cheered several times as they went along—they marched round Finsbury-square two or three times, waiting," I believe, for another party to come up—I did not see whether any other party joined them—I know a person of the name of Vernon—I did not see him at the meeting before it started—the first I saw of him was at Finsbury-sqaare; he was then marching with the procession—I cannot call to mind in what part of the procession he was—after leaving Finsbury-square, they pro<lb/>ceded along Chiswell-street, Beech-street, Barbican, Long-lane, through Smith-field, up Holborn, and turned down, I think, Great St. Andrew's-street, and got into Leicester-square—they then went along the end of Piccadilly, up Princes-street, Compton-street, and up Dean-street, to No, 83, where there are rooms occupied by the Irish Confederates—a great number of persons came to the windows and the door—the mob did not positively halt, but they moved much slower, and there was a great deal of cheering from the mob and from tie house, and several persons from the house came out and joined the pro<lb/>cession—after leaving Dean-street they went into Oxford-street and down. Regent-street, through the Quadrant, through Whitcomb-street and Pall-mall Rast, through Trafalgar-square into the Strand—in the Strand I heard some persons in the procession singing to the tune of the "Marseillaise Hymn" and also to the tune of "Rule Britannia"—I do not know the words, but I had heard them sing the same, at some of their previous meetings, to some words about the Charter—the words they sang to the "Marseillaise Hymn" appeared to be an English version of that which I have-read—from the Strand they went to fleet-street—they halted at the <hi rend="italic">Dispatch</hi> newspaper-office, and hooted and groaned a very great deal, and some persons who stood near me said, "Let us smash the place in"—that was not general, but the hooting and groaning was general—they then passed towards Farringdon-street—they there hesitated, and many of them said, "Let us go to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>-office"—they did not go, but proceeded up Farringdon-street, and up Skinner-street and Giltspur-street, into Smithfield—Williams was then at the head of the procession—he said to the leading section of the procession, "We will halt here in Smithfield, and I will <hi rend="italic">get</hi> up a lamp-post and address them"—he or some one got up a lamp-post—I do not know who it was—I moved away out of the crowd—the City police then interfered, and they moved along Long-lane, and to Red cross-street—they halted at a coffee-shop there—Williams, who was at the head of the procession, said, "Now do not any of you come inside, don't come inside the walls of the house"—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>let us have a meeting on the 10th April; we have had one now without his leave"—he said they would continue to-meet night after night until such time as they had news from Ireland, which the damnable press would not give them—" I mean," he said, "when our Irish brethren will want us to assist them in obtaining their liberties"—Vernon afterwards addressed them from the window, and M'Carthy after him—M'Carthy said, "Not to-night, but to<lb/>morrow night"—that was in answer to some people in the crowd, who said "Come down to-night, come down among us to-night, and lead us, and we will do it to-night!"—I cannot say what that referred to; it was while Vernon was speaking—M'Carthy said, "No, not to-night, but to<lb/>morrow night, and bring your guns and pistols with you"—the City police then interfered, and dispersed the assembly—I was in plain clothes.</p>

I heard there was to be a meeting—I think I heard it somewhere in the City—some one said there was to be a meeting on Clerkenwell-green, and being out of employment I merely went to see whether it was so—I am not a member of the Chartist body, but having nothing better to do I went—I did not" pay much attention to Wil<lb/>liams's speech, besides he was so indifferent a speaker that his voice scarcely readied any one—M'Carthy spoke somewhat strongly of the grievances of Ireland, and particularly the case of Mitchell; but I did not take any par<lb/>ticular notice of the expressions he used, not knowing cither of them—I did not hear him say that if the people allowed John Mitchell to be taken away from his native land other brave men would fall victims to the damnable <hi rend="italic">Gagging</hi> Bill, and now was the time to strike if they valued their liberty—he certainly spoke strongly, but I cannot answer'for the words; I took very little notice of what he said—I have heard Fussell speak before—I have known him seven or eight years—I did not know him at Birmingham—I suppose he has got five sons, but I am not aware that he has—I think M'Carthy used fords to the effect that if Ireland had been quiet it was only to recruit its. strength and make a bold effort at the proper time—I first gave my evidence to the solicitor on Friday morning, I think—Mr. M'Namara's clerk examined me, I understand—he asked me similar questions to what you have done, whether I was there, and so on—Flexham and Weed on were in an ante-room</p>

               <p>at the office at the time—I think there were five or six of us there altogether.—I dare say there might have been eighteen or twenty persons in the van at the meeting—I think I only recognized one or two of them; a Mr. Fuzzon was one—I saw Fussell, of course, and I understand the chairman's name was Williams—I was not acquainted with him; he was the man that spoke—I do not think Vernon spoke on that evening—I did not recognize him be might have been there—I am told he was there—I cannot say precisely who the persons were that were, there—I cannot say, of my own knowledge that they were the Chartist leaders; I suppose they were.</p>

No! all the seditions and trea<lb/>sons of these gentlemen I adopt and accept; and I ask for more. Whatever has been done or said by the most disaffected persons in all Ireland, against the existence of the party which calls itself the Government, nothing can go too far for me; whatever public treasons there are in this land, I have stomach for them all May I presume to address the women of limerick—It is the first time I have ever been in the presence of the daughters of those heroines who held the breach against King William; and they will understand me when I say that no Irishwoman ought so much as to speak to a man who has not provided himself with arms. No lady is too delicate for the culinary operation of casting bullets; no hand is too white to make up cartridges; and I hope, if it be needful to come to the last resort, that the citizens of Limerick, male and female, will not disgrace their paternal and maternal ancestors."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, G</hi> 15.) On Monday evening, 29th May, I was at Clerkenwell-green—I recollect the procession leaving there—I was afterwards at Finsbury-square, and saw Vernon there, arm-in-arm with two persons walking in the procession round the square—I had seen Vernon before last April—I did not see him again that evening till I saw him on the leads at the first-floor window of a coffee-shop in Redcross-street—I know Williams—I did not see him in Finsbury-square; I saw him on Clerkenwell<lb/>green, and I saw him at the head of the procession in Compton-street, and in Redcross-street on the leads of the coffee-shop, with Vernon—I know M'Car<lb/>iiy—I did not see him on Clerkenwell-green; I first saw him in Redcross-street, about half-past eleven o'clock—the procession had halted in the street, in front of the coffee-shop, where I saw Williams and Vernon—Williams made a speech to them from the leads, and said that they had now had a meeting to show <hi rend="italic">Finality Jack</hi> whether they wanted reform or no—he said, "He would not let us have a meeting on the 10th of April; we have now bad one without his leave, and we will continue to meet every night on Clerkenwell-green and Stepney-green, until we hear such news from our. Irish brethren as our damnable press will not give us; I mean when our Irish brethren will want us to assist them in obtaining their liberties;" that is all I remember of what he said—Vernon then spoke—he commenced with saying, "Myrmidons! myrmidons! for that is now your name;" and then he said something about how they got that name, but I do not recollect exactly how he explained it; and he said this night had cheered his drooping spirits—he should not speak much, he was now resolved only to act—he said, "You will go home quiet to-night;" and to that the mob began saying, "No, to-night! to-night! Come down among us, and lead us, and we will do it to-night?"—I do not think he said any more, but from the noise of the mob I could not</p>

               <p>hear—I think the influence of the mob prevented his saying more—M'O—then said, as if in answer to what the mob was saying, "No, not to-night but to-morrow night, and bring your guns and pistols with you;" that was all M'Carthy said—Vernon was still there—there was a great noise <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> and M'Carthy was obliged to repeat what he said several times—I could distinctly hear what Vernon said—I should think he could hear what M'Carthy said he was about a yard from him—M'Carthy was at the window, and Venton on the leads outside—M'Carthy spoke from behind Vernon—I was about twenty yards from the window—the City police then came up, and dispersed the assembly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>considerably as they went on—at Dean-street, which was the last place wher I saw them, I should think there were 50, 000 or 60, 000—I then went home to write my report.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he at that time really walking in the procession, or walking as others, casually or idly present, might be walking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You see, that would be a difficult thing to say—he was walking round, and I was walking round with Mr. Potter—he might have been walking, for aught I know, for the same purpose—the procession was going round and round—they were not in order then—there were sometimes three or four, or eight rows, straggling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a reporter. On 29th May I attended a meeting on Clerkenwell-green with Mr. Fowler—I think I stood nest to him, at all events there was not more than one person between us—I was carrying on my report with Mr. Fowler—I saw Vernon there in the van very shortly after the proceedings commenced; I saw him get into the van, but I do not distinctly recollect at what time—he got in during the delivery of the speeches—I saw him previous to getting into the van, standing in con<lb/>junction with a friend among the crowd, near the wheel of the van, but how long he stood there I am not able to say—I saw the meeting break up<lb/>Williams told his friends to fall into marching order, and the whole of the persons in the van got down—I think I was the last that remained in the-van, and when I reached the ground I found Vernon and two of bis friends standing within a few yards of the van, and at that time the procession moved off—I went down Red Lion-street I think, the first street on the right as you leave the Sessions-house going to St. John-street, and I saw Vernon and" his two friends immediately before me, perhaps thirty or forty yards, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030059"/>
               <p>as nearly as I recollect they went into a public-house; at all events, about that time I lost sight of them—when the procession moved off the Green, Vernon remained at the wheel for some few moments—he did not move off in the procession, he went in a contrary direction; he went to the right, down Red Lion-street, and the procession moved straight on through Aylesbury-street—the van was placed in the middle of the Green—I never lost sight of Vernon after he left the Green till he went into the public-house as I supposed—I met the procession again at the corner of Wilderness-row, and Old-street-road, I think in Goswell-street, but I am not very well acquainted with the the neighbourhood, so I cannot speak as to the streets—the procession was going by at the time—I saw nothing of Vernon then—I accompanied the procession as far as Finsbury-square, where I again saw Vernon and his friends—I believe he was then walking with the same two friends that he was with before—he was walking there—my impression is, that at one time he was at the bead of the procession, but I really cannot say; I am not clear enough to swear to the fact—the persons remained some time in Finsbnry<lb/>square. they walked round and round—I followed them some time after that, as far as the Chartist Assembly-rooms, in Dean-street—I saw Vernon two or three times in Holborn after leaving Finsbury-square—I wanted to speak to him, but at the time I got through the crowd I missed him again—I wanted information about the objects of the body, for I was tired of following the procession so long—in Finsbury-square the mob were all together, four abreast, in the same order as they left Clerkenwell-green—I do not know where Vernon lives—I have been subpoenaed here, or I should not have been. here—I was not subpoenaed by the prosecution.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a picture-dealer and bookseller, and reside at 94, Wardour-street. On the night of 29th May, I went to the meeting; at Clerkes-well<lb/>green—I got there a few minutes after seven o'clock—I saw Vernonthere, on the van—I saw the whole of the meeting fall into procession, and march from the Green towards Finsbury-square—I saw Vernon get out of the van, on the back side, immediately after the conclusion of the meeting, when they began to fall in—he did not take any part in the meeting afterwards—I did not notice him forming part of the procession—I afterwards saw him in Old-street-road, walking in the road with a gentleman, 400 or 500 yards behind the stragglers of the procession—I spoke to him, and walked with him some part of the way down the City-road—a gentleman of the name of Dalrymple was with me—we went on towards Finsbury-square—I saw Vernon walking towards the square, some distance behind the stragglers of the procession—after walking with him some distance, I returned to Dal<lb/>rymple—I saw Mr. Vernon, after the procession had formed apparently, ci rather had walked round Finsbury-square, and at the time Vernon must have reached it it appeared to me they had gone round the square more than once—I saw the procession go round before I reached the square, and I saw Vernon pass through the procession, and go to the iron railing and walk with a gentleman, by the enclosure as it were forming the inner circle, but in no way connected with the procession, which was marching out<lb/>side Mr. Vernon—there is a pavement round the circle of the square—the procession walked round the square, leaving a space of eight or ten fee! between them and the iron railing, and in that space Vernon walked without identifying himself with the procession—I observed that particularly—I did not see him in the procession at all at the time—having had some oppor<lb/>tunity of seeing Mr. Vernon, I crossed through the procession, and went and asked him what was the object of the procession, and asked him to leave that place, and come with me, which he did—I then took hold of bis arm, and took him to a public-house, in Chiswell-street, where we had some re<lb/>freshment—I should think we staid there a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I cannot say whether the procession went on, while we were absent, but it was walking when I left the square, and it was walking afterwards when I returned to the corner of Chiswell-street—I separated from Mr. Vernon there.</p>

               <p>the same way that I had left it—it appeared to have gone on; it had not passed the public-house, it was going round the square; it had not left the square—I returned with Vernon towards the square, and at the corner of Chiswell-street, we got separated by the crowd of stragglers—he appeared to go towards Moorgate-street—I heard the procession was going on to Smith<lb/>field—I then went considerably ahead of the procession, and waited inside the pens until the whole of the procession passed me, with an intention of seeing if Mr. Vernon was there—I wanted to know the object of the procession—I did tot see Vernon—I was looking for the purpose of seeing him—I feel certain that if be bad been there, I must have seen him—I followed the procession on the footpath through the various streets, till it reached the top of Holbom, when understanding that they were going towards Leicester-square, or Charing<lb/>cross, I went down the short streets and courts; and when I got to Leicester<lb/>square, I found myself at the head of the procession—I turned through, the square to the corner of Princes-street and Coventry-street, and saw the whole procession pass up Princes-street again, where I parted with it—Vernon was not then in the procession—I stood there, on purpose to see—I have no idea where be lives.</p>

Other person, because I found there was no person that did know the object—I went to Leicester-square to see the procession pass, to see if there was any one I knew—Dalrymple invited me to attend the meeting—I understand there was a placard, but I did not see it—no placard was exhibited at the meeting—I heard Williams speak—I cannot say that I heard the whole of his speech, I heard some part of it—I saw Vernon in the van, when I got to the meeting—I heard several persons speak whose names I do not know—there is some difference between Vernon and me upon Chartism—we have never agreed yet on that point, as to the extension of the suffrage, and the payment of members—I know Cartwright's coffee-house, by having been there occasionally—I have not been there for twelve months—I do not know who keeps it—I believe it is a house that Chartists resort to—I know nothing of my own knowledge of the parties who go there—I never went but once—I know nothing about it from Vernon—I know the Chartist-rooms, in Dean-street, I have been there—I do not recollect that I was there on 26th May—the last time I went, it was so unpleasantly crowded, that I thought I would never go any more—I did not see or hear Vernon there.</p>

On Fri<lb/>clay, 23rd June, I went to the Three Nuns, at Aldgate, to get a bed, between twelve and one o'clock at night—they could not give me a lodging there and I went to the Bull—I went up the yard, and found the door was done no—a woman followed me, and said, "I understand you want a bed?"—I said I did—she said she would get me one—I went across the yard to * *, and she followed me—she put her hand round into my pocket, and took my money—I caught her doing it—I ran after her—a man collared me at the corner of the yard, and said, "What business have you with my woman?"<lb/>he kept me in discourse about three minutes—the woman ran up the street and this fellow ran after her—I told the policeman, and we went after them<lb/>the woman was taken in a coffee-shop—the prisoners are the persons, I am sure—I suppose it might happen at a quarter or twenty minutes before one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a short-hand writer. I attended a meeting held in Bishop Bonner's-fields on Sunday afternoon, 4th June—I should think the meeting consisted of from five to seven thousand, as near as I could judge—it commenced shortly after three o'clock—the meeting was addressed by several persons from a natural mound on the Common—I saw a person there whose name I think is Curtain, who acted as chairman—a person named Henry Jones addressed the meeting—I took a short-hand note of his speech—I have not read it since the meeting—this is a transcript of it—I have compared it with my notes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WELSBY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Sharpe follow Henry Jones? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have the original notes of that, and also the transcript here—I have compared the transcript with my notes (<hi rend="italic">reading from his notes</hi>)—Sharpe said, "You still find that I am here to-day to give the lie to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, when I tell them I am always prepared to attend public meetings, to perform my duty. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper seems to <hi rend="italic">chuckle</hi> because I was not on Clerkenwell-green last Monday night. If I could have divided myself I should have been there, and likewise at a large and enthusiastic meeting at Greenwich; but it was impossible, if I had divided myself, that I could enjoy the liberty of speech, and therefore I was obliged to be at Greenwich; and that accounts for my absence from Clerkenwell-green. The gentleman who preceded me has stated that the English and Irish would continue in unity. I beg to state, that ever since the English working man has understood the oppression he labours under, and ever since the Irish peasant has known the degradation he suffered, I must declare here they have always been in unity; and by remaining in unity they are determined to destroy the power of the base bloody, brutal, and tyrannical Government. I am convinced that the English and Irish are in unity, and the interest of one is identified with the interest of the other; and if you recollect (those who were here on last Sunday afe-noon) I proposed a resolution bearing on the very subject. I spoke at great length concerning the prosecution of John Mitchell, and I believe I was not at all merciful in dealing out my remarks to <hi rend="italic">those</hi> bloody government that rules the country at the present time; and as far as my abilities would admit I lashed them as well as I could; and I am here to-day to speak briefly is seconding this resolution, because you will all understand that our meeting—that is, the Chartist meeting with which I am connected, will commence at five o'clock, and then I shall be prepared to tell the Government such a tale, not at all novel perhaps; but although it may be a repetition of the tale, and if the Government consider that I tell it too often, they will not stop my mouth by confining me in prison; for I will be equally as dangerous there, if I can have any communication with my fellow-prisoners; for I am sure to teach my doctrines wherever I go. I will contaminate every man I come in contact with, and I will tell every man, that the destruction of this Government is essentially necessary for the well-being of society; we are all working-men, we support the Government, the Church and State and pay twenty-eight millions per annum for the interest of the national debt; now, we knowing, that the source of all wealth comes from the toil of the working-man, we, as working-men, have a right to look at the sys<lb/>tem of Government; we have a right to look how the machinery is set to work, and if there is anything out of order in that machinery; we, as good mechanics, artizans, and mechanics, have a right to put it in order, and I think the union of the Irishmen and Englishmen will be so consolidated, that ere long, the Government will tremble at their power. Permit me to make a few remarks with respect to the meetings which have taken place during the last week; I have no doubt many of you, who were at those meetings and many who were absent,—you have feelings alike with us, and are some<lb/>what interested, and you are somewhat excited, and want to know, during this period of excitement, the actual position in which you are placeu. Permit me to endeavour to show you: you will recollect, but a very few nights buck, Lord John Russell made a'declaration in the House of Com<lb/>mons, that the working-classes of England were not desirous of reform—(A Voice: He is a liar)—when he made that declaration he told an abominable lie; but it is not unusual for Lord John Russell to tell lies; he is the greatest</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030079"/>
               <p>scoundrel that ever sat in the House of commons; he ought to be transported. He has transported John Mitchell for recommending that which he recom<lb/>mended prior to the passing of the Reform Bill—what was the deleration of Lord John Rusell? He said, "If they do not concede reform, I will be the colonel of the yeomanry, and the yeomanry shall lead the people; and their combined power shall destroy the aristocracy." These are Lord John Russ<lb/>ell's own words; and if he was justified in 1829, and 1830, in making use of such expressions, I have a right, as a working-man, to recommend people to resort to ulterior measures, which are calculated to proscribe this damnable power with which the Government rules the country. Permit me to say, with respect to the meetings on Monday evening, there is not one person who attended the meeting, on Stepney-green and Clerkenwell-green, who was aware that a procession would take place; it was only known among those men who could be trusted"—here a cry of "Police"was raised, and several persons ran away—the speaker then proceeded to say "Gentleman, is this way you wish to display you patriotism; is at because a few idle boys, or some scoundrel connected with Government, raise the cry of 'Police!' that you must run away across the fields like a number of scared rats. I am ashamed of you. It is not you who will be injured, it is those men who have the hardihood to come forward and address such meetings in the time, of danger, and these are the men that the Government want to entrap, and these are the men who are prepared for any circumstances that may arise, these men feeling assured, that if the <hi rend="italic">Government</hi> are inclined to imprison them, there are other men willing and prepared to take their places; as the people should always be taught the injuries they labour under, and the best method of destrouying the power that oppresses them With regard to the procession that took place on Monday evening, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper said it was 10, 000 but you are aware that that night there were not less than 150, 000 indi<lb/>viduals who composed that procession; and said our only idea and intention the papers have called us destructives, and said our only idea and intention was to make confusion and riot; not proved that working-men, when they have a demonstration are determind to show the Government that they are desirous to respect porperty, and only disrespect the power which <hi rend="italic">causes</hi> their degradation"—I have the word "causes," not "seeks"—my note is very distinct—I so understood the speaker—" I heard that when about twelve o'clock 6, 000 individuals met in Redcross-street, and a friend of mine addressed them from a window, about 100 policeman, with truncheons ready for action, dispersed this body of people in about seven or eight minutes, and he says he saw when the mob was dispersed, he looked about, and saw twenty or thirdy individuals"—I have it in my notes, (<hi rend="italic">the transcript was "seven or eight individuals, "</hi>) the words, "seven or eight minutes" occurred just before, that accounts for the mistake-" who were scarcely able to move on account of the severe knocking about they had received from the police; I was not there, and I mean what I say; and as you have listened to me Sunday after Sunday, you must be aware of the fact, that if I had been placed in that situation, I would have recommended the mass of people to make an opening admitted them all, and have enclosed them all; and if they had done, as I would have done, very few of them would have come out"—it is not "should have come out"—" but this brutal and bloody force, when they find the people meet unarmed, are ready to take advantage; but the time (not "day") is fast approaching, when it may be necessary for that force to beg mercy from the hands of the people, and I hope they will then be as generous with their mercy towards.</p>

               <p>them as they have been towards us. Now, my friends, the Government was completely paralysed; the Government was not aware of such a demon<lb/>stration; and one of the liberal members of the Parliament met with no less a personage than one of the executive, (I have no occasion to mention his name,) and he says, 'Good God, Mr.----, what was that procession about last night?' He said, 'Had you surrounded the House of Commons, we must have been compelled to run from it.' When this was told me, I very much regretted that I was at Greenwich, instead of being amons you; for had I been amongst you, I would have been the man to say, 'Come, and surround the House of Commons, not to injure any of the members, but to convince them that we are desirous of reform.' With respect to the meeting, on Tuesday night, I was disengaged, and wished to give the lie to the <hi rend="italic">Times;</hi> and after hearing of the brutality exercised towards the people, I went to Clerkenwell-green. and was the second man to address that large concourse of people; and when I got up, so the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reports, I spoke openly and advisedly, and likewise I begged the people, who were listen<lb/>ing to me; that if thev did not understand they would please to imagine, I will tell you precisely what I said, and I spoke in particular with regard to the brutality of the police on the previous night; and I showed the policemen that they placed themselves in a false position; and I told the people then, if I had been with them on the previous night, I would have recommended them to act on the defensive; this was my recommendation then, and this is my recommendation now. I would not recommend any man to strike or insult a policeman, but if they strike or insult you, if there are not stones, there are better and more formidable weapons. You will often find about the streets of London plenty of railings before the houses; let every man only—when necessary grasp one, and all pull together, and you have then got a weapon better than any policeman's truncheon—it will take a policeman five or six times to strike a man before he quiets him with his truncheon: but only strike a policeman once with such a weapon as I have recommended, and you will soon silence him. This is my recommendation only when it is necessary. I would not recommend you to do so now, there is no occasion;" (the words are not "it is not necessary.") "although we have policemen and soldiers in the neighbourhood, for a peaceable meeting of this kind does not require their interference, they will not come out now. You must excuse me addressing you any longer, I commence again at five o'clock, and I shall be prepared then to give the Government a good horsewhipping; but I hope you will remain here till the other meeting begins; and what with the power we have now, and the power to come up, it will be the largest meeting I ever saw in Bishop Bonner's-fields; and the public mind is so excited, "that I believe Sunday after Sunday the meetings will increase. What power can prevent men from meeting and discussing their grievances. The day is too far gone when the sight of a policeman's truncheon, or a soldier dressed in a scarlet jacket, will stop the mouths of the working-classes. The resolution I most cordially second, believing every one of you sympathise with that man as much as I do myself; and in the wording of the resolution, he has committed no crime, but only taught the people their duty: he gave them such political instruction, as was essentially necessary for the Irish people to establish their independence; and I enjoin; all men, all Englishmen and Scotchmen, as well as Irishmen, to raise the cry "—then the prisoner recited two or three lines of verse, toe whole of which I did not get—I only took the words, "To raise the cry of brave Ireland shall be free and great."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the time that you were there, until you left in Mr. White's com<lb/>pany, was all peaceable and orderly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as far as I saw-—we left the first meeting shortly after five o'clock, and returned again shortly after to the second meeting—at the end of that meeting the people left and dispersed about the Common—the people who attended the second meeting were of just the same class—Mr. White and I walked away directly the speakers had left the mound—there was a room kept for us at the City of Paris Inn, in the neighbourhood, which commanded a view of the Common, and we had bor<lb/>rowed a table and two chairs for the purpose of writing on in the field—we em<lb/>ployed some men to take them back, and we went with them—we stayed there nearly an hour—we had a view of the Common from the window of the inn—all was peaceable when we left at the end of the hour, but there had been some disturbance in the interim, I believe; I did not see any—about a quarter of an hour after we left the Common, I heard a great noise and shouting of "Police!" whilst we were at the inn; there was a cry that the police were charging the people—I looked out of the window and saw the police running after the people, who were running away—I did not see them use their truncheons—they had them in their hands—they were at some con<lb/>siderable distance from us—I saw women among the persons who were run<lb/>ning away—the police were on the Common, running from the direction of the Church, and about 200 or 300 yards from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With reference to the report you have read, did you in the first instance furnish the whole of that report to the solicitor for the Crown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was standing when I took my report—I had a policeman's back to write upon—there was no pushing to and fro to any great extent—I was protected by three or four policemen, in plain clothes, who stood around me—I went there for the purpose of reporting the meeting for the Crown—in my report I have the words," But this brutal and bloody force, when they find the people meet unarmed, are ready to take advantage; but the time is fast approaching when it may be necessary for that force to beg mercy from the hands of the people."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, were not these the words the speaker then used, "And I hope they will then be more generous with their mercy towards them than they have been towards us?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I took the words as I heard them and as I have read them—I have no interest in the matter—it is possible I may have mistaken what he said—I may have misunderstood him, it is possible—he also said, "Permit me to say, with respect to the meeting on Monday evening, that there was not one person who attended the meeting on Stepney-green and Clerkenwell-green who was aware that a procession would take place"—I did not hear him add, "It was only known among those men who could be trusted for prudence and love of order"—if I had heard them I should have taken them; and Sharpe is an easy speaker, he spoke rather deliberately than otherwise—there were at times swells in the noise of the people while he was speaking—I would not swear that I took every syllable he uttered—I had often to appeal to the people around me, to enable me to write.</p>

                  </hi>. I attended this meeting on the part of Government—I got there at five minutes to three o'clock—the chair was taken at twenty-five mintes to four—it was not announced what the meeting was for, and I had no information to that effect—I heard it said there that it was a meeting of Irish confederates on behalf of Mitchell—I did not hear it officially—I heard people talking about it, and I heard it in the chairman's opening—a person named Curtain took the chair—I have got my short-hand notes here of what fee said, but I do not think I can read the first few slips with any degree of accuracy, as I was sitting on the ground, and pushed in all directions at the tine—I will read what I have got—" Ladies and gentlemen,—I am extremely prond of the position you have put me in. We are met here to-day to denounce the cruel, the villanous, and damnable Government, for the attro<lb/>cious, villanous, and despotic conduct towards our countryman, "or" <hi rend="italic">coun<lb/>trymen</hi>, "in Ireland. What have they done to John Mitchell I or what has he done to them? His only crime was, for loving his native land, the land of his forefathers. They have made that an outrage and a crime, and they have packed a Jury by a juggler of a Sheriff, and they have transported him for fourteen years beyond the seas! What for? Because he loved his country. They did not stop there, but they desecrated the home of his wife and six children. When they sentenced him to transportation, they sent a hand of ruffians to his home, and while his wife was standing in her home, <hi rend="italic">bereaving</hi> the loss as she stood in the room, the ruffians came in to rob her of whatever little property belonged to her. This was their conduct towards her; and will we Irishmen be silent? Are we not cowards at the present moment to allow it? (Cries of, 'Yes! yes!') We are cowards and slaves; but the day will arrive, and it is not far distant: there are some of the <hi rend="italic">Foigh-a-Ballagh</hi> boys" I think it was "in London at present."—I do not know the meaning of that expression. "We have called our countrymen a home cowards, because they have left their native soil; but vengeance is ours, by the Lord!"—as I have got it, but I wish you distinctly to understand that these passages I am now reading I cannot positively swear to, they were taken while I was sitting on the ground, and the people all about me—"This is the last meeting the Irishmen will hold in London or any other place. This is the last meeting of the Irish. If there is any spy of the Government here, let him note that down with pens with sharp points and short holders."—I have got here a note, the mob was running away, and there was very great confusion—I-did not see what occasioned that—there</p>

               <p>was a cry of," The police are coming!"—that occurred several times during the meeting, and this was one of those occasions—I did not see any police come—that is all I have got of the chairman's speech—Henry Jones spoke next—I was not better situated for some time—he said, "Gentlemen,—It is my pleasing duty to propose the first resolution in this important meeting; I call it great and important, and I will tell you why; because, by meetings like these we shall convince the Government of this country that the spirit of patriotism among the Englishmen and Irishmen is not dead, it only sleeps"—then there is a word I cannot read, it is obscure—"to give it a glorious resurrection, we wish the Government of this country to know that there is an end to all human endurance; that human struggles may be carried on to a certain pitch and a certain length; but the day must arrive, necessarily arrive, when human endurance can bear that tyranny no longer"—there was then some confusion in the meeting—there was a cry every now and then of "Police!" and people running away—Jones suspended his speech till quiet was restored, and then went on: "Gentlemen,—I call on you, one and all, to pay no attention to either the interruption of any felon in disguise, or to any juvenile little noise; that is unavoidable in all assem<lb/>blies: I call on you, if you value that liberty of speech, which sooner or later you will know the value of; if you value that liberty of opinion which the Government wish to crush; if you value the noble patriotism of action which, as citizens, you wish to possess; unless we tell the Government we are determined to possess that liberty of speech, they will, by the power of brute force, endeavour to dispossess you of that glorious"—I do not know the word—"of freedom. Gentlemen, recollect this is not a meeting of a sect or of a party; this is a meeting of the English Chartist body, and of the Irish Confederation; Englishmen and Irishmen have all one evil to complain of; it is one tyranny, one despotism, that is sucking the vitals of the people of the two countries: let not Englishmen forget the [<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>]; as an Eng<lb/>lishman, I solemnly declare that I have no interest in any measure, in any treaty, any public negotiation which the aristocratical Government of this country will make; I have no interest in it. Englishmen, I call on you, as you love your freedom, look at that brave people; they put a man on the throne, having confidence"—I believe he was referring to France—I see that something is omitted by my book—I could not hear—" the fellow violated the confidence that was reposed in him, and that people acted as a noble example, that all people similarly situated ought to follow—to drive a tyran<lb/>nical Sovereign, wherever or whatever he is, from the throne. Thanks be to God. we have not a tyrannical Sovereign here; we wish no ill to the lady that fills the throne of this country; we have the most unbounded respect for her person; but by all that is good and holy, we will drive into a state of exile, or something else, the Whig ministry, so that they will not have the power of doing----"—I think it is "harm to anybody; I am quite aware of the responsible position I am standing in in the presence of a noble band of patriots, among whom is gathering the scribes, the penners, and myrmi<lb/>dons of the Government; and if I could single out those men, I would ask them to stand by my right-hand, to take a note of every word I say"—I did not write this part out, it is so obscure—" for I wish the executive in Downing-street to know that the day is come when"—then I have a very long blank; I have made a note to that effect; it was caused by confusion of some kind—I was pushed down repeatedly—the next I have is, "I assert this fact, the Union was made for the benefit of the aristocracy"—then I have another blank—the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Go on to the end of his speech, and come to the resolution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "Gentlemen, this is a resolution which will be seconded by a gentleman well known to you all; I have to apologize to you for the length of time I have kept you, but as I am often before the public, I am quite sure you nil give me absolution for any crime I have committed; 'Resolved, that this meeting is of opinion that the conduct of Government was tyrannical, base, brutal, and even bloody, in transporting John Mitchell for no crime, in Dublin, which, if England was similarly situated to Ireland, would be a patriotic virtue in London'"—I am rather doubtful about the word "patriotic," but I think that is the word—then comes Sharpe—he seconded the resolution; and Looney spoke as follows: "Mr. Chairman and fellow-countrymen; I come here in consequence of hearing that this was to be a great meeting of my countrymen here to-day, to have a look it the spirit that seemed to animate them; this is the first meeting that I ever spoke to in my life; but I am very glad,-as an Irishman, and as a work<lb/>ing-man, to be able to follow those two Englishmen who have come for<lb/>ward to bear testimony to the injustice with which my countrymen, and the man who tried to advocate the doing of justice to my country, has been treated by the british government."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> just turn back to jone's speech, and see whether in your note of what he said, there is any allusion to the police being in the Church? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I have it; "Behold, even in this very assembly, you may behold every material that forms a natural, well-organized system; you behold a Church consecrated to the service of the Most High, consecrated to the purposes of religion, occupied by men, the myrmidons of Government, who are there not out of any feeling that there will be a riot, the Government know there will not be a riot; but they want, if they can, by the exhibition of characters in police uniform, to frighten you from struggling for your just, constitutional rights; but, Gentlemen, I beg leave to say, as a public man, now is the time that men ought to speak their feelings and their sentiments; I say solemnly, advisedly, and reflectingly, I would sooner follow John Mitchell in his travel to a foreign land, than I would stop in this country with the damning badge of political inferiority stamped on my brow"—Looney spoke after Jones, and O'Manney, or O'Malley, after him; then M'Carthy, and then Henry Jones spoke again—the last speaker finished shortly after five o'clock—the number of persons concentrated round the mound had increased during the speaking—I went away for about twenty minutes, then returned, and took a <hi rend="italic">verbation</hi> note of everything that passed at the second meeting—there was no chairman appointed—Mr. Curtain did not remain—I did not see him—Sharpe and Ernest Jones were the only speakers—Sharpe spoke first—I have a note of his speech—that meeting finished at nearly seven—I then left the ground,.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the incumbent of St. James's Church, in Victoria-park. On Sunday afternoon, 4th June, I was officiating in my Church—the service commenced at three o'clock—I recollect the inspector, with a certain number of police, coming into the Church during the service—I came out from the Church about half-past four—there were then some thousands of people on the Green—the most part of them were near the Church—my house is very near the Church—I could see the meeting from my house—I saw persons addressing the meeting during the course of the afternoon, or rather in the evening—the speeches concluded about a quarter-past seven—the centre of the meeting then separated, and a great portion of them came towards the Church—the next thing of most importance that I witnessed was the throwing the stones at Mr. Inspector Waller, and the windows of the Church—a great many of the panes were broken—I then saw Inspector Waller go into the churchyard, and the police were brought out from the churchyard—they proceeded to disperse the mob—a great portion of the mob ran away—many of them remained behind, and some of them must have resisted the police—I saw the police issue forth with their trun<lb/>cheons, and I observed the mob dispersing, and the field in great excitement—a portion of the mob continued on the ground—the conflict with the police was at a great distance from me—I saw a great muster of the people at a dis<lb/>tance, and the police proceeding against them—they were at too great a distance for me to individualize them—the next thing of importance which I observed was the return of the police with the prisoners.</p>

The prisoner was an inmate of that prison in June—he came in on 4th November—I knew the deceased, his name was William Henry Woodhouse—he was a warder—on Saturday, 10th June, about eight in the morning, he came to me with the prisoner, and reported in his presence that the prisoner had complained to him that one of the prisoners in the yard had held a conversation with him, and asked him if he were not the man who had criminal intercourse with his own daughter, or something to that effect—Woodhouse said to me that he did not believe the truth of the prisoners state<lb/>ment—I said instantly, "Nor do I," and told the prisoner I should remove him into a cell by himself, for he really was not a man fit to associate with others—he was then taken away by Woodhouse—about an hour after that I saw the prisoner in a cell in No. 5 yard—I had then seen Woodhouse carried away wounded and dying from No. 5 yard—when I went to the cell I said to the prisoner, "You have done a fatal deed at last; this poor man is dead. you have killed him "—he said, "Serve him right, a b----y villain!"—he</p>

On Monday, 22nd May, about noon, I went with four other officers to the second-floor of No. I, New-court, Great Wild-street, Drury-lane—I directed Hughes to remain in the court, to stand by the door under the second-floor window—he would command a view of that win<lb/>dow—the street-door was open—we went up to the second-floor room, and com<lb/>menced battering the door, which was strongly barricaded—there was a door nailed to the usual door with large spikes, to make it thicker and more dif<lb/>ficult to enter, and against that door these large pieces of wood (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to go from the door to the wall on the other side—after considerable difficulty we got in, and Neville and Swanson secured the prisoners, who were in the room—Thomas was standing with his shirt-sleeves tucked up above his elbows, and a frying-pan in his hand—Sarah was standing close to the win<lb/>dow, which was open—there is but one room on a floor—before we got in I heard a noise resembling the breaking of glass, and ordered Harvey to go down in the court to Hughes, whom I had left there to watch—on entering the room I observed this earthenware pipkin on a clear fire with white metal in it, which had been recently upset, with the metal pouring from it through the fire—I saw a tub containing water, which I immediately emptied on the fire—I then commenced picking up the metal which poured through the fire—this is it—I believe it is Britannia metal—on the hob I saw an iron pot which contained metal, not in a fluid state but quite hot, I could hardly bold the spoon—it appears to have been melted, but left there to cool—under the stove I found another iron spoon, and this knife on a table close to the fire, with plaster of Paris adhering to one of the blades, and on the same table a pair of scissors and two files, one of them with white metal in its teeth—on a shelf in the room I found a quantity of copper wire, having a silvery appearance, as if used in the galvanic battery; and under the table three tin bands for forming plaster of Paris moulds, with plaster adhering to them—I searched Thomas, and found in his right breeches pocket three good shillings</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Wire, we are solicitors. We had been concerned professionally for the prisoner for several years past—I heard that he came in company with Forrester—I was not there then—I heard the cause of his being taken—several days previous to that he told me the notes he bad paid into his bankers, the Southampton branch of the London and Westminster Bank, had been stopped at the Bank—I accompanied him to the Bank, and saw Mr. Marshall—I was alone with him, and explained to him the circumstances as detailed to me by the prisoner—the prisoner did not give me directions to make any express statement, or to say anything specially—he came to me, and said that on the preceding day he had paid these notes into his banker's, and in the evening, some person came from the Bank, and told him they had been stopped, that they had been stolen some years before, and he requested me to go with him to his banker's—on the way, he told me that he went to Epsom, on the Derby day, and while there, a bet was offered him of 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by a person, who he afterwards ascertained from himself, was a Mr. Green, whose residence was at Manchester; and after the race was won, and it being determined in his favour, the gentleman come to him, and wished to settle the bet; that he paid him the two 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in question, and he immediately put the name of the party on the back of the notes—I believe this to be the prisoner's writing on the back of them—he said the person who came to him was attired as a gentle<lb/>man, was rather of an imposing appearance, and was in a very handsome carriage; that he knew there was a Mr. Green of Manchester, very much connected with the sporting world, and who kept race-horses, and he sup<lb/>posed this was the man; that Mr. Robertson, the editor and proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Railway Record</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Railway Times</hi>, was with him, and saw the notes, and took them in his hand, and Mr. Upham, and another gentleman, were present; one carrying on business in Blackfriars-road, and the other in Edgware-road, and his wife was with him, and other persons—I stated the substance of this to Mr. Marshall—these are the notes which were deposited in Mr. Goodman's hands, at the hearing—they have Green's name on the back of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old. I am servant to Mr. William Wheatley, of 23, South-terrace, Thurlow-square, Brompton—the prisoner was in his service eight days, and left between seven and eight o'clock on 21st June—she left one of her boxes behind, and Mr. Wheatley said she must come for it afterwards—she came for it about eight that evening, and asked leave to go down-stairs for a certain purpose—you have to pass the kitchen to go to the closet—it is indoors—you need not go into the kitchen to go to it—she went down-stairs, and I waited for her up-stairs in the passage—I and a little boy six years old were the only persons in the house, besides an invalid lady up<lb/>stairs, who was locked in—the prisoner was gone a very long time, and I called to her three times—she made no answer—I went down, and saw her come out of the kitchen—I am sure it was not out of the other place—I did not go into the kitchen myself at that time—we both came up-stairs together—I opened the door to let her out, and while I was standing at the door, before she went out, I smelt a great burning—I asked her if she had seen anything on fire when she was down-stairs—I am sure I used the word <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> anything—she said no, she had not—she was looking down at the kitchen window two or three times, we could see it from where we were—I looked and saw a great smoke come from the window—I asked her whether she would mind coming</p>

               <p>down stairs again with me, and she told me I might go down and look and see whether it was on fire, for she had not any business in the house when her box was out—I told her, that master would be very much obliged to her if she would come down and put it out, if it was on fire—she would not, and I went down by myself into the kitchen—I went to a cupboard, the door of which I found shut, and found rags inside burning on the top—it was smouldering—there was a little flame—I am sure I saw flame—it was beginning to light again, but a pipe which runs through the cupboard was melted, and the water run out and put it out—I was rather frightened, I ran up stairs and asked the prisoner again to come down—she told me to go down and open all the doors and windows, and then the smoke would go out—I went down, but I did not do that—I opened the cupboard-door, and when I found it was begin<lb/>ning to blaze up again I shut it again—the prisoner came down in about ten minutes—I had not done anything in the mean time to put it out—I could not do anything—when she came down I threw some water over it, and when it was very near out, she took up a jug and threw some over it herself—I told her if I opened the windows and doors it would blaze up, and the house would be burnt down before my master came home—she said she could no: help it, she was in a hurry, as she had to go out that evening—I asked her if she met my master to tell him that the house had been on fire, and she said she would—we usually kept black-lead brushes and leathers to polish candlesticks in the cupboard—there were some rags, but no wood was there before the fire—I am sure of that—it was kept in a different cupboard—there was wood mixed with the rags when it was on fire—that was the first time I had seen wood there—rags were kept in the cupboard, but in a different part—I had not seen any of them before on that day—the wood was kept in another cupboard—no paper was kept there,-but there was some burning—the inside of the door, the side, and underneath the shelves of the cupboard, were all burnt black—I had to throw a great deal of water on it—it was put out at last—my master came in a little time after the prisoner had gone.</p>

I live at this house—it is in the parish of St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington—the prisoner came into my service on 12th June—for some reason I parted with her—she went on 21st—she wanted a month's wages besides the time she had been in my house—I refused to pay her, on account of her conduct and the bad language she used while in the house—she had been rather violent—she said she would not go without her month's wages—that was on the Tuesday—on the Wednesday evening after I paid her I went out—I gave her leave to leave one of her boxes in the passage, and to come back for it—I left my little boy and Caroline Steele in the house—the rest of my family were out—as I came home I met the prisoner at the corner of Thurlow-square, and said, "You have been for your box yourself?"—she said, "Yes, Sir"—that was all she said—I went home, and found Steele very frightened, and fainting away in the passage—I went into the</p>

Lubbock's, I inquired of a gentle<lb/>man the nearest way to the bankers.'—he said he could not tell—the prisoner Clark came up after me, and asked me where I wanted to go—I told him I wanted to go to the Mansion-house—he said he was going that way, and he</p>

B., at Mr. Clarence's, fruiterer, Church-passage, Pic<lb/>cadilly"—on the following Thursday I received a memorandum, in conse<lb/>quence of which I went to the East India Chambers, Leadenhall-street, on 20th April—I waited in the passage of the chambers, and Bradbury came to me—he asked if I was the young person who was to meet him there at two o'clock—I said, "Yes"—he asked me to walk with him to the corner of Lime-street, which I did; and as we walked he said he wanted me for a gen<lb/>tleman whose name was Bird, who resided near Bromley, in Kent, and who was going on the Continent for six or seven months, and wanted a servant to go with him, and he thought I should suit him—he said he would go and see if Mr. Bird was in town, but he was afraid he was not, as the day had been so wet—he asked me to go to the Custom House, and meet him thereat three, and at the same time gave me a shilling to get some refreshment—I went to the Custom House at three, and met Bradbury at the first door from Billingsgate Market—he said he had been to see, and Mr. Bird was not come to town; but he was authorized by Mr. Bird to engage a servant for him—I asked him twenty-two guineas for wages—he said that was twenty-three pounds, but I need not be particular, the gentleman was a very liberal. man, and he would as lief give me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I should have no objection to that, but I should be satisfied with twenty-two guineas—I was to meet him on Saturday, the 22nd, at eleven—I was there at eleven—he did not come till a quarter-past—he said he was in a hurry, and he made an appointment to meet him again at one, at the middle door at the Custom House, and he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went at one—he did not come till a quarter-past—we walked round to the water-side—he said he had got business at the Docks, business at the Custom House, and business in the City—he asked</p>

               <p>me if I could do the business for him in the City—I told him, "Yes"—he said it was a check, and rather a heavy one—he said he had a ship lying off the Docks, and they could not get it in till he had got the check cashed—he told me to take it, and if they asked me who I came from, I was to say, Messrs. Hunt and Co.; and if they asked me anything further, I was to say Mr. Thompson had sent me—this is the check he gave me (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it was in a bill-case—he took it out and showed it to me—it is for 371<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a paper which had on it "Three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash"—he asked me how long I should be gone—I told him I thought about half an hour, unless they detained me—I went to Messrs. Lubbocks with the check—they cashed it, and I put the notes into the case—I took back the money to Bradbury, at the Custom House, against the water-side—I gave it to him—he took the notes out of the bill-case and looked at them, and I emptied the money out of my own purse and gave it him—he said he had heard from Mr. Bird, but he would not be in town till four, when he would be at Hatchett's Hotel, in Piccadilly—he told me to meet him there—he gave me a half-a-crown, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get <hi rend="italic">Bradshaw's Guide</hi>, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my dinner—he said I was to be there a little before four, but he thought he should not be there till a little after—I went there, and he came, in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, about twenty minutes past four—I did not see whether there was anybody else in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he said he had just seen a messenger from Bromley, and that Mr. Bird, while hunting in the morning, had met with a slight accident, and would not be able to come to town till the following Tuesday or Wednesday—he said he must get me to wait till Tuesday or Wednesday to see Mr. Bird—he asked me what would satisfy me to keep me till Tuesday or Wednesday, that I night not look after anything else—he said he would give me a half sove<lb/>reign, if that would be sufficient—I said I thought it would—he gave me a half-sovereign, and as the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> turned round to go towards the City, I took the number of it—it was 2268—in consequence of an advertisement I after<lb/>wards saw in the paper, I went to Mr. Mullens and gave information.</p>

Portsmouth, and a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 24181, 18th Aug. 1847—these notes were shown to Clark, and he was asked if he recognised them as the notes that had been taken from his person at the moment of his arrest—he examined the notes, and said they were—he was asked on what part of his person they were found—he said, in the inside pocket of his flannel uaistcoat—he was asked why he carried the notes in such a place—he said he had once lost a large sum of money, and ever since that time he had always carried his money in a more secure place, in the inside of his waistcoat—he was then asked where he got these two notes from—he said he had them from his companion Bradbury—he was then asked what notes he had changed in Brussels, out of the notes which were then lying on the table, six notes, and one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they are all here—he said, "I changed one of these," and after looking at them, he selected this note, No. 24180, dated 18th Aug. 1847, Newcastle—he said, "I changed that for 118 Frederic d'ors; that is my own; I changed that at a money-changers"—he was then asked if he claimed any of the other notes, which were lying on the table—he said, "No, these do not belong to me"—he was asked how he became acquainted with Bradbury—he said he never saw him before they met at Dover—he was then asked where he got the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, which iie acknowledged he had changed—he said from a person at Dover, to whom he gave small notes for it—he was then shown the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper of 28th April, in which the numbers of the notes appeared, including No. 24180—after noticing that, he</p>

               <p>looked at the note again, and said, "If that note is in that advertisement, I am sure that is not the note that I changed"—he was then asked what note it was, he would acknowledge to have changed—he said, "The note I changed was dated 1847, but it was an older note, and I think, rumpled"—he was then asked where he got the notes from, which he had given in exchange for the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, at Dover—he said, "I cannot say where I got those notes, but I could if I had my book"—he was asked where his books were—he said they were at home—he was asked where his home was—he said, "I will not say where that is, because I should disgrace my family"—he was then asked, whether he knew who the person was from whom he received the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said he did not; he had met the person by accident, on the Quay, at Dover—his attention was called to some notes which had been taken from his person, but there were other notes produced, which were brought by different money-changers, in Brussels—Bradbury was then called in, and the same caution was given to him that had been given to Clark, and translated in the same way by the interpreter—his attention was directed to the whole of the notes that I have produced to-day, Nos. 45307, 42326, 36137, 38273, 2, 180, 24181—he said, "I received them from Mr. Bullock, 114, Yardley-sreet, King's-road, Chelsea, he gave them to me on Saturday, 22nd April, on the Quay, at Dover; the property which has been seized by the police is not mine but Mr. Bullock's; I received them on the Quay, and at the same time seven 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes; these are the notes—that is my writing—I know them. by that"—the name, "J.

                  </hi>. I am a short-hand writer. On Sunday, 4th June, I attended a Chartist meeting held in Bonner's-fields, which is a large open common or green—there had previously been a meeting of the Irish Confederates that afternoon—the Chartist meeting began at a quarter to six o'clock—there were about 3, 000 people present at the meeting, and a larger number scattered over the place—many of them had remained from the former meeting—there was no chairman appointed—Sharpe first addressed the meeting—I took a note of what he said; this is it:—" My friends, you can perceive that I have kept my promise; and on yesterday morning several parties, who pledged their words to attend this meeting, I expected here; but if some men, in the time of anticipated danger, will not come forward, it is necessary that some one should; and as I have been here during the calm, I am prepared to be here when the storm comes on. This being the most stormy time I have kept my word, and consequently I am prepared to make a few more remarks. You will, perhaps, not consider that I am actuated by any motives of fear, when I tell you, and when I find that I stand alone, I shall not give the Govern<lb/>ment the horscu hipping that I promised them; but still I will address you. While I was speaking to you this afternoon, in reference to the various meet<lb/>ings that had taken place in London during this last week"—(cries of 'Ernest Jones! Ernest Jones!')—Mr. Jones appeared in about a minute or two after,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030111"/>
               <p>not then. "Gentlemen, I believe there is Ernest Jones coming. Friends, I am very glad to find that Mr. Jones has not run away from the post of danaer; and when I made my remarks previous to his coming, I did not include him in the list, but I included those men that had addressed you Sunday after Sunday for many weeks; and I do not think that it is con<lb/>sistent of men, while we can talk quietly together, that they should desert their post, as I have observed before, when there is something like an antici<lb/>pated danger. I will not detain you long, because I know that you are desirous to listen to Mr. Jones. Now, my friends, I wish to speak to you with reference to the unnecessary interference of the police this morning, with a number of working men who attended a meeting at Nova Scotia Fields. It is well known that we have met there for about four or five Sundays; we have discussed our grievances, and the men have quietly dispersed; but what with the tyranny of the Government, and the officiousness of the police, I understand they came there this morning, and abused, and insulted, and brutalised the great majority of the men who had there assembled. I under<lb/>stand that the people acted the part of cowards, and do not blame me when I say so. I was not present, because I was at another meeting, on Blackheath. The people, I understand, ran away—(a voice: 'The people had nothing to defend themselves with.') The gentleman says the people had nothing to defend themselves with. Now, if ever you come in contact, Sir, with the police, you must expect a knock-down blow with their truncheon; but when you have about three to one, one man falls out of three, and the other two can secure him. Now, will any man tell me I am wrong when I say that you acted the part of cowards when you ran away? What was the conse<lb/>quence? This morning, when I was at Black heath, there were five inspec<lb/>tors pointed out to me; there was a number of special constables, and like<lb/>wise a number of sergeants, and of other men connected with the force, all in private clothes, pointed out; and some of them said, 'For God's sake, Sharpe, be careful what you say.' I consider I am always, because I am always desirous to speak the truth; and when I speak the truth I state what I mean; when I tell men what they should do, it is what I am prepared to do myself, believing that what I stated is all that is required to carry out our ends; and consequently, if you are men, and determined to establish your rights, that you should embrace the opportunity when it presents itself. Now, then, with regard to the meeting that took place on last Wed<lb/>nesday evening, on Clerkenwell-green, I was absent, because I was at Green<lb/>wich, the same as I was on the. Monday; and in the words of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> they certainly were men of the right sort—men who, under any circumstances, if attacked by the police, would be the vanguard and destroy them. Those are the men of Greenwich, and I trust that the men of the Tower Hamlets will not be behind them, Now my friends, I live at a dairy myself; I wish to give you a little instruction—it is an idea of how many of these men are situated that address public meetings during the so-called turbulent time. I live at a dairy; and a I stopped at Greenwich last Wednesday night, I did not go home till the Thursday morning; but of course my wife, like every other woman anxious for the welfare of her hus<lb/>band, sat up for me. A man came to my house at eleven o'clock on Wed<lb/>nesday night, and wanted a gallon of milk very particularly; but she told him that the man would not get up to serve it, and he consequently went away. At one in the morning, (my wife still sitting up for me, and in great anxiety,) two men came past, and said they must have milk, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030112"/>
               <p>demanded it. After a great deal of persuasion, the bell which led to the man's chamber was rung; he got up, and the man put the question to him, 'What the devil do you want the milk for? 'Oh!' says he, it is wanted; the <hi rend="italic">specials</hi> are ordered out for two o'clock in the morning, and they want their breakfast before they go out.' I treat the <hi rend="italic">specials</hi> with the same con<lb/>tempt as I do the police, because I consider the united force of the work<lb/>ing classes of England will destroy that petty power which they hold at the hands of the Government at the present time; and I do hope that you wiil act as men, not be scared at the sight of a policeman or a <hi rend="italic">special</hi>. I trust not; but if ever they insult you, if ever they brutalize you, if ever they strike you, act upon the defensive; and if you cannot knock them down, close with them, and do the best that you possibly can; for I can tell you no more nor less than this, it is only man to man, and sometimes it is a little man to big man, and sometimes it is a big man to a big man, so that, consequently, you stand an equal chance to each other; he has a staff and youhave not, there<lb/>fore it is just possible that you, using your strength, might dispossess him of that staff, and make as good use of it as he did himself. You are aware that I have addressed you previously this afternoon, and Mr. Ernest Jones is anxious to address you; and I am very glad, in the presence of my friend Jones, that I have proved what I stated to him yesterday, that there would be from 20, 000 to 30, 000 people at this meeting; and I hope that when he gets up, he will grant to me that I have at least spoken the truth for once." Ernest Jones then addressed the meeting—he spoke from a chair that was placed on a natural mound—he spoke thus:—" Mr. Chairman and men of the Tower Hamlets,—In the first place I have to apologize to you for not having been here sooner; but a man cannot be at two places at the same time. There was a meeting announced for Irongate Wharf, Paddington, and the police, I understand, had forbid that meeting taking place. I was invited to attend it, and therefore I did attend it. There were a good many police there, but they did not venture to interfere with the meeting; and I can tell you this, hold your meetings; for although the Government certainly are mad, they are not mad enough to put down public meetings; and if they were mad enough to do it, I for one hurl defiance in their teeth, and dare them to dis<lb/>perse this legal and peaceable assembly. I must ask likewise for your indulgence to-day, inasmuch as I start by the mail-train to-night for Lanca<lb/>shire and Yorkshire; and as those places are both in a very excited state, I shall have to use my lungs there a good deal; and as London is not so excited as those parts of the country are, excuse me from wearying you at any great length to-day. All that I say is this, stand fast by your colours; do not shrink from the Charter, and the whole Charter; do not mind the nonsense of the half-and-half men; do not pay any attention to the <hi rend="italic">Dispatch;</hi> and if you see any bodies of police coming near to this meeting, marching on to this meeting, stand your ground, shoulder by shoulder. Do not run; there is danger for those who run; there is safety for those who keep together. Dare them to strike you, and my word for it, they dare not strike a blow. If they were to strike a blow, bad as the laws are now, still they are sufficiently stringent to punish those men who assault peaceable citizens in the peaceable execution or performance of their duty. In nine cases out of ten it is your own fault, it is your own cowardice that invites others to strike a blow, it is men saying, 'We will not do this, we will not do that, because it is forbid.' Make up your minds, stand by it, and whatever comes, stand to your ground. There cannot be more heads broken than are broken on those occasions when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030113"/>
               <p>men run away. All I say is, that the Government are desirous of marring the performance of your present great duty—that duty is organization. I have not been amongst you for some little time. Where are your classes? Have you pot your wardmotes? <hi rend="italic">I</hi> Have you got your class-leaders? Have you perfected your organization? If not, call public meetings, and elect the class-leaders at those public meetings; do not let the class be formed before you have the class-leaders. You will find it much more easy to form class after the class-leader is appointed; for if you form classes, and then afterwards appoint the class-leader, you may spend two or three hours or more upon the formation of every class, and can never come to a fixed determination with regard to it, as one man will live here and another there. Elect the class-leader; the class-leader then knows the men likely to form the class living in his neighbourhood; he will go to those men and invite them; and there can be no dictation, no assumption of that power, because you all elect the class-leaders at the public meetings. Rest assured, if each locality elects about 100 class-leaders, you will soon have 1, 000 men under the banner. That is the way to get up the organization; and then you may elect wardmotcs—one out of ten will be a wardmote. Commence at the foundation right, namely, the classes and the wards; all the rest will follow of itself as a matter of course. Begin by forming your classes. It is no use coming among you, when there is no organization; and it is not the Executive that can get up the organization. The Executive cannot go to each locality, and get up the organization of each locality—it nust be the men in the localities. Show us your organization, and you will have a glorious opportunity on the 12th. Prepare in the mean time. Show us your organization then, and depend upon it we will show you some very feasible means for getting nearer to your rights; depend upon it we will not be backward. Show us your organization, and depend upon it you will not have to make one false step, depend upon it you will not be called to undertake any one step that you will not be fully prepared to carry out, and that the officers that you entrust with office will not lead you in the carrying out of. Steer clear of all partial outbreak and partial rioting. There has been an outbreak at Bradford and Manchester. We sent down Dr. M'Douall, who is now addressing a glorious meeting at Paddington, to tell them to have no partial outbreak—no partial riot. That is just what the Government wants. In a riot of that kind they immediately seize upon the leading men; they will immediately cripple the organization, and your organ<lb/>ization will be thrown back. Go on organizing, organizing, organizing, and the rest will come, never fear it. And there is one thing more that is wanted, which is funds—funds are wanted. Without funds, the organization is of little use. The country is beginning to do its duty nobly, and that is a great test of public feeling. But mark you, suppose that it was true, as we heard last night, that the fighting had begun in Dublin—suppose that it is true, as we heard last night, that Government has ordered the daily papers not to say one word of insurrectionary news from Dublin, so that this country is kept in the dark about it—suppose that it should be necessary that we should send a man over to see with his awn eyes, and to hear with his own ears, and thus breathe defiance to the lying press. Suppose that this should be all neces<lb/>sary, and suppose that we have not got the money to send that man over, see What danger the movement runs; see how the movement might be thrown back and injured, from the mere consequence of not having a few paltry pounds wherewith to pay a messenger, a trusty messenger, to ratify the bond</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030114"/>
               <p>of union between the English and the Irish people. Union, I say, of senti<lb/>ment—union of democracy, but separation from a yoke which binds the one nation in the thraldom of the other. I sav you must excuse me, if I do not: address you at great length, as I am about to start to-night bv the mail-train. Rest assured that I will be struggling in your cause in Bradford, in Halifax, in Manchester, and in the other places where storm and turbulence is now going on. Rest assured that I shall not preach a miserable <hi rend="italic">namby pamby</hi> doctrine of non-resistance and passive obedience; but at the same time I shall preach a doctrine of manly firmness, and of no hot—headed impetuositv. But if you mean to do a thing, see well first if you have the power to do it; and then, having made up vour minds, do not let even death itself prevent you from carrying it into effect. I shall be able to send you" good news <hi rend="italic">one</hi> way or the other. Good news from the north, from Yorkshire, and from Lancashire, namely, the news will be that we have got such an organization spreading there—the news will be that there is such a spirit spreading there, that success must be the certain result. Recollect one thing, gentlemen; part of the West Riding has got the true spirit in its heart, but two great towns stand like an incubus upon the West Riding, namely, Leeds and Sheffield, which are torpid and apathetic. My duty will be to endeavour to get Leeds and Sheffield up to that mark to which Bradford and Halifax are now. I believe that the feeling of the men of Leeds is the true feeling in reality; but men have been preaching among them for a long time an unconditional peace doc<lb/>trine. Those men are mistaken men; for though I talk not now of insurrec<lb/>tion, I say this as to a peace doctrine, there shall be no peace in the country as long as I for one humble individual can prevent it, until the poor man has his rights, and until the rich man has brought his nose to the grindstone. They are trying to sow dissension and mistrust between you and those men whom you have honoured with the advocacy of your cause. The <hi rend="italic">Dispatch</hi> tells you that the mantle of Oliver and Cashes "—(in my original notes I hare <hi rend="italic">got</hi> it "Oliver Cromwell," but I was <hi rend="italic">corrected</hi> by the defendant before the Magi<lb/>strate, and he changed it to "Oliver and Castles ")—" has descended on my shoulders, and it tells you that I was a Tory ten years ago. It lies. I fought three times for those principles which I uphold now, and I can give. the <hi rend="italic">Dispatch</hi> a proof, if it requires it, that J bear one of the bayonet wounds of the King of Hanover's soldiers about mv person at the present moment. Well, again, there is Cobden, who tells you that demagogues are going about, disturbing and breaking into the middle-class movement; and he says in his letter to the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, that the individuals who go about disturbing those meetings, have got the wages of despotism in their pockets. Ask Mr. Cobden where are the 70, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that were given to him? Ask him where did he get them from, and what did he get them for? and tell him, at least, that the wages of despotism are in his pocket, if he dares to accuse honester men than himself of having the wages of despotism in their pockets. And again, when Cobden the other night challenged the Chartist myrmidons, as he called them, with daring to confront him, why did he, when at the London Tavern, not get up on that platform, instead of sneaking among the reporters as he did <hi rend="italic">I</hi> Recol<lb/>lect tin's that their game, their plan is this, to sow mistrust among the various branches <hi rend="italic">of our</hi> organization; to make you believe that if you help them, you will gain afterwards your result. But they cannot deny this, that if you help them they will gain their object. Now, why should your pupils—for you have taught them—why should they, your pupils, gain what they want at once, while you have been so many years struggling for and have not gained it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030115"/>
               <p>yet? No, my friends, stand by your own cause. They say they can prevent you from putting the wedge in the rotten phalanx of power. We are strong enough to split it up at one blow altogether, without waiting to put a middle-closs milk-sop wedge in. You will recollect the story of the farmer, whose field was overrun with thistles, and he wished to destroy the thistles; and what did he do? he cut off the tops of them, and the thistles spouted out more luxuriantly than ever. But there came another farmer, and that man was a Chartist; and what did he say? he said, dig them up by the roots. The middle classes are cutting the tops of the thistles, and they will sprout up more luxuriantly now with labour than ever. I want you to take the spade and the hoe to them, and to root up the noxious weed altogether. When you have once destroyed it, it never comes again. Organize—organize—organize! Dr. M'Douell will remain here amongst you; and on Whit-Monday come up in your classes, come up in your wards. Give them such a display as they sever had before. Give them at least another Kennington (but not on Ken<lb/>sington-common) meeting, at all events; show them your organization. I trust that much may be done between this and the 12th; and no doubt on the 12th your movement will make an advance again, the same as it did on the 10th April last; only a greater and a better advance. Now, my friends, I bid you farewell. My friend, Sharpe, wishes to say a few words to you on something particular. Now, that I am going off, shall I tell the men of Brad<lb/>ford—shall I tell the men of Halifax, who acted so gloriously and who acted so gallantly—shall I tell the men of Manchester, who made the piece-monger<lb/>ing [<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>] skip over a garden wall—shall I tell the men of York—shall I tell the men of Leeds—shall I tell the men of the West Riding—shall I tell them that London is determined to do its duty? Because, recollect, they are look<lb/>ing to the metropolis—they are looking to you. I verily believe that not a single blow need be struck for liberty in this country. I "believe that in Ireland it must be struck; and what is more, I believe in Ireland it will be struck. But whatever may be the consequence, organize—organize—organ<lb/>ize! and prepare for anything. Only preparation—only organization is wanted, and the green flag shall float over Downing-street and St. Stephen's. Only energy is wanted—only determination—and what will be the result? Why, that John Mitchell and Frost will be brought back, and Sir George Grey and Lord John Russell will be sent to change places with them."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what manner was this speech received by the meeting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was received with "hear, hear," and cheers, at various places which are marked, but I did not think it necessary to read them—he left immediately he had done speaking, and Sharpe again addressed a few words to the meeting—he said, "My friends, I shall not detain you at any length; as usual when this meet<lb/>ing is concluded, I intend to adjourn to the Prince Albert for the purpose of enrolling names, and as Mr. Jones has told you that you should organize, I exhort you likewise to do so, and we have the plans of organization at the Prince Albert, that you can have for a 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, so that all persons who are sincere, and who are desirous to carry out Chartism; if they will only ad<lb/>journ to the Prince Albert, they can have the plan of organization, and all those who in any locality want these plans can have them at half-a-crown per 100, and sell them at what price they like, and realize a profit to increase their funds. Only one remark more, and that is this, the Press has endeavoured to make the public believe that Chartism is dead; I would merely wish to state this—that Chartism is alive and kicking, and that ere long it will kick the damnable Whigs out of office; I adjourn to the Prince Albert, no pro<lb/>cession."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the course of the afternoon, while the meetings were being held, was there any minister of religion preaching there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was, but not within hearing of the Chartist meeting—he was on the same ground—he had a congregation round him—I thought it was the Chartist meeting when I first got there—he was under a tree in the open air—I conclude there would be praying and preaching—he was preaching when I got on the ground, and I was there from thirty-five to forty minutes before the Chartist meeting com<lb/>menced—he was preaching all that time—he continued to preach during the time of the meeting, but he lost a good number of his bearers—they came to hear something about the Charter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now during the whole time that the speaking was going forward, did the people behave themselves well, and peaceably, and orderly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I attended the Kennington-common meeting at which Mr. Jones spoke—I have not been at any others at which Jones has spoken—I have been at the out<lb/>door meetings—Mr. Jones endeavoured to keep the people off when they pressed on me—he stood close to the table, and I rather think he removed a man from the table in order that I should not be interrupted—there was every facility given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WELSBY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you attended the 10th April meeting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—Jones addressed the people there—he rruist have been aware on whose behalf I reported this meeting, because I was first of all at the National Convention, and afterwards at the Assembly every other day nearly, during the whole-time it sat, and there every delegate in the kingdom knew me—I do not know that Mr. Jones was aware that I came to report on behalf of the Government, but I of course conclude so, because we were so much to<lb/>gether at the Convention—there were four shorthand-writers there on alter<lb/>nate days, and he saw us there—I infer that he knew I came from the Government—I do not recollect that I have been a other meetings where he was present, but did not speak—he was a delegate—I know nothing about the Executive—I believe no Executive was appointed there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know he was a delegate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because everv delegate who came from the country brought credentials, and on the first occasion of meeting, the credentials of every delegate were read to the meeting—I did not set Mr. Jones's credentials, but I believe I heard them read—I know that no man was admitted there except as a member for the time being—if he came without his credentials he was not allowed to take any part in the meeting before they arrived, unless it was moved and seconded that he should be permitted to do so—Mr. Jones spoke repeatediv in the Convention—everybody spoke—they had five minute turns.</p>

On 30th June I went into the Clapham Union Work-Louse, at Wandsworth—I then had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and six sixpences, wrapped up in a rag, and a halfpenny loose, all in my trowser's pocket—it had been raised by my friends, to send me to Ireland—I went into a room at the workhouse where there were several persons—the four prisoners are some of them—I laid down in my clothes, and went to sleep—I awoke, and found Beard feel<lb/>ing my pocket—he then went and told the other people that I had some half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences; and a little while after that five or six of them attacked me—Beard and Davis were there; they are the only once I can speak to—I got away from them—the others did not take any part in it—they then made a second attack on me, ten or fifteen of them collected round me, <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the rug round my head, threw me down, and tore my money away from my side-pocket—I can only speak to Beard and Davis.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a short-hand writer. On the 5th June, about five minutes to eight o'clock in the evening, I attended to report a meeting at a place called Chartist-hall, Webber-street, Blackfriars-road—after I got there a chairman was appointed—about 200 persons were present then—they increased as the proceedings went on—I should say the greatest number present was be<lb/>tween 300 and 400—they were of the lower orders—I should say the majority were Irish—there were about half a dozen women—I took a short-hand note of the proceedings—I have it here—there were several speakers—the prisoner was one—he was announced by the chairman, as Mr. Looney, the Secretary of the Davis Club—he said, "Mr. Chairman and fellow-countrymen, I came down to-night from our Club, in consequence of Mr. Terry, and the other men who are here, informing us that they were about to open a Club in this neighbourhood, to organize the Irishmen and Englishmen of this locality, who are disposed for such organization, and to look for freedom. The chair<lb/>man has misinformed you when he introduced me to you as a speaker. I am not a speaker, but I am one who has a dreadful hostility to Lord John Rus<lb/>sell; and I will tell you more, I am one of his most practical opponents, I believe, at present in London. I go into every neighbourhood where Irish<lb/>men and Englishmen are to be found, and try to get them to become dissatis<lb/>fied with his Government; and I will tell you more, I advise them to get arms. And I came here specially to-night to propose a resolution to that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030128"/>
               <p>effect to this meeting, and I will read it to you:—' Resolved—That as God made man, and man made arms, and as it is the undoubted right of every man to possess arms, and know the use of them, and as the possession of them imparts a dignity and importance which none but the possessor knows or can appreciate, we think it right to advise all present to provide themselves with the same, as the best and surest means to repel a foreign foe, a mid<lb/>night burglar, or an armed myrmidon of any Government that chooses to set itself up as the oppressor of the people it governs, or the stifler of the public opinion honestly expressed.' But let me tell you that, before I go any further, I am decidedly for moral force"—(here there was some confusion among the audience.)—" My friends, do not misunderstand me. I am for moral force, as far as the force of persuasion goes, when it is adjudicated by justice; but I believe that the Government at present do not act in that manner, and that they are enabled to carry out their measures of injustice, because they have physical force at their hack to succour them. That is my opinion; and I will tell you how we will manage that. Let every man in this meeting, who thinks that is the fact, provide himself with a good pike; and now, particularly now, that the time is coming, when men will be called upon to act the parts of men, and no longer talk and blunder like so many wind-bags, and speak about rights and wrongs with you, and never tell you how you may redress them. New, I tell you how you may manage them. The surest way to avoid all fighting, and all battling, and all murder, is for every man in the country to arm himself; that is the way to manage it. Then there will be no fighting; the Government will see you are too strong, and the advocates of justice will have fair play wherever they are. Now, to be practical, I believe the Government of this country are the greatest traitors this country has got. I believe it is impossible for this state of things to exist much longer, and enable the working men to maintain themselves or their families. I believe it is impossible. All the world seems to heave at this moment for liberty and for justice to the working classes; and now the only man who effectually preached the true doctrine calculated to give the working man the means of living, this man is taken away by the horrible machinations of an unjust and pernicious law, and transported away from us. We have not his fellow. I believe he was the first man who preached and propounded that doctrine, (and I believe it is the only true doctrine,) which is calculated to save the lives of the people"—(a voice "Robert Emmett.")—" Emmett did his business in his day; but men have forgotten Emmett and the teaching of Emmett. Let us not in our day, after such a glorious example, forget the teaching of the master who has been sent away from us. For fourteen weeks he wrote and propounded beautiful doctrines. I would advise you all to adopt them, and to act upon them practically, and let each man go into his neighbourhood—let each man speak to his wife and children, and tell them of the—wrongs we are obliged to endure; and tell them of the millions of his countrymen who have been slaughtered, and when manufactures are at a standstill, and when the aristo<lb/>cracy are no longer able to trample on the rights of foreign nations; you will not be able to succeed in getting employment, unless the land is taken away from the robbers who have got it, and given to you. We must not be afraid of the Government. I tell you from this spot I am a republican in heart and soul! In my own Club this is our night of meeting; I shall not therefore inflict any more of my remarks on you, for there are othi-r men who have come here to speak to you; but I tell you to be particular to do this:—Let every ten or twenty of you in the neighbourhood you live in, meet; and it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030129"/>
               <p>your means are very poor, and you cannot provide yourselves with guns or rifles, you can get pikes from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each; and, mind you, you can get pistols very cheap. I tell you, as one of your friends, not to misuse them: do not go about the streets. I am opposed at present to street works; I do not like to act such a part; I do not like to go into open-air meetings, or processions: but any fellow who is paid for cudgelling my head in, will find me stiff enough for him; and I can tell him that if he attempts to strike me, he should strike nobody else. Now this may perhaps be my position, or the position of some others who talk to you from time to time; but you" may not all be prepared for such an emergency; and therefore it is I would not advise you to go to these public demonstrations, and hold public meetings, and stand with your hands in your pockets, whilst a policeman comes up with his bludgeon, and knocks you down. They have said in that thing called the House of Lords, that these demonstrations are very bad—that they are very dangerous, for they are a rendezvous for pickpockets. Then I say, let us have no meetings of pickpockets; let the people all adopt this resolution, and we will go to the House of Lords, and we will discard them first: they are pickpockets by wholesale, and not the poor wretch who is driven by hunger and desperation to take a loaf! If you were to go over the list, it would appear the most preposterous thing in the world that the people of this coun<lb/>try have been subjected so long to such horrible tyranny, as to be obliged to pay them pensions. I will tell you what you must do: your lesson must be the first principles of justice, to enable you to carry out these things. Go home into your neighbourhoods to-night; do not come to these meetings again until you have taken care to make that proper preparation which you will be called upon to make: and you Irishmen that are here, the harvest that is growing in your country shall never leave it till every man has had plenty of food What must you have felt during the last famine-time, as you passed through the different streets, and as you passed through the different purlieus'—I will say the purlieus, and rat-holes that you were obliged to live in, in consequence of the circumstances in which you were placed. How far better would you be in your mountain homes. Oh my God! how I sigh to be at the foot of the mountain where I was born! In the middle of the plague I went there, because I hate to live in London; and every morning I almost curse my fate because I am content to live here. I say how much better for us all, and Englishmen too, would it be if we were obliged by the circumstances in which our country was placed, to remain at home, where plenty of food, and plenty of labour could be found, instead of coming here into the market to compete with Englishmen, and reduce their wages. Now you Irishmen who are disposed to stop this thing, again I say to you, go into your neighbourhoods, and talk, club tojether, love one another, have no drinking-. Do not follow any man you do not know: do not be led into. riot, disorder, or destruction, by any parties you do not know, or are not acquainted with: destroy no man's property: do not, as the blackguard press of England would fain have the public believe, do not be treacherous, nor permit any pilfering to go on anywhere, to tarnish our movement: and if you see any man do a base or cowardly act, stop him, lay hold of him, because he is an enemy to our common cause. But I will tell you what we shall do. Our people at home this year will, my life upon it, keep the food that is there, until every Irishman has got sufficient to eat. There shall be no more-famines: and then if the myrmidons of the English Government dare to hew them down, by heavens we will be there to help! The press of England, the thunderer, the ruffian <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, says, 'Oh, '—what does it call the Confederates?</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030130"/>
               <p>some horrible name, some 'hireling crew!' (a voice, do not dirty your mouth;')—at nil events i: says we are mean hirelings. That is a lie No man who opens his mouth receives a penny of reward; every man pays his own expenses, and he goes everywhere, impelled by nothing but the motive of pure and honest and high-minded patriotism, and to be enabled, if he can to erase the stain which has been placed upon his country by the acts of his countrymen during the last year or two; who have stood by and seen millions of the people hewed down by famine and death! It requires a great effort on our part to restore our country to the position of human nature, because I feel we have fallen far below it; then I say be ready in these times; do not be misled; do not help any plunderer; do not call say great open-air meetings, because they are not necessary; but go wherever ten, or twenty, or fifty of you can meet together; club together, take in the news, read the papers together, know what is going on, inform your minds, and keep yourselves ready for everything; it is a glorious thing, if the times require it, for men to stand up and die for their country; and when the time comes, let me tell you, Englishmen and Irishmen, that if the Government of England do not give the country to which I belong justice, when we are in the position which we will be before three months more, when we are in that position, we will demand justice; and if they do not give it, we will take it; and then Irishmen, as I said before, Irishmen will have a duty to perform, and I hope you will perform that duty nobly; your English friends, the English Chartists, are standing by your side; their cause is a holy cause, it is the cause of truth, and no matter what paltry efforts may be made to try and tarnish it, it will outlive all its enemies, and become the universal law; Irishmen, wherever you meet Englishmen and Scotchmen, be kind to them, they have been kind to me; I have worked with Englishmen five or six years since I have been living here, and I find them very kind to me; I say then let us be very kind to them; let us respect them, and love them, and love one another; our cause is their cause, and the press, and the oligarchy of this country have ever tried to poison our minds against them, and their minds against us; let us do our business then in spite of the vile press, and their hirelings; and though I am speaking in the presence of a great number of printers, I believe I am stating what is as nearly true as possible; there is as base a press in London as ever existed anywhere; I shall now trouble you no more; but I propose this resolution to you, that you should all provide yourselves with arms of some kind; and if you will all fraternize one with another, make your proper inquiries, and you will be sure of the way to every thing, and every thing will come quite <hi rend="italic">aisy</hi> to you."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that resolution seconded by a person named Rooney? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I believe Looney was still present—Rooney got up immediately, and he had finished his speech before a person could get out of the room—he said: "I feel great pleasure in seconding this resolution; and it would be super<lb/>fluous for me to add anything to what Mr. <hi rend="italic">Looney</hi> has said; I will only tell you this much—I will tell you that any of you who are for this reso<lb/>lution, should show it by being sharp and decisive—sharp in the time you take to get arms, and sharp in the time you take to learn how to use them; and be decisive when the day enmes for us to strike the blow."</p>

               <p>Repeal meeting—I should say the greater part of the meeting were Irish—there were some Englishmen—it was a public meeting—I did not announce the object for which I went—I went for more reasons than one—I was seen taking notes—every facility was afforded me, no obstruction was offered me; I was treated with respect—after Looney had finished speaking, he sat down, and if he had only sat for two minutes he must have been present during Rooney's short speech—he did not walk out of the meeting without sitting down—I positively swear he sat down, and that he was present when the resolution was seconded—Mr. Doogood, a gentleman from Messrs. Gurney's establishment, and my clerk were with me—we went specially to report the meeting—I saw no disturbance, tumult, or riot—as to tumult, I must add that at the strong parts of the speech there was very loud applause—I call that tumult, when it is very loud indeed, excessive—I have taken notes at the House of Commons, as a short-hand writer—I have heard similar tumult there—by tumult I mean applause.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Knight's-buildings, Bermondsey. In 1842 I was convicted of felony, and sentenced to ten years' transportation—I underwent an imprisonment, and five years were remitted—I have known Stevenson a great many years—I met him about last Feb.—he said trade was getting very bad (he was a leather-cutter); he intended to sell his stock-in-trade, and he would work on my judgment with his money—I was in the horsehair and glue-piece trade—I collected horsehair for the manufacturers; that has nothing to do with leather—I began the business with Stevenson—I went into Kent with him some time in March—the last trip I had with him was in April, to Thaxtead—he said he wished to return to town, as he expected a man to call with some butts—we came to town, and went to his house—we saw his wife—he asked her if any person had been inquiring for him—she said no person had been, with the exception of the man with the butts, and she wished he would have nothing to do with these infernal butts—she further said that she wished, when he went in the country again, he would not leave her without money, and he had sent the man to her for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to pay for the horse and cart—she was then speaking of the same transaction—Stevenson and I then went into the kitchen—he looked at the butts, and said, "My wife says they are rather inferior, but I think they are very good"—I did not count them, but there were two bundles rolled up—I believe there are generally five butts in a bundle—these bundles were about the usual size—Stevenson said he was sure there would be a <hi rend="italic">blow</hi> about these butts some time or another; but he could not see how it could possibly be found out until they took stock, in consequence of the foreman and the car<lb/>man being concerned in the affair—he further stated that they came from a large firm in Weston-street—next morning we went to Maidstone—I went with him to carry some bags to the steam-boat, and he said to me, "I wish you would call on Mr. Lay land, as you are going over the water, and tell. him I have got ten 35lbs. butts for him, and I want 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for them"—I went to Mr. Layland's, in Shoreditch—I did not see him; I saw his man in the shop, and a female—I delivered the message to the wife—Ste<lb/>venson returned to town after that, and I told him I had called on Mr. Lay<lb/>land, and he said he was a buyer, if they were cheap—Stevenson hired a cart on the morning after he returned, to fetch the goods from the railway station which he had bought at Maidstone—I went with him to fetch them away, and about two o'clock that day the butts which I had seen in the kitchen were loaded in the cart by Stevenson and myself, and taken away to Mr. Layland's—the butts were there unloaded and taken into the shop—on our return from Mr. Layland's, Mr. Stevenson said he had done very well out of these butts; that he gave 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sold them at 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; but he must have an invoice</p>

               <p>made out at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he emptied his pockets into his wife's lap—she counted the money, and there was 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—on the same evening I saw "Walker in the shop I was in the parlour—there was a partition between us, and a glass window in the door—Stevenson's wife was in the parlour with me, and Ste<lb/>venson came and opened the door, and asked her for some money—she said, "How much?"—he said, "Give me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or rather 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—previous to that, he had asked for a pen and ink, and I saw him writing while Walker was in the shop—his wife went up stairs and fetched the money, and gave it him—Stevenson and Walker then went to the Cottage of Content—I stopped at Stevenson's till the time to go home, and then went to the Cottage of Content—I saw Stevenson and Walker there drinking ale—this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is my writing—I wrote it on Saturday, the day after I saw Stevenson and Walker together—I did not post it then, in consequence of not knowing who to send it to—I posted it on the Tuesday after these goods were sold on the Friday—the post-mark is on it now, April 11—I was at Stevenson's that day—I saw Mr. Layland call there in the afternoon—he saw Stevenson in the shop—after he was gone Stevenson said to his wife, "There has been a <hi rend="italic">blow</hi> about these butts; Mr. Mortimer, the foreman, has been over to Mr. Layland"—his wife said, "I thought they did not belong to Mr. Mortimer"—he said, "No more they do; they belong to Mr. Brooksbank"—about the same time, nest afternoon, Mr. Wilks called, and Stevenson went in the shop and spoke to him—I did not hear the conversation, but after Mr. Wilks was gone Stevenson came to the parlour door, and said there certainly was a <hi rend="italic">blow</hi> about these butts—Mr. Wilks returned with Mr. Brooksbank and a police<lb/>man, and while they were there I saw Stevenson take a file of bills down, take one bill off, and lay it on the counter—he then came to the parlour, put his hat and coat on, and went away with them—next morning I was at Ste<lb/>venson's, and saw Mrs. Walker there—on the Saturday afternoon following I was there again, and Stevenson returned home—he had in the interval been in custody on this charge, and had been bailed—he did not say anything to me on that day, but next Monday he said he had seen Walker, and had given him into custody boldly, considering it would make his case look better—on the same day I saw Stevenson take-down the file of bills—he took two or three bills, brought them into the parlour, tore them up, and put them into the fire—he said to his wife, "These are the bills of the other butts "—I have seen Mrs. Walker, on other occasions, at. Stevenson's—she was there mostly every day during the time that Walker—was in Horseraonger-lane—I saw her there once when Stevenson was there, and she told him she had seen her husband, and he intended to stick to the same tale; that was said while Walker was in custody—I heard Mrs. Walker speak repeatedly, day after day, to Stevenson—she said her husband did not see that there was any utility in bringing the other man into the affair, because in the event of his being in prison they would assist in supporting him.</p>

               <p>why did he give anybody into custody, for fear they should tell some<lb/>thing about him—Stevenson said he had found out Walker, and had taken the officer to him—I stood almost like a post on those occasion—I heard, but I did not utter a word—they did not talk to me—I was continually in the place—they did not tell me to turn out—I most likely must have made some answers—I cannot say what remarks I made—I gave no advice—what I was transported about, was a little wearing apparel—I was tried in the other Court, I think before Judge Gurney—I had never been in custody before; I was with another man, who had been in trouble once or twice—the wearing apparel was in the passage of a private house, in Bermondsey—the door was open—the young man that was with me got the clothes—I was inside—I cannot tell what the clothes were—I was in the hair and glue piece trade—the glue pieces come from the same hide that the butts do—a man may be a judge of glue pieces, and not of butts—I did not buy any glue pieces while I was with Mr. Stevenson—I bought horse-hair—I took him about to horse-hair places, and collected it—my name is James Crowe—I signed the letter, "A Well-wisher to Honesty"—I considered I ought to be a well-wisher to honesty, after what I have suffered—I have been honest ever since I was transported, to the best of my knowledge—I have not been in trouble since—I know a man named Matthews, a publican, in Bermondsey—he never made a charge against me, for having a pewter-pot of his, and never suspected me of anything to my knowledge—I never heard him say that he took a pewter-pot out of my hat—I never heard a word of such a charge till now—the reason I wrote the letter was, I considered I stood in very great danger—I gave no evidence myself till I found the case was not strong enough, then I came forward; when Mr. Stevenson said she hoped her husband would have nothing to do with these infernal butts, I did not remonstrate with him about the danger he was in<lb/>curring—I did not know Walker—I had never seen him at Mr. Stevenson's before that time.</p>
