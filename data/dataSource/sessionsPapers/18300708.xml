            . In February last I was in the House of Correction, Cold Bath-fields - about the 17th or 18th of that month, I was in the same yard with the two prisoners; I had known Nash for some time - he said he knew of a good job, and asked if I had a mind to be in it; I asked what it was - he said the poor's boxes at St. Bartholomew's-hospital were closed all the year round, and if I had a mind, when my time was out, we would go and crack them, and take the money out that was in them; we had some further conversation in the course of the day, and he asked what time I went out - I said about the 12th of May: he said that would not do, it was too late, for the treasurer or steward went round about that time, and took the money out; but he said that was no matter, as there was another place we could do, and that was old Wilby's offices - he said he knew there was always plenty of blunt in those offices; they are in the hospital: he said we must get in early in the evening, before the gates were shut, and slow ourselves away in a cellar, where they were in the habit of putting old beds or bedsteads; I said I could say nothing at all about it, as such jobs were quite out of my line, and I would rather not have any thing to do with it; I got out on Wednesday, the 12th of May, and on the Saturday following I saw Nash in Smithfield - he asked if I had thought any more about the hospital; I said No: he said he should like to give them another turn - he renewed the conversation, and I said I did not like to give a chance away of being found in the hospital at night; he said there was a chance we could do in the day time, the steward's office; he said he knew Mr. Wix was in the habit of receiving 70l. or 80l. every Friday morning, to pay the sisters and nurses, and the different tradespeople, and putting it into his desk or drawer, and then leaving his office to go round to ring a bell at each of the three wings in the hospital - he said he himself had received money frequently of the steward, and he knew where the desk was and while he went round we should have plenty of time to go and do the robbery - he said, "Do the robbery;" I said if I was in it I would not go in and do it myself - he said he did not require that, as he had a person who would do it; I told him I would be in it on that understanding - he said he had got a person who would do it, and he and I were to look out the while - I saw him again on the Sunday morning, but nothing particular transpirted. We met there again on Monday morning; Hurley and another man were with him - I had known Hurley about three months previous to my going to prison; they were in deep conversation that Monday morning - Hurley said he had not time to stop then, but he would meet us at ten o'clock the next morning at the same place, or if he failed to meet us we were to go to the White Lion, in Rosemary-lane, and he would wait there for us in the afternoon, but did not say at what particular hour - Nash and I met there, but Hurley did not come; we went to the White Lion in the afternoon - Hurley and the other man were there; we had some conversation by the pump in Leman-street about this same robbery- I saw Herdsfield on the Thursday morning following, and gave him information that the robbery was intended to take place, but the time was not then settled; all I did afterwards was by direction of him or the gentleman; he told me to go and tell the gentlemen of the hospital - I went and saw Mr. Wilby and Mr. Wix; they told me to call in again in the course of the day - I called, and saw the treasurer and some other gentlemen: the officer was then present and some other gentlemen - I told them the robbery was intended to take place; I acted by their direction - I after that continued to meet the prisoners; I saw Nash. Horley, and the other man on the following Tuesday - we had another long talk by the pump in Leman-street, and it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080004"/>then agreed that the steward's office should be robbed on the following Friday, in the day time, and when the noise occasioned by that was quiet we were to rob the Renter's office in the night, and then make our escape through a window; it was arranged that on Friday morning Hurley and the other man were to commit the robbery, and Nash and I were to look out - I saw Nash again on Thursday evening, in Smithfield; he said he had seen Hurley, and that Hurley's partner had got taken, and was sent to the House of Correction for three months, for something he had been doing, and we must do the robbery our three selves -Hurley told me he wished Nash would call him in the morning; Nash said he had bad shoes, and wished me to call him - I told him I would go down; I went the next morning, and called Hurley at half-past six o'clock - that was on the Friday morning; Hurley came down, and asked what time it was - I told him, and he said it was too soon, and I had better stop and have some breakfast; I said No, we would get to Smithfield and see Nash - Hurley went up stairs again, and when he came down we went to Smithfield, but Nash was not there; we staid there some time, and then Hurley proposed we should go back to Rosemary-lane - Hurley went to a Jew's, and borrowed a crow-bar: I was present; we then started a second time for Smithfield - I missed Hurley in Rosemary-lane: I went on to Smithfield by myself, and Nash was there, sitting on the rails of the sheep pens - he asked me where Hurley was; I said I had missed him: in a short time Hurley came through the hospital, with a cigar in his mouth - it was then half-past nine o'clock; we all three went to the Queen's Head and French Horn in Duke-street, Smithfield - an altercation there took place between me and Nash as to the stations we were to take, to look out - Nash wanted to look towards the square of the hospital, and I towards Smithfield; Hurley jumped up, and said,"D - n it, I will do it myself;" we went on to Smithfield, and missed Hurley all on a sudden - Nash and I walked on to the middle gate of the hospital; the clock was striking ten, and I saw Mr. Wix go from his office towards the square, as if he had just left his office - I waited some short time, and not seeing Hurley I went towards the steward's office to see if I could see anything of him; I met him coming running down the steps from the steward's office, with his left hand on his hip - he said, "Come along, I have done it;" he ran out of the hospital - Nash and I followed him across Smithfield into Long-lane, and through a court into Cloth-fair; Hurley there put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a note, with some sovereigns and silver rolled up in it - we then walked into Aldersgate-street, on our way towards Old-street, to a public-house we had agreed to go to, to share what we had got from the hospital; I told Hurley he had better give me a shilling, and I would get a pint of ale, and see if any person was following us - he took out the same note with the money in it, and gave me a shilling from it; I said that that I might go back and tell the officer - I went into a public-house, and saw the two prisoners running on; I then went and told Herdsfield, his brother, and another officer - they desired me to go on to Old-street; when I got there the publican told me there had been some one there for me, and left a message for me to go down to their place - I went with the three officers to Hurley's house; they told me to go in, and they would follow me in a minute or so - I went to Hurley's, in a court in Rosemary-lane; I went into a room, and found Hurley, Nash, and a woman Hurley lived with - Nash had a pale red money bag in his hand, holding it over a candle, and he gave it to the woman to take down stairs to destroy it; she went down, and Nash said they had sold a 5l. note for 4l., and two pieces of coin for a shilling; Hurley was just beginning to share out the money, when the officers came up and took us. I was examined on this charge before the Alderman - he demanded sureties for my appearance, but I thought I would rather be in prison.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.What! rather be in prison? A. I thought I had better be there - the conversation was in February; we were all in the yard of the prison - there might be ninety persons or more there; I do not know that any other prisoner heard us - I think they did not; Nash and I were walking up and down the yard by our two selves - though there were so many prisoners there were plenty of opportunities of speaking; Hurley was somewhere about the yard- I never knew he was to do any thing in the robbery till I saw him in Smithfield; I had been committed to the House of Correction under the Vagrant Act; I was never committed under the Vagrant Act before - this robbery was not in my line; I am in a general line - I am a gardener by profession, but I have left that four or five years; I have never been a carter, or a farmer's servant, or a butcher - I wear a frock because it suits me; I have been in the habit of supplying the faculty with subjects, in other words a resurrectionist - I have been employed these five years in that way; I live with my mother - she does not support me; we had credit at a chandler's shop - I have been in trouble four or five times within the last ten years; I got into trouble first when I was seventeen - I shall be twenty-seven next month; I do not know whether I have been twice five times in trouble - I say five at a risk; I have been to sea - I did not see any large hand-bills about me; there never were such - I went to sea in 1825 or 1826, and returned the following year; I went as poulterer on board an Indiaman - I did not go a second voyage, because I did not like it; I then returned to the other trade - I did not like this job, but I did join for the purpose of giving the hospital information; I thought of seeing the officer first -I first determined to tell the hospital people when Nash was importuning me in Smithfield, but before that I had said I would join in it if I did not go in; I told Herdsfield of it -I had known him before, but I never had any thing to do with him; I believe he is a friend of mine, the same as he is of every other man - he knew what I was; he told me to make the hospital people acquainted with it - he did not know it was to be on Friday; I saw the hospital people twice - they told me to look in again, and the second time Herdsfield was with them; I saw him two or three times afterwards - I told him I had informed the people of the hospital of it; he did know from my information that the robbery was to take place on Friday -Nash sat on the rails at the time, and I went on towards the steward's office, and met Hurley coming down the steps; I knew where Nash was waiting - we had missed 
               <persName id="t18300708-1-person119">Hurley</persName>
             all on the sudden, and the first I saw of him after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080005"/>wards was when he was coming down the steps; I cannot tell whether any one but myself saw him - upon my oath I did not go in myself and take the money; that is as true as all I have said to-day - Crawley is the landlord of the Queen's Head; he is not here, nor the Jew who lent the crow-bar, that I know of; I have not seen him since - I know the house he went into; I do not know the name of the street - I have been at Winchester; I was in trouble there in 1824 or 1825 - that was for "exhumation;" I was in six months for that, and four months for the fine - my occupation has been providing subjects for the faculty, and one year I went to sea; I have been the last three months in prison.</p>
               <p>Nash. What he has said is all false.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Are not people usually safer in prison than out of it? A. Yes, if they give information, and I have been threatened; when the first communication was made to me there were ninety persons in the yard - there was not much opportunity of speaking but at meals; I have never been in trouble for felony, but several times for obtaining dead bodies - once for obtaining money under false pretences, and as a vagrant, being found in the burial ground at Pentonville.</p>

In consequence of some information that Herdsfield gave me. I saw Sheering on the 20th of May - he made a communication to me of a robbery which was likely to happen; I do not think I saw him again on the same subject, but I saw him twice on the 20th of May, and the second time Herdsfield was present - we heard what Sheering had to say, and then sent for Herdsfield, but I was not present long then, I merely went into the room; it was my custom to pay the sisters and nurses on Fridays, and on Friday, the 28th of May, I left my office locked or latched - the fastening of the latch was broken off, and I lost the money I had left there; I had taken very particular notice what money I left behind me, expecting that something was to happen - I left 17l. 4s., a half-france, and a canvas bag; there were two 5l. Bank of England notes, Nos. 38,011 and 38,012 - 3l. 2s. 6d. in silver, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences, three sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns; there was a George II. shilling, a George III. sixpence, and a half franc of 1818, which I had from Mr. Wilby, the renter; when I came back the latch of the door was forced, the door was forced, the drawer was broken, and the bag and money gone - Nash had been in the hospital, and knew the place very well indeed; he was there to assist in carrying coals - the two Herdsfields were placed in the hospital, but I do not know exactly where; I did not go any where in search of the prisoners - I have seen a half-franc very similar to the one I left in my office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you seen Herdsfield on he day of the robbery, before the robbery? A.No, I did not - I swear I had not; there are a great many servants employed there - I locked my drawer myself, and closed the door; my office communicates internally with the renter's house, but the outer door was broken - no one was present to see me deposit the money there; I had not shown the money to the officer before I put it there - I marked the shilling and sixpence I have spoken of; I did not think of apprising any officer that I expected a robbery would be committed - I do not know whether any of the gentlemen who directed the proceedings of the officers are here to-day; I was not there when the robbery was committed - I did not keep in view to see the robbery; I could have done so if I had chosen -I had not left the building; I was not present at the time of the alarm of the robbery - I returned in ten minutes, and saw the officers.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q.Where did you see the officers? A. By the renter's office door, in the yard; I told them the door was broken - I do not know that there is a place from which persons could have seen that door, and they themselves have been concealed, except in a little closet in my own office: I know Mr. Wilby, our treasurer, and our legal adviser were present when I went with Herdsfield; Mr. Wilby was steward before me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the nature of the communication between your office and the hospital? A. It is with the receivers house - I cannot say whether that communication was fastened that morning; I certainly did not fasten that door myself.</p>

             attended, and his brother I believe. On the morning of the 28th of May I delivered some money to Mr. Wix, as I did every Friday: I delivered to him that day 18l., and a half-franc of 1818 - there were two 5l. notes, and the rest in cash: I took the numbers of the notes - they were 38011, and 38012, both dated March 20, 1830, and the rest was in gold and silver; I took the date of the half-franc - it was a half-franc of Napoleon; I have seen it since - I believe it to be the same: it was marked "Napoleon Empereur," and on the reverse "Demi franc Republique Francois;" there is a communication between the steward's office and my house; I am in the habit of going through it frequently - it goes into the hall; I cannot say whether it had been opened that morning or not - the officers were placed in the passage leading to my office: I was there - no one could go through my house to Mr. Wix's office without their seeing them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You took very great care to make a note of these particular coins, that the whole proceeding should be well managed? A. Yes - I remained there to see the thieves taken, if they had the boldness to come; I did not see them taken - I did not place myself any where to see them: I left the officers to do their duty - I did not tell the officers it was to take place at twelve o'clock; I understood it was to be at ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080006"/>- he might say from ten to twelve o'clock, but I understood it was to be at ten - I have seen Sheering, but I do not know that I could speak positively to his person; the entry was made at the door of the steward's office - I do not know where the key of that door was; I do not know whether Mr. Wix was stationed there - there is a latch-lock and a key-hole - I really do not know whether I could hear the movements of any person in that office by putting my ear to that key-hole; I never tried it - if I were in my room, and men were to come into that office, I think I should hear them; the hall of my house is on the other side of that office - there is a door communicating with it; if I were at that door, and a man was to break open the other door I think I might hear it, but a man might open the latch without my hearing him - I cannot tell whether I might hear him; it is a very large room - if I were listening I might.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you see the door of this office? A. No; the pier of the arcade was between us, but I heard it hang too - I had no opportunity of seeing the party who came from that place.</p>
               <p>CHARLES HERSDFIELD re-examined. I was in this witness' room on this Friday morning, with my brother; I could not see the door of the steward's room, nor hear the breaking in - I saw Sheering three or four or five minutes after ten o'clock - he had informed me before that the robbery would take place about ten; I and my brother went with him, in consequence of what he said, to a public-house in Old-street, to apprhend the two prisoners at the bar, but we did not find them - we then went to Mill-yard, Rosemary-lane; Sheering was with us; he went up stairs to where the two prisoners were - my brother went up first, and I went up in about a minute; when I went up I saw Hurley sitting near a deal table, I believe, smoking a cigar - there were some sovereigns and some silver on the table; my brother had got hold of him - he said to me, "You take him, and I will take up the money;" I found nothing on him - I cannot say what money was on the table; my brother took it - I believe nothing was said to either of the prisoners, in my hearing; Nash was there - I did not take him: it was a small room - there was a bit of a bedstead there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You were placed in the room to notice what was going on? A. Yes - I supposed I should be able to notice it, but I could not see who went in: I think the name of the people at the public-house in Old-street is Parsley - I will not be certain; I believe it was on the 20th or 22nd that Sheering first told me of this - he was not in custody at the time; I was coming through the archway, and met him - I have seen him about here; he came to me, and said, "There is going to be a robbery;" I said, "You had better see the gentlemen;" when we went to the place where the prisoners were found, Sheering went up first - he turned into the door, and when I went up stairs he was in the room; I and my brother did not go in first, because we wanted to ascertain whether they had had sufficient time to get there- if they had not been there we should have waited; we should not have been able to have got a strange man to have gone up - they would say, "I am not an officer;" I did not think they had time to get there as we had a coach.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you find any crow-bar? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Perhaps you would not have been where you were if you had chosen your place? A.No; we sent Sheering up first - we could not, with any hope of success, have gone up first; we should have had the place all in an uproar - if they had not been there they would never have come there; if they had not been there Sheering was to have come down directly.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HERDSFIELD. On the 28th of May I was stationed with my brother in St. Bartholomew's-hospital - I did not see Mr. Wix go out of the door of his office, but I saw him go from that way; I went to Old-street with my brother and Roe - we did not find them there; I then went on to Mill-yard, into a room on the second floor - I saw the two prisoners and Sheering; Hurley was sitting with his left arm on a table, and on the table was this money, which I here produce - it has been in my possession ever since; here is a French coin, which had been shown to me in the morning, before; there was a candle on the table, but it was not burning - while I was stationed in the hospital I saw Hurley come from Bartholomew-square to go towards the door of the office; in two or three minutes he came from towards the door, going into Smithfield, and I saw him put his left hand to the side of his pocket - I saw no more of him till I saw him in the room; the money found there is three sovereigns, one half-sovereign, nine half-crowns, twenty-three shillings, seven sixpences, one half-fram, and 3d. in copper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You had heard of this intended robbery? A. Yes - I swear I saw Hurley: his name had not been mentioned to me by my informant, nor by any one - my brother did not tell it me: when I saw him pass near the steward's office I did not take him, because I expected more to be there - I said, "I think that is one of them."</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. That is a public place? A. Yes -I could not have seized him instantly: I had to go round several yards.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You have stated you said you thought that was the man? A. I said so to Mr. Wix - I followed him within five minutes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you keep your eyes upon him? A. No: I saw no more of him till I saw him in Mill-yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you go up first or your brother? A. I did, with Roe - Sheering was in the room.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you know Hurley again when you saw him in Mill-yard? A. I did.</p>

I joined the two officers in pursuit of these prisoners - I was applied to here, at the Old Bailey Session, a little after ten o'clock; I did not go into any house in Old-street-road - I believe Sheering went; I went on to Rosemary-lane, and to a court - I do not know the name of it; I went up into the room after Sheering -I saw the two prisoners and Sheering - it was a middling sized room; there was a bed in it, and a table - as I went in the table was on the left-hand side of the room: Hurley was sitting on the left-hand side of the table, with his elbow on the table, and Nash was on the opposite side - Sheering was on the bed; I took Nash - I did not take notice of any thing that was said to him: this money was on the table.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM GLYDE. I am a porter at St. Bartholomew's-hospital.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you keep the whole house? A. Yes - I pay the rent; a cousin lodges with me - he pays rent to me, and not to the landlord; I am a <rs id="t18300708-3-viclabel19" type="occupation">dealer in cattle</rs>

               <p>EDWARD LOW. I am the prosecutor's cousin, and lodged with him; I had some things there. I left London on the 1st of May, and returned to the house on the 16th; I missed a top coat, a silk handkerchief, two snuff boxes, a pair of gloves, and a bracelet - I saw my property on the following Wednesday at the office; I had seen it safe the morning I left - they were locked up; the top coat was in a drawer in the front bed-room, and the rest in a chest in the back bed-room - the drawers and chest had been opened when I returned.</p>
               <p>FRANCES LOW. I am the prosecutor's sister, and lodge opposite his house. I recollect his going away in May - he left the house shut up: I went over to his house about half-past eight o'clock that evening - the house was quite safe then; I had the key - I locked the door, and went home; I went over again with my two brothers, about nine or a quarter-past, as they were going to sleep there -I then observed the parlour door open, which I had locked a short time before; that is just by the street door - I opened the street door, and observed nothing wrong there; I had a candle with me - I heard somebody up stairs; it was two persons - I heard them open the front window, and saw the two prisoners jump out of that window - I was outside the house, against the paling; I called out for assistance - Mr. Adams came first: my brother William took hold of Cushway first, but let him go, and Adams took him; he ran after him, as he had got a few steps from the house - my brother Stephen followed Taylor; I did not know the prisoners before, but am certain Adams took one of the persons I saw jump out of the window - I saw Taylor in custody in about ten minutes; none of the outer doors or windows had been broken open - I am sure I left all secure at half-past eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you leave any body in the house when you first went? A. No; I went all over the house, and am certain I left nobody there - when I returned the outer doors were locked, as I had left them, and all appeared safe, till I heard the prisoners open the window; it was the top window the prisoners opened - there was no window opened before that; I am quite sure no window was left open - I do not know such a parish as St. Mary, in Hackney.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was dark? A.Just dusk - I had not time to go to the top of the house before I heard them; my sister did not go up stairs - she went back to the house after they were taken, to see what was lost; I saw the up stairs front window open after they jumped out.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN LOW. I went with my sister and brother, and saw both the prisoners jump out of window; my brother and I were round the paling, keeping them in the garden - Taylor said if we did not let them get over he would knock our brains out; they both got over - I caught hold of Taylor's coat: he turned round, and threw me down - I followed him round Russell-place, and did not lose sight of him before he was stopped by Turner.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ADAMS. I was present, secured Cushway, and delivered him to Wood, the constable, at Hackney watch-house.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM GLYNN. I live opposite Low. On the night in question I saw Cushway in Adams' custody - I also collared him, and on the road to the watch-house I saw him make a motion with his right hand, and throw something behind him across to the paling - it rattled very lond, and he said, "Mind what you are after, flinging stones here;" I did not see what it was he threw away - the palings are about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's house.</p>

            . I am constable of Hackney. I saw the prisoners in custody at the watch-house; I searched their persons, and found on Cushway four silk handkerchiefs, two snuff-boxes, a bracelet, half a crown, a shilling, a sixpence, and two or three halfpence; I have some skeleton-keys given me by Turner - I took some crowns, half-crowns, and shillings out of Taylor's pocket, and Dorset, in my presence, took from him a top coat and another coat- they each had two coats on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there more than one parish in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080009"/>Hackney? A. No; there are two churches, but it is all rated as St. John.</p>
               <p>JOHN LOW. These three handkerchiefs are mine, and are marked with my name; these other things are also mine.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LOW. This snuff-box, coats, and other things are mine - the value of the property I lost is about 25l.</p>
               <p>The prisoners made no Defence, but five witnesses deposed to Cushway's good character, and one to that of Taylor.</p>

On Wednesday, the 3rd of June, he had two calves and twelve geese; I secured the calves in the pen - they were all right at ten o'clock that night; the pen is at the end of the cowhouse - the geese were in a building which was formerly a stable; it is part of the premises - I saw them safe at eight o'clock, when I secured them there, as usual; I got up between five and six o'clock in the morning, and went to the pens immediately - the calves were gone, and the doors were open; I then went to the stable - that door was open, and only one goose left; I went and told master, then went to Dorward, the constable, who accompanied me to London that morning - we went to Leadenhall-market, and in consequence of information there, we went to Judson's, a butcher, in Whitechapel; I saw Adaman there, and in consequence of what passed I went to the house of the witness Banks, in Rosemary-lane - it was in the morning; I there saw the two calves dead, but their skins on - I knew them to be my master's, and the two I had lost; the skins are here (looking at them) - these are only the skins of the two bodies, the skins of the heads were so offensive we could not keep them - the heads were particularly spotted about the eyes, by which I knew them, and here are white marks down the back on these skins, by which I know them; the mark on the head was a particular one - I have not a doubt they were the heads of my master's calves - one was seven weeks old, and the other seven weeks and a few days; they corresponded in age, and one of the skins has a very particular mark - they were calved at our place. When I went to Banks' the prisoner was there, with the calves; I had known him before for seven or eight years, and have seen him passing the house three or four days running - Dorward took him into custody: something passed between me, Dorward, and Banks before that - after finding the calves Dorward went to look for the geese, and I saw eight of master's geese in a cart at Lambeth-street Office on the Friday: they are now at master's farm - I have no doubt of their being eight of what were stolen; one had been left behind, and when the eight came back they appeared to know each other; if you put geese to a strange one they will fight - they were not marked: I put them down in the farm-yard, they then came up to the back door where they were usually fed, and the one which had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080010"/>been left behind came and joined them - they appeared to recognise each other; I believe they formed eight of the eleven which were stolen - the calves were not exactly in a killing condition; they were worth about 7l.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. What are you? A. A bailiff; there are two other persons employed at the farm - it is my duty to look after the calves.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever see a brown calf without a white stripe down the back? A. Yes; I never saw one like this before - there are certainly others with white backs, but not as this is; I do not mean to say there never was one like it before - there were also marks on the head of a particular sort: the head was spotted round the eye very particularly - it is common for calves to be spotted.</p>
               <p>Q. The other skin is white, what do you know that by? A. The skin is dried up now, and I cannot explain it so well; I know it by these marks - I never saw another marked like this one; it is a very particular mark - I have had some hundreds of calves under my care, and never saw one that would answer this; I never saw one marked like it; I should know it from five hundred - I never knew the prisoner employed to take calves or poultry to market; he kept a cart, and I know he carried wood- I do not undertake to swear to the geese, but have no doubt of them; my master has no other Christian name.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you speak to the prisoner at Banks'? A. Yes - I said to Dorward, "That is Kirby;" Banks lives in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>DAVID DORWARD. I am constable of Chingford. On the morning of the 3rd of June I was spoken to, and went with Hawes to Leadenhall-market, after inquiring at different markets; I afterwards went to the house of Judson, in Whitechapel, and there saw Adaman - in consequence of what he told me I went to Banks', in Rosemary-lane, with Hawes and Adaman, and saw the two calves hanging up, with the skins partly off, as the butchers generally leave them when they are fresh killed; the prisoner and Banks were there - Hawes identified the calves, and recognised the prisoner; I said, "Halloo, countryman. who would have thought of seeing you here?" I live at Woodford, and had frequently seen him, but not for some time before this; he was very much agitated, and said, "I don't know you;" I knew that he did know me very well, and said, "You know me very well - you are my prisoner," and took him into custody; I found five of the geese next day at Leadenhall-market, in the possession of Howard, and two more were produced at Lambeth-street by Howard; I took the geese to Chingford, and put them down in the farm-yard - they appeared to recognise the one which was left, and that one seemed pleased and was cackling; they went under the gate together, into another yard, and then to the place where they are fed - I was present before the Magistrate when the prisoner was examined; I believe what he said was taken in writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Before you took him to the Magistrate, did he say any thing to you? A. He said he did not steal them - that he was engaged by two men to fetch them from Chingford; I asked who the men were - he said he did not know them at first; he afterwards said one was a bird-fancier - I have since ascertained who that is, and have been in pursuit of him, but cannot find him; he said that he went down with him, and another man, who he had very little knowledge of, was to meet him at Mr. Walton's; he said the bird-fancier had engaged him- that the bird-fancier and him met at the Two Brewers at Stratford; he went down to Walton's with the birdfancier, and met the other man, who had got the calves ready for them - that the bird-fancier and him carried them to the cart, which stood at a little distance from the house, in the lane; he said it was about two o'clock in the morning - he said that he engaged him to fetch them, and he did not steal them, for he was employed by them- he said he and the bird-fancier carried them from Mr. Walton's barn; I had not held out any threat or promise to him, but told him what he said to me would come against him as evidence - he lives at Hackney-wick, four or five miles from Chingford; I have seen him many times at Woodford, which is the adjoining parish to Chingford.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BANKS. I am a butcher, and live in Rosemary-lane. On Thursday morning, the 3rd of June, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Lime-street, Leadenhall-market, where they unload the meat-carts for the market - he had a cart with two calves, also two small hampers and one long one at the side; he called to me, "Butcher, will you buy two calves?" I told him no - I went over, looked at them, and asked what he wanted - he said either eight guineas, or 8l., I do not know which; I said No - he said, "Do you know any body who will kill them for me?" I asked whose they were - he said they were his own; he asked if I knew who would kill them for him - I said I would if he would take them down to my house; he asked where I lived - I said, "No. 64, Rosemary-lane;" he took them there - I was to have 10s. for killing them, and taking them to market the following morning; that is about a fair price - I went home directly; he was coming to my house, and I met him - he had the calves and three hampers with him - I helped him to take the calves out, and put them in my shop, which is in front of the main street - I untied their legs, and said, "Let them lay and rest themselves;" he said, "Put them backward in the back place" - (they could be seen where I put them in the shop, which was open, and the door off;) he drove them backwards himself, and we went over to the Hampshire Hog public-house, and had a glass of gin each; he said I was to kill them and get them done by four o'clock, and he would come back again - I said that should be done; he said they were to go to Mr. Brown's, Whitechapel-market, the following morning; he wanted me to purchase them several times - I said what I bought I always bought at market; we parted about half-past eight o'clock- Adaman, who was in Mr. Judson's service, came to my shop between eleven and twelve that day; I told him what had passed between me and the prisoner, and showed him the calves - between three and four o'clock that day he came with Hawes and Dorward; Hawes recognized the calves. which hung in the middle of my shop - he said, "They are my vmaster's calves, I will swear to them;" the prisoner was present, and was taken into custody; I never saw him before that morning, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure about the conversation you first had with him? A. Yes, quite;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080011"/>nobody else was with him - I am sure he did not say he was instructed to sell them, and get them killed; nobody came to inquire after the calves after he was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Is Salmon in your service? A. I employed him to kill them - my house is in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SALMON. I occasionally kill beast for Banks. On Thursday morning, the 3rd of June, I killed these two calves - the prisoner came in while I was killing them; he said they were his own, and that they were to go to market - I was to do them in the best manner I could.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ADAMAN. On Thursday, the 3rd of June, I was gathering money for Mr. Judson, who is a carcasebutcher; I went that day to Banks', who made a communication to me about the prisoner, and showed me the calves - Dorward and the bailiff came to me that afternoon; I accompanied them to Banks', and saw the two calves, which were then killed - they were alive in the morning; they appeared the same calves.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose there was no particular mark by which you could recognize them? A.There was no private mark, but I knew them from the colour of the skin.</p>

            . I am Howard's brother. I bought eight young geese of him on the 3rd of June for 3s. each - I sold one to a stranger that day, and on the Friday following Dorward came to me; I delivered him the seven immediately - they were the same as I bought of my brother; I had no others - the prisoner was present when I bought them, and said they belonged to him; I do not know whether Godfrey was present.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GODFREY. I saw the eight geese in Mr. Howard's brother's possession; they were eight of those I paid the prisoner for.</p>

I asked him if the geese belonged to him, and if they were going into the market - there was another young man with him, and they said they wanted to see a man named Godfrey; I cannot say which of them said so - I told them he was Mr. Howard's man, and I would look for him, but he might not be there for an hour - this was ten minutes or a quarter-past four o'clock, and a little before five I saw Godfrey coming down the street; I told him there were some things there for his master, and asked if I should pitch them - he said, "Yes, bring them up;" I did so, and Howard paid me for the porterage.</p>

I know the prisoner - his mother is a laundress, in master's employ; the prisoner brought the clothes home, and took others away to be washed. On Wednesday, the 2nd of June, I remember his coming with some clothes, which he delivered to me; there was a bill due to his mother - I desired him to wait for his money; I left him in the hall, and went down into the kitchen; the watch at that time hung on an image in the back parlour - he could not see it where I left him in the hall, but he came to the head of the stairs, and told me he was going a little further, and would call again; I had desired him to wait for the money, and expected he would do so - I should have detained him probably ten minutes, but he called out to me, saying he was going a little further, and would call again for the money; he was not to carry away any clothes that day, he went away, and did not return - I went up stairs in about ten minutes after he left, but did not miss the watch till evening; no stranger had been there who could have gone into the parlour after he left - nobody could have come without my knowledge, and I am quite sure nobody did come; when he called out to me the second time from the head of the kitchen stairs, he could see the watch hanging up, as the room door was open; the watch has never been recovered.</p>

             well, and the whole of the family: he said it had been disposed of to Moses Marks, in Field-lane, for 10s., and he had 2s. of the money - I afterwards heard him give the same account to Limbrick and others.</p>
               <p>JOHN LIMBRICK. I am an officer. In consequence of information from the last witness, I had some conversation with the prisoner - the father asked him about the watch; he said he took it, but did not part with it - that another boy sold it, but he did not know his name; I fetched him up on the Thursday, and took him to where he said he had sold it, and the man denied it - the man was brought to the office, committed for two days, and then discharged.</p>

            . I know the prisoner by sight: I saw him on Wednesday, the 2nd of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock; he asked me to pledge a gold watch for him - I told him no, I would not; he said he would show it to me; he took up the tail of his jacket, and said he had it there, and I could see the form of a watch in his jacket pocket, but I did not see the watch; I heard a watch tick - I saw him at Brompton, between four and five o'clock; he crossed over to me, and said he had sent a person to pledge it, and he got taken into place - I thought he meant taken into custody; I gave information to his father: I was not present when he made a statement to Limbrick.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) The evidence against me you have heard; I beg in the most humble manner to inform this honorable Court that I am innocent of the commission of the offence for which I stand here before you: it is most painful to my feelings, as well as heart-breaking to my unfortunate mother,(who has six small children) to whom I was a great assistance, to see her ill-fated son placed in such a degrading and perilous situation; on the morning laid in the indictment I admit I went to the prosecutor's house for my mother with some linen - I also admit that I was desired by some person in the prosecutor's house to call again in the course of the day, but I omitted to do so, in consequence of my having more pressing occasions for my time elsewhere, which I thought would turn to more advantage towards the support of my mother, brothers and sisters, whose interest I always preferred to my own; the two above circumstances alone have been the cause of my being committed on the present charge, without any further shadow of guilt attached to me, and I solicit in the most respectful and humble manner that the very slight grounds of suspicion which attaches to me - I trust that my youth (being scarcely eighteen years old) and my general good character, and this being the first and only offence with which I have ever been charged - this honorable Court will in its great humanity condescend and weigh minutely the evidence of the witnesses against me with mature deliberation; I await with humble submission your decision.[Friday, July 9.] <rs id="t18300708-6-verdict40" type="verdictDescription">

I was not aware of it;" Davidson said he had followed him from place to place, and witnessed his passing bad sixpences, prior to his coming into that shop; the prisoner then said, "If I have given you a bad sixpence where is it?" I replied,"Not expecting to see you again I destroyed it;" I had thrown it into the fire - he immediately drew from his pocket 5 1/2d., which he laid on the counter, and said,"There, that will do I suppose?" Davidson said, "No, not exactly - you have passed other bad money, and must change it;" he then demanded the prisoner's name, and he very indistinctly gave Highland or Ireland; we could not make out which - Davidson said, "You must now go with me," and he quitted the shop with him.</p>

            . I am turnkey of the County gaol of Surrey. I know the prisoner; he was convicted in October, 1828, by the name of John Ireland, and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment in the County gaol.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I stand before your Lordship's bar charged with an offence, of which I am entirely innocent. I understand one of the witnesses for the prosecution has sworn that I went into her house on the day mentioned in the indictment and had a glass of peppermint in payment, for which she says I gave her a counterfeit sixpence, which she put into her till among a quantity of other money: among which were nineteen other sixpences, and that it was after it had been in the till she found that it was a bad one. I most positively declare my innocence of this charge, and the witnesses must be mistaken in the person. - Another witness swears that I went into his shop for half an ounce of tobacco, for which he says I gave him sixpence and received the change, which sixpence he afterwards found to be bad; and he immediately burned it - he also says that I was brought back to his shop by some person who asked him if I had not given him a bad sixpence; he said Yes, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080014"/>immediately gave him back the change. In answer to this I do most positively declare that I did not know that I had a bad sixpence in my possession, or I should not have given it. - A publican has sworn that I passed a counterfeit sixpence at his house on the same day; this witness, as well as the first, must be mistaken in my person: for I do most solemnly declare my innocence of these two charges, never having been in either of the witnesses' houses. I have been in his Majesty's service for upwards of twenty-three years, and in the event of the Jury finding me guilty, I throw myself upon the Mercy of the Court: who, I hope, will take into consideration the length of time I have been in his Majesty's service, and that I have a wife and three helpless children.[Monday, July 12.] <rs id="t18300708-7-verdict45" type="verdictDescription">

Taylor, to be in his hand-writing - when he brought me the bill he asked me if I thought I could discount it for him; I said I could say nothing about it till the return of my husband, who was then at market - he returned, and I mentioned it to him; the prisoner was not present - I saw him afterwards, and told him my husband could not give him cash for it; but he was willing, as he was so much distressed, to endeavour to get it done for him - he had told me he was likely to lose his furniture for rent; he said he should be greatly obliged to my husband if he would get it done - I had kept it in my posession, he endorsed it when he gave it to me; this, which purports to be the acceptance of Taylor, was on it when he gave it to me - I took the bill to Mr. Barnes', who gave me ten sovereigns for it; I gave the prisoner eight sovereigns and a half, and some silver - the remainder, by his wife's request and his permission, I laid out for them in stockings and things; I did not hear what amount his rent was - I told him, next morning, that I had got the money from Mr. Barnes, and gave him Barnes' address.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q.Are you aware that this is a capital offence? A. Yes; I remember calling at the prisoner's lodgings in Dorset-street; his wife and an old gentleman, whom I do not know, were present - he endorsed the bill on that occasion, in my presence; it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080015"/>was not brought down stairs by his wife and handed to me - I received it from his own hand.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you tell me any one occasion on which you saw the prisoner write? A. Yes; he once came to our shop, made out a bill of his own, and showed it to me - I did not wish to notice what he was writing, but he showed it to me; I had lent him the pen and ink - I was near him when he endorsed the bill; his wife called on me on the Saturday morning after he had received the money, but not before; she might also have called a few days before I got it cashed - she called to say her husband had received a bill from Taylor; Barnes did not deduct any discount - I handed the money to Mather; I never said I did not receive the bill from the prisoner, but from somebody else - I was examined at Marylebone Office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he bring the bill to you in Homer-street? A. Yes, and left it with me to consult my husband - I took it to him in Dorset-street, and told him what my husband said, and he there endorsed it; he told me Taylor was a gentleman he had been in the habit of working for for the last two or three years - the prisoner is a painter and glazier; I do not know whether he told me where Taylor lived.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS TAYLOR. I live in South Moulton-street, and am a carpenter and builder. The prisoner has done work for me; (looking at the bill) this is not accepted by me- I never gave the prisoner authority to accept for me; I first knew of its existence on the morning it became due; it was presented for payment - I knew nothing of it till about an hour before it was presented; the prisoner then called on me, and said he had taken the liberty of putting my acceptance to a bill of 10l., which would become due that day, for which he was exceedingly sorry, but he would provide me with the cash if I would have the goodness to pay it in the course of an hour; he failed to bring the money - I was from home, but believe the bill was brought between ten and eleven o'clock; I did not take it up - I left word at home that if the money was not brought for it the servant was to say I was out; the prisoner told me it would be presented by some banker's in St. James'-street, I think - I called on him the next day or a day or two after, to point out the danger of his conduct in not attending to the bill; he assured me he was using every endeavour in his power to accomplish the object of getting the money for it - he told me the bill was in Mr. Barnes hands; I have seen the prisoner write occasionally, but not above two or three times, and I have had specifications for work from him; (looking at the bill) I believe this endorsement to be the prisoner's hand-writing - I think the acceptance is similar to his, but cannot swear it is; I think it is his writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you to tell your servant to say you was not at home when the bill was brought? A. I always go out about half-past nine or ten o'clock on business.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not stay in the house to tell the person who brought it that it was forged? A. I had undertaken to pay it if he brought the money - I was very angry with him, and felt hurt at his forging my name; I should have liked to have kicked him across the street for doing it if it had not been for the law - I left orders with Mrs. Taylor about the bill, not with the servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not stop at home to tell the person who came that it was forged? A. I could not tell it was forged till I saw it - I have known the prisoner three or four years; I am hard run for money at times - I have frequently paid people who did work for me with bills; I think I have given the prisoner three bills - I cannot swear I have not given him more; I never kept an account of them, except on slips of paper, as they were so small; the prisoner called on me about two months before this bill became due, and asked me as a favour if I would accommodate him with my acceptance to a 10l. bill - I told him I would not do any thing of the kind; I am a little deaf.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he bring a bill with him? A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. On your oath, (being deaf,) I ask you whether the prisoner did not propose to you, about seven months ago, to allow him to use your name, and you said,"Yes, you may if the amount is small?" A. No, he called and asked me to accept a bill, which I did, and paid it when due - I never said he might use my name if the bill was small, or any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be glad to know if you did not say enough from which be might understand he had your leave to put your name to the bill as acceptor? A. No, I refused him flatly - he never made another application to me; the three bills I gave him were to serve him - when I gave him the first he had done about 2l. worth of work, and wanted to draw for a few pounds, and said it would be of service to him if he might draw; I said he might, and gave him my acceptance - I cannot swear exactly how much for; I have no recollection of his calling with another person, and asking me to allow him to use my name as acceptor to a bill - I have no recollection of any such thing; I know nothing of it - I deny it as far as it is possible - I think I can swear it never happened; I positively swear it was not done - I knew who discounted the bill after it became due; I did not know Mr. Barnes before it was due, nor did I know Mr. Collins.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that the prisoner has been sued on this bill as a debt? A. I did not know it till this took place - I now know he has been sued for it; I understand the Sheriff's officer was endeavouring to arrest him for it as a debt.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He had applied to you to accommodate him with bills, but never to allow him to use your name as acceptor? A. Yes - I accepted the small bills, because he told me the persons who discounted them would hold them till they became due; I was not in his debt at any time before the bill became due - I think it was in November that we balanced accounts; I paid him the balance in November - he gave me a stamp receipt about the middle of November; I think it was 5l. or 6l. that I paid him - this bill is dated 12th of December; I never authorized him or anybody to accept that bill in my name; I never authorized anybody to accept any bill in my name; I have a very good memory generally - it is very good in this case.</p>
               <p>JAMES BARNES. I gave Mrs. Collins cash for this bill some time in December, but I took no memorandum of the time; I gave her the full amount, as Mr. Collins was a friend<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080016"/>of mine - I would not take the discount; it was returned to me after it was dishonoured - I applied to Mr. Taylor about it; he refused to pay it - I afterwards applied to the prisoner; he said he would settle it in the course of the day - I left him, and he called on me at various times, but did not pay the money; I have had the bill in my possession ever since till I gave it to the Magistrate; (looking at it) this is my endorsement on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear Taylor swear he did not know you, nor where to find you? A. He did not know me at the time; he must have meant to say he did not know me before it became due - that is what I understood him to swear; I did not speak to him till after it was due, nor did I see the prisoner at all till after it was dishonoured - I never entered into an engagement with him to take the amount by instalments; he promised me he would bring the money - that was after I knew it was forged; I spoke to my attorney, who advised me to sue him, which I did, and got judgment against him, but could not find him to take him till the Police-constable took him- I did not then say if he would pay me I would discharge him; I never spoke to him - I never agreed to receive any thing from him by way of payment.</p>
               <p>RICHARD COLLINS. I am Mrs. Collins' husband. I heard this bill was not paid, the prisoner came to my house the night it was due, and asked us to be so good as to put the bill off till Saturday, and it should be paid.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH AINSWORTH. I am a Police-officer. I took the prisoner into custody, and told him it was for a case of felony - he said it was nothing but a debt; I said, "We will see what it is."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not go quietly with you? A. Yes; he expressed no alarm.</p>
               <p>MRS. COLLINS. When he first produced the bill he asked if I could give him cash for it - I told him I would ask my husband when he returned, that I could do nothing till he returned; he left the bill in my hands.(Bill read, see indictment.)</p>
               <p>Three witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BIRD. In May, 1829, I lived at No. 3, <placeName id="t18300708-10-crimeloc61">Greville-street, Hatton-garden</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18300708-10-crimeloc61" type="placeName"

On the 5th of May, at five o'clock in the afternoon, I placed a trunk, containing seven dozen pairs of shoes, at the end of my passage, fifteen or eighteen feet from the street door, and within the house; the trunk was matted, ready for exportation - I missed it about six o'clock; fifteen pairs of shoes were afterwards found - they were produced here fifteen months ago; I have since sent them to India - I knew them to be part of what I had lost; they were not of my own manufacture - we have a particular way of dressing them up for exportation, and marking them on the toes - I found that fifteen pairs the same evening, at a house in Hole-in-the-Wall-passage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Are any of the shoes here? A. No - I have been twenty-two years in the trade; I knew them to be what I lost when I saw them - I never saw the prisoner in my house; we number our shoes, beginning with the commencement of the year, from Nos. 1 to 20,000 - there was also the manufacturer's stamp on them, but no other mark of my own, except that the silk strings were in them, and I have a particular way of cutting them; the manufacturer is not here - he lives at Northampton.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When the articles were produced, did you immediately recognize them as part of what you packed for exportation? A. I did - I had not the least doubt of them; I could swear to the numbers.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BURGESS. I am a book-binder, and lived at No. 25, New Compton-street - I knew the prisoner by the name of Rushlight Tom, for about six months before this happened, and I had seen Jones. On a Tuesday, about the middle of May, 1829, (I heard of this robbery the same week,) I was sitting in the Swan and Sugar Loaf, about five o'clock - the prisoner came and asked me to carry a box; I said, "Who for?" he said, "Come and see;" I said should I be paid for it - he said Yes; I went down to Bartlett's-buildings, and saw Jones - I said,"Is this the box?" Jones said Yes - I said, "Is it all right?" he said Yes - the prisoner was present, and within hearing; Jones lifted the box up, and told me to take it to White's-alley, which I did, and received 6d. -I was to have 1s.; Jones sent me 5d. afterwards - Jones accompanied me; I rested on the road, and he helped me up with the box - the prisoner also went with me to the house in White's-alley; we separated there - I do not know the contents of the box; it was about five feet long, covered with a matting, and corded - I do not know what became of it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had not the prisoner been in the habit of occasionally giving you jobs in the way of messages? A. Yes - he has recommended me to a job to carry things; Jones paid me for this - I cannot remember that I ever expressed an opinion that the prisoner was innocent of this.</p>

             DAVIE. I am a widow. On a Tuesday in May, 1829, I lived in Hole-in-the-Wall-passage, and saw the prisoner at jones' - (I had seen him there before, backwards and forwards, bringing different parcels, for two or three years) - this was about five o'clock in the evening; I saw him go to Jones' house - he lived at No. 1 and 1 at No. 7; I was at my own street door - he was alone when he went into Jones'house; I saw him come out, and Jones followed - I saw Jones return with a bundle of shoes, and then I heard of the robbery; the shoes were in a white apron, tied up so tight that I could see the shape of the soles - the passage is narrow, and he passed me; I could see the marks of the heels and toes through the apron - it was a projection of what appeared to be shoes; I heard of Bird's being robbed, and told him I had seen Jones go into the house with a bundle of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080017"/>shoes - this was at a quarter before seven o'clock that evening; Bird went and found them - Jones was taken about half-past eight or nine o'clock that evening, and I saw the prisoner about ten minutes to nine; he just came into Jones' house after he was taken, and went out directly -I heard no conversation between him and any body.</p>
               <p>SARAH IVES. I am the wife of William Ives. In May, 1829, I lived in Kingsbury-place, Gwyn's-buildings, Chancery-lane - the prisoner and Hawkins took an apartment at my house - he went by the name of Thomas Gall; they lived together there as man and wife - I saw them there in company together in the early part of May, and I believe the early part of the week; I saw a tall and a short man take a box out of our house, but I cannot say it was the prisoner, for I was a long distance from them.</p>
               <p>MARIA BROWN. I live at No. 12, Portpool-lane. I believe the prisoner to be the man who came into my shop in May, 1829 - I had never seen him before; Jones came in, and asked if I would purchase some shoes - he had about six pairs in his hand; I said No, they would not suit me, they were a deal too light - he asked if I could tell him where to dispose of them; there was another man in the shop, who I believe to be the prisoner, but I did not know he was with him till he was gone out, and did not see him again till now; I cannot exactly swear to him, as I did not notice him particularly - my boy was in the shop, and called me; Jones came towards me, the other man stood at the back part of the shop within hearing; Jones said he had some shoes to dispose of - I said they would not suit me; he said he had a great many, and asked if I knew where he could dispose of them; I said No, and turned into my room immediately - I never noticed the other person.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TOOK. I apprehended Jones, and I found fifteen pairs of shoes in his house on the 5th of May, 1829, for which he was prosecuted; I know nothing of the prisoner in this case.</p>

               <p>"Mr. McCabe you had no occasion to dispute that being my hand-writing, it is mine, I acknowledge it in the presence of all parties;" he would not be satisfied - I took the receipt, and said, "To shew you it is my hand-writing," I took a pen and ink, and wrote the name over again, and said,"There is the ink wet for you;" he would not take that- a stamp was brought, and I wrote a fresh receipt; Rawlinson, his friend, proposed to have a bottle of wine each - I objected at first, not wishing to be in his company, but eventually two bottles were brought and drank, and two more sent for; there were six people in all - while we were talking together I stood at the table; the prisoner got up, and struck me in the face - I never gave him any cause for it; I got up, and struck him - he pulled a knife out of his pocket during the scuffle, and stabbed me in the ear; the three witnesses interfered -Rawlinson ran away; the Police were called in, and I gave him in charge - he was taken to the station; he was held to bail at Hatton-garden - in fact, the whole force of Hatton-garden opposed me; he was well known there - he has surrendered here.</p>

            . I live at Fulham, about a mile from Mr. Holmes'. On the 24th of June, between three and four o'clock, I was going to his house, which is near the church - I observed the two prisoners as I crossed the church-yard; one of them appeared to be lurking near the wall, and the other was among the tomb-stones - I walked round the church-yard, and directed my attention to them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080018"/>- I saw one of them cross from the path among the tombs - I did not see the other; I then walked round the church-yard again, and observed neither of them then - they had nothing in their hands: I saw Mr. Chasemore - he asked me a question about them; after he left me I found the box in the moat which runs along the same walk as I had met the prisoners in, and about forty yards from where I last saw them; it was wrapped in a blue apron, partly uncovered - I went to the top of the walk, and there were some labourers; I saw it taken out of the moat, and taken up to the Bishop's lodge - I saw the prisoners in Barker's custody in about half an hour, and am sure they are the men I saw in the church-yard; I saw Barker bring the box back to Mr. Holmes'.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is not the moat in a public pathway? A. Yes; there is about an acre of water - the prisoners were taken going towards Hammersmith; about half an hour intervened between my seeing them and Chasemore, and in half an hour more I saw them in custody. When I last saw them they were going towards Hammersmith - when I saw them in the church-yard they were going towards Mr. Holmes', which is about twenty yards from the church-yard; there are other houses adjoining - one was among the tombs, and the other by Holmes' wall; the labourers were haymaking at the top of the Bishop's-walk.</p>
               <p>HENRY CHASEMORE. I live at Fulham. I was in the church-yard between three and four o'clock, and saw Sullivan standing there, looking up the lane towards Mr. Holmes' house; (he is the husband of Lady Strong) - Matthews was not in the church-yard at that time; Sullivan was thirty or forty yards from the house, looking down the lane once or twice - I afterwards saw Matthews come in a direction from Holmes' house, with a mahogany box under his arm, in a blue apron; he was going from me, and the hind part of the box was exposed - he went towards Bishop's-walk; Sullivan followed after him, ten or twelve yards behind - I saw nothing pass between them; Matthews' face was not towards me - I should be very sorry to swear positively to him; I met Mr. Gifford several minutes after, and made a communication to him - I went after the prisoners towards Hammersmith; I went along Bishop's-walk, and saw a box with a blue apron in the moat - I left it there, and went on, but did not see the prisoners till I got near Hammersmith turnpike; I saw the Policeman, and he took them into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not the Bishop's-walk a very public thoroughfare? A. Yes - Mr. Holmes' door looks towards the church, but there is a wall and a garden between; I did not see Sullivan nearer to the house than thirty or forty yards - I am certain it was him: the path through the church-yard, I believe, leads to Mr. Holmes' house, and also to Bishop's-walk; I did not notice any body else - other people might be passing; I stopped to talk to the hay-makers; they were about thirty yards from the moat in a field, and three or four hundred yards from the box.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoners by direction of Chasemore, at Hammersmith turnpike - I found a spike and two keys on Sullivan; I followed them for seven or eight minutes - they were together, going in a direction for Fulham; I first saw them come down the lane from the Bishop's-walk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why, this spike is a tenpenny nail? A. It is a very large one; I saw them about two hundred yards from Bishop's-walk - that was as near four o'clock as I can tell; the toll-gate is about half a mile further - they were about ten minutes in my sight; Chasemore said the one with the box had his back to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Have you the box? A. Yes, the Bishop's garderer delivered it to me in the field, near the walk - this blue apron was with it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>ANDREW GIFFORD. That is the box I saw in the moat; I saw it taken to the Bishop's lodge - I saw it in the gardener's hands, and afterwards in Barker's hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not that a common description of article? A. I cannot say - I was close to the moat, and could see nearly all of it; I am acquainted with Mr. Holmes, and had seen the box there before the robbery - I was about thirty yards from the prisoners in the church-yard, and passed them in Bishop's-walk; if they had had the box in the church-yard I must have seen it, I think - the prosecutor's house is built to represent a cave, with French windows to it; it is a house that people go to look at; I do not know whether any body had been there that day - there was only an old servant in care of it; she is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When did you see them last? A.They passed me in Bishop's-walk, about fifty yards from the church-yard, in company; the box was much nearer the church-yard than that - they had passed the place where it was; I was a few minutes walking round the church-yard - I am certain of their persons.</p>

On Tuesday, the 29th of June, I cleaned the plate, and locked the plate-closet door - it was then quite safe; I then went to another part of the house - I heard a little noise, and thought it was the bird at the window - I heard it again, and thinking it was the rattling of the spoons and forks, I went to the pantry, and saw both the prisoners in the pantry, in the act of taking the plate out of the closet; I immediately ran in, and laid hold of Taylor - Thomson ran out of the pantry, past me; Taylor tried to escape - I knocked him down in the front hall, and secured him, but he afterwards escaped from me at the door; I immediately gave an alarm of thieves, and ran after him - the front door was open; he was secured about one hundred yards off - Thomson had run in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080019"/>a different direction; one of the labourers stopped Taylor - he up with his fist and knocked him down; that man then ran after Thomson and secured him - they were handcuffed and taken to a public-house; I returned to our house, and on a small table in the pantry found a yellow handkerchief, containing these spoons and forks, and another handkerchief by the side of it; the handkerchief was not tied up, but the plate laid on it - they were plated articles, except four spoons and a fork; I had put them into the closet about twenty minutes before, and locked the door - the table was by the side of the closet; I received information from Gillham, and by the garden wall found a silver watch and guard, belonging to me, about a quarter of an hour after; it hung on a hook in the pantry, opposite the plate-closet, about ten minutes before I saw the prisoners there; I cannot form any judgment of its value.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Your master is the French Ambassador, is he not? A. No, the Sardanian - he is a Count; I do not know whether he has other titles - he is called Count D'Anglie; Taylor was secured in a very few minutes - I did not lose sight of him above half a minute.</p>
               <p>HENRY GILLHAM. I am a groom. I was riding by the prosecutor's house, and heard somebody cry out Halloo! I immediately saw two men making their escape from the house, and heard somebody call Stop thief! they ran in different directions - I followed Thomson, and saw him throw something over the garden wall: I pointed out the place to Curry - I was opposite Thomson when Almond stopped him; I am certain of him, for I was close to him all the time - he said it was merely a lark, and offered Almond 1s. to let him go.</p>
               <p>ROBERT ALMOND. I heard a cry of Stop thief! near the house, and ran after Thomson, who was running down by the lodge-gate, in a direction from the house; I stopped him, and delivered him to the constable, who had got Taylor.</p>
               <p>GEORGE CALDER. I am a Police-constable. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw Taylor struggling with Miles' workman, and secured him; he had no hat on - I found a dozen lead pencils on him, and two dozen on Thomson.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the 4th of May I spent the evening with several friends in the City, and parted from them at half-past eleven o'clock; I had been at the Langbourn-tavern, Fenchurch-street, and was proceeding home, but it was too late to get in at the hotel - I was crossing Lombard-street, and met a hackney-coachman who was going my way; I got on the box and rode with him - I went to a public-house and treated him, then went to a second public-house, and saw the prisoner there; I had met him at the first public-house, but never saw him before that evening - I treated him with liquor at the first public-house; the coachman parted from me when I left the public-house - the prisoner accompanied me, and I got to the neighbourhood of <placeName id="t18300708-14-crimeloc84">Zion-square, Union-street, Whitechapel</placeName>

               <p>Q. Had you any difficulty in getting up when he threw you down? A. Yes - he kept me down, and while I was down I put my hand to my fob, and found my watch was gone; I am sure it was safe at the very moment I was knocked down - I had had a little liquor, but was not deprived of my senses so as not to know what I was about; I found my watch was gone, and the prisoner also; I instantly pursued him - I had not lost sight of him for more than a minute before he was taken by the officer; I called Stop thief! and Murder! when I saw him running from me - he was brought back by Arnold within a minute; I saw the watch found at the bottom of the lining of his trousers - my snuff-box was in his waistcoat or coat lining; I am certain I had not given them to him to take care of, or as a gift - he might have seen them by my exposing them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He might have seen them by your exposing them? A. Yes - taking the watch out to see the time, and taking a pinch of snuff; I never saw the coachman before - I was not so drunk as not to know what I was doing; I did not go to more than three public-houses after eleven o'clock, to my recollection - that was the Half Moon, Leadenhall-street, the Langbourntavern, and a house in or near Leadenhall-market, which I do not know the name of - it may be the Hercules Pillars; I tossed for gin at the Half Moon twice - one quartern of gin was brought; the first toss I won, but the prisoner did not pay for it - I met him there; I had never seen him before; I treated him with 2d. worth of gin, and had the same - we drank the quartern we tossed for; we only tossed for one quartern - the prisoner and I left the house in company together; I did not ask him to accompany me, not to my knowledgde - he invited me to go to another house close by, where he said he was known; I cannot recollect being turned out of the Half Moon, but I know it was time to go - I positively swear I never asked the prisoner where he lodged; I never lost my senses - I went no where with him to get a bed, nor did I ask him if there was a house called the Acorn in Whitechapel - I never went to another house to my recollection; I do not know whether I went to the Acorn or not; I do not recollect one

               <p>Q. Did you not produce your watch and hand it over to the prisoner, and tell him that and the snuff-box must find more liquor and a bed? A. I could not say so of the snuff-box, for it was not worth 2d.; but I cannot swear to the latter part of it - I quarrelled with a person at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080020"/>Hercules Pillars, and we had a couple of rounds; I paid 4d. for gin there - I cannot swear I did not go to the Bee Hive, in the Commercial-road; I do not recollect asking the prisoner if he had got my watch and box safe two minutes before the Policemen came up - I was taken to the Police-station; I sent Benson to the station next morning to inquire if my watch and snuff-box were safe, and said that was all I wanted - I did not wish to have any more to do with it, if I could get my property; I did not say I was drunk -I told the man I had no charge against him, because I was never in a Police-office before, and should have been glad to receive my property and have done with it; I was told to attend at the office that morning, but did not attend till the second examination - I could not attend before, through the ill-usage I had received; I was going to my father's to sleep.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ARNOLD. I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Zion-square, Whitechapel, between one and two o'clock in the morning, and heard a great noise, apparently of somebody hallooing out for assistance, but could not exactly hear what was said - I stood still, and presently heard somebody running towards me very quick in a direction from the noise, and almost directly I saw him turn round the corner into Mulberry-street - I stepped back into a door-way, and when he came opposite me, jumped out, and secured him; it was the prisoner, and in the space of a minute, not longer, I saw the prosecutor running after him - just before he got to me he said, "Did you see a man running this way?" I said,"Is this him?" he said, "That is the man who robbed me of my watch;" I asked where he was going when I stopped him - he said to his lodgings: I asked where that was - he said to the Bee Hive public-house; when the prosecutor said he had robbed him of his watch, he said he had never seen the prosecutor nor his watch before; I searched him, but could find nothing - I took him to the station, searched him more particularly, and found the snuff-box in the lining of his jacket, and the watch at the bottom of the lining of his trousers - he, up to that time, had said nothing, but that he had never seen the prosecutor nor his watch or box; he had been drinking, but was not much intoxicated - the prosecutor had been drinking; he was not very much intoxicated - he told me he was going to his father's, in Old Gravel-lane, and appeared to know what he was about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was any body present at the conversation between you and the prisoner? A. No - the prosecutor did not tell me he did not know whether he had given him the property; he was not so drunk as not to know whether he had given any thing away, or it had been taken from him - I have heard what he has sworn here: I have seen people much more drunk than him; I could not call him sober - he was not beastly drunk; his coat was covered with mud - he told me that was caused by the prisoner knocking him down - he was in liqour a little; he could walk, and did walk - I did not tell the Magistrate he was sober, or hear him say so; I stated the conversation I had with the prisoner at the first examination; the prosecutor followed me to the station - the inspector gave him a note to attend at Lambeth-street in the morning; it was a direction to the office, because he said he did not know where it was, not because he was too drunk to understand - I did not ask the inspector to give it him for fear he should not attend; he did not attend - a man came from him for his watch, but I would not give it up; I found the prosecutor at home - he did not in my presence state that he wished to prefer no charge, or that he could not tell whether he had given him the things; he said they were taken from him - I did not tell him he must swear they were taken from him; I went to tell him the Magistrate said he must appear the next day - the prisoner was not quite drunk, or he could not have run so fast as he did; I do not know whether I have any allowance for coming here - I was never here before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the Half Moon tap, Leadenhall-market, taking a pint of beer with Walker - the prosecutor came in, and challenged the room to toss for a quartern of gin; I tossed and won - we tossed again; he won the quartern, and I had to pay for it; the landlord said it was time to shut up - he would not let us have more liquor, and he was obliged to retire - as it was in my way home, (near Acorn-street, Bishopsgate,) I accompanied him as far as Cornhill; he asked me to go and see if we could get something more to drink; I went as far as the 'Change - the chimes were going three quarters past eleven o'clock; the prosecutor pulled out his watch to see if it was right, or to see the time, and in pulling it out I suppose he threw the snuff-box out of his pocket with a penny piece, which I picked up, and offered them to him - he refused, saying, "D-n the box, it is of no use to me, not worth keeping, you may keep it;" he then said it was too late to get in at his situation, and did I know of a lodging - I said No; he said would I accompany him to where there was a lodging to be found - I said we could get one at Whitechapel, and seeing a light at the Hercules, in Leadenhall-street, we knocked at the door, and were let in; we had gin and ale - he quarrelled with somebody at the front bar; I took his part, and he struck me twice in the face and gave me two black eyes - the landlord turned us out; we went towards Whitechapel, called in at the Acorn, and had something more to drink, which was ale and gin; he made a disturbance, and was turned out of that house - I staid to drink the rest of the liquor; he knocked at the door, and called out Ned! I suppose he had got my name at the Half Moon - I went out, and he asked if I would pay for a lodging for him; I refused, telling him I knew nothing of him - he pressed me to accompany him to a lodging; I at last agreed to go - we went opposite Whitechapel church, to the Ten Bells, which was shut up; we crossed the road, and both stopped for a necessary purpose - he again asked if I would pay for his lodging; I said I would - he said if I thought he would not pay me in the morning I should pledge his watch, and offered it to me; I refused it two or three times - we then agreed to make the best of our way towards the Bee Hive.</p>

            . In 1827 I lived in Lower Queen-street, Islington. The prisoner came to lodge with me in March that year - he had one room on the first floor. and he slept and had his meals there; he continued to lodge there till he was apprehended - the officer (Lea) came to the house at the time Solomon was taken; they entered the room he occupied, and called me up - I saw lace and different things, which Lea and Davis took away in a coach; the prisoner was not taken at my house, and I cannot say on what day it was - his wife used to come there to see him, but did not live with him there; I knew him by the name of Jones at my house.</p>
               <p>JAMES LEA. I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 23rd of April, 1827. I apprehended the prisoner in the New North-road, Islington, not in any house; I took him to Islington watch-house, and searched him, but found nothing relating to this robbery - I had not then received information of it; I took him before a Magistrate, and he was afterwards committed to prison; I went to Mrs. Oades' premises the following morning, about six o'clock, and inquired if she had a person named Solomon living there; she said No, there was a person named Jones - I was shown to the room on the first floor- I was accompanied by one Jackson, and sent for Davies; on opening the room door I found a vast quantity of property, lace, handkerchiefs, veils. Irish linen, tablecloths, and various articles, silk handkerchiefs, a watch, some hobbinet, and a quantity of caps; all the property was tied up in bundles, under the bedstead - there were three or four large bundles, and a great quantity of valencia waistcoat pieces; I took it all away - there was a large trunk full; all the articles were new, and might be worth 300l. or 400l. altogether; among it were the articles I now produce; also the following, which I delivered up to Mr. Copestake on the 28th of September, by direction of the Magistrate: (reads) "74 pieces of cotton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080022"/>lace, 88 caps, 30 lace collars, 39 dozens of cap crowns, 312 children's lace caps, and 27 pieces of bobbinet;" the prisoner at that time had been committed here to take his trial at the May Session, but was not here, when the Sessions came on; I have still detained in my possession part of the articles I found - I am sure they are the same, and the other parcel is what I delivered to the prosecutors - when I went to the prisoner's lodging in Queen-street, there was a coach at the door; his wife and son were there - I knew them well, having been to the house before, and seen them passing as his son and wife; the son was going in at the street door, with a key, and I prevented him - this was about six o'clock in the morning; I did not open the door, but waited till Mrs. Oades got up; I did not look into the coach - it went away, and his wife and son also; Davies was present when I found the articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who showed you Jones' room? A. Mrs. Oades - she went up to the room door; I inquired which was the room - she said on the one pair of stairs; this was on the 24th of April; I found some cloth and a silver spoon in the room - there were no skeleton-keys or housebreaking implements.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DAVIES. On the 24th of April, 1827, I went with Lea to Mrs. Oades' house - I found Lea down in her room, and accompanied him up to the first floor room; I saw him find the property - I have heard Lea's evidence; it is correct: I found a quantity of lace under the bed, which I gave to Lea - this is it: I found all the lace that was identified by the prosecutors - all the articles were new.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.There was considerably more than a man could carry? A.There was a coach full; we found no housebreaking implements.</p>
               <p>SAMPSON COPESTAKE. In January, 1827, I was in partnership with Mr. Groncock - we carried on business in Cheapside; here is a quantity of bobbin and sprig net, which have our tickets and marks on them, the same as they were in our warehouse; I do not recollect seeing any of the articles in the warehouse on the Saturday, but the articles produced are part of what were missing on Monday morning. the 8th of January; in September that year Lea delivered me the articles be has enumerated, by the Magistrate's direction - I put my name to this inventory on receiving them; they amounted to about 120l. - I calculate our loss at about 500l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When can you undertake to swear you saw any of the identical goods produced? A. I cannot fix any time myself - I had sold none of them; I can tell that by the numbers on the tickets, and the identical goods are so fresh in my recollection - we had not bought them long before, within a month; I will swear I saw them within a month of the robbery - I find, by referring to the invoice, that I received some of them on the 3rd of January, and will swear I saw those a fortnight before the robbery- I sold some of the lot, but can identify these as not being sold, by the numbers on them; I divided them into two lots when they came in, and sold one lot, but the other was stolen - they are entered in my books, which are not here, but I cannot be mistaken; this invoice amounts to 28l. 10s. - I sold about half of that amount; I will swear I sold 10l. worth; after we were robbed I marked off on this invoice what were sold, and ascertained that these were not sold, I have a memorandum here which I extracted from my books myself, and I know the goods again: here is one piece I had seen about the 3rd of January, and I might have seen it the day before the robbery, and here is another; the person I bought them of is not here.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.This invoice is for net? A. Plain and figured net, a very small portion of which formed part of the property lost; here are some pieces which I saw about the 3rd of January.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before he was taken? A. Never; he certainly was never a customer of ours - the warehouse is on the first floor; the street door was fastened inside - the thieves had come in through a private door in the passage, which opens into a trunkmaker's shop, and which was robbed of portmanteaus at the same time; a large portion of this property is unopened, just as it was when in our warehouse, and as we purchased it, not as we should sell it; we never sold a piece of lace entire like this - it is our own make, and we never made any other piece of this pattern.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you a shop-boy? A. I do not keep a shop; we have a warehouseman - this is an uncommon pattern of lace; I do not think you would find it in the whole City - I am satisfied I made no other of that pattern; there is certainly no other piece of this pattern to be found with my mark on it.</p>

            . In 1827 I lived in Fore-street, Cripplegate, and was a commission traveller to the prosecutors. These two pieces of figured bobbinet are their property; I saw them in their warehouse on the 6th of January.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How many warehousemen are there? Two and a youth - here are two others which I can speak to, and one which I know there is not another of the pattern; I took these out on Saturday to show to several people, but did not sell them - I brought them back; here is another pattern which I recollect perfectly well, but we had two of this, and sold one; I now speak positively to both - I did not examine it before so minutely.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has that piece the private mark on it? A. Yes, in pencil; I cannot say whether that is the mark of the house - I never saw the prisoner on business, nor ever near the house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear you saw it within a week of the 3rd of January? A. I cannot say positively- I am sure it was not sold; I should have missed it, for it was the only piece we made of this pattern. We had, I should think, 3000l. or 4000l. worth of goods on the 3rd of January - when I saw this piece again I recollected it as not having been sold.</p>

            . I was an under-gaoler of Newgate in 1827, and between sixteen and seventeen years. The prisoner was in custody in May, 1827; I took him from Newgate to the Court of King's Bench, Westminster, on Ascension-day, by habeas - I brought him back to Newgate, and on the following day took him again to Westminster; his bail was rejected, - and just at the foot of Westminster-bridge a large mob came round; I was afraid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080023"/>he would escape, and took him into a public-house, to get rid of the mob; we had a glass of brandy and water - he wanted to go into the yard for a certain purpose: I took him out, brought him back into the room, and took some brandy and water which I found there; and when I brought him out I did not know what I was about, I was so giddy - I found I could not walk; a coach was called, and we got into it: it drove I do not know where - we got into Petticoat-lane, and he got away from me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I ask for your own sake - I have no doubt he got away without your knowing any thing about it? A. I knew nothing about his intention to escape.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can only say I had no concern in the robbery - I have dealt largely for many years, and had papers to prove I bought property to a great amount, but since I have left England part of my papers have been destroyed; and Mr. Isaacs has papers in his possession - whether he has delivered them up I cannot say; they were papers of different sales, to a large amount.</p>
               <p>JAMES LEA. The prisoner was in Whitechapel watch-house at the time I went to his lodging.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Nor any means of knowing how to get into your warehouse, to your knowledge? A. No- not above 10l. worth of property was found; the padlock, no doubt, had been picked, and then the bar came away.</p>

On the 31st of December, in the afternoon, I met the prisoner and another - the prisoner asked me to go into a public-house, which I did; I was quite sober - I had not seen the prisoner before; Saunders was with him - the prisoner called for some gin and water: we all went into the house together - the other called for the gin and water, and paid for it: the other man, said he met a lady last night, and lent her 5l. to get a bonnet - the prisoner was there, and I am sure he heard it - we then went into the public-house, and had something to drink; I told him he would never see the bonnet nor the woman again - the other then said he had been to the Bank and received 800l.; the prisoner heard him say it - they both asked me if I had any money; I said I had: the prisoner asked me to pull it out and lay it on the table, which I did - it was 19s.6d.; the prisoner took it up and put it into the other one's hat, which was on the table; the prisoner then got up, and called me to the door - I went out with him, and when I returned the other man had run away with the money; it was a parlour we were in: when we got out into the street the prisoner said he was going to get change for a draft, and I left him - before he went away he told me to go back and look after the other one; I went, but the man and money were gone - I prosecuted that man in January last; all the money was gone, my hat and all - I had only 1 1/2d. left: I was at the door two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you positively swear I am the man? A. Yes: I never saw you before nor since till now - I think I was an hour in your company; I did not tell my brother I would not come up, as I did not know you were the man.</p>

On the 13th of June I was awoke about four o'clock - I got up directly, and went down Holborn to look for my clothes, which I missed from a box on the top of a chest of drawers; the key was in the box - I had seen all this property safe in the evening; I missed it all - the prisoner had occasionally slept there; I went to bed about one o'clock - he was not there then; there is a pair of folding doors at the entrance, and at the top there is a flap - whether he got over or opened the gates I cannot tell, but the key was in the lock; I found him at a quarter before one o'clock in the day, on the other side Templebar; he said, "Halloo, Frank!" I said, "Where have you been all night?" he said, "At Covent-garden;" I asked where he was about four o'clock - he said in Covent-garden - I said, "That is wrong, you have taken my things"- he said if I would go home with him he would make it all right at his place; just then the Policeman came up, and I gave charge of him - I had seen him the night before very much intoxicated; I believe when he came to my place it was not his intention to rob me - I never gave him authority to take my things; the seal and waistcoat were found on him at the watch-house - the coat he said he had sold to a Jew; we had the Jew up, and he said he had sold them again - I permitted the prisoner to do almost as he liked at my place.</p>
               <p>EDWARD ASHFORD. I slept with the prosecutor - I was awoke about four o'clock that morning; I saw the prisoner retreating out of the room - he was near the box with his back towards it, as if turning from it; he got out - I then awoke the prosecutor; I had not seen the prisoner the night before, and do not know how he got in.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met my prosecutor - we went to a wine-vaults; we walked on the Broadway, and he asked me to go on the water with him; I said I could not go as I was - he went home with me, and waited at the street door while I got a shawl; we then went on as far as Pimlico - he said was not that a very pretty garden, and asked me to go down a passage, and to go into a shed with him; I did so - he gave me all he had, and afterwards asked me for the sovereign back again; I said nothing was freer than a gift, and would not give it him.</p>

            . I am an officer in the army. On the 18th of June I saw the prosecutor followed by the prisoner and two other young men; I saw the prisoner take up the prosecutor's pocket, and take the handkerchief - I took hold of him, and told the prosecutor; the prisoner swore he would do for me if I did not let him go - he got from me, but I took him again; he struggled and broke a window - the handkerchief fell from him; I could not pick it up, but I believe this is it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. About half-past nine o'clock - there was light enough; there were several people there - he was walking abreast with two others, immadiately behind the prosecutor; I could not be mistaken in the person who took it - there was quite light enough; some shops were open - the prisoner threw down the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The two corner shops were shut up. Witness. Yes, they were - there were not two persons between the prisoner and me; I did not state that I saw two young men, who ran away - there were two with him; I did not say they went away - I did not notice; I did not say I would serve him out for it; he was very violent, he shoved me away, and I caught him again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The witness allows two shops were shut, and is it likely he could distinguish me from two or three others, when there was no gas-light at the corner - he let me go, and a lady came out and said I broke the window; she caught hold of my coat, and then he took me again - I am quite innocent.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. You remember the 25th of May, when you and I had a little conversation, and I said I had cleaned some clocks? A. Yes - my watch was in my hand, and I said I had had it home cleaned; I did not ask you to look at it - you did not say it had no cap; I did tell the Magistrate I did not suspect you till I found you had packed up your things - I knew you had a basket; I do not know what you had to pack up; it took me rather better than half an hour to get up and go to the Angel and back; I did ask where you had been after you left the station, and you said at a public-house - I asked what public-house, and you said you did not choose to tell me; I do not know that you showed me the public-house - I did say if you would give me my watch I would not prosecute; I was not examined at the watch-house - I did not hear the serjeant or any one say, "If you don't mind what you are about, you won't get your expences;" after I got out of the witness' box, the serjeant stepped up - I do not know what the Magistrate said to him, nor what answer he made - I will swear I do not recollect it; he did say, "I have nothing further to say, but I wish to put the prosecutor right in his evidence."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 24th of May, being off duty, I was at the Duke of York public-house, opposite to where I live, and which house we use; I cleaned three clocks there, and on the next morning I told the prosecutor I should lay in bed that morning, having had something to drink - he asked me to look at his watch; I looked at it, and said, "It has no cap to it, but it has had one;" he said he supposed he must have lost it, and asked if I could get one: on the morning of the 28th I went up to the room - I found him in bed, and I believe asleep; I called him twice - he answered me the second time - I said, "Shall I take your watch?" he said Yes: I took it, and went to the public-house; I staid, I suppose, an hour and a quarter - I then left it on my way to town, and very shortly afterwards I met the prosecutor, who said, "You are wanted at the watch-house;" I did not know what for, but I returned with him - in going along he said, "Where have you been?" I said, "At the public-house here, on the green, but I don't know the sign;" in coming along I showed it to him - there were two Policemen at the watch-house; he did not speak to either of them, but said to me"Come up here, I want you;" I went with him about twenty yards up the street, and he said, "I want my watch- give it me, and I won't prosecute you:" I gave it him, and said, "What does all this mean?" he then took me, and gave this evidence.</p>

               <p>ANGELIOUS BETRAUN. I am an officer. On the 4th of June I was in Oxford-street, near Poland-street; I saw the two prisoners together - Warner had a bundle under his arm: when they saw me they separated, and turned down Poland-street, on different sides of the way - I followed behind some persons, and saw them join and go down Brewer-street, into a coffee-shop - I went in, and said to Warner, who still had the bundle, "I want you?" he was going to give the bundle to Lawrence, but I said, "Bring that with you - what have you here?" he said, "Boots which I brought from Ipswich, where I exchanged some pens and quills for them," and that be lived in Whitechapel; I said he must have given a good many for them - I then asked Lawrence what he knew of them; he said Nothing: I asked which way they had come from Ipswich - they said through Romford and Whitechapel; I asked why they did not leave them in Whitechapel - they said they had been up there to sell some pens and quills.</p>

No, it is impossible; I had had it in my hand just before, and if it had fallen on the stones I must have heard it - my hand had not been off my pocket a minute, as I am always suspicious of these places; I had been looking at some caricatures: there is a bruise on the snuff-box, from a fall.</p>

I said, "Yes, you know it;" I seized them both - Mitchell broke from me, and ran across the street, but an officer took him; Mitchell had not touched the coat</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. I believe you induced them to come into your shop? A. Certainly, I called them - I took the coat off, and Mitchell stood by: I saw Moss fumbling about - I had other things about the counter, and thought they were his object; I did not take them before they left my shop, because I was not certain.</p>

The prisoner came there on the afternoon of the 25th of June, and said he should want a bed for the night; he then went out, and returned about half-past ten o'clock - he went to bed, and came down about half-past nine the next morning, and said he should want the bed that night also - he had paid for the bed the night before: I thought he looked rather bulky, ran up stairs, and missed the sheets from the bed he had slept on; I came down, and ran out - I found him in Jermyn-street, collared him, and gave him in charge; we took him to the watch-house, and found the pillow-case in his pocket, the two sheets under his arms, and this blanket round his waist, under his trousers' band.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I asked the prosecutor to do my work, as I felt unwell, from the effects of drink; we had both been drinking the night before - I asked him to lend me his hat and shoes, which he agreed to do; being holy-day time I wanted to go out, as my master said I might go out at any time, if I could get the prosecutor to do my work - I went to the fair, and met the prosecutor, who accused me of robbing him; I said, "I have no property of yours but what you lent me;" he would not listen to any thing, but gave me in charge for stealing his coat, waistcoat, and trousers, besides the hat and shoes, which I solemnly declare he lent me - he offered to settle the affair with my mother if she would give him 3l. 10s.; I had got his situation, which he had lost through bad conduct, and he wanted to regain it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHITE. There is no truth in what he states; I never lent him any thing, nor did he ever ask me - he went quite unknown to master.</p>

Yes; they both serve in the shop - the prisoner was taken into the back wareroom; I returned to work - he could have taken the locks when my back was towards him, taking the steps to show him the boilers - I was not above four feet from him; there were one hundred bundles of this description - I had seen these three minutes before on a small square shelf by themselves; I know it was full as we went into the wareroom, and as soon as he was gone it was empty; there was no other person in the shop.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I went and found the prisoner in custody; the prosecutor said he had robbed him - he asked if he had not committed a forgery for 10l.; he said that had nothing to do with him; he said, "Then tell me to what amount you have robbed me?" he said not more than 2l. that he knew of - I took him to the station-house, and found on him two bills for beer.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FRASER re-examined. Q.Can you say that he was taking out beer to deliver to Piercy? A.Not to my knowledge: I or my wife used to give him the beer, and when he returned he used to give an account of what he had done with it, and what he gave verbally was put down; I am certain that I have served him with beer to take to Piercy, under an idea that they were my customers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have paid him money off the bills that I took out; he used to tell me, "I shall always look to you for the money."</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FRASER. That was only customers who paid.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I used to give credit to customers when he would not; all the beer I used to book he used to look to me for the money, for I only booked No. 28 for a few days.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 15th of June, I selected from my stock ten silk handkerchiefs, and placed them on the counter to take the next morning to a customer - I saw them safe at nine o'clock in the morning, and at twelve a witness called and asked if I had lost any thing - I then looked, and missed them; these are them; I am certain they are mine; they have no shop mark - I know them by the pattern; they are tied together with a piece of string round them.</p>
               <p>JAMES BALFOUR. I went to the prosecutor's, and asked if he had lost any thing - I saw the prisoner and another boy pass me, and try to pick a gentleman's pocket - I did not see them go to the shop, but in a few minutes the prisoner ran by me very fast with something concealed under his coat; I ran after him from the corner of Percy-place, where I was waiting for a gentleman who was gone into a house in Deane-street, St. Giles, and there I stopped him with these ten handkerchiefs under his arm - I gave him into custody.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You say you saw me attempt to pick a gentleman's pocket. Witness. Yes; I did not take you because I thought some of the Policemen would see you- I once interfered in a case like that, and nearly got killed; I did not see you pick the handkerchiefs up - I was on the opposite side to the prosecutor's.</p>

I said No - he ran after me with the Policeman and tried Stop thief! Witness. It was a very dirty morning, and the handkerchiefs were clean.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CANNON. I took the prisoner - he told me he picked them up at the back of Oxford-street, near Soho-square; and a second time he said he picked them up in Oxford-street - he gave two different accounts.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor brought a pattern of one green one, and said he had no other pattern. Witness I have been to the prosecutor's, and saw the same pattern.</p>

I belonged to the Police, and on that morning, at a quarter-past four o'clock, I was on duty, and saw the prisoner coming down Carlton-terrace, opposite the Marquis' house with this basket of tools; I said, "What are you going to do with them?" he said,"To take them to some place;" I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him a man, named Clark, told me to bring them. Witness. He did so, but I thought it was a very unseasonable hour - I went to Clark, who came and said he knew him, but he had not commissioned him to get any tools; he lived near Middlesex-hospital.</p>

            . I am an Excise-officer. I was coming from Brentford, and saw the prisoner hanging with his right arm to the coach, and his left hand up against the woman's clothes - he seemed to move it; he saw me, I believe, and put something to his mouth - I ran after him, and saw him turn; he sat down on the irons, and then put his right hand to the prosecutrix's clothes - I ran, and when the coach stopped, I saw her clothes were cut; the prisoner was in sight, and she said, "That young man was behind;" I ran with another man, and we took him near the bridge - he had a large clasp-knife, and this half-crown was in his hand; a little boy told me he had it in his right-hand, and it was so - he had denied having any thing on him but 2s., which he had; the constable found the knife on him - he is not here; he took the knife from him at the office at Bow-street - I should think it was not sharp enough to cut the clothes.</p>

             re-examined. Q.What was cut? A. My gown, petticoat, and pocket; he showed the knife, and said, "That is the only knife I had."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you had your half-crown in your pocket? A. Yes, about half an hour before I saw the prisoner; it was loose in my pocket, and had been given me three hours before by my mother - I did not see any other person behind the coach; my sister sat on one side of me, and a young man on the other - my sister's clothes were cut in three places: the young man who was sitting was on my left-hand side, and my clothes were cut on my right side, and my sister's on the left.</p>


               <p>MR. BARRY to WILLIAM TAYLOR. Q. Have you not seen boys and men hanging behind a coach? A. Yes, but the prisoner's arms were through the irons at the top - he was hanging with his arm to the iron, and his left hand was up to her clothes; it was not pressing against her - I thought he was going to cut her clothes, from the position he was in, and from his hand moving; as soon as the cry of Stop thief! was raised he ran away - I suppose ten minutes had elapsed from the time I first saw him till the coach stopped; she did not get down - the coach stopped to change horses.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH PLUMMER. I have known the prisoner some time. On Monday evening, the 7th of June, I went with the Policeman - I had heard of the robbery: on the Tuesday afternoon, about twelve o'clock, I went by myself into old Fleet-market, and met the prisoner: I said, "Charley, have you been home yet?" he said Yes; I said, "You have stolen your master's watch?" he said, "Go on with you;" I asked if he had pawned the watch, and if he had, to give me the ticket - he said he had not pawned it, but sold it, but he had not got the posh (which means money) yet; I wished him to come home with me - he would not; I then told him the Policemen were after him, and if he would come home with me, and give his master his property, he would not be hurt; but if not, his master said he would prosecute him; he said it was a lie - I told him his mother was fretting about him; he said, "Tell my mother not to fret, for I am going out of town, and shall not see her any more;" I asked if he was going to give me any thing to drink; he said, "Don't I tell you I have not got the posh yet;" I said, "Well, Charley, when shall I see you again?" he said, "You won't see me any more, for I am going out of town;" he said, "Good bye Joe;" I said, "Good bye Charley;" that is all I recollect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You understand what posh means very well? A. Yes; I live with my parents; I was never turned out of doors by my mother for bad behaviour; I have been in the workhouse, and left there suddenly - I was never in the Penitentiary, nor in custody.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM EDMEADS. I live at No. 53, St. John-square, and know the prisoner. On Monday morning, the 7th of June, he came to my house about a quarter-past nine o'clock, and told me he had got a place for me as errandboy at a bookbinder's in Long-lane - I was out of place, and left my mother's house with him; when I got out, he told me he did not mean that, but that he had left his master, and if I had a mind I might go after that place; I went with him down Benjamin-street and Peter-street, Saffron-hill he told me to go on; I waited for him at the end of Holborn for about five minutes, and then he came to me again - we strolled about together, then went down to Deptford to see the fair, and staid there till six o'clock in the evening, returned home together, and slept at a peppermint shop in Field-lane; got up at four o'clock in the morning, strolled about till ten, and then I waited for him in old Fleet-market till about two - he then went away, and came to me again; he told me he had been to his aunt's, and gave me 15s. to mind for him; he said I might spend some of it if I had a mind; I asked where he got it; he said, "Never mind that;" we went on the road to Deptford again, and met a boy by the Halfway-house with a donkey - we paid him 4 1/2d. for halfpenny rides till we got almost down there, and then paid him 2d. to go to Deptford - he had just entered the fair on the donkey when he was taken; I had about 13s. of the money then, and I walked away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He made no attempt to run away? A. No; he was taken off the donkey.</p>

I had before that asked if he had got his master's watch - he said No; I said I could not let him go if he told me where it was,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080037"/>and when we got to the foot of Tooley-street there was a great crowd - I said, "You must now let me take hold of your arm;" he said, "If I tell you where the watch is, shall I be hunt?" I said it would be best for him to hold his tongue, for I could not render him any assistance - I said if the watch was found, in all probability it would be better for him; that was all - I searched him at Deptford, and asked what money he had - he said he had none at all, that he was very hungry, and wanted something to eat, but I found two half-crowns and a sixpence on him - I said, "How did you get possession of this money?" he said he had borrowed 9s. of a boy over Blackfriars-bridge - I asked who the boy was; he said he did not know, but he used to be acquainted with him, and did not know where he lived - I found 10s. 6d. on Edmunds, which I have here.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 22nd of June, about half-past seven o'clock, I went out, leaving Matthewson and Smith in the house - I returned about half-past ten, and saw a handkerchief of mine in the shop, and a pair of trousers and waistcoat belonging to a brother of mine, all laying in one place in the shop - I had left the handkerchief in my box up stairs; I went up stairs, and found my box broken open, and my brother's also - they were secure when I left the house; I found various articles strewed about the room and a pair of trousers, which were taken from the box; I had seen them a few days previous and had locked the box that morning; my pocket-book laid there open, and two sovereigns were taken from it -I had seen them there that morning; I missed a pair of trousers and a waistcoat entirely.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Has not Smith left his residence since? A. No - I saw him yesterday; I saw my box safe two or three times that day - I have another brother lodged there; I did not fasten the house up.</p>

            . On the 27th of June I left the house between seven and eight o'clock, with my cousin Smith, and left nobody in it - I pulled the door too, and the spring of the lock fastened itself; I did not mean to lock it - I took the key with me; I returned between eight and nine o'clock, unlocked the door, went in, shut it, and heard a scuffle up stairs - I went up, and passed the prisoner on the top of the stairs; the stair case window is immediately opposite - I looked at him, and he started me full in the face; I am certain of him - I passed him, and he ran down stairs; I looked into the back room - there was a trunk broken open, and clothes on the floor, and a blue coat on the floor of the front room - I immediately ran down, found the street door open, went out, and saw the prisoner fifteen or twenty yards off; Robinson, who lives opposite, ran out, calling Stop thief! I followed the prisoner about a hundred yards, then lost sight of him for half a minute while he turned a corner, and saw him in Bowyer's custody soon after - he brought him round the corner, where I had lost him; I directly said, "That is the man;" he said he could not be the man, and Bowyer let him go, as a man came into the crowd and said he could not be the man, for he had walked down behind him - I said he was the man; he walked down the street- Matthewson said he would follow him; Robinson came up, and took him - I had then gone back to the shop; I saw him in custody in about a quarter of an hour - I went up stairs with two Policemen; there were two trunks in the back room broken open, stockings, sheets, and a blue coat on the floor; two pocket-books laid open on the bed - an old brown coat was found in the back room; it belonged to nobody in the house; I did not notice the room windows when I went out, but when I returned they were both open - they were closed when I left, as far as I can recollect; they both belong to one room; they were not broken - the men must have entered at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You do not know whether the windows were open or not? A. They might be open when I left - it was rather dusk when I returned; I stood on one side of the prisoner on the stairs - his face was towards me, looking towards the window, when I got on the last stair - he might have knocked me down if I had stopped him; when he was stopped a man said, the man who was running had gone down the street, but I was sure he was the man - he walked very quick when Bowyer let him go.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . On the 27th of June I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner walking at a quick pace; I took him - several people said he was the man, and others said he was not; I am sure he is the person I took - there was a crowd; I do not recollect seeing Matthewson or Robinson - he was about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not several of the neighbours say he was not the man who ran from the house? A.I cannot say they were neighbours - one person said he was not the man, for he had been walking before him- some said he was not the man that jumped out of the window; others said he had run out of the door.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROBINSON. I live opposite Hutton. I was in my front room and my wife at the window; in consequence of what she said, I looked out of window, and saw a man getting out of the first floor window - I hallooed Stop thief! my window was open; I was hanging half out, and saw a man directly afterwards come out at the street door; that was the prisoner, I am sure - I called Stop thief! another man came out of the door; I put on my coat and hat, which took about three minutes, went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080038"/>out, and overtook him in Rose-street - he was walking not particularly fast; I followed him till I saw a Policeman, and gave him in charge - I did not know him before, but I saw his face.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You believe him to be the man? A. I am certain of him - I continued at the window from the time the other dropped from the window; he did not run - the corner of the street is six or seven doors off; I saw his face perfectly, and his dress; he was taken the first time in about three minutes - he was walking at a moderate pace.</p>

On the 23rd of June these stocks were in a box at the side of the counter; I saw the prisoner in my shop when I came in about five o'clock - he had brought me a note, which was taken up stairs; my young man said there was a note up stairs for me - I went up, read it, and came down; I asked the prisoner what time it would be convenient to wait on the gentleman; he said about eleven o'clock the following morning - he was about to depart, and my shopman said,</p>
               <p>"While that young man has been in your shop he has been robbing you - if you look into his hat you will find he has robbed you of some stocks;" the prisoner himself took off his hat, and I found four stocks in it - he said poverty had driven him to it: the stocks were given to the constable - they have my private mark on them; this is the note - a piece of paper was found on him, corresponding in water-mark with that the note is written on; a list of names was found on. (Note read.)</p>

On Sunday morning, the 27th of June, between seven and eight o'clock, he was sitting up in bed, and the child was in his room; he appeared very fond of it - I went into the room, and saw him give her more than half a glass of rum; I did not object to it, for the men who work for my husband have been in the habit of giving the children liquor from their infancy; and my husband, when he took a drop, would give the child a drop at the bottom; I saw him put the glass to the child's mouth, but did not suppose she would drink it all herself; she drank it voraciously - there was better than half a glass: I had said I wished he would give Margaret, my eldest child, a drop, but he was fonder of this child than her, and gave it her to aggravate me - she did not complain of being ill; I went out about eight o'clock that morning, and left her at play - I returned between ten and eleven, and found her in bed, ill, and between one and two she got more affected - it did not affect her at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she stagger at all? A. She was used to stagger; she seemed a little giddy, and wanted to go out with me - she was taken to an apothecary's between one and two o'clock; he gave her some castor-oil, told us to put her to bed, and she would be well by eight - she was taken to the hospital before eight, as she got into fits, which she was subject to, and died between eleven and twelve that night; her father gave her some melted butter, thinking she would discharge it from her stomach; I know nothing of her having soap-suds.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN WHITEHEAD. I saw the child at ten o'clock in the morning, quite tipsy; she said the prisoner had given her a glass of rum - she was subject to fits when teething, but not at this time; I put her to bed, went out with her mother, and returned at half-past eleven o'clock; she was then senseless - I went away, returned at three, and she was in strong convulsions; I took her to the hospital.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WEST WHEELER. I am an apothecary of St. Bartholomew's-hospital. I attended the child till half-past eleven o'clock on the Sunday night, when she died - I attribute her death to taking a quantity of rum, which would cause fits; she was in strong convulsions - her state was altogether different to what it would have been in a common teething fit; there was more torpor - I should think she had taken about three table-spoonsful of liquor; her body was opened, and there is no doubt of her having been previously in good health - the mischief decidedly arose from the quantity of spirits which had passed into her stomach.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty in Brewer-street on the 5th of June - I saw Bilston with a quarter of lamb; he took it to a shop, and asked them to let him leave it there for an hour - they thought it was not all right, and spoke to me; I watched till he came back and had the lamb - he went out and round the corner, where he met King, who had some other meat; they went to some shops, and both King and Bilston tried to sell it - I then took them; I showed the meat to Daley - King said he had bought the meat for 12s.</p>

I was on duty and met the prisoner with two others at the top of Bunhill-row; I went up to him, and said, "Halloo, young fellow! where are you going?" he said to bathe; I said,"What have you about you?" he said Nothing - I took off his hat, and saw a red handkerchief with a little sprig on it in the hat; I gave it to him, and told him to take care of himself, or else I should have him again - he went away; I went to the Police-station, and heard of this robbery; the prosecutor came in, and described the handkerchief and the prisoner - I went out and took him in about ten minutes; he was then alone - the prosecutor said he was the man; there was no handkerchief there then - the prosecutor seemed perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.The prisoner had plenty of time to have gone off altogether? A. Yes - it is very unlikely that I shall get 14s. by this job, they do not like to give so much, they think 1s. 6d. a day enough; I was here the Session before - I had 3s. 6d. a day then; I have heard they have cut us down - I did not detain the prisoner at first, as I thought it was very unlikely I should find the owner of the handkerchief; he was not a respectable boy - I asked if he had any thing about him, I did not mention a handkerchief; it was a common pattern -I have seen many like it - it appeared as if it had been folded and round a man's neck; it was in a lump.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. About a quarter past three o'clock that morning I met the prosesecutor and the prisoner (to the best of my belief) linked together very close, up Whitecross-street - they turned through a court; I had seen the prosecutor three quarters of an hour before, and supposed he must have got drunk since - they got out of my sight, then the prosecutor came and said he had his handkerchief taken from his neck, and I gave information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen the person before who was with the prosecutor? A. To the best of my knowledge I had seen him often before that night, and every hour of the night, because I am on the same beat; to the best of my knowledge I had seen him in bad company - I had no charge against him before; I was one of the old watchmen and a street-keeper.</p>

I am, and have a family I do not usually go into public-houses to treat women; it was to get rid of her that I did so - I was perfectly sober, so as to know every thing that was passing; I was stimulated, but not tipsy; I did take the gloves, thinking them to be my purse - it was up in a dark corner; she hustled me up in that corner under a pretence of having something to say to me; I had five sovereigns in my purse, and I believe there was some silver - I certainly have not said in another place that I thought I dropped my purse; the question was never put to me: I did not count the notes when I went into the public-house - I am certain I had them; I had not paid any of them away: I had had them two or three days in my purse - I never thought of such a thing as having dropped it; I do not know whether I drank any thing in the public-house, from indifference to what passed - I believe I and my friend had drank a bottle that day.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The only note you speak to is the one passed to Warmington? A.

               <p>Q. Now, have you not said you would be d-d if you would not serve her out the first opportunity, because she would not leave her husband to come to live with you? A. No, I never said such a thing - I never solicited her to leave her husband to live with me; nothing of the kind: I never quarrelled, and said I would serve her out, and never had the least idea of it - I have heard of a will which lawyer James has in hand now.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you not solicited them to forge a person's name to that will, or to put her name to any document? A. No; I never did any thing of the kind, that I swear - I mean distinctly to say I never solicited Wyatt to leave her husband and rob him of 10l.; I never solicited Sheen or Wyatt to make an affidavit to present to any Court, stating that her mother or father was dead; I never heard of any thing of the kind; I never heard such a charge - I never solicited either of them to make an affidavit that her brother had died at sea, to get his wages.</p>

On the 24th of May I received three 10l. notes, a sovereign, and 3s. or 4s - I lodged at Nunn's mother's four days; Platt was in the house, and I took them for brothers; I owed Nunn's mother 2l. 17s. - when I was paid Platt came to me, and said, "Give me the money for my mother;" and I gave him a 10l. note - he took it to Nunn, who put it into his pocket-book, and said he could not change it; I said I wished he would give me the change as I wanted to go home to Scotland by the steam-boat - Nunn then gave it to Platt; we went to some place to get change - Platt then said he thought the captain could give change; I then got another note changed, and gave him the money - I never got the first note at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you told all the story? A. Yes; I owed Nunn's mother 2l. 17s.; I never thought of asking the captain for change - I did not afterwards ask Nunn if he had returned the note; he did afterwards say, "I gave it to Platt, and he returned it to you;" I told him he had not, and he said he gave it to Platt to return to me - I went into a skittle-ground with some shipmates, but not to play at skittles; I cannot tell how many of my shipmates were there - there might be about eight; I am certain Nunn did not give me the note - I did not say, "So help me God I do not think he ever had my note."</p>

On Sunday morning, the 6th of June, between six and seven o'clock, I went to the City of London public-house to meet a man who owed me 2s. 9d., but he was not there according to promise - I saw a man named Spencer there; he said, "I have not seen you for a length of time, will you stand a treat?"

I never saw the two men in bed till I took the prisoner down for them to take care of him - I charged him with stealing 12s. in shillings; he had not that on him - I had been in bed that night; I never laid a hand on him till he took and grabbed up my money - I had bought a quarter of a pound of corn beef at the cook-shop, and there was one shilling I could swear to.</p>

On the 4th of June, I saw the prisoner come into the yard, about six o'clock in the evening - he was a stranger; he took a mahogany board, and carried it out of the yard two or three doors - this is the board; I took him, and told him he must take it back - he said he would not; then I said,"I must, and you along with it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was he so drunk as to be unable to stand? A. He was drunk - there is no window there; I took him to be in a very advanced state of intoxication - he stood, and walked, but rather crooked; I heard my master say he knew the prisoner, and should like to recommend him to mercy - I have heard that he is a looking-glass frame maker.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Drunk or sober, he could carry this board? A. It appeared like it; he had carried it three doors off the premises, and it had been fifteen yards on the premises.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you swear the man was sober? A. No - I said he was not drunk, but rather intoxicated; Mr. Sykes charged me with him - I do not recollect hearing him say he did not believe the man intended to steal it; I will not swear he did not - he said he had known him a good while, and had dealt with him for wood.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my father's service on the 12th of May, and on the 13th, about four o'clock in the afternoon, this watch was missed; I had seen it on the morning of the 10th, which was Monday - I went to the prisoner's lodging, to inquire if he had my father's watch; it was kept generally in the shop - the prisoner was not at home; we found the watch from some hand-bills: it is worth 10l. - that is the cost price; it is worth more than that - my father's shop is part of the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How many persons had your father in his employ? A.Only one in the shop where the prisoner worked; but I believe there were four altogether - we had before this lost a watch and a chronometer, which we have never found: we had an officer, and searched Carter, the errand-boy, and all who were in the house - we suspected other persons, but not the prisoner; we found property which had been concealed by other persons; my father did not ascertain that Carter had taken this very watch - I take an active part in the business; it is customary to give work to the men to take home to clean, but this was not taken home - the prisoner worked for my father for six or seven years; he was very honest, and we always placed confidence in him.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WORLEY. I am a pawnbroker. In the consequence of the hand-bill I searched our watches, and found this one, which was pawned by the prisoner on the 12th of May, for 3l., and on the 13th he came and had 3s. more on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before? A. Yes, I have seen him three or four times.</p>
               <p>HENRY JOHN FRODSHAM. This is my father's watch; I gave it to the prisoner - I know the name and number.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not your father's name on every watch he makes? A. Yes; but this watch I have had so many times, I could tell it among ten thousand - I do not suppose he has made above one of this description, with a compound-balance, since I have been in the business; this is the watch I gave the prisoner on the 10th of May - I have looked at the book to see that the number corresponds, and it does; it had been sold, but came back to be altered.</p>
               <p>Witness for the Defence.</p>
               <p>JAMES HENRY. I am a calenderer. On Wednesday, the 12th of May, I saw the prisoner between half-past eight and nine o'clock in the evening, at No. 29, Half Moon-alley, where he lives.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WORLEY. Our shop is in Old-street - he was there at a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening of the 12th of May.</p>

               <p>MR. LEE to MR. FRODSHAM. Q. At what time did the prisoner leave on the 12th of May? A.About eight o'clock - that is the time they generally leave; I do not remember desiring him to go to work on a chronometer-bar - they never leave before eight in the evening; his residence is about ten minutes' walk.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the watch entrusted to the prisoner? A. Not out of the house - he had it on the 10th of May, to make a trifling alteration; he might have taken it home, but he could have done it there in five minutes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Is it a place of much thoroughfare? A. Yes; there were not many persons passing at that moment - I am sure I saw it in the prisoner's hand; he was the middle one of three - it was not in the hand of either of the others; there is a pastry-cook's shop just behind, and the light from that made me see him.</p>
               <p>JOHN ANDREWS. I am an officer. I came up, and the prosecutor gave the prisoner to me; this other handkerchief was found on the prisoner at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That other handkerchief he took off my neck. Witness. No, I did not; but I believe it was taken off his neck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home; two boys picked the gentleman's pocket, and dropped the handkerchief at my feet; I took it up to give to the gentleman, and he said I had picked his pocket, but I am innocent.</p>
               <p>MR. ALDERMAN re-examined. Q. Did the other boys run away? A. Yes - the prisoner went on his knees, and begged I would forgive him; he did not say he had picked it up.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

I have my clients' instructions to adopt proceedings if the matter be not arranged in the course of to-morrow, and as the nature of those measures would be of serious consequence to you, I hope you will see the propriety of preventing them by your attention hereto.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Whose handwriting is this note (producing one)? A. Mr. Henry Dod's; I was not present when a pretended mate of the Malvina called with Mr. Imray - Messrs. Dods are <rs id="t18300708-92-viclabel521" type="occupation">merchants</rs>

Dods advertise vessels lading for Swan River, but are not brokers.</p>
               <p>HENRY DOD. My counting-house is at No. 10, Mark-lane; we received this letter on the 11th of February, or shortly afterwards; I was in the country at the time - but when I returned, there was a summons to attend at the Mansion-house - we had no dealings with Robert and William Blackford; I did not know a man named Forbes; I was subpoened on this trial.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is this letter your hand-writing? A. Yes, it is a copy of what was given to me to give notice - I heard the name of Forbes on this business; I do not know a mate of the Malvina - I did not attend at the Mansion-house, and do not know what took place, except from what was published in the papers; I certainly did not think of writing this letter till that appeared in the newspaper - I know nothing of the hand-writing of this note.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q.Were you present when you received the summons to appear at the Mansion-house? A. No; I saw it when I returned from the country - my object in sending this letter to the prisoner was, to give him fair warning that I meant to indict him.</p>
               <p>CHARLES DOD. I received this letter; I never heard of Robert and

            , there mentioned, before - I had seen Mr. Blackford, the chart-seller, before; I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080049"/>observe, that his clerk, Mr. Imray, called on me before he called himself - and said the mate of the ship had come to him, on a representation from our house, for them to supply him with goods; I said I knew nothing of him - but looking at the mate a second time, I said, "I have seen him once before, when he applied to me for a situation in one of my vessels, and having pleaded great distress, I ordered my book-keeper to give him half a crown;" I had no further knowledge of Forbes, but a gentleman, who said his name was Blackford, afterwards called, and said he had given this man credit on the faith of what I had stated to his clerk, that he was a person worthy of credit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is this (Mr. Imray) the young man that called with the mate of the Malvina? A. Yes, I believe he is; I do not know whether the mate's name was Forbes - he might tell me that he had bought charts to the amount of 3l. and a little more; he had come to ask me if he was mate of the ship Malvina - I said I did not know that he was, and never heard of the ship; I mean to state I did not say he was the mate - Forbes did not tell me he had been obtaining credit, or was about to obtain credit with Mr. Blackford; he did not tell me any thing of the kind; I believe this note was produced to me, but I did not read it - I told him I knew nothing of the man, and not to give him credit at all on any recommendation from me, that I swear; the clerk who introduced him into my room is not here to-night, by my wish; I never heard of Messrs. Blackford's, the chart-sellers, but as far as this business goes - I have better employment for my time; Mr. Blackford called on me, and taxed me with having stated to his servant that this man's story was true, and upon this ground he endeavoured to obtain the money; he said on the faith of my representation to his clerk he had given the man credit - I said I had not; he did not, to the best of my recollection, tell me, if I would wait he would go and fetch the clerk; I was never denied by my order -I am never denied unless I am on particular business; Mr. Blackford said as I denied that I made the representation, he would bring the clerk to whom I made it, but that did not intimidate me; I do not recollect whether he said he would bring him that day or the next - I did not stop at home for him - I did not inquire where Mr. Blackford lived, but I believe he stated himself; I did not go to the Minories to look after him - I never was in the house in my life, to the best of my recollection; we received the summons two or three days afterwards - I had not made any communication to Messrs. Blackfords, nor had my clerk by my order; I believe my father did - I had given this man charity, when he called and represented himself to be a mate in distress, with a wife and two or three children; he told Mr. Imray, in my presence, that I knew him - I contradicted him, and said I did not; he then went away, and they trusted him - I told him plainly I would not be responsible for any goods contracted on reference to me; I believe I told him I knew nothing of the house of Graham and Sons - I believe there is no such house in existence - I might say I did not believe there was; I believe I did mention the house of Graham and Sons - I might have seen the names on the note without reading it; I might have looked at it, but surely did not read it through - I did not take notice of who drew it, or on whom it was drawn; I never heard of Mr. Doyle, to the best of my recollection; I never heard the name of Captain

            , or of the ship - I did attend at the Mansion-house - Mr. Robert Doyle appeared there, and the prisoner appeared as his attorney; the case was heard before the Lord Mayor, but was instantly dismissed; the Magistrate might say if I had been a little more explicit the charge would not have been there; the letter in question was written after Mr. Blackford had taxed me with this, to the best of my recollection - Mr. Imray was examined at the Mansion-house - two of my clerks appeared there.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Your time is very much occupied? A. Yes; when this note was produced I was very busy; Mr. Imray produced the note, and the person who called himself Barclay, at the same time - some other name was on the note; he went by two names; he asked if the note was drawn on me if I should pay it - I said it was not drawn on me, seeing Graham and Sons; he spoke of it merely as a monthly note, and said he wanted it cashed - Mr. Blackford's manner was an attempt to frighten me out of the money; I might have answered him very abruptly.</p>

I did not hear it, and believe that it is not true; I was in the room all the time, and swear I do not believe any such thing passed; I did not know Marchant before he and Neale were introduced to me by Ellis; I believe information had been given to him - a person came in who called himself the prisoner's brother-in-law; I believe his name is Kay- he gave me his card; he was not in the room all the time - I was there before him; I think Wintle went out and got some candles to search before he came - it might be five or six minutes before he came; the prisoner was handcuffed before he came in - I am not aware of the Goldsmiths' Company offering any reward for convictions of offences of this sort; I shall be very glad if it is so -I expect to be paid for my time; I never heard of a reward from the Stamp-office, except it was offered before by public print - I have been an officer twenty years; I have no recollection of seeing any watch-movements in the prisoner's room; I found some cases, which he said he had to do for Mr. Fox.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Fox? A. I did not; he has been pointed out to me since with a great many more in the neighbourhood of Bow-street, as a person in the habit of passing these things off - he was in a public-house in Russell-street, on the day the prisoner was examined; witnesses very seldom frequent that house - it is the Albion; it is rather too respectable for witnesses such as they appeared, but they were watched there.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 21st of June I accompanied Ruthven to New-court, to the first floor front room - the prisoner was there, a woman, who states herself to be his wife, and Marchant; I saw Ruthven find the mug and spoon, but did not see him find the dies - Kay, who called himself the prisoner's brother-in-law, came in; we might then have been there five or ten minutes - I saw a basin on the table, with liquid in it; I put a stick into it, to see if there was any thing at the bottom of it, and in the course of the evening I perceived the colour of my coat and trousers had discharged, but I did not at the time know I had spilled any of it on them; I found two punches, but not those in question.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. What have you done with them? A. Here they are - I do not know whether they are used by a watch-movement maker; I believe there is a kind of stamp on them, but what it is I cannot say - I do not remember the woman saying any thing to Marchant; she might without my hearing it - I was searching the room; I did not hear Marchant use Neale's name - he might do so without my hearing it; Kay was detained in the room till we had searched - he might be there a quarter of an hour; the first information I received of this was from the solicitor of stamps, or some person in his office - I am not certain whether it was Mr. Wintle or Mr. Tilsby, both of whom belong to the solicitors' office; the next conversation I had was with Neale - I did not know him before; he calls himself a wind-instrument maker - I was never at his residence; I saw Neale and Marshall two or three times on the day, I went to the prisoner's house - I know they had been together a few days before I went to the prisoner's house - they did not appear to have been acquainted when I first saw them together.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Do you know whether their acquaintance had been much or little? A. I understood they had not been acquainted, till Marchant was employed to go with Neale.</p>

            . I make keys for wind-instruments. I have known the prisoner since April; I had been at his lodgings several times before the 21st of June. On Sunday, the 20th of June, I bespoke some spoons of him; I called on him at eight o'clock on Monday morning and was to have them at twelve - I called at twelve; he said he had been to Petticoat-lane, and could not get any there- he said he had seen a pot in Playhouse-yard, and would go and get that; I went with him - he went into a shop; I stood at the threshold of the door - he pointed to a pot in the window, and asked me if that would do; I said just as he thought proper, (the pot produced is the same) - I saw him buy it, and when he was in the shop he bought a table-spoon and two tea-spoons; I did not know he was going to buy them till I saw them in his hand when he came out of the shop - I returned with him to his lodging, but left before the officers went in; they were stationed at the Black-Bull public-house near - I was present when Marchant received two half-crowns at that house; he went to the prisoner's lodging alone, I staid at the corner of the court - the prisoner's wife went out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080051"/>after Marchant had been up there; I went part of the way with her - she went to buy some binding-wire, as she said when she returned; she was sent out again by her husband for some punches, which, I believe, were never out of the house, for I had seen them in the house that morning on the board - the punches were produced after that, and I saw the prisoner take up a table-spoon, take the punches in his hand, put the iron on his knee, and put the stamps on the spoon with three of the punches - I then went out as if to get some liquor, and the officers went in directly; I remained at the public-house - no mark was put on the mug while I was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first go to any person respecting this business? A. On the 29th of April, I was going to Goldsmiths'-hall, but asked an officer whom I met, to go with me - Nicholls, an officer of Battle-bridge station, was the first person I named it to; he is here -I gave information because I knew he was doing wrong, for I had been to Goldsmiths'-hall with my master's work, who was a jeweller; after seeing Nicholls I went to Goldsmiths'-hall - they sent me to the Stamp-office at Somerset-house; I was not at work as a wind-instrument maker at that time - I left that trade about a year ago; at the time in question I had left Mr. Wood in Harrow-road - he keeps a tavern and eating-house; I used to attend the company in the gardens for an honest living -I was pot-boy; I had been a pot-boy for two years before this transaction.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not tell me this instant that you had left the wind-instrument key-making twelve months ago? A. Twelve months or two years, I do not know the time exactly - it might be a year and a half that I was a potboy; I worked at wind-instrument key making for Mr. Rexter - he retired from the business, and took the Marquis of Cornwallis; I left him before he took that house - he may have had it six months or more; when I worked for him he lived in Nevill's-court, Fetter-lane, and East Harding-street afterwards - it is two years since I did business for him, to the best of my recollection, but I made no memorandum; I worked for him a long time - I lived with Mr. Stevens, a jeweller, in Hatton-garden; I have followed no other trades - I beg your pardon, I was a baker; I forgot that just at the moment - I was apprenticed to a baker, but did not serve my time out, as master ill-used me; he nearly broke my neck with a fire-shovel - I have seen his journeyman here; I have lived pot-boy to Mr. Sims in St. John-street, and to Mr. Tucker opposite him, and a Mr. Lane who came to the house when Sims left - I only remained with him to see that things were right and show him the customers - I did not exactly live with him - he did not turn me out for stealing tobacco and sugar; he did not dismiss me on that charge - he would not pay my wages; I summoned him to Kingsgate-street - if I had robbed him why not take me before a Justice? he did not turn me away nor make a charge against me - Tucker did not turn me away; I and my fellow servant had a bit of a to-do and I left - I was washing after dinner, my fellow servant was rather intoxicated and dipped my head into a bowl of water, I threw the bowl at him and it caused a to-do; my indentures were cancelled at Hatton-garden, as I told the Magistrate I had hardly any food, only a halfpennyworth of cheese and no tea - I was never at a Police-office on any other occasion; I was once a witness - I was never taken to Hatton-garden on a charge of attempting to stab my mistress, nor for embezzlement; I went there to cancel my indentures - my mistress came forward and said I had never paid her for some bread; she was subject to fits and often out of her mind - the Magistrate told her to pull off her bonnet, and she had two caps on; she charged a young woman with stealing her cap - she was a very good mistress, but subject to fits; she did not charge me with threatening to stab her - I did not take the punch to the prisoner's lodging; I never bought a punch for two-pence - I never produced one to the prisoner and asked him if it was King Charles' head, nor did he say it was more like King George; I did not take a salt-spoon from my pocket and stamp it with the punch, to see what impression it made - I have been in the prisoner's room with Kay; the prisoner stamped many a spoon before him - I do not know a woman named Plunket; there was a woman in his room sometimes besides his wife - he would do nothing before her; she was not an acquaintance of mine, she lived in the house - she came into the room on the 21st of June to fetch her child out, not for hot water; I was then sitting down, doing nothing - I was not scraping a spoon; the prisoner was at tea - if the woman came for hot water I was not there; I do not remember the child playing with the mug upon the floor - she did not see me scraping the spoon, and say I was industrious; the prisoner was cautious, as an officer lived on the other side of the way, and he partly knew of the transaction, seeing so many bad characters go up and down.</p>
               <p>Q.How did you become acquainted with the prisoner? A. I met a friend, named Jones, who lived in Sutton-street - he took me to a public-house, where I met one Rodwell, who had worked for my master; I asked what he was about - he said, "Why don't you do as I do?" I said, "Do what" - he pulled out a ring, and said, "Look at that;" I took it, and having been in the line, rubbed it, and it was silver gilt, with the hall mark on it - I knew by the weight and sound that it was not gold - he kicked up a to-do about my rubbing it; I named it to Mr. Nicholls - he said, "Purchase it, and take it to Somerset-house;" they told me to purchase another, and another, which I did - this man used to make them; I was introduced to him by Rodwell; I believe the people at Somerset-house could not do any thing in it, because they were made from the handles of silver teaspoons, with the hall marks on them, and then gilt over - he used to file them out; I had been in communication with the solicitor since May - what I got there was very trifling - 2s. 9d. at a time, to purchase rings, but nothing myself.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were not carrying on trade then, how did you live? A. My wife was carrying on trade - I did not get a farthing from Somerset-house; I expect to be paid for my time; when they could do nothing about the rings, they paid me for my time - I had 3l. 12s. 6d. when it was over, but when I was purchasing the rings I only had 2s. 9d. at a time. (Here the witness referred to a memorandum.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your hand-writing? A.Part of it - I was only looking at the date when the other business about the rings ended - the date is not on it; this was written by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080052"/>Mr. Ivers, the officer, as he can write better than me - I can read it, but shall not let you look at it; I will show it to any gentleman but you.</p>
               <p>COURT. If that is introduced as evidence, the Counsel has a right to it - (Witness handed it in.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do I understand you to say you received no more from Somerset-house except 3l. odd? A. I had money to purchase things - it is all down in that memorandum; I bought about half a dozen spoons of him - they were salt, mustard, and egg spoons; I had money now and then, as I gave him a drop of something to drink - it is all down there.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this 10l. 5s. summed up on the paper? A. I had 3l. 12s. 9d., Nicholls 3l., and Ellis 3l. 7s.; I commenced the second business at Somerset-house on the 10th of June - I received 5s., and 5s., 2s. 6d., and 10s., to buy spoons with, and 5s., and on the 21st of June 1l. - that was to buy spoons, and for what I wanted; I could not be out all day, and have nothing to eat or drink - there might be eight spoons; I bought a pair of buckles of him, and a watch and case, which amounted to 15s. - the mark put on it was so small.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, have you not been endeavouring, from the beginning to the end, to trepan this man for the purpose of getting money for yourself? A. No, I have not -I did it for the sake of my King and country, not to get any thing for myself; when I mentioned it to the officer he would not let me leave it, or I should have declined it; I have worked since the 10th of May at blocking bonnets for my wife - it is just ironing a bonnet over; I expect to be paid for my time - I do not expect they will give me much, except half a crown a day, or something for my trouble; they paid me before at the rate of 2s. 6d. a day - I believe that is all I got; it is down there - I cannot recollect how many days I was employed for them; I live at No. 44, Ironmonger-row, St. Lukes, at Mr. Hills, a watch-case maker - that is not the prisoner's trade; he used to buy watch-cases in Petticoat-lane - there were watch-movements at his place; he used to take watch-cases to pieces, and do them up again for people to go out and trepan others with them - I recollect, a long time ago, his coming into a public-house and selling me a ticket, and on taking out the watch it turned out to be bad; I did not recollect him till he mentioned this to me - I never heard of the Goldsmiths' Company offering a reward for things of this sort; I never gave information against any body but the prisoner - my wife pays the rent of my lodging; I meant, from my first acquaintance with the prisoner, to give information at the hall against him - I did pretend friendship and kindness to him, and deceived him in every step I took; I did not do it for the purpose of gain, but for the good of Goldsmiths'-hall - he ought to be a man of property, from the trade he carried on; I knew a man, named Finney - I never lived with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you leave the neighbourhood of St. John-street? A.Because I heard of another place, and went to it - that was my only reason; when I lived there this man bought a watch - it did not go well; he asked me to buy it - I said I did not want one; I knew a man named Whittington would do it up cheap, and made a bargain to give him 5s. a week for it - I gave him 5s., and being out of work never settled with him, but I intend to do it; I did not pay him out of what I had at Somerset-house, as I expect my wife to be put to bed every day - he did not threaten to charge me with fraud: Nicholls introduced me to Marchant when this business first commenced - I saw him in Ruthven's company, about the spoons; Marchant is a very respectable cabinet-maker and undertaker, he lives at Pentonville; he accompanied me to the house to bear witness of this transaction - I cannot say whether he was examined at the Police-office; he was concerned in the ring business, and went to Somerset-house, but I had the best part of the money - he had money to purchase for himself, nothing else, except if he wanted any thing extra for being out.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q.Have you received any thing whatever from Somerset-house, except to purchase these things, and for your time? A. No, it will not make the least difference to me whether the prisoner is convicted or acquitted.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Thornhill-street, Pentonville. I was introduced to Neale in April, by Nicholls, the beadle - I first saw the prisoner in St. John-street, in the street; I went to his lodgings at different times with Neale, who introduced me to him - I saw him next at his own house, where I went at different times; I was there with Neale on the 21st of June, when he was taken - I went with Neale to the public-house where the officers were, and received two half-crowns from them; I went back to the prisoner's house, and gave them both to his wife in his presence, and she went out - I saw the prisoner take the spoon off the board where it lay with some others, and put it on a flat-iron; he took something out of a tin-box and stamped what he took out of the box - it was like a file; I saw him make three different impressions on the spoon, which the officer afterwards found - he wrapped the things he made the impression with, up in paper, and threw them into a chair alongside where he sat - they were there when the officer came in, and he took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose it was by mere accident that you happened to be there? A. No, it was not; I follow the cabinet business in a respectable way - this took me out of my business; I left nobody to attend to my business - it was at a stand on this occasion for about three months; I do not know that it will be any particular loss to me.</p>

Why, renuming the character of the people I work for - I mean by getting it back again; I am deficient in learning - I mean, by going to the parties I worked for, and getting them to give it me back; I engaged in this by Nicholls, the street-keeper's order, not as a friend of his, but as a friend to my King and country - he asked me to go with Neale, and see if it was as he had said; I left my business, and let it stand still, out of love to my King and country - I have received between 1l. and 2l.; this is the first time I ever embarked in such business - I am a master cabinet-maker; I got the money from Ellis, the officer, at his house, and some from my wife, who is a laundress; and for jobs I did in my trade - my business at home was standing still; I went out jobbing on my own account - I got 2l. from Somerset-house; I did not think of that at the moment - I had the 2l. from Somerset-house, to get a few things to put on my back to appear decent in Court; I have on part of the clothes I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080053"/>bought - I got that 2l. about a week ago; I received no other money at Somerset-house - I never got any with Neale, I am sure; I went there with him six or seven times, and saw the solicitor - he caused one of the clerks in the office to give me the 2l.; I do not mean that he told him to give it me, to make me appear decent in Court - I do not know what he gave it to me for, but I wanted to go decent - I have been living at my wife's expence since April; I have had nothing from Somerset-house except this 2l. - I did not give my business up, only part of it; I am an undertaker and upholsterer - I do not know any other trade that I have carried on; I did not agree with Nicholls that I was to get money for this - he never employed me before; I have been to the prisoner's house a dozen times about the spoons - I had some more spoons of him, and there were some rings in April; I got no money from Somerset-house for that, nor did Neale to my knowledge; I went to the prisoner's three or four times about the rings, and to Somerset-house a dozen times, but never asked for money there till a few days ago, nor do I expect to get any there - I did this out of love to my country, but I find I must stand to my business; I do not expect a farthing more than I have had, nor do I want my expences - I do not know what I might take as a gift if it was offered.</p>

            . I live in Playhouse-yard, Whitecross-street, and am a broker. On the 21st of January the prisoner came to my house, between two and four o'clock, with Neale - there was a small mug hanging in my window; the prisoner came in, and asked to look at it - I took it down, and gave it to him; he made a sort of signal to Neale, who was outside, and he came in - he handed the mug to him, and asked what he thought of it; the words that passed between them was "It will do", or something to that effect - he asked the price; I said 6d. - the prisoner paid me, and asked if I had any more plated articles, had I a spoon - I had one; my wife said she had two teaspoons, which were produced, and put towards them - they came to 6d.; they each looked at them - the prisoner said to Neale, "You will want one;" the prisoner said to Neale, "You shall pay 4d. for that, and I will pay 2d. for the two tea-spoons" - the prisoner paid for the spoons and mug; they put them into their pockets, but which took the table-spoon I cannot say; this is the mug - it had no mark when I sold it; and this is the table spoon, but it had no mark; the plate was not so much off the handle as it is now, but the bowl is the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Neale carry away one of the spoons, at all events? A. I cannot say that - the prisoner would not buy the mug till he referred to Neale to know if it would do, and the spoon was given into his hands for his approbation.</p>

            . I am an inspector of stamps, and have been a silversmith. I was present with the officers when the prisoner was apprehended - I saw some watch-cases in the room; this mug, spoon, and punches were found in a chair in the room - I have examined them - this flat iron was found there; there was a brown pan, which contained a liquid - we call it a pickle in the trade; it is used as a wash to colour plate or copper - it produces a white colour like silver on copper; it will give base metal the appearance of silver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it will have that effect? A. I have seen it used before; I was appointed inspector by the commissioners of stamps - I never saw Neale or Marchant till they came to Somerset-house, to give information of improper practices going on; Neale came first with Nicholls, the officer - I went in, and informed the solicitor, who gave instructions to the officers; I did not hear the first instructions given - I had several interviews with them afterwards; I knew they were employed to detect this man in the forgery - there was no reward whatever to be given; they asked for nothing at the time - they have had money to purchase articles; but I do not think they have had any money given them to live on yet; they were paid for their time in detecting the previous job - I cannot exactly say how much Marchant was paid, but I believe 5s. a day; I think they were each paid alike - there was an end of the first job, and then they came and gave further information; I knew they were employed to detect the prisoner - Neale knew him before he gave the information. I succeeded my family in the business of silversmith - I was in custody before I was employed as an inspector; it was in 1820 I think - I was charged with a similar offence to this, but it was investigated.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it was through the activity of your daughter that the bill against you was thrown out? A. I swear positively my children had nothing to do with it - my eldest child is now only eighteen: I was in custody about three weeks, and was out on bail - before that I was in Clerkenwell prison, and was advised it was not worth while to trouble my friends for bail for so short a time; nobody was charged with me - my father was taken up and tried, but not with me; it was some years ago, when I was quite young - I did not enter into league with these witnesses.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q.What was the first transaction? A. They gave information respecting some silver-gilt rings which the prisoner was making as gold; the officers had money to purchase several, and for the loss of their time; they were paid by the cashier in the solicitor's department - I believe an order was made by the commissioners that they should be paid; I did not see them paid, and have no exact knowledge what it was; I was present when an arrangement was made what they should receive a day - the rings was not a case exactly under the stamp-laws; the pawnbrokers should have procceded against them for fraud; I believe it is now under their consideration. My case was investigated, and the Grand Jury threw out the bill - I was immediately taken into the employ of the Stamp-office; it originated out of a great deal of jealousy in the trade, and was not a prosecution by the Stamp-office, but by the Goldsmiths' Company; they were in correspondence with the Stamp-office - the late Mr. Sykes attended, and immediately after the prosecution I was taken into the service of the solicitor.</p>

            . I am an engraver, and live in Trinity-square, Tower-hill. I am employed by the commissioners of stamps to engrave the King's head on punches to mark gold and silver, and also by the Goldsmiths' Company -(looking at the punches) here is one with a head; this was not made by me; I cannot say it much resembles mine; persons who did not know much about it would take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080054"/>it for the King's head - here is another with a head; it is a mail punch, which is sunk into this to produce the impression - one is used to make the impression on the other, and on receiving the impression it is used to mark the plate; one is concave, and the other convex; this was not made by me - I make all the punches entirely with my own hands, not by others under my inspection; I know of nobody else who makes for the government.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do they appear to be counterfeits made to resemble yours, and to produce an impression similar to yours? A.When they are put on plate I have no doubt persons would be deceived.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Look at this spoon? A. Here is a head on it, which is impressed from this punch - this would deceive persons not conversant with it, but silversmiths would perceive it immediately, I suppose - it would deceive persons not acquainted with the form of my punch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Which mark do you call the impression of the King's head? A. The centre one; I cannot see a likeness of the king on it - if I saw it on a piece of copper I should undoubtedly say it was a head, but silversmiths or judges ought to know it was not genuine - it is very bad.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Does it appear to you to be an imitation of the genuine stamp? A. I hardly know how to answer - the arrangement of the stamps is quite different from the Goldsmiths' Company's; they do not stand in the same order - I think it would deceive persons not conversant, but it is so badly done, it hardly bears a resemblance.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it likely to impose on a person buying a spoon, as a stamp denoting that it was silver? A. Yes, I think so.</p>

            . I am senior assayer to the Goldsmith's Company, and have been there twenty years. I am in the habit of using their punches daily: I do not stamp plate now, but have done it - the mark on this spoon is not a genuine impression of any punch made for the Company; I consider it a resemblance of the punch of the King's head used by them; and such as would deceive the public, though not a person conversant with the marks; the Company employ nobody but Mr. Smith to make their punches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say this is not merely two bumps, and not any resemblance of a head? A. It is as much a resemblance of a head as most forged marks.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Is it what you in the trade call a counterfeit of the King's head? A. Yes.</p>

            . My husband is a flour-porter to Ambridge and West, of St. John-street - I live in the same house as the prisoner. On the 21st of June I went into his room for some hot water for tea, my child was there with me - the prisoner's wife and Marshall, as I call him, was there; I saw Neale there - the prisoner was not there then; Neale had a half-pint pot and a table-spoon in his hand - Marshall sat still in a chair; Neale was cleaning the spoon and scraping it; I said, "You had better turn housemaid as you are cleaning a spoon;" he then looked at Marshall and laughed; I could swear to the spoon which he had - after that my child was playing with the pot - that is the very pot and that the spoon; the child was on the floor -I was going to take the pot out of its hands, as I was going down stairs, and Mrs. Bispham said, "Don't take the pot out of the child's hands, let him play with it;" he had come in while I was there; Neale said to the prisoner,"Will you have a drop of gin?" he made no answer; Neale went to the cupboard, took a bottle, and went out for the gin; I went down stairs, and afterwards heard an alarm of the officers.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q.About what time was this? A. About half-past six o'clock; I got my hot water and went out - Neale was coming in with the gin as I went down stairs - he was alone: I had sat there a few minutes waiting for the water to boil - I was in the room as good as half an hour waiting for the water; Neale came in in ten minutes, and the prisoner ten minutes after him - I was often in their room, and frequently saw Neale there and Marchant; I have seen the prisoner at work cleaning watches - I never saw him at work on rings or spoons; I saw him solder a ring which I had picked up - that was the same afternoon; I never saw any thing in his room but watches, and the inside of watches - I was never in the room before when Neale and Marshall were there; I have seen them pass up and down, and have answered them often when they have been out; I never saw them in the room before the Monday; I have lived there since Christmas - the prisoner was there at that time; I first saw Neale there a week or two ago, I think, but cannot say exactly. I was standing outside, holding my baby up in my arms to Bispham, when the officers came; I had not been drinking - I have seen the prisoner cleaning watch-cases - he cleaned a watch for my husband; I have seen watch-cases in the room with the works which he cleaned - the officer came in five or six minutes after I met Neale on the stairs; he had said he would go out for more gin, but I was not there then.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you remember seeing Neale go out after bringing in the gin? A. I did; I was standing at the door - he was out when the officer came.</p>
               <p>ROBERT KAY. I am the prisoner's cousin; a few days before the prisoner was taken - I saw Neale in the prisoner's room; he showed me a punch - it was in the morning; he took it out of his pocket, and said it was the head of King Charles, and that he had bought it at an old iron shop for 2d.; the prisoner looked at it, and said it was 
               <persName id="t18300708-93-person682">George</persName>
             the 4th. - Neale pulled two spoons out of his pocket, and marked one first with it - he stamped it on one of the spoons to see the impression; I am certain he is the person who brought the punch into the room - he pulled it out of his waistcoat pocket; the prisoner is a watch-frame maker - that is all the works inside; I am in the watch line.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you ever work with him?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080055"/>A. No, nor assist; I now work at Wandsworth in the engineer line - I worked at the watch business about a week ago; I worked with my father for three or four years - he is a watch-maker, and lives at No.22, Eagle-court, St. John's-lane; I often go to the prisoner's to see him, he being my cousin and only companion - I was there every night, and two or three times a day; I live within two or three stones' throw of him - I never saw him at work on rings; I have seen rings in the room often, many; he bought them to sell again - from what I understand they were gold; he used to buy them of Mr. Sell, of Barbican; I might take one of them up - I knew there were marks on them, for I bought one of him about six weeks ago, just before I was married - it was in pledge for 5s. - he gave me the duplicate; I have seen him pawn one or two rings when I have been up and down there - I have seen watch-cases in the room, metal, silver, and all manner of cases; he had jobs to do to them for people - he had the movements and all with them; he polished the cases up, when he put the works in, he has just brushed them up; we generally brush them up when we have them to repair; I never sold rings or watch-cases for him to my knowledge; I cannot call it to memory - I never pawned any for him; I should not like to swear I never sold any, but I cannot remember it; a duplicate of a suit of clothes was found in his possession which I claimed - I had left the duplicate there; I was going to get them out on Saturday night, but my wife was disappointed in getting the money; they were pawned for 12s.; and a duplicate of a waistcoat was found, which I claimed - I have seen spoons there at tea time, and I saw that spoon and salt-spoons, but no others; I never saw him do any thing to spoons; I do not know what they were there for - they were of a copper colour, yellow; I did not afterwards see them white; I saw this spoon there the day he was taken; I went there about eleven or half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, staid about half an hour, returned between one and two, and saw the prisoner and Neale come in with it - Neale had bought that and the pot in Playhouse-yard; the pot he said was for his child - and then I went to work about a quarter to two o'clock; the spoon was put on the table - I went there again when the officers were in the place.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.You saw the spoon there the day he was taken, but not before? A. Not before; I think my brother was handcuffed after I entered the room.</p>

               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. Did you ever hear him examined on oath? A. Yes, at the Court of Requests; he summoned me for wages which he said were due to him; he recovered them by giving representations to the Court, which I afterwards found to be untrue - that is one reason why I would not believe him; I lost property at various times while he was with me, and when I discharged him I would not let him go up to his room - the servant brought his things down, and under his bed found a great quantity of tobacco and sugar, I have no doubt he concealed it; nobody but him occupied the room, and he received money on my account and kept it - I gave the Court of Requests a list of monies he said were coming to me; I went with the officer to several places - no such persons lived there, and at the rest I found he had received the money, and never paid it over to me; before I got home from the Court he went to a customer, and demanded a debt - he insisted on their paying him and not me; I lost 3l. by these transactions.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is your opinion founded on your observation of his general conduct and character? A. It is; his character is exceedingly immoral and bad.</p>

I would not believe him on his oath.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. Do you know of his having been beaten by his master? A. Yes, but he well deserved it - he went himself to the office, and complained of that; his indentures were not cancelled for that, but his bad behaviour - his mistress was subject to fits; his mistress had not two caps on at the office; she was not desired to take her bonnet off that I know of - she charged him with threatening to stab her; I was a witness - he did not attempt it; it was a threat.</p>

On the 31st of May I shut the shutters in his Lordship's study, which is on the first floor, over the porter's hall, about nine o'clock; there was then a small French clock on the chimney-piece, and the opera-glass on the table - I left the still room about half-past ten that night; there were some silver spoons in a small jar in a glass-case, where they are kept, and two brown earthen tea-pots, one with a silver spout and the other a silver rim round the spout; I got up at half-past seven o'clock next morning, and missed about eighteen spoons - I am sure there were fifteen; they were not worth more than 2l.: the silver spout was twisted off a tea-pot, and the other tea-pot was gone - I went into the study, and found half the shutter open; I missed the clock and opera-glass - Elizabeth Green is the still-room maid: I saw her at work the night before, on a gown and piece of lace, which were missing - the sweeps had not been ordered that morning.</p>

            . I am a chimney-sweep, and live in Pye-street, Westminster. I was in the House of Correction for dusting, which is taking ashes with the servants' leave - Riddle was also there: he was discharged before me - he asked me a few days before he went out, what I meant to do for a living when I got out; I said if I could not get a place I should take a basket on my head, and sell things about the streets, as my father and mother had been accustomed to do; I was locked up with him two or three nights, and had conversation with him - I said I should sell things in the streets; he said, "Oh, d-n it, I would not do that - I have been at work at two or three houses for Mr. Anderson, and know where to go and get plenty of money, if you choose to go with me;" he mentioned two or three houses - I took notice of Lord Roseberry's, but cannot recollect any other; he said he went there to take a cowl off the top of a chimney - that he went up stairs, and searched two or three rooms, and in one room in particular he pulled open a drawer, and found a lot of money, and that he only took half a crown, being fearful of being found out when he went home to his master's; he said he knew where there was plenty of silver and gold laying about down stairs in the still-room or pantry - there was plenty of plate, spoons, and other things, and would I go with him; I said, "No, I never did such a thing in my life, and won't do it now;" he said he went to work there the other morning with Kondering, and in the kitchen saw plenty of things which he could have brought away if he had liked; he went out on the Friday, and promised to come to the gate and meet me the day I came out; I told him I did not want him, for I should have somebody there to meet me - he said he knew how to get into Lord Roseberry's house, and knew his way about it - that the porter opened the door with a string and did not get out of his bed, which had a curtain round it; he said he was to go about half-past three o'clock in the morning, and the porter would open the door and let him in, if he said he came from Mr. Anderson, of North-row; I saw Kondering on the Saturday night after I came out, and told him what the prisoner told me.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ, and in consequence of information, I went on the 3rd of June to Mr. Fleming's, Fleet-market, and found eight knives, which I knew to be mine - I got an officer, and took the prisoner at his lodgings, at a court on Bennet's-hill, and asked him to give me the duplicate of the knives he had pawned; he denied all knowledge of the transaction - and while he was being searched he said if I would forgive him he would produce the duplicates; I said, No - on the way to the Compter he stopped and asked if I would look over it and let him go; I said, No - I have not found the duplicates; I had seen the knives about the 31st of May; he had nothing to do with them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not, when you gave me in charge, tell you I had received the knives from your son to pledge? A. I cannot recollect whether he did or not; he said so at the Mansion-house - I do not recollect his saying it in the room; my son was employed in my business, and is twenty-eight years old - I have not seen him since that day.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How long has the prisoner been in your service? A. Nine months - he knew my son had no authority to give him the things.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You observed nothing about him? A. No; he looked respectable, which made me not observe him - there were several sea-faring men in my house that night; Courtney's shipmate did not go into his room; I saw none of them there that night - the prisoner might have a dozen waistcoats on without my noticing him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you ask Clark how he came possessed of the property? A. Yes, he said it belonged to a friend of his who would be there in a few minutes - he pointed out Jones; he did not say then that Jones had received them of another person, but he did before the Magistrate.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. About half-past two o'clock, on Wednesday afternoon, I was going along Long-acre; the prosecutor called me to take Jones - Jones said it was Mr. Davis' property; I took the two prisoners to the watch-house, and in Jones' hat I found the duplicates of two saws, which had been pawned that day - I found no duplicates on Clark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Then Clark never owned the property? A. Not in my hearing; I went on the opposite side, and took Jones - he did not come across; I went to the Blue Posts - Clark said before the Magistrate that they had the saws of a man, who was inxtoxicated, at the Blue Posts - I did not hear there had been three persons there; only two.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN BIRDSEYE REEVE. I am a pawnbroker. I have two saws, pawned by Jones, on the 5th of June.</p>


               <p>Jones' Defence. I hope you will look mercifully upon me - a man at the Blue Posts asked Clark or me to pawn some tools for him; I agreed to pawn two saws for 4s. 6d., and gave him the money - he said if the dupli<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080061"/>cate was of any use I might keep it; he afterwards got us to pledge more things, and gave the basket to Clark, telling him to walk on, and he would overtake us.</p>

Yes, Mr. Nicholson said it might be the case - if these shoes are in the indictment it is a mistake; he said this knife was his own - I cannot swear to that; he said one of these brushes was Mr. Wissett's, and the other his own; he never had Mr. Wissett's clothes to brush - he had Nicholson's, but he could not say he brushed them with this brush; I will not swear he said he took this brush home with Nicholsotn's clothes- the hat was on the shop-board half-way behind the door, and the waistcoats were covered with a handkerchief - I do not know how long the hat had been there; I had not been in five minutes - I did not hear Nicholson say if he would confess he took them he should be discharged; the shopmen have been on good terms with the prisoner as far as I know - there was no question about which of the five was to leave; he sometimes went home without his hat, sometimes without his coat, and sometimes with it on his arm - I never heard about one of the five persons having to leave because the baker's bill was too heavy; I never heard Mrs. Wissett say that - I will not swear she did not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been making any search in the neighbourhood? A. No - I have not heard of any thing but what I have produced; the search was made as soon as I had locked him up - these shoes were under the bed; I do not know how they came to be in the indictment - Mr. Nicholson said they were Mr. Wissett's, and then we found they were not.</p>

I took the prisoner about thirteen yards from the prosecutor's - he and another man were carrying the tub of butter; they let it fall and ran away when they saw me - I ran, and took the prisoner about three quarters of a mile from the place- I know he is one of the persons; he had some butter on his hands and on his hat; there were 90 lbs. of butter in the tub.</p>

             re-examined. There is no truth in that - I never said so; I sent another saddle to be repaired a week before, which he paid 7s. 6d. for; I had said before that I wanted a saddle - the prisoner took me to Collis', and I saw one which they wanted 3l. for; I left 2l., and said if my employer liked it I would return and pay for it, or pay for the use of it - I took it to the stable; I sent back for the stirrups and girths - my master rode on it, and approved of it; I called in the evening for some longer stirrup leathers - Mr. Collis' man said he was gone out, but would soon return; this was on Saturday - I did not call on Sunday or Monday, but on Tuesday I went to clean my harness, and missed my new saddle; I asked a man where it was - he said the prisoner had taken it to be altered; I went out, and saw the prisoner intoxicated, eating some wilts - I asked him whether he had got the leather to the new saddle; he said, "It is all right;" I then went to Mr. Collis', and saw the saddle on the horse- Mr. Collis said the man had brought it back, and said the gentleman did not like it; that he had given him the 2l. back, and he had paid 7s. 6d. for the use of it for the three days - I then went after the prisoner, and found him in Marylebone-lane; I asked him if he had spent the money - he said Yes, and was very abusive; I had him taken into custody.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH PITCHFORD. I was in the stable on the morning of the 21st of June, I believe; I was in Lord Winchelsea's brother's service, and since then have been to Melton Mowbray - since then I have been helping in different yards; I went to the Golden Cross yard to see a man named Fisher, who has some horses standing there- I saw Warringe there, and the prisoner was asking him for some money for the work he had done for him; he did not mention any sum, but said, "I want some money to get something to eat and drink, and to get a clean shirt" - Warringe said he had no money, but there was an old saddle which belonged to him, and he would get him to sell it for him; we then went and had some beer - I went before the Magistrate, and stated this; this was between twelve and two o'clock - it was not on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>MR. COLLIS. This saddle was brought to me on Tuesday morning, between nine and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WARRINGE. I never at any time said,"Here is an old saddle belonging to me, go and sell it;" he did ask me for money - I cannot say that I owed him any thing, for I sometimes gave him a pot of ale for any thing he did; I believe he did tell me on Saturday evening that he wanted a shirt; I gave him 1s. now and then when I had it - the new saddle suited my master, and we intended to keep it; we have bought it again; there was 1l. 7s. 9 1/2d found on the prisoner, which the Magistrate ordered to be returned.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made a long Defence, the only part relating to the case was, that the prosecutor had sent him to dispose of the saddle.</p>

I do not know how far he got before he was taken; he gave me back two shillings, and said he threw the other two away - we found them; we got the whole four back.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Where had you been? A.With a friend; we had drank a quart or three pints of beer after dinner, and at dinner I had about half a pint of porter - I was perfectly sober: there were no lamps - it was not very dark; my breeches were not down, but they were unbuttoned - I gave charge of the prisoner directly; I did not say that I had lost 5s., then 7s. 6d., then 10s., and then 14s. 6d. - I think the prisoner had 1l. 1s. 8d. on her in all, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>MARK KING. I heard the alarm - I went up, and saw some men near the prisoner; she was running - the men followed me up the lane, but when I took the prisoner I lost sight of them; the prosecutor accused her of robbing him; he seemed to me to be sober - she denied it at first, but in going along she said she would undo her pocket, and give it me - there was 1l. 1s. 2d. in it; in going to the watch-house she said she would give him the money if he would say nothing about it: I found five half-crowns on her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was there not some conversation about taking the money, and she said rather than have any piece of work she would give him the money? A. No - I think it was twenty minutes before I offered to search the prisoner; she could not have thrown it away without my seeing it - I should think not five minutes elapsed from my hearing the cry till I came up.</p>

On Friday, the 2nd of July, James came to our shop to try some Wellington boots - we fitted him with some, and he did not like them; we promised to get him some in half an hour, and he went out; Kennerley then came in, and asked if he had bought any thing - we said No; in a short time Schofield was brought in with this pair of shoes, which were missing.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNERLEY. I was near the prosecutor's shop, and saw the two prisoners skulking about; I told Betraun of them - they then went to a mews, and there changed coats; they came up again, and James went to this shop - when he came out I saw something in his left-hand coat pocket; Schofield had been close outside the shop - they went together down a street; I went into the shop, and asked if James had bought any thing; they said No - I came out, and told Betraun; we went down Blenheim-street, and saw the prisoners - Schofield came and abused me; I saw Betraun go and pick something off a dung-hill, close by where the prisoners had been - Shofield was taken at that time, and James about five o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>ANGELIOUS BETRAUN. I saw the two prisoners together; they went through the market - I went over, and saw Schofield near the shop, and the other in it; they then joined, and went down Blenheim-steps, into a mews - I saw James near a dung-hill; I felt his pockets, but he had nothing, and I let him go - Schofield was abusing Kennerley, and I went and took him: a man told me where the shoes were, and I found them - James was taken afterwards.</p>

               <p>JAMES KENNAIRD. I am a labourer.

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 8th of June I was going home, and saw the three prisoners together, looking into an oil-shop window in Norton-falgate; Angier went into the shop, he then came out, and they all went away; I went into the oil-shop, and then followed them - they went on towards Shoreditch church, and looked into a watch-maker's shop; Angier went in there and came out - then they went to another shop; I followed them down Church-street, Bethnal-green - they all three tried the door of an undertaker's-shop; they went on to a clothes-shop, and went into the passage, one after the other; I still followed them, and at last I saw Angier go into Gregory's shop, the other two stood outside - Angier came out again; I went in and asked Mrs. Gregory if she missed any thing - she then looked, and said she had; I went and took them - they were altogether, resting their hands on their hands on some butts - Rogers walked away when he saw me, and I followed him; he ran, I made a spring and jumped on his back - I took off his hat, and found this handkerchief in it; my partners took the others - they searched them at a public-house, they had no money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How long have you been in the Police? A. From the beginning of it; I had taken a great many thieves before; the Chairman of the Quarter Sessions has not refused to take any case on my representation; I was not ordered out of Court the other day - I was not accused of buying cotton handkerchiefs, and charging boys with stealing them; I was not in my Police dress when these prisoners were taken - I was then off duty - I saw them go into shops and ask the price of things; I found nothing on Angier.</p>

I have known Lilley six or seven years; she lives not far from me - I met her in Tottenham-court-road, and asked how she was; this was last Tuesday three weeks, about two o'clock in the day - she said she was very poorly; the other prisoner was with her - I said I had nothing with me, but if she would stop till I came back I would give her something to drink; I then left them, and went up to my husband's mistress - when I came back they were gone; I observed that Lilley seemed surprised - I went home about half-past two o'clock; my door was then broken open, and all the property stated was gone - I had locked the door and had the key; it was the back attic - there are six rooms in the house, and a private door which goes on a pulley; I went to a constable, and while I was talking to him the prisoners came up - Lilley spoke to me; she seemed very much confused, and I said, "This is a pretty circumstance that has happened" - she said, "What is it?" I said, "I have been robbed;" she said, "Dear me, you surprise me" - Goodyear ran away; Lilley then said,"You and the Policeman are very welcome to search my room" - I had said I suspected her; we went, but found none of the property there, but while we were there Goodyear was taken by another officer - they were both taken to the watch-house, and next morning to Marylebone office; the Magistrate ordered Good year's room to be searched - I went there, and found the bonnet, shift, and stockings, this piece of cloth and some other things; I had heard the night before where she lived - I found nothing of mine at Lilley's, but there was a towel mangled, and I had lost one like it; it has no mark, but I lost one in the state this is - it was taken at the time the other things were.</p>
               <p>JOHN NAISH. The prosecutrix applied to me on the night of the 22nd of June, and said her door had been broken and she had been robbed - I went in search of Goodyear, and after some time we found where she lodged, but she was out; I went out and met the two prisoners - I took Lilley; the next morning I got this property from Goodyear - I found sixty-two duplicates at Lilley's.</p>
               <p>DAVID COLLINS. I was on duty the same night, and the prosecutrix came and stated the case to me - I took Goodyear, and in going along she threw away a skeleton-key which opened her own room, and next morning I found this property; I told her she threw away the key.</p>
               <p>Lilley's Defence. The prosecutrix asked me to treat her - I said I had laid out the last shilling and could not; she said she was going for money, and would treat me, but did not tell me to wait - she lives with a man they call Blackguard Jack, and walks Oxford-street every night; she knows more of my husband than me.</p>
               <p>Goodyear's Defence. I met the prosecutrix, but we did not wait for her; I then met a young woman in St. Giles', who said she was going to her place to get some things - she brought them to me, and I took them home to keep for her, as she told me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q.When did you see them again? A. On the Friday morning -I had not seen Trant till Thursday afternoon, about five or six o'clock; there was another person with him - there was nothing to prevent their straying from where I kept them - Steers told me that Trant was the owner of the herbage in the parks; he did not say he was forbidden to have more than three hundred sheep at a time, nor that he never let stray sheep go, till they paid for the herbage - the fold is in the hollow near Kensington-gardens; Waugh told me to look over the fold, and I did, but my sheep were not there, either on Wednesday or Thursday, when I went.</p>

            . I am a drover. On Wednesday, the 9th of June, about four o'clock, or a little after, I saw Trant at his fold in Hyde-park - he drove some sheep and lambs up towards the fold, and called Waugh, his shepherd (who was not with him then), and asked if he knew the marks of those sheep and lambs - he said No; he also asked me if I knew the marks; I told him No, I did not - Trant said, "There are eighteen of them, there will be 18d. to pay for them;" I did not notice the marks - he pulled his watch out, and said, "It is a quarter-past four o'clock, William; some of the sheep have broken over, and by the time you bring the others up it will be nearly five, to fold them;" none of the eighteen had broken into his fold - Waugh fetched the sheep up, and they were put into the fold with these eighteen sheep and lambs; this was at the fold in Hyde-park - I had to take four lambs of a master butcher's, which had been there to grass, and Waugh had to take ten home - we went home with them together; Trant takes in sheep to graze for butchers - I saw Hempson at Smithfield on Thursday morning; I went with him to Waugh's house that night, and reminded him of what occurred in the park - he said it had quite slipped his memory, but he would show Mr. Hempson where Trant lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You were attending sheep in the park? A. Yes; it was about folding time - I cannot say whether Waugh heard Trant say there would be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080069"/>18d. to pay; I believe the number of sheep in the park is limited, and if there are above that number they are taken to another place - Trant rented the herbage of Hyde-park and Regent's-park.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. We admit he was not allowed to keep more than three hundred and fifty sheep in Hyde-park.</p>
               <p>JOHN STEERS. There might be two hundred sheep in the fold or more; I cannot swear there was not two hundred and fifty.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Were all the sheep in the park in the fold? A.There were a few store things out in the park - I could see all that were there; I should judge there were not above two hundred and thirty or two hundred and eighty - I did not go all over the park, because the sheep are kept together; I was not there on Thursday, and cannot say how many more might come in then - they come in and out almost every day; it might be five o'clock when I went away.</p>
               <p>MR. HEMPSON. I first saw the fold on Wednesday evening between six and seven o'clock, my sheep could not be there then, for I looked the fold over well; I could not have overlooked them - I will venture to swear there were not two hundred there; the G. on my sheep was so visible it must be seen.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FOX. I am in Trant's service. On Wednesday evening, the 9th of June, I had the keys of the fold at Regent's park - I left at six o'clock; these sheep and lambs were not there then, I am sure; I went at six in the morning to attend the flock, and these sheep were there then -Trant was not there; he sent his nephew to me, and I saw him about nine o'clock that morning; he said, "Here are eighteen sheep and lambs which I found going to be taken to the green-yard, if any person should come for them you are not to let them go out without my leave;" I saw one marked S. on the hip - I did not notice what was on the back of the others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Waugh is the shepherd at Regent's-park? A. Yes, I am under him; I had not let some stray sheep go once before - I had only been there a month; he did not say any body was welcome to look at them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Where are the sheep kept in Regent's-park? A.Between Clarence and Hanover gates, close to the road; people going along can see them.</p>

On Thursday night, about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock, I went with Hempson to Lisson-grove, and took Waugh; I went and knocked at Trant's door - a woman answered; Trant at last put his head out of the window - I said I had come about the sheep which he had stolen; he said he had stolen no sheep - I waited a few minutes, and then knocked two or three times; he looked out again - I said I had an information against him for sheep stealing, and if he did not come down I should he obliged to break open the door; be put on his clothes and came down - I told him it was a serious charge; he said he had got the sheep in Regent's-park, and we could have them in the morning.</p>

On Friday night, the 21st of May, at half-past ten o'clock, I locked my mare up safe in the stable; I live fifty-nine miles from Hyde-park corner - I missed her at seven next morning - also a saddle, bridle, rug, and halter; I came to London directly by coach, and published hand-bills that afternoon, offering 15l. reward on conviction - and on the 27th I received a letter, came to town again that night (Monday), went to Shadwell with the officer, and saw my mare, saddle, bridle, rug, and halter - they were all what had been taken on the 21st.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DANIELS. Q.Where is the stable? A.Between my house and shop, rather behind, about ten yards from my house; I had two horses, but one was not at home -I had only one in the stable. I swear that I locked the stable door myself - I had rode to Winchester that afternoon on this mare. and called at several houses there; I was not in any jovial society - I dined about half-past twelve o'clock before I started - I had half a pint of ale at Winchester, which is seven miles from my house; and I think I had one glass of brandy and water, or sherry and water, at the White Swan, which is the only public-house I called at; I took nothing at any friend's house - my lad, who looked after the mare, came to my bed-room door at six o'clock, and on going to the stable I found it open and the property gone - it locks twice; one bolt was forced back once, and being double doors they could then open them; I do not know how they had forced it back - I found a window open, and by getting in at it they could open the doors; I swear I fastened the window at night.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Had you seen the prisoner about your premises? A. No; I never trusted him with the mare.</p>

            . I am a coal-merchant, and have a stable at Shadwell which I let to the prisoner on the 10th of May, and delivered him the key - he said he was in the habit of coming to London occasionally, and wanted a place to put a horse and cart in; I saw the mare in question in the stable, but not when Ward was present - I saw it after it had been taken away by the headborough; the prisoner is club-footed with both feet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A.Never; I said he was a stranger to me, and I should expect a reference; he referred me to a Mr. Deen - I saw him again once before he was apprehended - I am certain of him; he came to me about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon; I went to Deen, who lives in the neighbourhood - I might be there a quarter or half an hour; the prisoner was in my house at that time; I should think he was in my company from a quarter to half an hour - he went with me each time to the stable.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Have you a doubt about him? A.Not the least; the stable is in Pope's-hill, Lower Shadwell.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew the stable well? A. Yes; it was locked - Holmes got in at the loop-hole, and opened the door by forcing the lock; a man could easily get in,</p>

            . I am a jobber. On Saturday, the 23rd of May, I was applied to, to go to the stable in Pope's-hill, by a tall-looking gentleman in a green coat -I did not take notice of any body with him; I never saw the prisoner till he was at the Thames police-office - I went over the water with the gentleman on the Sunday, after a mare that had been taken out of the stable; I went into the stable on the Saturday and cleaned two horses for the gentleman; he gave me one shilling for it- I did not see the prisoner then.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the mare claimed by Mr. Ward? A. Not since I cleaned her - I do not know that that was his; I was taken into custody on the Monday evening, and detained for a month - I was sworn before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect yourself, and tell me what happened when the man in a green coat hired you? A. I was standing at the top of St. Margaret's-hill - the gentleman came up and asked me to go and clean two horses for him; there was a person with him - I cannot say who it was; I have no notion whether it was the prisoner or not - there was nothing about him which I noticed.</p>
               <p>MARY ALLEN. I live on Pope's-hill; my house joins Hoskins' stable. On Saturday, the 22nd of May, two horses came there about three o'clock in the afternoon - one was in a chaise-cart, and the other was rode by a man - they went to Hoskins' stable; the gentleman that rode the horse went round to Mr. Deen for the key, and when he came back he said the man was gone away, and he was a d-d pretty fellow to go with the key - they broke into the stable - the horse that was rode appeared very dirty; I do not recollect how either of the men were dressed - I believe the prisoner is the man who rode in the chaise-cart; he had two clubbed feet -I took particular notice of him; I saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A miller's wife; I stood at my door to see the horse come in - I take in work, and often sit at the door to work and nurse my children; horses seldom come by my door - I never saw the prisoner before that day; the chaise-cart was enclosed on each side; I saw him come out of the chaise - the young man with him broke into the stable, and opened the door for him to put the horse in.</p>

            . I am a livery stable-keeper and hackney-man. On the 10th of May I let a chaise-cart and harness to a young man who called himself Frederick; he hired it for two days, and said he might be gone two or three days longer - I saw no more of the chaise till I found it in the officer's possession; I let the chaise to Frederick before, and on one occasion, when he brought it back, the prisoner was with him - I saw him talking to Frederick in the street; that was before the 10th - my chaise was found in the stable at Shadwell, nearly a month after I let it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you swear to the prisoner? A. I saw him once talking to Frederick, in Whitechapel-road; I do not know where Frederick is - I have not seen him since he hired the chaise, on the 10th.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was there never an occasion on which the prisoner, jointly with the other persons, hired the cart of you? A.Not in my presence.</p>
               <p>ROBERT FEYER. On Sunday morning, the 23rd of May, about ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner looking down Pope's-hill, towards the stable; he stood there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him looking towards the stable more than once that morning? A. Twice; he went away a little, and came back again - he was two or three hundred yards from the stable; he stood there looking two or three minutes both times - I saw him come from Shadwell-market, not in a direction from the stable.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DEEN. I keep the Three Compasses, Shadwell-market. I was surety to Hoskins for the rent of this stable - I have known the prisoner altogether fourteen or fifteen years, but but for the last seven years, I had only seen him twice previous to becoming surety for him; I saw him at my house on the Saturday before he was taken - there was a tall young man with him, who went by the name of Fred - it was about three o'clock in the afternoon; Fred had a greenish coloured coat, to the best of my recollection - I have heard Fred called Reynolds and Smith; they left my house about eight o'clock, or between that and nine, but Fred had gone out in about half an hour, and was gone a considerable time - he came back after the prisoner, and they left soon after nine; Fred returned a short time before they left - I did not hear them say where they came from; I did not notice whether they were splashed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not sworn it was on Sunday, the 23rd, that you saw them? A. No, I cannot state the day of the month; I swear it was on a Saturday - I did not see either of them on Sunday, and never said so; I have not seen Fred since - I was sworn before the Magistrate; I was not charged with taking the mare - I was not in prison, nor bailed; I was taken with a warrant, but was only in custody from my house to the office.</p>

            . I am a headborough of Shadwell. On the 24th of May I was sent for Little, by his father, and in consequence of what he told me, I took him before the Magistrate; I went next day in pursuit of the prisoner, and saw him, after four hours' search, in Laystall-street, Gray's Inn-lane; I and Whitwell observed him, run towards him, and took hold of his arms - he said,"Don't hurt me, I will go with you quietly;" I told him I apprehended him on a charge of felony. and if he was the person, was his name James Brooks - he said Yes; I asked where he lived - he made no reply: I again said,</p>
               <p>"Where do you live?" or "Where do you lodge?" he said, "I suppose you will know where I lodge to-night;" I said Yes, I did; after asking him several questions, I said, "Do you keep the stable, for the rent of which Mr. Deen has become answerable?" he said, "How can I keep it if Mr. Deen has become answerable for the rent?" I took him to a public-house about two hundred yards from where I apprehended him, and there we asked whether he was not at the stable, or in Shadwell, on Sunday last - I repeated the question as to Shadwell the second time, and he said, "I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080071"/>have not been there since Saturday night;" we asked him several questions, but he gave us no answers - we took him to the Thames Police, in a coach, and in the coach Whitwell was looking stedfastly at him; he said, "What the h-ll are you looking at me for?" on his person I found 18s. 7d., a snuff-box, and a strop; he was examined five or six times - the mare was at the stable: I showed it to Ward there, and he claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear whether the prisoner was married? A. I believe he said so at the office - he was five or six times examined before he was committed; that was for the purpose of apprehending two others - it was in answer to Whitwell that he said he had not been to the stable since Saturday - he went quietly; there were three of us.</p>
               <p>MARY ALLEN re-examined. The horse the man was riding seemed very dirty; I did not notice whether it was fatigued - I did not take such particular notice of the horse in the chaise cart, and cannot say whether it was dirty or not, for the cart bid the horse.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LITTLE. I went into the stable between three and four o'clock on Saturday afternoon; there were three horses there, only two of them were dirty - I do not think one was more dirty than the other; they seemed rather fatigued - I did not notice whether one was more fatigued than the other; they were both brown mares, and the third which I did not clean, was brown - that was not dirty; I was about an hour in the stable: I went again on Sunday morning, between nine and ten o'clock - I saw the horses last in the stable between eleven and twelve on Sunday; I left about eleven - the two horses I cleaned were standing in the stable - all three were in one stall; neither of the mares had a bridle or saddle on on Saturday.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BAYFORD. It was a chaise-cart and harness that I let, but no horse.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HOSKINS. I did not go into the stable after letting it, till after the 23rd.</p>
               <p>JAMES WHITWELL. I seized the horses about ten o'clock on Sunday morning - Little was not there then; I found only two mares then - I had been to the stable about half-past eight or nine o'clock that morning; there were then three mares there - I returned about half-past nine, and one was gone; that belonged to Mr. Holmes - I knew it before, for three or four years.</p>

            . Q.Which man handed the bay mare to the stable? A. I did not notice; I did not tell the Magistrate the other man rode the bay mare to the stable, and came first - the man that rode it went round for the key to Deen's, before the prisoner came down; the prisoner's cart was going by my door when I first saw him- he was driving it, and the man with the horse had then hung his horse on the stable, and was gone round to Deen's for the key; I first saw Brooks in the chaise, but did not see the other man till he came back from Deen's - I did not see them come together; the bay mare was fastened to the stable door by the reins, at the time Brooks drove down with the chaise.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Then you did not see in what direction the man came? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the mare till ten o'clock on Saturday morning, when I met the other man at Kingston with it, and he came home with me to the stables; I never saw her again till she was taken away - it was my own horse that I drove in the cart; they were both taken together, but they have advertised it all round the country, and cannot find an owner - Ward's mare is the one the young man rode, and he got there before me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.This has been a stable a long<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080072"/>time? A. I believe so, but there had been no horses in it for a long time.</p>

On the 23rd of May, I saw a young man ride away from there with a mare, about a quarter-past nine or nine o'clock, but I cannot tell who it was - I cannot swear it was Parker; I saw the young man undo the stable gate - I will not be sure that it was Parker; it was a brown mare, with a white spot on the off side, and blind with both eyes - I knew her to be Holmes' mare, having seen her several times; he put a saddle and bridle on her - I saw him walk up and down the hill once or twice, but cannot say it was Parker; I did not know him before - the officers came soon after, and I went with them to look after the mare.</p>

Consols, in my own name, Elizabeth Smith; Mr. Pickering, of Swallow-street, was the broker - I lived with General Taunton, in Ireland, five or six weeks, and then went to live with Lord Farnham, who was then Colonel Barry; I was two years with him, and then married - I quitted his Lordship's service, and settled in Ireland; I have not been in England since, till I came over for this prosecution - Colonel Barry advanced my husband 10l. on my shewing the stock receipt, and some money was advanced to me on the dividends; I never had a niece named Jane Smith - I never knew such a person; I have one brother, named William - he lived in Lincolnshire.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The administratrix was accompanied by the prisoner? A. Yes, and by a person named Rorke - the prisoner herself said she knew the party very well, and gave a draft on her agent for 3l. for the current expences; I think that was not on the first application - they applied several times; we required money to be paid down before we proceeded, as we did not know the party, and the property being an unclaimed dividend, we did not know whether they would receive it; we required the money before we proceeded, and the prisoner gave the order.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not when the documents were ready, and you refused to give them up without being paid? A. No; it was on the first or second application - the administratrix was not surprised at my requiring the money- I said the business could not be transacted without the money, and the prisoner gave Mr. Townsend the order for 3l., on account of the current expenses; the order was on a navy agent, in Craig's-court - I had not produced our bill before she gave the order, and never saw her, except on these three or four occasions, but am positive she is the person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. By what name did the prisoner appear? A. Warburton Patfull - she produced a document proving she was possessed of 50l. a year; the cheque at Craig's-court was not paid.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. Q. How long was it from the commencement of these proceedings to the end? A. I think the order was at three months after date: I sent to ascertain if it would be paid, but think that was after the business was done, because she said her dividends became due at a certain period.</p>

            , of Lord St. Asaph's - here is a receipt given by the party for the dividend; Sanders was present, and identified Jane Smith, on receiving the dividends - I have an entry of Jane Smith having afterwards sold out the stock, and receiving the dividend.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS HARRISON. I am a jeweller, and live at No. 185, Tottenham-court-road - I lived there nearly the whole of 1826, till now; the prisoner never lodged with me - I have no knowledge of her whatever; no widow lodged there since I have had the house - Mr. and Mrs. Butler occupied the second floor when I took it, and continued there till June or July, 1827, when Mr. and Mrs. Doggerty took it; in 1826, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews occupied the first floor, and till 1827 - I had no attic, and am certain the prisoner never lodged in my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is yours a shop or private house? A. A shop; the number is not on the door, because I have been painting - it was on the face of the shop, and on the private door; I never heard of there being another No. 185 - they appear to be regular.</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN STAFFORD. I have inquired after Henry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080074"/>Johnson, in John-street, City-road, and in John's-row; I inquired particularly through the whole street, and could gain no intelligence whatever of him; I also inquired after Jane Smith, at No. 10, Brook-street, Hampstead-road, and New-road, and in Brooks'-gardens, and in a number of courts and alleys round there, but could hear of no

            ; I certainly found the name of Smith - I also inquired at No. 8, Howland-street, after John March - it is a private house - there is not a butcher's-shop in the street; there is a butcher in Cleveland-row; I inquired of him - he never knew a butcher named March in the neighbourhood; I inquired at several shops; I was led to make these inquiries from the documents produced; I inquired after Mrs. Warburton Patfull, and found Mr. Harrison at No. 185, Tottenham-court-road; I went to public-houses and several places, but could gain no intelligence of her - I could only find one No. 185; the numbers appeared to go perfectly regular.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you look at the bottom of Howland-street, on the left from Tottenham-court-road, three or four doors up, for a butcher's? A. There is no butchers there; I went to Little Howland-street, there was none there.</p>
               <p>Mr. SMITH addressed the Court on behalf of the defendant, stating that she had been the dupe of

The prisoner came into my employ about the 29th of March - he boarded and lodged with me; he had for a few nights slept in an adjoining house which was empty - he came in on Monday in the evening, about eight o'clock - he had been out with a parcel; I said, "You have been a long while gone, I want you to go out with another parcel immediately;" I took hold of his coat, and felt something hard in his pocket; I said, "Anthony, what have you here?" he said Nothing; I said, "Yes you have, I feel something hard;" he again said Nothing, and went towards the counting-house; I said, "Don't go, Sir, I want you to go with another parcel;" he said, "I won't go;" but moved on towards the counting-house - he went in and turned round; I said, "What have you got?" he said Nothing - I put my hand into his pocket, and took out a length of black ribbon on a block; I said, "Where had you this from?" he said, "I called on my sister this morning, and she gave it me to take to my brother's wife's sister;" I asked how often he had called on his sister, and on his brother's wife's sister - he said he had occasionally called and taken parcels; I said, "Have you never met her in the street by appointment?" he said, "Yes, when I have had parcels for her;" I then asked if he was not accustomed to call generally; he said generally, and had given her parcels which he had from his brother, who lived in a respectable house in Bridge-street, Blackfriars; I then asked when he was at his sister's before that morning - he said the Thursday or Friday before; I said "This may be all right, but it will require some explanation; I will go and look into your boxes" - I asked which was his box; he pointed it out, and opened it with a key - I found in it two fans, which he said he had brought from his sister to take to his brother's wife's sister; I then said, "Are you aware that these fans and ribbon have my private mark on them?" he said they were not mine, he had them from his sister, who lived in Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell - I went there next day with a warrant, but found nothing - she keeps a green-grocer's shop, and her husband is a patten-maker; this ribbon is worth 1s. 10d. and the fans 4d. - the prisoner afterwards said he had taken nothing before, but something came over him all on a sudden, and he took this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Had you threatened him, or said it would be better for him? A. No; he had been a good while out; I cannot tell when this mark was made on the ribbon, but it is my own writing - I had a good character with him from a wine-merchant; I cannot say how long before I found them on the prisoner I had seen the mark - I will not swear I had had it in my hand within a week; we have a pile of goods of the same sort.</p>

               <p>JAMES REEVES. I am a shoemaker. I made these shoes for the prosecutor - I made them myself, and no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080075"/>one makes such a cut as I do; I never made shoes for the prisoner - I am certain I made them for the prosecutor; they were made with a long strap and a buckle, but the straps are now cut off, and the short straps are not bound - no shoemaker would send them out so.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOWLER. I am the prosecutor's brother. I took the prisoner at Enfield-highway - he owned that the shoes belonged to my brother, but denied having taken the other things.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you still in the service of the prosecutors? A. Yes; I missed the watch I had been working on, some which a fellow-workman had been working on, and a vertical watch, which was perfect, in a going state - those I had been working on were not in cases; I had been timeing them - they were movements: they were perfect as far as regards the movements - they were going; they had gold convex spade hands on the dial-plate, and the second-hands were blue steel - they were all alike. Highfield was another servant in their employ - he is here.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q.Should you know them again? A. Those I was at work on I have not seen since; those which are here I had not worked on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In the course of that night, were any articles lost, which in the trade would be called watch-movements? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>CHARLES STRACHAN. On the morning of the 23rd of December, 1825, I received notice that my workshop had been robbed - I went down immediately, and missed fourteen watch-movements; the value of what I lost was upwards of 100l. - I sent to the Mansion-house for an officer- I had the locks examined, and endeavoured to trace the property. In the month of May following I received information, and went to search the prisoner's house, in Bell-lane, Spitalfields - Stafford was with me, also fortune and Foster, two officers, who are both dead; we went between ten and eleven o'clock, I think, on Sunday morning; the officers knocked at the door, and gained admittance immediately - it was opened by the prisoner's wife; she said her husband was not at home, and begged we would take a seat in the parlour, as she expected him in every minute to breakfast - breakfast was on the table in the parlour we went into; the things did not appear to have been used - we sat down for some time, I think full a quarter of an hour, expecting the return of the prisoner; I then told the officers I began to be impatient, and we began to search the lower room first, and looked under the bed; we found nothing there - we then went up to a door on the left-hand side of the stairs at the top of the house; it was fastened with a padlock outside - we were there about ten minutes, when the prisoner came up, and asked what we wanted there, and who I was; I told him my name, and said I was told that some movements I had lost were in his possession, and I begged he would let me look into that room, among his watches, to see if there were any of ours - he put his hand to his pockets, felt, and said he would go down and get the key, and show me his watches; I stood at the door for a few minutes, and as the prisoner did not come, I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080076"/>into the adjoining room, but left Mr. Stafford at the door, with orders not to leave it; in about ten minutes the prisoner's father came and said his son was gone to find the key - I agreed to wait twenty minutes longer; I took out my watch - it wanted twenty minutes to twelve o'clock, and I agreed to wait till twelve; while I and the officers were waiting, Mr. Stafford cried out, "Officers, officers, some one is breaking into this room;" the officers then broke open that room door instantly; I had not then heard any noise myself, but when the officers broke open that door. I heard the lime dropping from the cieling on the floor - I went into the room with the two officers and Mr. Stafford; the room was full of lime-dust, and there was a large aperture in the cieling - some of the plaster had fallen down, and some was falling; we searched, and I found five of my movements; I have two in my pocket now - I never saw the prisoner again till he was in custody; these movements were in a jewellery-case on the table, immediately under the aperture, covered with lime dust - I told the officer to open it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Then we are distinctly to understand that the prisoner never came up again? A. No - I never saw him till he was in custody; I lost watch-movements that night.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. Produce what you found? A. These are them - they were in cases when I found them, but not when I lost them; I can identify my own movements, and swear to them with positiveness - these two are of my manufacture, and were part of those stolen on that night; I have no doubt about them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I take it for granted, these must have gone through many hands, to have cases and glasses, and the works fixed in? A. Yes, I should think they had - the name of "Dwerrihouse and Carter, London," was not on the movements we lost; we did not lose any watch - we do not call them watches till they are in cases; I cannot say that I had seen them the night before they were lost, but I must have seen them within a day or two, and given them to my workmen - I believe I had marked and numbered them all with my own hand; I find my own numbers on these movements - here is No. 11, 124 under the bottom, endeavoured to be erased, but it is perfectly distinct to me with this magnifying glass- I cannot see them without the glass; here is part of another movement with No. 11,487 on it - it was about five months after I missed these that I found them; from the state in which they were in on my premises, they must have gone through a glass-man's, a case-maker, a gilder, and another person's hands, before they were fit for sale; I do not swear to every part of the movements, but to those parts which are attached to those that have the numbers on them; I do not recollect whether any of them had the numbers more distinct than this one has - the prisoner had not returned when they broke open the door, that I had seen; we did not wait any longer than while we searched the house, which took nearly an hour - I did not go to the house again to see if he returned; I believe he was not taken up till 1827 - I had a warrant to search the house, but not to apprehend him; the officers had instructions to take him from me, but I cannot tell where he was; I kept these movements in the state I found them for some time, and then sold them to friends, who have since delivered them up to me; I am not quite certain who I sold No. 11,487 to, but I believe to Mr. Enderby, perhaps a year ago - it was in 1829, but I retained that part of the movement with the number on it, and this other part with"

               <p>JAMES STAFFORD. I accompanied the last witness to the prisoner's house in May, 1826 - I was waiting at the door of the upper room; I heard a noise as of stuff falling from the cieling - I gave the alarm, and the door was instantly opened; the lime-dust was flying about, and there was a large hole in the cieling - we found the five watches there; I am a workman of the prosecutor's, and from the state in which I saw them I could swear to the movements - I knew them positively to be my master's, and the same which had been stolen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go up to the cieling to see if any one was there then? A. No - the hole was not large enough for a man to get through; we found no person in the house who could have made that hole - I looked up, but saw no man; if there had been a man breaking in at the time I was there, I must have seen him - I did not see any cat there; there was time for a man to get away over the roof of the house.</p>

On a Wednesday in August in that year, I had occasion to leave town - I think on the 18th; I returned on the Tuesday after - I went to this house; I found it shut up, and the furniture was gone - after I had extricated myself from the King's Bench prison, I found where the furniture was gone, but I did not find the prisoner for a length of time; I endeavoured to find her, and offered 20l. reward - I at last found her in a lodging-house in Sutton-street, Soho-square; I went to her, and asked what she had done with the furniture she had taken from my house in St. Mary-axe - she told me it was an unfair question; I went for an officer, but she was then denied; I found her again on the 12th of June last year, at a lodging-house in Winslow-street, Oxford-street, and gave her in charge - the furniture was really mine; I bought the greater part of it - she had no authority to dispose of any part of it; she was nothing more than my servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What sort of a house was it? A. The same sort as the one I found the prisoner in; I was in trouble about a licensed house, where soldiers were quartered - I was fined 500l.; I am separated from my wife, but did not make over the furniture to her - I have no person here, of whom I bought any part of it; the prisoner arrested me and sent me to the King's Bench about 1819, and in 1820 I surrendered; I put in her claim as a disputed debt; I only recollect seeing her once in the presence of Mary Hughes, between 1819 and the time I apprehended her - I do not know Mary Roberts; I know

The prisoner had been in my employ since the 20th of November; I marked this money, and put it into my till at half-past eight o'clock on Saturday night - I saw the prisoner take the crown-piece from the till, while he was giving change for a half-quartern loaf; the customer gave him a shilling, and he should have given 8d. in change - he kept the crown in his hand for a minute, and then hid it under some dust; this is it - it is marked; this shilling and sixpence were laying on it, but I cannot swear to them -I spoke to the prisoner; he said I knew best - I sent for an officer; we searched his box - I found 103l. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, and two 5s. pieces; I gave him 16s. a week, but for about six weeks past 17s., a Saturday night's supper, and a Sunday's dinner - he found himself the rest, except lodging.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did you come to the shop? A. I took it of Mr. Robinson in November; the prisoner had been in his service, and I kept him on - I had not marked any money before this; this crown-piece was found on the sack in his absence - no one but me saw him take it; nothing had passed about my putting a piece of lead to the bread scale - the lead was not in the scale; I do not use it now - I have done so, but not to cheat my customers; I have not used it this fortnight - it was merely put to see how heavy my bread came from the oven; I never had any complaint made on the subject; I know a Mr. James Boyce - I had a good character with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>HENRY BERESFORD. I am a Police-officer. I was sent for, and took the prisoner; Mr. Tubb and him were in the shop - he asked the prisoner why he took the money; he said, "You know best;" I merely asked him if he had done it, and he gave me the same answer - that Mr. Tubb knew best.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Stokes, and the prisoner is my brother. Before he went to Mr. Robinson's he lived with my husband; he then had a guinea a week, and went on the same terms to Mr. Robinson - I saw about 30l. in his possession; he was a frugal, good, sober lad - I supposed he was saving money, and that he had a great deal more then; he had notes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long is it since be left you? A. About twelve months - it is about seven years since I saw the 30l., when he first came to us; I have never seen any of his money since - I had nothing to do with his box; he was employed in minding one shop, and I looked after the other; he left because Mr. Stokes gave up the shop - he was with us about six years.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.When did he come from the country? A. Seven years ago, and then he showed me the 30l. - he had the care of one of our shops; that required a higher rate of wages than a mere journeyman - my husband sold that business to Mr. Robinson.</p>
               <p>SOPHIA BOYCE. My husband is a baker in the employ of Mr. Tubb. I have known the prisoner three years -I had the care of his things from October till April; I had to go to his box to put away his clothes - I have seen money to the amount of 80l. or 90l.; I took him the key of his box, and said I was surprised he should leave his money loose - he said he did not know it was loose.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was this while he lived with Mr. Tubb? A. No, before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. You say it is sold in 1 lb. rolls? A. Yes; I have made inquiry, and have not found any other druggists who sell it so - I am not sure that our's is not a common gauge; but if a particular cylinder corresponds with a particular gauge, I consider it is the same - I do not know whether the general appearance of all blister-plaister is alike; we use a particular sieve, and from the general appearance of this pil. colocynth, I believe it is that made at the hall; it is precisely similar in appearance and texture - I may be mistaken, but every tradesman can tell the articles he has manufactured; I do not manufacture this, but it is made under my eyes - I believe it is very of ten made in this way; there is no recipe in the "London Pharmacopoe" for it; I have tasted it - it is excessively bitter, but I am not putting bitterness as the test; I have no other means of ascertaining it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Is not the Apothecharies' Company a chartered Company? A. Yes - this is not the property of the Company, but of Mr. Field and others, and they have all the profit to themselves; they supply themselves with articles from the same market as all other druggists - there is nothing peculiar in the article sold to them; other druggists make the same article, and some with the same ingredients, but the different manner of manipulation would make a difference- no two persons would proceed about any operation in precisely the same manner; the blister plaister is in 1 lb. rolls, and in a particular cylinder - we never sell the colocynth in large quantities, always in small quantities; it is entirely an article of retail trade - many druggists sell cheaper than we do.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Do you never sell it wholesale? A. Yes, sometimes - the Company supply gentlemen who are members, and would supply them in pounds; there is nothing particular in the manufacture of this - the ingredients may be precisely the same; all colocynth would be bitter, but that I have seen elsewhere is of a darker colour, approaching to black - except when exposed to the air, ours is of a dark olive green; I have no means of knowing how long this has been made - time will not have an effect on the colour through the whole mass; if it had been kept a long time it would not go through - part of our colocynth had no doubt been made two or three years, but it would in the interior be the same colour as if fresh made; if some of ours had been made three years, and some of another person's, they would still differ in the texture - the mode of grinding and sifting would make a difference; doubtless others might make it of the same texture as we do - no apothecary makes blister-plaister as we do, but druggists make it of the same materials, or they ought to do so; I have seen other blister-plaister - I believe it is not the practice of other druggists to use any gauge at all, but to roll out their blister-plaister; I cannot tell the exact length of our gauge - other druggists might get such a one.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If you saw a thing miraculously the same, you would not know the difference? A. No; we generally roll the blister-plaister in white demy paper, but that is not exclusively used by the Company; Mr. Henry Field is one of the Company, and there are other partners; there was some blister-plaister done up in blotting-paper by mistake.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR STURGEON. Q.What is your reason for thinking they never sell 13ozs.? A.Because it is an odd number; I am not in the selling department - this demy paper is commonly used by apothecaries, this filtering paper is particular.</p>

               <p>(Witness in continuation.) - I went with my husband to Monkhouse generally every day for four or five years; he did not ostensibly keep any druggist's-shop - we went into their living room, and then Monkhouse would take them up stairs to a private room; he gave 4s. per lb. for the pil. colocynth, but the last lot was 15lbs. for which he paid but 30s. - I was not there then; he paid several prices for the plaster, the outside price was half a crown a pound; I have known him to buy it at 1s. 10d.; I was present when these articles were found at Monkhouse's - I heard them count forty-three rolls of the blister-plaster - it was the same sort I had seen my husband take there, and the same house; the plaster was found in a box, and some of the pills tied up in a bundle, and some in a jar - the box was under several other boxes in the left-hand room on the first floor, the pil. colocynth was in the same place; I have known Duck nine or ten years - I have been to his house, and taken him plister-plaster and pil. colocynth; we got the same price for them of him, half a crown and 4s. - Duck I believe was apprenticed to a druggist, and he kept a shop; we have taken all sorts of drugs to him and to Monk-house; when my husband was in prison I went to Monk-house, and stated the situation my husband was in, and he gave me 10s. for him; I went to Duck and told him, he promised me some money, but did not send it - I then sent Mr. Chapman, the Stepney carrier, and received 5l. from him; my husband was in the Apothecaries' Company -Duck called on us some years ago, just as he opened his shop - my husband was not at home; he said if my husband did not send him the goods according to his promise, he would go to Apothecaries'-hall, and tell the gentleman what Peacock was doing; I remember when Duck used to take these things, he said he could recommend them to any surgeon as he knew they were genuine, for they came from Apothecaries'-hall; I remember going with my husband and Jago to Duck in February last - we took 18lbs. of the pil. colocynth in a covered basket - Jago carried it, and I went with my husband; I saw my husband go into his house, and I waited till he came out with the basket empty - this was on a Sunday morning; he brought the money out - he had no money when he went in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was your husband sentenced to transportation? A. The Session before last, he was a chemist and druggist, and lived in Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. You have said Pike always confessed that he took the goods from Apothecaries'-hall? A. Not every time, he did several times; he lived at the hall - my husband used to say, "Here is Pike come from the hall;" Pike used to say he had brought so and so - he has mentioned Apothecaries'-hall in my hearing; he has said he brought the blister-plaster and the pil. colocynth from there - I never asked Pike to give me 50l. - I did not think he was worth it; I did not think by bringing him here I should get my husband off; I have done it at my husband's wish, that we should give up one of the parties - I knew they were the goods of the Apothecaries' Company; I never had any money, nor had any offered me - I have known him two or three years, and he has brought these things backwards and forwards to our house - we were the intermediate messengers to the other parties; there were other persons used to come, but I have given up all the gentlemen wished.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Your husband was a regular chemist and druggist? A. Yes; we sold to two or three other persons besides the prisoner; Duck is a chemist and druggist - he has practised as such, and lately, through Peacock, he has been able to get up very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080082"/>much; I did not tell of this till my husband was transported - I should not have done it now had it not have been for him; I was aware of his guilty practices - I told it by his desire: I have not bought any since he was away; I can go to my husband at any time - I do not want to buy goods to follow him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q.Monkhouse has frequently come toy our house to deal? A. Yes, but he has not come to the house the last two years, his son has a few times; he did not keep a druggist's-shop - I have known him four or five years: I have seen these goods in his place- I believe he dealt in all kinds of articles, a general dealer; my husband has dealt in other articles - he has bought goods of Monkhouse; I do not know what price my husband gave him - I do not know that my husband has returned him goods if they did not suit; I do not know that Monkhouse has sent back 30lbs. of goods as not approved of - I think if he had I should have heard it; there was, I believe, very little but what I knew.</p>
               <p>PHINEAS PEACOCK. I am nine years of age. I was examined before the Grand Jury; I go to church, and know I must tell the truth. I know all the prisoners - I have seen Pike bring things to my father's house; he brought pilacochia and blister-plaster - the other men have come there; I have gone with my father to Duck's, and to Monkhouse's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. How do you know it was pilacochia? A. My father told me so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Do you know where the things were got from? A. No; I was taken up for presenting a cheque at a banker's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. How lately have you seen Monkhouse there? A. Since Christmas.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who sent you with that cheque? A. My father; I was taken before the Lord Mayor, and set at liberty a week afterwards.</p>

            . I am a porter. I know Monkhouse, but not Duck. On the 28th of February I carried a parcel of pilacochia to Duck's, but I did not go in - Peacock and his wife went with me; it was in a little basket; Peacock went into the house which they called Duck's, and took the basket; Mrs. Peacock and I staid outside - Peacock brought out the basket empty; I carried it part of the way home - Peacock put his hand into his pocket when he came out, and showed some silver and two pieces of gold; he said he had no money when he went in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Was the basket so heavy that you were obliged to carry it? A. I went to the shop, but did not go in; it was a doctor's-shop - I never went to his shop to tell him if he had any thing improperly come by, to put it out of the way; I do not recollect ever seeing him.</p>

            . I was servant to Peacock for two years and three months; I left nearly twelve months ago. I knew Pike - he was a working man at Apothecaries'-hall; he used to bring blister-plaster to Peacock's, and two kinds of pills - one blue pill and the other pil. colocynth; Monkhouse used to come and buy the drugs which came to the house; Peacock told him they came from Apothecaries'-hall - there was no certain time for Monkhouse's coming; he came at all times, sometimes in the morning, and sometimes noon or evening - he bought goods, and sometimes took them, or his son came for them, and sometimes Mr. or Mrs. Peacock took them; I never went with any - I never heard Peacock tell Monkhouse that Pike brought them; I have seen money pass between Peacock and Monkhouse - I did not know Duck; sometimes if Mr. Peacock was going out he would say to me,"Mary, here is so much money - if Pike comes give it to him," and I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. How do you know that Pike brought blue pills and pil. colocynth? A. He told me so; Monkhouse used to buy drugs, and so did others, but I only want to speak of him now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q.Peacock carried on a large business? A. Yes, and had several persons dealing with him - I have seen him deal with other persons - I have taken goods to other houses, and I have seen money pass.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He bought of other people besides Pike, and sold to others beside Monkhouse? A. Yes - he kept no shop; his name was not on the door.</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN ELLIS. I am a druggist, and live in Thames-street. The price of blister-plaster last year was 4s. 6d. or 5s. 6d. a lb. if sold in large quantities - I should think that a low price; I never bought any at Apothecaries'-hall: we make but little pil. colocynth, but I should think the value of this was about 12s. per lb.; we make the blister-plaster in pounds and half-pounds, generally in pounds; I went last Wednesday fortnight to search the premises of Monkhouse - it is quite a private house, no appearance of business; just as we were coming away we found a quantity of blister-plaster - he was not at home at the time; we searched the back yard and the shed - we then went up stairs, and found a room, with a variety of drugs, opium, scammonia, and other drugs, and 40lbs. or 50lbs. of blister-plaster in a box, under some other boxes; I heard Monkhouse say he bought it of the East India Company, at some of their sales - I think he did not give any other account, except of some opium, which I suspected from its quality to be mine; I saw a book on a desk on the right-hand side, containing various entries - one was some opium at 14s., and the letter P. on it, and one was "Peacock, March 3, 1. 9s." - I should think the price of isinglass was from 12s. or 14s. to 17s. 6d. at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Whether the isinglass was good or bad you do not know? A. No, nor whether it was cut or not; I saw some isinglass that was cut, but I do not know whether it was that or not - there were drugs of various descriptions; I think no other articles - it had not the appearance of a general dealer's, the room being up stairs, and a bed-room next to it; there were goods enough to allow the inference that a person dealt in these goods generally; I do not know whether he was a licensed general-dealer, but there was a desk and a book containing various entries.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. Then other chemists are in the habit of selling 1 lb. rolls of plaster? A. Yes, but I never saw any in this form.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you think the maker of a mass of pills of this description, is likely to know his own manufacture? A. I should think he may, but I am not in that department.</p>

            . I am an officer of Union-hall. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080083"/>the 30th of June I took a search-warrant to Monkhouse's, with the last witness and Mr. Hennell; his house is No. 16, Fair-street, Horslydown - there is no shop, nor appearance of business; he was not at home - it was about half-past eleven o'clock in the day; we searched the room down stairs, and then the back premises - we found nothing there; we then went up-stairs, to the left-hand room on the first floor - there we found a quantity of drugs, wrapped in paper, and in boxes; they were not put on shelves - there was no counter; a pair of scales were in the room which would weigh about 2lbs. - there was no shopman or boy, no customer came while I was there; we were there I should think an hour and a half - we found some blister plaster in a box, which had some parcels on it; this is the plaster - while we were there Monkhouse came in; he could see we had those things - I showed him my warrant, and asked whether he could give any account of this plaster to the gentleman with me- he said he should give it at another place; I then took him to Union-hall - I believe Mrs. Peacock's name was mentioned, but I do not recollect; here are about 22 lbs. of pil. colocynth, which I found at Monkhouse's - seven pieces were in an earthen jar, and one large piece tied up in a brown paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q.You say these things were concealed? A. They were in a box, and some things on it; there were many articles there - there was a desk and a book; there was no chair in the room - there were some parcels; the box was not locked - there were parcels on it, and some goods in front; I could only see a part of the box - the room was not locked; a box by the side of the desk was locked.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there any thing like a collection of goods, except in that room? A. No.</p>
               <p>GEORGE AINGER re-examined. Q. Are these rolls of plaster made up as such articles are made up at Apothecaries'-hall? A.They are; here are some of them done up in blotting-paper or filtering-paper - I think the other came from Apothecaries'-hall; the are gauged before the paper is put on - they fit the gauge exactly; from the softness of this pil. colocynth, and the strong smell of the oil of cloves which it has, it has every appearance of being such an articles as was made at the hall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q.Is it not genearally made of oil of cloves? A. Yes, but it depends on the quality and quantity of the oil - the Company sell a great quantity of oil to apothecaries, but a great number of druggists draw their own oil; if they bought oil at the hall it would be the same - I have no other test but the smell of the oil, and it is possible for a chemist to make the same of the same materials.</p>
               <p>Q. Now take this roll of plaister in your hand, and measure it by your gauge, does it not fit as near as any of the other rolls? A. It does fit as near as they do without the paper - I apprehend it always preserves the same bulk as when it is first made; I never tried - it is affected by heat and cold; heat makes it soft, and cold hardens it, but I am not aware that they affect its bulk - I have never tried that; we make them in copper pans - they are beat with a stick, and then rolled with the hand; they are commonly rolled in white demy, but some of them are in filtering paper - the one you have given me is in white demy, the same as the Company generally use.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If a man had one of these rolls, might he not make up others like them? A. Yes, certainly - I am not aware that they expand or contract with heat or cold.</p>
               <p>Monkhouse's Defence. I bought them in a regular way of business.</p>
               <p>Duck's Defence. (written.) I have been brought before you on a charge of which I am wholly innocent; I was taken into custody on Saturday, and after being carried about from the Court of King's Bench to the Mansion-house, and detained several hours, I was conveyed to Newgate; I have not therefore had those proper opportunities that I ought to have had, which would have enabled me to disprove the evidence of Mrs. Peacock, and other witnesses for the prosecution, who are connected with her, and show them to you in their real character: a witness whose husband is already under sentence of transportation. I am, therefore, compelled to have recourse to such evidence on my behalf, as the immediate necessities of the moment compel me to bring forward: I have hitherto supported myself in my profession, with credit and respectability, and brought up a family, and I hope and trust that you will weigh with great caution the evidence of such persons as have been brought against me, when contrasted with those respectable men who have this day come forward on my behalf.</p>

            . I live in Tooley-street, and am a chemist and druggist - I have been so for fifteen years; I compound blister plaster - it is the custom of the trade to make it in half pounds generally, but sometimes in pounds; this is the usual way of making up pounds - I have dealt with Monkhouse for many years; he is a general dealer- he has bought things at the Custom-house sales; his character has been strictly honourable as far as my transactions with him have gone, no man more so, and I have heard him spoken of so by his neighbours.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say this plaster is usually made in half-pounds, do you know how they make it at Apothecaries'-hall? A. No, I never bought any there -I do not know who made this piece, which has been put into my hands; it is usually put in white demy paper- what we usually use is outside printing demy; he is a general dealer - he deals in soy, drugs, oils and dye goods; he has lived at that house for many years - the usual way for general dealers is to have a warehouse.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q.Have you bought a great many things there? A. Yes - at the back of his house there is a considerable warehouse; sometimes general dealers buy goods, and sell them again without taking them home- I should think this paper is such as is generally used.</p>
               <p>MR. STURGEON. Q.Could you speak to the manufacture of any of your articles? A. No.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH LATCHAM. I am a Police-constable. On the 23rd of June, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner in York and Albany-road, about a quarter of a mile from Bowden's, with this copper tied in the ticking - he said he had brought it from No. 35, Winchester-place, Pentonville, and was taking it to Compton-street, Seven-dials; that his master had bought it over night, and he was obliged to be at home by five o'clock in the morning - I detained him; he then said he was employed by a gentleman (whom he named) in Compton-street, to carry it; I went there, and they knew nothing about him- when I came back he said he had stolen it in order to be transported; I found there were only nineteen houses in Winchester-place.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you been talking to any body about the evidence you were to give? A. No - I have not talked to my father about it, I am sure- I only told him of it when it broke out that I had done it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason you took the three sovereigns out of the till, for the prisoner? A. He had a summons - I began to rob my father three months ago; he flogged me about nine months ago, but that was my own money - that is since Christmas; it was my own money I had spent - my father thought it was his; I spent 1d. at a time; my father afterwards questioned the servant, and found I had drawn it from him; I had money given me by several people - my father said I had stolen his money, but never said how much; he accused me of stealing silver, but he flogged me after I had spent 1d. of my own; I have not spent half a crown at a time in peaches or fruit - I know Burt, a fruiterer, next door to the Eagle tavern, City-road- I did spend money with him two years ago, which I had taken; I do not recollect his threatening to inquire of my father how I got it - I will not swear he did not; I know I left off dealing with him, but cannot say it was about that- I stole all the money I laid out with him; I have given him a shilling at a time, but do not recollect a half-crown; I will not swear I did not show him one.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not young Harnor deny to you that he had ever given money to Smith or Swainson? A. He did.</p>

On the 3rd of July I was at home, between eight and nine o'clock at night; my father put four sovereigns and 10s. into a cupboard - I took them out, and put 10s. into my right hand, and four sovereigns into my left; I wanted to look at the sovereigns as a piece of curiosity, it being dark - I took them to the back of the house to look at them; the prisoners were play-fellows of mine - they were near the door; my little brother seeing the sovereigns began to jump for joy, and said, "My brother has got a load of sovereigns;" Dixon then came, and looked over my right shoulder - I got into the passage, and left the street door open - fearing he might take the sovereigns out of a lark, I closed my hand, as he said they were Queen's metal - he then laid hold of my hand, forced two out, and tried to get away; my other brother collared him - Lilley (who was with me and saw him do it) tried to rescue him; I called for help, and Scott came- when Lilley found there were three of us he ran away, and we forced Dixon into the room; some more boys went and brought Lilley back - I sent for the Policeman; I have not found the sovereigns - Dixon swore he never had them, but when I first laid hold of him he said he had dropped them - while my brother and some boys were gone for the Policeman I heard the door locked, and looked about where the bustle was, but could not find them; the other boys came in when Lilley was brought, but they did not go so far as where he said he had dropped them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were not these boys altogether in the passage, scrambling? A. No, none of them were on the ground; nobody but Scott went near the ground during the whole time - Scott was the only one who came in; the others stopped at the door when they brought Lilley back - I never had a sovereign in my hand before; the cupboard was not locked - my father did not accuse me of taking them; there are cracks in the floor, but they are filled up with dust and not wide<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080087"/>enough for a sovereign to go through - I have tried to put a farthing through; the boards have not been taken up.</p>

            . I was standing at Daley's street door, and saw Peter Daley go to the staircase window; his little brother danced about the passage, and said his brother had got some sovereigns; the prisoners were playing about the door, and heard it - Dixon went into the passage, and looked over Daley's shoulder; I did not see him take the sovereigns as I was at the door - there was a scuffle between them; Daley hallooed out, "I have lost two sovereigns;" Dixon said, "I have dropped them;" they both fell down - Lilley, who was standing at the door, then went in, and fell over them; he grasped up something - I could not see what; I said, "Have you got them?" he said, "Hold your tongue;" he shut up his hand, and ran away - I am quite sure he said,"Hold your tongue;" he ran away, and stopped at the corner of Payne's-buildings, Whitecross-street - he came into the court again when the boys fetched him, and sat down in the room with Dixon quietly; Dixon said to him, "Let us come out, don't let us stop here to be sloughed up all night and Sunday, till Monday morning;" Dixon said to the Policeman, "I own I had them, but I dropped them in the passage" - I was not in the passage after they were lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. May you not have made a mistake? A. Yes; I am certain Daley and Dixon fell down, but Daley was in such a perspiration and fright he could not exactly say whether he fell.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see Lilley till you fetched him? A. No; we found him at the corner of Payne's-buildings - the Magistrate liberated them from Monday to Wednesday, and they came to the office then.</p>

On the 3rd of July I missed this harness, which I saw safe the day before - I went immediately and overtook the prisoner in Hampstead-road, about seven hundred yards from my stable, and charged him with stealing them; he was a stranger - he said he knew nothing of them; I told him I knew to the contrary, and that I must have the harness, as it belonged to a gentleman whose horse was at livery - he then took me to No. 95, Drummond-street; the Policeman was with me - I did not go into the house, as I was not quite dressed; the harness was brought back to my stable.</p>

The prisoner was given into my charge by Godfrey, who asked him where the harness was that was taken out of the mews - he denied it; Godfrey said it was of no use to deny it, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080088"/>he had it - he said he had some harness at home that was brought to him by a young man, at a quarter past twelve o'clock, and was to be fetched at eight in the morning; he did not give his name - I went with him to the second floor back room, No. 95, Drummond-street, and he gave me the harness, which Godfrey claimed; I watched at the house from half-past seven till nine o'clock - nobody came.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I followed him, in consequence of information, that a man had gone out of my stable - I went after him about three minutes after I received the information; the person pointed to the prisoner as he was going down the mews, and said that was the man who had gone out of my stable, but did not say at what time.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On Saturday, the 29th of May, between five and six o'clock, the prosecutor complained of being robbed - he was perfectly sober; he took me to the house - two rooms in it were fastened up; he said it happened in the top room, the door of which was open - I went in there, and searched well, but found no watch; the prosecutor on the road produced the duplicate of the watch to me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You knew his Hebrew name? A. Yes, Aaron is Hebrew, but I did not know it was Cohen; I have known him for years - there were five or six hundred people in the street; there is a great deal of jostling and hustling about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not come to you of his own accord, and ask you if you had presumed to say he had taken the trousers, and if so, to give him in charge? A. No; I did not tell the Lord Mayor so; when I spoke to him I could not take him, because I had a lot of goods, but I told him I certainly would have him taken after I sold my goods; he then went away, but came back again, and we had an altercation for about a quarter of an hour - he was taken next day in the lane; it will not help my business to transport him; he would certainly make one person less in the market; I only go there when I have a lot of old things to sell.</p>
               <p>LIPMAN LEVY. I am the prosecutrix's nephew, and assist in the business. I saw the prisoner take these trousers off the board - he looked at them, and my aunt asked him 6s. for them; he said he would see if there was any thing else to suit him, and while he was examining them, some beasts came by, which made a great confusion - a crowd came against my stall, and when they had passed, I looked round, and saw that the trousers were gone, and so was Cohen; my aunt went and fetched him back in about a quarter of an hour, and said he had the trousers; he said he had not - they were contending for about five minutes, and then he went away; we did not attempt to stop him -I saw him afterwards walking up and down; I could not find a constable - I did not leave the stall to look for one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If you thought he had stolen things, why not take him? A. I could not leave the stall it was so long - my aunt could not mind it all; I never saw the prisoner before, and never heard my aunt say she had seen him; the cattle going to market created great confusion.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prosecutrix came to me after the fair was over, and said a man had stolen her trousers; I asked who it was - she said Cohen; I said, "Why if he has got them he will bring them back," for it is common in the market to take things away for four or five hours; we are always in attendance at the market, and have these complaints eight or nine times a day; I left word at the prisoner's house for him to come to the watch-house, which he did; he said he might have looked at the things, but never took them away; he insisted on going to the Compter, and said if I did not take him, he would take me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not his friends offer her the value of the trousers, but he said it was a gross imposition, and he would go to the Compter and not pay one farthing? A. Certainly he did.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it Hunt's cart? A.

               <p>COURT. Q.When Hunt went up into the granary was he in Eames' sight all the time? A. I cannot say; but Eames was in a situation that he could see him; I saw him give him a nod, and then he went up; there was no hay in the granary.</p>

            . I am book-keeper at the Saracen's Head, and am Mrs. Mountain's cousin. On the 12th of June, about twelve o'clock, from what Brown said to me, I sent for an officer, then went into the yard, and ordered one of the ostlers to get into the cart and unload the dung; he was doing so, and I ordered Eames to take the tarpauling off the front of the cart - he lifted it up several times, and said, "Nothing here?" I said, "If there is nothing, throw it down;" he threw it down, and the sack came down with it - it contained two bushels - the sack was not ours; I asked Hunt who the corn belonged to; Eames was present, and looking at the sack - Hunt twice answered, "I don't know;" and the third time I asked him he said,"The corn don't belong to you, or any one here;" I found no other sack in the carts.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.Had the bag any business there? A. No; Hunt had no business in the granary; there may be fifty persons employed in the yard; we do not keep strange bags in our granary.</p>
               <p>JAMES MERRETT. I am horsekeeper to Mrs. Mountain. I saw the tarpauling on the ground, and heard Hunt say to Eames that he ought to have taken more care.</p>

               <p>THOMAS PIKE. I am a constable. I was in the yard; Mr. Mountain ordered Hunt to throw off the dung - he then told him to throw off the tarpauling, which was on the copse; it just covered the sack on the copse - after being told two or three times he threw it down, and the oats came down with it; I took Hunt that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw them all, I believe? A. Yes; Hunt threw some dung down, and said he could find no oats there; the oats were in two bags - neither of them belonged to Mrs. Mountain; Hunt said the outer bag was his master's - it had the name of Board or something on it- I asked him if his master sent the oats to town to feed the horses; he said No - I asked what he fed them with: he said beans and chaff - I asked how he came by the oats- he said he found them; I asked where - he said that was not my business, he should not tell me. Eames attended at the office, and was ordered into custody.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Was the bag dirty? A. No, quite clean; the road was very dirty - it was a very rainy day: the man who went home with the cart took the outside bag home; I produce the inner one, with the corn, and a sample taken from the bulk in the granary.</p>

On the 3rd of July I was sitting at tea, and there was a knock at the door - my daughter answered it; an old woman stood at the door, and asked to see my servant - I went and asked her business; she said she had brought twoshifts my servant had given her to make - I called the prisoner down; she came, and the woman said she had brought her a sheet on the Sunday to make two shifts; the prisoner said in reply, it was not a sheet - the woman said, "It was, and you told me your mistress had sold it you for half a crown;" the prisoner made no reply - I looked over my linen, but I could not miss a sheet; I delivered the two shifts to the officer - they never were in my possession as shifts. On the 5th or 6th of July I found a piece of silk and two caps at a pawnbroker's, also the handkerchiefs, the table-cloth, and the stockings, but not the spoons, scarf, orveil; a duplicate of a silk handkerchief and a towel was found on the prisoner on the 3rd of July, when I gave her into custody, but the pawnbroker is not here with them.</p>

               <p>ANN DARBY. I live in Mill-yard. On the Sunday the prisoner brought me some things, wrapped up in a small parcel, in a bit of rag - I gave the same to Mr. Isaacs on the Monday, and the duplicates.</p>
               <p>MARY SIMMONS. The prisoner lodged with me in February last; when she got this place she was very hare of clothes, and had a great many duplicates; when she had been there about a month, she came and said her mistress had advanced her 12s., and she had redeemed to the amount of 12s. - she said, "Take care of this little book, as there is a great family of children, and they are apt to tear things;" she left me a book, with some duplicates, but I cannot tell whether there were more or less than she had had before. On the 30th of June she came again, and said her mistress had advanced 12s. more, and she released some more things; on the 1st of July my child died - she said her mistress was a very good woman, and if I would call she would let me have a little money; I called, and she asked where I lived; on the 5th of July they called and took the duplicates - the prisoner gave me this bit of silk, and these caps she gave me to make up.</p>

               <p>JOHN SCHOLES. I am clerk to Messrs. Deacon and others. I received this parcel on the 24th of February, 1827 - it arrived by the waggon from Huddersfield; in about two hours we looked for it and could not find it - we supposed they were Valentias from the direction; they were for Mr. Kesteven, in King-street, Covent-garden - it had been put down in the yard, and when we wanted to send it out it was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Are there many persons about there? A. About sixteen or seventeen men; it was an open place - I never saw the prisoner till he was at the office; I cannot say that I ever saw him in our yard.</p>
               <p>JOHN WOOD. I am a manufacturer, and live near Huddersfield. We sent off the parcel on the 20th of February, 1827, by the waggon; I understood it was on the road about four days - the parcel contained Valentias; I have seen some of them since - these are the ends of those I sent.</p>
               <p>JAMES LEA. I have these samples of twelve pieces of Valentias, which I found in a box in a lodging at Islington, where the prisoner was living by the name of Jones - the pieces of Valentia were brought to the office, and Mr. Deacon made a memorandum of receiving them, and these samples were cut off them; I took the prisoner on the 21th of April, 1827, on Mr. McCabe's robbery, and found these things there - he said nothing about them.</p>
               <p>JANE OADES. I know the prisoner. In March, 1827, he came to lodge in my house at Islington - his wife took a furnished room in the name of Jones; they brought a variety of things - he said nothing to me about any valentias; his conduct was always correct in my house.</p>
               <p>JOHN OADES. I am this witness' husband. I know nothing of this parcel.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DAVIES. I was at that time an officer, and went with Lea.</p>

On the 28th of June I lost some potatoes from a coal and potatoe warehouse which I keep - I saw the prisoner carrying them in a direction from my warehouse under my window, at six o'clock in the morning; they were in one of my sacks - I got on my clothes, and hurried down; I missed the prisoner, but I went into an empty house, which I suppose he had gone through - I fastened it up, then went, and finished dressing myself: I then went down, and saw the prisoner coming back to my premises to go to work - I waited about, but said nothing till his mistress came down; I then got some officers, went to the empty house, and under the staircase, in the lower room, I found this bag of potatoes - I had not seen him in that house, but going towards it; I saw my name on the bag when he had it on his back - I had seen it on the Sunday morning in the place where my potatoes are kept.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. How many bags had you of this sort? A There might be a dozen - here is my name on it at full; the empty house joins my premises; the prisoner has been my apprentice for three years - I did not receive any premium with him; I lost ten sacks I suppose; the prisoner had been to repair that empty house, as I had no boats to build at that time - I did not see him go in there that morning; the trees before my house prevented me - as soon as I had got my clothes on I followed him close, in two minutes: he had time to put it there -I called out, or very likely he would have carried it through the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.It was but two minutes to your following him? A. No, not at first - I found the door open, and followed him; I shut it. went back, and put on my clothes - he has borne a good character.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM THOMAS. I was on duty, and was called to go in search of some potatoes - I found these in an empty house under some stairs, surrounded with some paintpots.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH JOHANNA. I am a <rs id="t18300708-183-viclabel1031" type="occupation">sailor</rs>

On the day the ship arrived the prisoner came on board to take me to board and lodge with him, which I agreed to do, at 14s. a week - I went on board the next day, and received a 10l. Bank note from the captain; I went to the prisoner's house with a tailor - I owed the tailor near 3l. for clothes; I was only five days with the prisoner - he gave me meat, and sometimes drink, but I did not owe him above 14s., nor that, for I treated him; I gave the tailor the note to go for change, and take what I owed him - he brought the 5l. note and the change, and put it on the table; the prisoner took it up - I did not give him leave to take it up; I asked him for money to get a pair of shoes, and he would not give it to me - I went before the Magistrate, and he committed him here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.When I took up the 5l. note, did not my wife say, "Don't give it him - don't let him have it;" speak the truth? A. No, she never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask me for the note, and give it to my wife? Q.No - I asked him next day for money to pay for my shoes, and he said, "I have no money, I paid a debt;" the note has never been offered me.</p>
               <p>CHARLES COHEN. When the ship Integrity arrived, the prisoner brought, the prosecutor to my employer's house - I am a tailor, and work for Mr. Nathan; he asked us to let the prosecutor have some clothes, and he would be answerable we should be paid on pay-day - we let him have clothes to the amount of 3l. 5s., and 1s. I lent him; on pay-day I went on board the ship, and when he was paid we all went together to the prisoner's house - on the way I told the prosecutor, as he was a stranger I would get change of the 10l. note, as I thought he had a 10l note by what I saw paid to other men; I got the note changed - I took the 3l. 6s., and carried him a 5l. note, a sovereign, and 14s. - I asked the prosecutor if he was satisfied; he said Yes, and I departed immediately - the next morning he came to borrow 1s. of me, but he was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a Frenchman. When this man was paid the tailor put the money on the table - I took it up; my wife said to him, "Don't let him have it," and he asked me to give it him back - my wife said,"Give it me," and he gave it her; he told every body that he gave my wife 5l. - the next day I met him; he said,"Your wife has been abusing me, I won't stop in the house" - he said,</p>
               <p>"you know I gave her 5l.; I said Yes - I said, "Come to an eating-house:" we had dinner, and stopped till four o'clock - on the Saturday he brought a Police-man, and took out his things; i met him again in the afternoon - he said,</p>
               <p>"I am going;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Come back" - he said, "You are a very good man, I like you very well - I gave your wife 5l.;" I never saw him again till the Sunday morning - we shook hands; the next day I received a summons to go before the Magistrate, and it was put off - I declare to God I never put my hand into my pocket.</p>
               <p>CHARLES COHEN. He received the money on Wednesday, the 23rd of June - I was summoned on the Tuesday evening, but I was out.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH JOHANNA. He never gave me the 5l. note back - it is not true that he gave it to me, and I gave it to his wife; I speak before God, he never gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you went to the Magistrate? A. I do not know; I could not get money before I went I have never been in England before; I went to borrow 1s. the next day - I was not drunk; I had had a glass of beer, and had 2s. or 3s. in my pocket.</p>
               <p>CHARLES COHEN re-examined. Q. Did you lend him the 1s. the next day? A. No - he was intoxicated in the afternoon; he did not say then that he had lost his money.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH GIBBS. I live next door to the prisoner -I work at waistcoat making. On the day the prosecutor received his wages (which will be, I believe, three weeks to-morrow)he came to my house, and asked if Mrs. Smith was there; I said; No - it was between twelve and one o'clock, I believe, but I cannot swear to the time; it was after breakfast, and before dinner - I breakfast generally at eight o'clock; it was about twelve, or between twelve and one; he sat down, and said he was waiting for Smith's wife to bring him change of a 5l. note - I suppose he waited for the space of a quarter of an hour; at the end of that time she sent a little girl to say she wanted me -I went in, and she said, "I have got a 5l. note of my lodger's," and she had a good many things on a chair, which she said she had got out of pawn - there were sheets, and a variety of things; a pair of blue trousers, a gown, an apron, and different articles; I said to her,"Your lodger is sitting in my house, I will go and tell him to come in" - she did not know he was there; I went and told him - the way he knew me was, I have a little girl who is in the habit of going of errands for Smith's house, and he took a liking to her and wished to buy her a pair of shoes; Mrs. Smith did not say why she sent for me - she did not tell me whose things they were, nor did I ask her; I thought it very odd - it was her husband's wish that I should come in and say these few words; I had not the curiosity to ask why she should send for me - the prosecutor said he was waiting for change to make the child a present of a pair of shoes; neither Smith nor his wife ever sent for me before on this kind of errand - they all three went out afterwards, and I saw no more of them; I heard some days afterwards that the man had asked for his money - I then thought the prosecutor was robbed, and began to turn this in my mind; Mrs. Smith confesses herself that she was in the wrong.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH JOHANNA re-examined. Q.you had no clothes in pawn? A. No - I was not at the woman's house; I never did give the note to the wife - I never had any sheets or a gown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My wife went to take her own things out;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080095"/>if I took the money he could have told the Police-officer of me - he never asked me for it.</p>

               <p>MARY CLARKE. I am the wife of Thomas Clarke - he is now at Walton-on-Thames. The prisoner lived with me five or six weeks, and left as I did not want her any more - I missed several things; I told her to take a shawl to my sister's - nearly a fortnight after she left me I asked my sister for my shawl; she said she had not got it - my sister and I took a walk, and I saw the prisoner sitting at the Orange Tree public-house with my shawl on; I took it from her.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WARDEN. The witness came to me in George-street, and when we came to the corner of Crescent-street, I saw the prisoner running down the street, and the prosecutrix crying Stop thief! she ran into a picture-shop, and the prosecutor gave charge of her; I took her to the station-house, and found a pair of pockets on her, a pair of black silk gloves, and a white handkerchief in them; I took her to the office, and on her examination she was asked if she had a box; she said Yes, at No. 3, Milford-place, and if I went there I could get it - I went, and found a number of articles, which the prosecutrix swears to - here are two shirt-collars, three pairs of stockings, and three pieces of cotton, which were in the box.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner to MRS. CLARKE. Q.Have you not given me the stockings - the gloves and handkerchief do not belong to you? A. To the best of my knowledge, the gloves are mine; I never gave her a pair of stockings, on my oath.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She is a false-swearing woman - she threatened to take her husband's life with a knife, or give him a dose of poison; she was going away because there was an execution against her husband - I have heard her threaten her husband's life, because, as I can understand, she was jealous of me.</p>
               <p>MRS. CLARKE. She had lived with us between five and six weeks - my husband went into the country; I had an execution in my house - I never had any quarrel with my husband, more than man and wife have; I have never been jealous of him - I never had any reason to talk to him about her; I had other difficulties to think of - I never suspected any thing particularly improper between them.</p>

               <p>DANIEL COLLINS. I am a Policeman. I saw the prisoner on the 3rd of June, at half-past three o'clock in the morning; I traced him till he came to the end of Cock-court - I then asked what he had in his soot-bag; he said he would show me - he went into a house, and thought to go up stairs, but I laid hold of the bag, and said I would know what there was in it; he put it down, and I found in it these four springs.</p>
               <p>ANDREW DUNN. I am a Police-constable, and was with Collins - I found out the owner of these things; I took them, marked them privately, and put them down - the prisoner ran off; I went out, and met the constable with him; our inspector said, "Where did you get them?" he said he found them in coming from Holloway - he asked him how he came to start away, and he muttered at that.</p>
               <p>JOHN DENNIS. I locked up my shed on the 2nd of June, and at eight o'clock in the morning I found the springs of both carts gone - they had been on the carts the night before, and had been taken off; one pair is mine, and one is Alexander's - I sent for a smith, and he said they could not have been taken off better by a smith.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ALEXANDER. I live in <placeName id="t18300708-185-crimeloc1040">Crown-street, St. Pancras</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At half-past three o'clock a young man called for me, and asked me to carry him some soot; when I got to Holloway-road I said, "This is not soot;" he said, "Never mind, I got them from my brother's, at Holloway" - this officer then took me, and I put them down inside the door; he did not look after the other man - he is twenty-three years old, and the father of three children.</p>
               <p>ISAAC COOK. I have been a watchman several years, and am now a private watchman. At half-past three o'clock that morning I saw the prisoner and another - the prisoner had the sack on his back, and these springs in it with some straw - the Policeman came to me, and asked me for a light; the two sweeps then went by him, and he took no notice of them - I called him back, and said,"These sweeps have something they ought not to have;" the other sweep had a machine under his arm.</p>

Yes; my brother was out at that time - he was taken up; my mother thought he must he concerned in this - he has, in general, borne an honest character; he was not accused of any thing till after he knew Martin - my mother has accused him of some trifling things; he has been accused of opening his father's locks - he never used a key before he knew Martin; I did see him with she purse that was taken from the prosecutor - he emptied out the contents of it, and threw the purse away; he struck me when I threatened to inform and called me by a most abandoned and vali name - he did not threaten that he would knock my b - y brains out, not use a worse expression; I cannot remember the name he called me - he is not here to day; by what I can learn, Martin gave him the purse; the purse was afterwards found - I did see my brother throw away a seal belonging to the watch; his name is Agesilaus - he is between twelve and thirteen years of age.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MACKIE. I live at a pawnbrokers. The prisoner brought the watch to me to ask the value of it, on the 29th of June - this is it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Agesilaus Camble? A. No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM THICKTHENER. I am a watch-maker. This watch was brought to me, and I was asked if it was worth any thing; I said, No, it was worth nothing - the person who brought it said,</p>
               <p>"Will you give nothing for it;" I said</p>
               <p>"I will give you half-a-crown" for it, as I thought it would do for my son to practice upon - when I took it to pieces it was worth nothing; it is what we call a duffer - it is made to sell, not to go; I do not know who brought it, but I really believe the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you sure it is a duffer? A. Yes; I have had a hundred through my hands.</p>
               <p>JOHN EAGLE. I am a Police-constable. I was sent for to the house about ten o'clock at night - this poker laid about two feet from the door - there is a hole where the poker had been forced in, and the wood was splintered off; I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And I believe you took Agesilaus? A. Yes; he is not near so big as the prisoner - I should take him to be about eleven years old.</p>
               <p>MARGARET ATKINS. This watch was my husband's, and went very well while he lived - it went very well for twenty months after he bought it; I have not seen any thing else.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming home from work, and met this boy - he showed me the watch, and said he gave some marbles for it; he went down with me to the pawnbroker - I asked if it was any good; I then returned it him, went home, and was taken out of bed.</p>

I knew the prisoner about five years ago, through my brother knowing some of his friends: the last parcel of these knives was found on the prisoner's person, they had been taken from the counter glass-case - I had missed some three weeks or a month ago, and we could not find how they were gone; on the 4th of July I concealed myself, and heard the prisoner come into the shop - on his leaving it I stopped him, and gave him into custody; the officer took him to the watch-house, and on him were found nineteen knives and nineteen forks.</p>
               <p>EVAN WILLIAMS. I heard the knives and forks rattle while I went down for some beer, and the prisoner was in the shop.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRIFFIN. I took him in charge, and found them in his pocket.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I was on duty early in the morning of last Sunday week: I saw the prosecutor, who appeared to me to be intoxicated, and the prisoner was with him - I saw them go to McCallister's house; I sent a person to tell the landlady to keep a sharp look out - I stood not far from the house; I was called in, and told she had done him - I found 3l. 18s. 6d. on the table; the man said there was another sovereign - the prisoner denied having any more; I searched her, and found this other sovereign in her glove.</p>

I met the two prisoners in Grove-end-road, between twelve and one o'clock at night, together; Humphries had this boiler and Kempshaw the kettle - I asked what they had - they said Nothing; I insisted upon seeing what it was, and they said they had it from Mr. Hinton's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you tell that to the Magistrate? A. Yes; and Mr. Rawlinson asked if they were covered, and I told him the second time that they were wrapped up; I did not say they had them openly, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>JAMES WHEELER. These are our property; this boiler has been lately mended - I have used it four or five years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where were they deposited that night? A. On the stove adjoining the house; it is an open place - I should think we had fourteen or fifteen additional waiters; I do not know whether one of them was rather familiar with one of these women.</p>

               <p>Griggs. Q.Can you swear you saw me? A. Yes, you were there for twenty minutes - you were five or six yards off when I took you.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNERLY. I met Betraum - he told me Jones had something in his apron; he was turning into Wardour-street - I went and asked him what he had in his apron; he refused to tell me - I was taking these stockings from him when Betraun came and took him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PLANT. The shop is mine, and these stockings are mine; here is my ticket on them - here are twelve pairs of them; I missed them when my attention was drawn to them.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH KING. I am a baker. I was passing, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket - the prosecutor turned, and asked if I saw any one take it; I pointed out the prisoner, who was running- he followed, and called Stop thief! I understood the prisoner dropped the handkerchief, but I did not see it -I am confident the prisoner took it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How near were you to him? A. Close to him - I was passing; he tucked it into his pocket, and ran off - I was not momentarily prepared to take him - it was raining fast.</p>
               <p>JAMES BROOKS. I took the prisoner. This handkerchief was given to me by a strange woman, who picked it up - I found nothing on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see him drop it? A. No; I ran over it; it was raining.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM JACKSON. I am a coach-painter. I saw the prisoner coming up stairs with the copper on his shoulder- I went, and asked Feary if Mr. Gibbons had sent for it; he ran down, missed it, pursued the prisoner, and took him with it - the copper fitted the place exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You swore I was the person, and could not give any description of my clothes. Witness. No; the copper was over your jacket - I could not speak to that, but I could to your face; I saw him again in ten minutes.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HAYFORD. I am a labourer. At twenty minutes before one o'clock I was passing through Pitfield-street, Hoxton, and saw a man with a copper - in a few minutes the prisoner came running towards him; I thought it was not right, and followed them to Charles-square - I saw the prisoner then accost the other man, and the prisoner took the copper; Feary came, and asked if I had seen a man with a copper - I said, "There he is;" the prisoner then threw the copper down, and ran; but I pursued, and took him - he said he was to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080100"/>have 1s. for carrying it; they came in different directions- the prisoner came in, as if from Queen-street - he was about one hundred and fifty yards from it.</p>
               <p>PETER CARNEY. I am a Policeman. I took the prisoner - he said he was to have 1s. for carrying it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going through the square, and the man asked me to carry it, and said he would give me 1s.; as soon as I had it on my back I was taken - the other man ran away.</p>
