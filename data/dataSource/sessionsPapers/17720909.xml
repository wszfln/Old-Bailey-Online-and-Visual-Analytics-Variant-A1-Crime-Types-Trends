I took another sup of my beer and went in his name; he described the watch to me; this young man said I should have the money presently; he went up stairs and brought in some men, and they took me before Sir

            . I saw the prisoner on Friday the 17th of July standing under an arch way, in Bell Yard, Broad St. Giles's, by himself, with a bundle in his hand; I lifted my clothes as I passed him for fear I should touch him and give him any offence; he said, how do you do? I said. I believe you don't know me; he said you are well dressed; he asked me my name and where I lived; he said his name was Conway, and that he lived in Cheapside; as I stood with him, he asked me if my buckles were silver, I said yes, and Irish made; I asked him where he knew me; he said in Dublin; I said I was a Cork woman, and had never been in Dublin in my life; he said he had 200 l. worth of goods, and if I would sell goods for him, I should get five shillings a day; I said that my husband was acquainted with several master tradesmen that would give us a character to be honest people; I waited, and he went into a public house; I said I had an acquaintance in Ship Yard that would befriend him, to recommend him to sell some goods; he said he knew no place but the Haymarket and Cheapside; he waited in an alehouse till I came back; he called for a pen and ink, and took a direction to find the Mitre Tavern in Fleet Street. I went into a public house with him and had a pint of beer; I told him I had not broke my fast. and it was past six o'clock. I had been a little troubled and had eat nothing that day. Offering to pay for the pint of beer, he said, d - n it, how generous my country people are! I went to a taylor's house in Broad St. Giles's, to see a young woman that was newly married; I came back again to the same alehouse; he had a pint of beer there and paid for it. I had not the key to let him up into my own lodgings. He said he had left six pieces of handkerchiefs with a good natured countrywoman, at a public house, in a street he said he did not know the name of. I found afterwards it was in Coventry Street. He said he must go out of town, and he said if I would go with him, he would give them to me; I went with him; he called for a quartern of mint and carraway; I told him I could not bear liquor; he said it was a cordial and I drank; after that he called for another; when we were going away, he went to the bar, and offered a bad shilling; the man would not take it, so he gave him another. When I came out at the door it was dusk; he went to take hold of me; I told him he should not; I stumbled and fell down, and I found my apron coming from me. I asked him if he saw my apron; he said no, d - n your apron, I will give you a yard of muslin; I said a yard would not make an apron; then he said he would give me three. I crossed over to a tavern in Grafton Street; I was going home; I bid him good night. Then he came to my right side and took my cloak and handkerchief, and took me by my hand; he took hold of me and shook me, and threw me on the flags, and threw me into a deep hole on my side; he picked my pocket, and then turned me over in the channel to pick my other pocket; I had but ten-pence; he took my gold ring off, then he took hold of my feet, and took my buckle from my left foot. A gentleman came up, and said, what are you doing to the woman, are you smothering her in the channel? he said he was going to lift me up, and then he made off. The next day my husband went to the public house, and found out his name, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090005"/> where he lived. I went with my husband and a constable to the prisoner's house, in Ship Yard; a person said the prisoner's wife had put something black up the chimney; my husband put his hand up the chimney and pulled my cloak down. (The cloak produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix) The constable found my handkerchief and apron in a cradle. ( Produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man that took your things from you?</p>
               <p>Duffey. Yes, I should know him from among a thousand.</p>

               <p>Q. You never saw him before?</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day did he accost you?</p>
               <p>Duffey. About six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It was quite light?</p>
               <p>Duffey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many public houses did you drink together at?</p>
               <p>Duffey. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you quite sober?</p>
               <p>Duffey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he untied your apron, did you feel him?</p>
               <p>Duffey. He put his hand round me, and I saw him draw it from me; I did not lay hold of it, because I thought it was from the motion of my body; when I looked for it, and it was gone, I thought it was vanished; I did not think he had it when I went from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be sober?</p>
               <p>Duffey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening did he take off your cloak?</p>
               <p>Duffey. Between nine and ten; that was in <placeName id="t17720909-4-crimeloc19">Grafton Street, at the top of Newport Market</placeName>

               <p>Q. Were not all the shops open?</p>
               <p>Duffey. There are no shops hardly but on one side; some of them were open.</p>
               <p>Q. Now upon your oath, did you ever cry out thief or murder, or any thing else, while he was untying your cloak?</p>
               <p>Duffey. I said to him don't kill me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you did not cry out for assistance?</p>
               <p>Duffey. He was not a minute doing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into any house in the street afterwards upon your oath?</p>
               <p>Duffey. No my own lodging was very near.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any of the passengers that you had been robbed, and the man had made his escape?</p>
               <p>Duffey. Yes, one woman; I don't know her name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fall down in the street from the effects of the mint and carraway?</p>
               <p>Duffey. I am a sober woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink a little of it?</p>
               <p>Duffey. I drank a full glass.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you stumble the first time?</p>
               <p>Duffey. I was pulling myself from him and stumbled upon my knee.</p>
               <p>Q. Who helped you up?</p>
               <p>Duffey. Myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have not you charged two or three other people with this?</p>
               <p>Duffey. No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the Fountain that evening?</p>

            . Between nine and ten in the morning of the 20th of July, I saw the prisoner talking to a woman in Prescot Street; they soon parted; she went away and the prisoner walked by the prosecutor's house, and then he went in. I said to a man that was near me, stay a little,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090007"/> and we shall see what the man is about. I soon perceived him in the parlour; I saw him take up the sugar dish and milk pot, and bring them towards the door; then he saw the other man and me standing in the passage, and returned them to the place again; the milk was spilt and the sugar was scattered about the table; I stept up to him, took him by the collar, and asked him what business he had with that plate; he said he had none.</p>

               <p>Mr. Legh. On Wednesday the 6th of May, I spent the evening with some friends in Gate Street, Lincoln's-inn-fields; I staid there till between twelve and one o'clock in the morning; there is a court yard before the house; the servant of the gentleman at whose house I was came out with a candle, and lighted me quite into the street. I went towards Lincoln's-inn-fields; when I came towards the end of the street, <placeName id="t17720909-13-crimeloc55">near Stonecutter's alley</placeName>

I called out for assistance, upon which I received some other blows upon my head, and was very soon brought to the ground; when I got up, I did not see any one; I saw my wig about a yard from me; I took it up and called for the watch; the watch came and went with me to my lodgings. I never saw or heard any person, I only felt them. I have not recovered the right use of my arm yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any injury upon your head?</p>
               <p>Legh. No; I was bruised on my right side by the fall. I believe the blows upon my head were given with a pistol.</p>

We went to the watch box; we met two men; I asked them if they were not in company with them; they said no. I said we have been robbed; they went with me; we met two other men, and we all five pursued them; I saw them both run over into a field, and in less than five minutes (they had before got out of my sight) I saw them in a road that goes to Portland Street, crossing out of that into the field; they went into a field where stones are laid that are taken up from the old pavement. I ran after Kem, but lost him among the stones. A person was looking out at a window, who said he saw the man go by. I went into the New Road again, and met with several men; we were at the Pye House informed that a man was in the common sewer, who afterwards proved to be Johnson; the common sewer was broke in.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that out of the road?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. Yes. We went there; I saw Johnson just at the hole, and another man who had got hold of him; he had disfigured his face that I could not at that time swear to his face, but I could swear to his clothes and hat. The other (Kem) was taken next night, in a street that goes out of Leicester-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Johnson first attacked you, had you ever seen him before?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. No, it was rather dusk; I could see to the Turnpike very plain; Johnson had a brown coat on and a round hat; I could see his face, I am certain he is the person. The other was dressed in a brown great coat, and such a hat as Johnson's, but I did not take so much notice of him as of Johnson. I challenged Johnson next morning as soon as he was brought out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say the night before?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. That I could not swear to his face he was so disfigured, but I could to his clothes and hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to Kem?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. He appears to be the same man; he is the same size and dress, but I will not swear to his face; I do believe him to be the man; I did not take so much notice of him as of Johnson.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been that night?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. I was coming from home. I went into Titchfield street to call for this young woman to take a walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. I don't kno w that I had had a pint of beer that day.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a day had it been?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. A very fine day.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from Kem?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. About a yard or three quarters of a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you never saw Johnson before, and you did not know him that night afterwards you say?</p>

               <p>Kitchen. He was disguised.</p>
               <p>Q. That place you say is a common sewer where Johnson was found; there is a way across the field I believe?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. I don't know that there is any common foot path, any further than some people make a practice of going through that field; I saw the prisoner go into that field.</p>

            . I was walking with Mr. Kitchen on Wednesday the 5th of August, about a quarter before nine, and as we were walking towards the Turnpike at Marybone, the two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090010"/> prisoners met us; they had each a pistol. Kem presented one to me, and Johnson one to Mr. Kitchen. Kem d - d me, and bid me deliver my money, or my life, this moment, or I'll blow your brains out; I told him I was only a servant and had no money; he said d - n you don't you tell me so, I insist upon your money this minute. I told him not to be in so great a hurry and what I had got he should have; I pulled a silk handkerchief out of my pocket; I held it in my other hand; I had nothing but a few halfpence and a silver thimble, I held in my hand to shew him; he said, d - n you don't tell me so, you have more; he held the pistol fast to my breast, whilst I held my pockets, for him to feel. When he had felt in my pocket and found there was no more, he said, d - n your eyes but I will have your silk handkerchief, and I will have the price of a pot or pint of beer, I am not sure which, and he took that and my silver thimble. When they were going away we offered to go back with them, and they turned about, and said, d - n your eyes go on, make no noise, or we will blow your brains out this minute. We made a stop, and they turned about again, and repeated the same words, and bid us say nothing and make no noise; we went on and saw two men a-coming; I asked them if they had met two men; they said they did; I said do you belong to them; they said no; one of them asked what was the matter; I said they had robbed us. One of them said he heard one of the men say as they passed them, d - n me. I'll never want money; we asked them to assist, and they went in pursuit of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen them before?</p>
               <p>Spencer. Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoners are the men that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Spencer. I am positive to Kem that he robbed me. I am not positive to the other; I thought I knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Kem again?</p>
               <p>Spencer. On the Friday afternoon, at Justice Welch's; I was taken into a large room where there were a great many men, I suppose there were thirty, in order to see if I knew him; I picked him out instantly; I saw Johnson at a public house that night when he was taken; I said then by the size of the man, that I believed he was one that robbed us, but he was so disfigured with dirt that I could not be certain to him; he seemed to have fell down in the dirt, his hands and face were very dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Spencer. No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you very much frightened?</p>
               <p>Spencer. Yes; if it had not been for the help of a gentleman I afterwards met, I don't believe I should have been able to have got home.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in this great fright and confusion was it possible for you to take notice of this man so as to know him again?</p>
               <p>Spencer. Yes; there was light enough to discern any face, and I had my eyes upon him all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. But you was in a good deal of confusion?</p>
               <p>Spencer. I was in more confusion when they left us than when they were with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you point this man out at first?</p>
               <p>Spencer. When I first went into the room, I said I don't know; then I looked about, and I went up to him, and said that is the man that robbed me; I asked him to stand up; when he stood up I knew him perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw his face before he stood up?</p>
               <p>Spencer. No, his hat was over his face.</p>
               <p>Q. You might see his face without his standing up; do you form your judgment from his face or his size?</p>
               <p>Spencer. From both; I could not have been so very positive to him unless he had stood up, I could not have seen his dress so well.</p>
               <p>Q. His dress was a circumstance then?</p>
               <p>Spencer. His size and face were more.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you pointed to any body in the room before?</p>
               <p>Spencer. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you point to the man's brother, or had any doubt of his being the person?</p>
               <p>Spencer. No.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Green Man. On the 5th of August, about a quarter before nine, Mr. Mascall came to me, and said a footpad had got into the sewer; we took each a light from the bar; I went first; the sewer is in a field, some dung carts had broke it down, and it is rather better than a yard deep. When I came to the sewer I put the candle down and the prisoner jumped up that moment, ab, said he, what is the matter! He had been under the arch; I said you have no business here; he said he was very much in liquor; Mr. Mascall and I laid hold of him; he gave a struggle and wanted to get off; I told him it would be best<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090011"/> for him not to struggle; he said, I am very much in liquor, how I came here I cannot tell. Kitchen came up, and said he could swear to his clothes and hat, but his face to be sure was very dirty; he said he could not swear to his face then on that account. He had fell down upon his side; his breeches and one side of his stocking were very wet. We took him to the watch house.</p>
               <p>- Marshall confirmed this evidence; he also said that Kitchen described Johnson to them before they want to seek him in the sewer; and added, that the prisoner, after they had taken him, went through a narrow passage, where only one could pass at a time; that there they let go of him, and he did not attempt an escape, and that the prisoner was sober when they took him into custody.</p>

When we came up to the man and woman, they asked us if we had met two man; we said we had; they asked us if we belonged to them; we said no; they said they had just been robbed of a watch and handkerchief, and the man asked us to go back and assist in pursuit of them; we followed them across the road into the field.

            . On Thursday morning about a quarter after five o'clock, Stalker came to me and said Kitchen had been robbed, and he suspected the man had hid the watch in the sewer; we both went together down into the sewer; I found this pistol there; ( producing it) it lay about three feet six or four feet from the hole, pressed down as far as the bricks would allow, and it was covered; groping about in the dirt I found the watch, about four or five inches from where the pistol was. I gave the watch and pistol to Stalker.</p>

They asked him if he would swear to the pistol, he said he knew nothing of it, nor of the watch, he only knew the black ribbon to it. I played at skittles all the afternoon, at the Adam and Eve; I got in liquor, and fell into this common sewer, and being overpowered with liquor I could not get out again.

            . The night the house was robbed I had given orders to my servant to call me at half after five; I was surprised he did not call me till six, then he knocked at my door, and said, I wish you would get up; I got up; I met him on the stairs, he said, Sir, we have been robbed, and your desk and draws are broke open; I went down stairs, and I perceived that the way they came in, was at the window of a room the servants call their dressing room; the shutter appeared to have been bored with an angur; a piece was broke out about two feet long and three inches broad; the holes were about the size of my little singer, and a joint of the window shutter was taken out. My servants trunk or chest was forced open, and there was another chest in the same room forced open, and the contents were taken out. I then went up into my dressing room, and there I saw my bureau was broke open; there were about five guineas, and three or four pounds in silver, in a little leather bag in one of the drawers, which was taken away; I put the money into the drawer on Monday night; out of that same drawer was taken a gold watch chain and two seals; there was a little door in the bureau which was locked, that was forced open, but there was nothing there for them to take; there was taken from another a set of pinch beck gift coat and waistcoat buttons; they have not been found again.</p>
               <p>Durant. This gold chain, buckles and seals, (producing them) were in the silver saucepan, which was in the hands of Jones.</p>

I know nothing of Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to take them to you?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I was taken up on suspicion of buying stolen goods; this man undoubtedly thought it was true and so came to me.</p>
               <p>Jones. That is his original character.</p>
               <p>Q. from Sunderland. Did not I come to you when Jones and you were disputing about the price?</p>

               <p>Q. from Sunderland. Did not I say if you don't agree they shall not be in my house?</p>
               <p>Thomas. No, he never said any such word; I was to give him I think five guineas; they said they had more goods in the country; I said I would not pay for them till I had them all.</p>

            ; I got up about half after five upon the 3d of September; I found myself locked in the room, and there was another servant with me; I was obliged to get out at the back window into the garden, and so to go round to the front door to call a servant to let me in. I was the first servant up in the house; I found the blind tore and the sash up in a small room under the stair case, that we put our clothes in. I suspected the house had been robbed; I called my master and he went with me; we found several locks broke and things lost.</p>

               <p>Q. Who makes fast the windows of a night of the room where the clothes hung up?</p>
               <p>Varley. I made them fast that night before the house was broke open; it was fastened with two cross iron bars from top to bottom, and a little bar which goes in the middle of the shutter; there was a blind I made fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Who looks after the windows in general?</p>
               <p>Varley. One of the maids; I fastened that window that night; I fastened the street door which was found open in the morning; I fastened the iron gate too; there is a lock to it and the door, and a bolt and bar; I fastened the door fronting the iron gate.</p>
               <p>Grover. That door was open in the morning and just pulled to; I suppose they let themselves out at that after they had got into the inside.</p>
               <p>Ghent. The lock of the iron gate was forced open.</p>
               <p>Varley. I lost a thickset frock, a waistcoat, a pair of breeches, five shirts, three stocks, a pair of stockings and three neckcloths. (The thickset frock produced by Thomas and deposed to by Varley.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Grover. Was it light when you got up?</p>
               <p>Grover. Yes, quite light.</p>
               <p>Ghent. I am butler; I know this silver saucepan to be my master's property.</p>
               <p>Court to Thomas. Now give a full account of what passed between you and Jones in Sunderland's presence; don't say a word of what Jones said of Sunderland when he was not there; nor of what Sunderland said when Jones was not present.</p>
               <p>Thomas. Jones came to me at my house in Wells Street, on Friday morning last, and fetched me to Sunderland's; when I came there he said come up stairs; Jones said the shirts were as good as new. Sunderland came up directly upon that; he said take them out of the house for God sake, for he would not have them there; Jones said if I would not buy them he would fetch somebody else, and immediately tied them up in a handkerchief. My intention was not to buy the goods, but to apprehend them. I asked if that was all, and they both said they had some plate in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of Mr. Franks's robbery then?</p>
               <p>Thomas. No; I did it in order to bring them to justice, and clear my own character. They said they would fetch the plate and be at home at night. Jones asked me if I had any money, and would lend him a little; I lent

             a 27 s. piece; I asked him what time they would be in town at night; they said about ten or eleven; I went to Durant, and got him, Mr. Blain and Mr. Haines to wait at the house for their return.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they?</p>
               <p>Thomas. One is a salesman, the other a carpenter. We sat up that night waiting for them till between twelve and one o'clock; this was Thursday night; we waited on Friday night at my house; I expected they would come there or let me know they were come; as they did not come, we went to Sunderland's house, to see if he was come to town; Sunderland's wife looked out at the window, and said he was a-bed drunk, and desired we would make it the first thing in the morning, and we might have it. I told them we had better let it alone till morning. I got up a little after six and called Durant; we fixed the Bell in the Back Lane to meet at; we met there by seven; we went to Sunderland's house; he was not at home; we went to a public house just by, and they were to send Sunderland to us. After some time he came there, and said he had robbed Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090015"/> Frank's house two years ago; he said they had been a chisseling of him; that they had brought him bad cloth. He shewed us a news paper with an advertisement of this robbery of Mr. Franks. He said they had been robbing one another, meaning they had kept half the things to themselves, and not let him have his share. He shewed me and Durant the news paper, and said he had got two pair of pistols, and that they had chisselled him, and he shewed the muzzle of a pistol, and said, that he should have the contents his belly; he mentioned Jones's name, and that he had seven yards and a half of cloth. He shewed me the news paper, with an advertisement of Mr. Franks, and said the cloth they had sent him was not so good as that advertised; he did not show us the cloth; he said they gave him that. I recommended Mr. Durant to buy the gold and the silver saucepan; it was then at Sunderland's house; Sunderland wanted me and Durant to have it without Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said where this gold and the silver saucepan came from?</p>
               <p>Thomas. Not at that time; I was unwilling to do that because I wanted to have Jones there; he said he had a banker's draught in his pocket. Sunderland wanted to go home; he did, and said he would send for us when Jones came home. He sent in about ten minutes; we were afraid to go by ourselves; as he talked about the pistols, I thought it rather hazardous to go; there were four of us waiting; then we got

            , then there were six of us; we went to Sunderland's; when we came there Jones had a saucepan in his hand and a gold chain; he asked if we had any weights and scales to weigh it. Then Gusset came in, and the other people followed him; only Jones was below at that time; Sunderland, run up stairs into the lost; there we brought him down. We secured them and then searched the house; we found the pistols and the rest of the things that have been produced; one pair of these pistols were loaded. Jones had the silver saucepan in his hand; he threw it down by him when I seized him; the gold chain, two pair of buckles and the seal were in the saucepan.</p>
               <p>Jones. He said first, it was Friday morning I first came to him; then he said he sat up for us on Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Thomas. No; I said he came first to me on Thursday about noon; that when he came first to me, he said he was going out of town. It was Saturday morning we took them; then the rest of the goods were found.</p>
               <p>Jones. I hope you will enquire into the character of that man.</p>
               <p>Court. He tells you he is a person suspected of receiving stolen goods himself; you may call any person to give him a bad character if you will.</p>

            . I am a peruke-maker. Durant applied to me at the desire of Thomas to assist him. I went with them; Jones was the first man we saw below stairs; we secured him and bound him; I saw them pick the things up, they had just been thrown down. I thought I heard a noise up stairs; I looked into the chamber; I saw nothing there; Gusset went up with me; we took a loaded pistol with us of Durant's. In the Garret we saw the cieling broke between the joists, and there was a great smother. I said somebody was got up stairs; I observed a little trap door in one corner of the room; said I, let's get up here; we got up and saw Sunderland endeavouring to hide himself by the side of the chimney; endeavouring to get there pretty fast, I suppose he had broke through the rafters; he was as high as he could go except getting over the tiling, what they call the cock loft. I told him to come down or it would be the worse for him; he said, what is the matter? what have I done now? he said he had done nothing as he knew of; I said, how came you to run into such an odd place as this? with threats we got him down into the lower part of the house; we pinioned him the same as Jones, and then tied them both together. In the closet, in the one pair of stairs room, I found three pistols, two unloaded and one loaded, and in the corner another pistol loaded, bound round with an old handkerchief (producing them.) We had a search warrant, and took them before the magistrate. I was present when the ruffles were dug up from under ground and the other things.</p>

I had the direction to his house out of their pockets, in Wells-street, Spitalfields; they left the bundles at Mr. Sunderland's house. I went to Thomas on Thursday afternoon, not Friday morning; I told him I would be there in the evening, if I was not somebody would; I did not go that evening; the next morning Thomas told me if I had ever so many things he would buy them, let them come from where they would, and be what they would; they told me they were obligated to go into the country again.

             I will satisfy you for your trouble, and said, go and fetch a pot of beer; I went. I said when I was going out, take them up stairs, there is an empty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090017"/> room; instead of taking them up stairs into the room where Thomas took them from, he put them into my own room; when we had drank we had some more, and some gin; I asked him some questions about the country; they are two country people, one would think they hardly knew London; he said you will see my brother-in-law to-morrow morning; he asked me where the necessary was that was backwards; whether he left any thing in the yard I cannot be positive; then he went away, but as he was going I went up stairs, and said these things must not be left here, take them up into the other room, which he did; there he put them; he opened them, I believe; I did not go up that night, being late; I saw the things in the morning, and was very uneasy when I came home; the morning after I had been out; I was frightened; my wife said Mr. Jones and another man were up stairs; I went up, there was a dispute; he was to give four guineas, they had reckoned up the different articles, and there is the chalks of the different articles upon the door now; he was going to fetch somebody else; I said no they shall not be here; they agreed for four guineas; I said they should not be here; they took the bundles down; he gave the man the money; I saw him going out; when they came back I said, where are you going? he said he should be back again by and by. I said to my wife are the things all gone, she said yes; I said I was glad of it. As I had been lame a good while with a bad leg I said I would lie down on the bed and rest myself; I did. This man came and said if I would take a walk a little way he would meet me. They paid for, I believe, a pot of beer a-piece, and I went home. The next morning these other things were brought, but when I went to bed that night, I went into the closet, and there I saw them four pistols lay. I did not say a word to my wife; I was frightened; I knew she would not lie in the house if she knew it. I got up in the morning, and said Lord have mercy upon me, here is so and so in the house; she flew in a passion; I said they should not be there long; I went out of the house, and met these two people who were drinking at the Rose. I asked them if they had got the things, they said they were in our house; I was fearful; I went home again, and said I must go and lie down again; I went and laid down upon the bed; I had not been there long before I heard a prodigious noise below stairs; it struck in my head it was something more than ordinary, and I tryed to get out of the way. I had nothing with me, nor about me; they took me down; I desired them to search me; they said they could not search without a warrant; I said you may break every thing open. They took me away; when they came before the justice, Thomas was asked the first time, if ever he bought any thing of me; he said, No; and I have bought nothing of him now. He says I shewed him the advertisement - there was an advertisement of 50 l. reward - He said that he thought he could better make a property of it, and wants now to swear this for the sake of the reward; because I am certain, by all account, they are people of the worst of characters; as to the things, when they were dealing, this man said there were some old things, a shirt and an handkerchief, he bid me put them by me; and some old stockings, he said give them to your wife; there was an old ragged shirt, two sleeves, and an indifferent body to it.</p>
               <p>Durant. What Sunderland says of going home to lie down is a truth. I asked them how they could get into a gentleman's house with servants, and when he had given an account by what means he got in, he said he would go home.</p>
               <p>Q. to Durant. Had you any conversation with Sunderland or Jones about how they got into the house?</p>
               <p>Durant. A great deal with Sunderland, at the sign of the Rose in Rose lane; the way we came to talk about it was; he was sent by his wife to the house as she promised; the wife produced the sausepan and seal and things, and wanted us to take them out of the house, and agree when her husband came home; he came to the house in a little while; he then got the news-paper, with respect to the quantity of things lost, he particularly mentioned some cloth; he read the article of the advertisement, particularly pointing to some cloth he said he only received seven yards, not worth above 14 d. of the good cloth; I said how could you get into the house, where there are so many servants; he said he was the first man that entered the room; I said there were only you and Jones; he said yes, there were three; that some of the servants he thought were stirring, and he locked either the porter, or somebody into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made him any promise, or any thing in the world before he told you this?</p>
               <p>Durant. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor threatened him?</p>
               <p>Durant. No; he looked upon me that I came to purchase the gold and silver.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090018"/>Q. to Thomas. Was you by at that time?</p>
               <p>Thomas. The same he told to Mr. Durant he told to me, that he was the first man in, and the first man out, and had locked some of the servants in.</p>
               <p>Jones. The agreement was four guineas, not five.</p>

               <p>Brittles. Nineteen.</p>
               <p>Q. From your account of the matter, Crook's confession to you purported, that he had been forced by Gibson?</p>
               <p>Brittles. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that he was much in liquor at the time, and that it was against his inclination?</p>
               <p>Brittles. Yes; he made him drink on purpose, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. I think, Crook, when he told you the story, proposed going before a Justice of the peace, did he, or did you propose it to him?</p>
               <p>Brittles. After I told him it was a very bad affair, he took on and cried himself to sleep, and declared he would have him taken up. He went up to the watchman in order to have him taken up. Gibson was at that time at the Red Lion; they were both taken up together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Crook make any complaint before the Justice against Gibson?</p>
               <p>Brittles. Yes; the same I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. He meant to prosecute Gibson?</p>
               <p>Brittles. Yes; he told the story to Mr. Wilmot.</p>

I asked him what he thought of himself, he said Gibson forced him to do it; I said don't tell me of forcing of you, do you think any body could have forced me to do so? I would have knocked his brains out; why did you not cry out for assistance?</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any reason why he did not call out for assistance?</p>
               <p>Dennis. No; I took them both into custody, when he came to the watch-house, he told me further, that he went out a second time, about an hour after the first time; after they had drank two or three pints of beer, Gibson asked him to go out to the vault again, and that then he put it into him again, but said he could do nothing; that he tickled him, and acted all that beastly stuff over again. I asked him particularly, Did you enter his body? he said he did.</p>

            . I was officer for the night; Mr. Dennis, the beadle, sent for me to the watch-house about half an hour after ten, to take charge of the prisoners; I found the watch-house full of people; there were two shirts brought there; Crook was giving an account of what had passed between him and Gibson; he said Gibson forced him to do what has been related before; he said when he was upon the vault, Gibson placed himself upon him, and worked himself up and down till he hurt him very much in his body; that he made a second attempt; that Gibson tried it then, and it would not do; then he kissed it, and rubbed it; (this declaration was made before a great number of people); I went out of the watch-house then; when I came in again I said that he should take Crook to another watch-house in our liberty, and I took care of Gibson. When we took them before Justice Wilmot, Crook told there how Gibson had used him; Mr. Wilmot said he looked upon them both alike guilty, and committed them both: there was a shirt produced there that was bloody; I am informed it has been washed since; he acknowledged both in the watch-house, and before the Justice, that he entered Gibson's body.</p>

            . Crook was brought to our watch-house, in Swan-yard, on Monday morning,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090021"/> by Dennis; Crook said that on the 3d of September he left off work in the evening, about seven o'clock; went to the Red Lion in Moorfields, to drink a pint of beer; that just as he had drunk the beer, Gibson came in and sat down by him; that Gibson asked him to drink with him; that when he called for another pint, he asked him if he knew Dick that had lived there; said he, he had a fine - fit to do Mrs. - ; he said after that, he went out at the door to make water, and Gibson followed him, and said, what sort of a c - k have you got? Dick was just such another slim young man as you; let me teel it; which he did; he said it was not so big as his; that then he took him down to the vault, forced him down on the seat, onbuttoned his breeches, then worked him till he made it come, and then sucked it; that he worked it again sometime; that then he pressed him very close, called him his dear, hugged him and squeezed him and sat down, put his hand behind him, and put it into his b - e, and worked up and down till he hurt him vastly, and he believed made him bleed. I asked him if he was in his body; he said he was; that then they went into the house, and sat down, and drank two or three pints of beer; that the y staid in the house about an hour; that then he (Crook) said he wanted to go to the necessary, and he went down, and Gibson came to him when he had been there about a minute, and used him twice as he had done before; that then he said now let me enter you, and unbuttoned his breeches; but he said he catched hold of the door, and gave a spring up, said he should not, and ran from him.</p>

               <p>Gibson's Defence.</p>
               <p>This man forced his discourse to me by producing four or five rings, and a breast buckle, and wanted me to buy them. I was in liquor; I lost a silk handkerchief and a penknife out of my pocket; I did not suspect that he had it, till he acknowledged before the justice that he had borrowed it to pick a marrow bone with. If I was guilty of it, how came he not to secure me in the public house, when so many people were there. I staid till the house was shut up; I went out and wished him a good night; I went again last Sunday was a week to know if he had got these rings finished, for they were in the rough when he had shewed them me before; he told me then that they were metal only, to be cast, and he was a button maker; I said there was no harm, and shook hands with him; he went out with that young man to make this declaration to the constable. If I had been guilty of any such act I should have suspected them, and have gone about my business; instead of that I called for a fresh pint, and waited for his coming. I went to the door and saw these men talking together; I knowing no harm, came in and sat down by the bar; up came one of the men, and said you are my prisoner; I asked him for what; and told him he mistook. I went to the watch-house, and then heard this man say what he did, but not so black as before the justice; he sent home for his shirt; it was all soul in the skirt; he said that was not it; he sent home for another; when that came it was in the same condition; somebody asked him whether he had been buggering somebody in the other shirt at the bean feast, which he said he had been to; he said, no, the necessary was soul, and he had fouled himself in that manner.</p>

When the lodger got up in the morning, about five, he alarmed us directly; when I came down, he had taken up a candle from the ground in the passage, and there were two candles upon the dresser; I saw the grease of the candles on the floor, and I saw two on the dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they there over night?</p>
               <p>Spratley. No; one of them had scorched the dresser cloth almost through; the next thing when I went into the parlour, through a long passage, I saw the bureau drawers in the parlour pulled all about.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the drawers fastened?</p>
               <p>Spratley. No, I believe not. The next thing I saw was the sash of the parlour window shoved up, and the shutter pulled close to, not fastened. They drank a bottle of wine that was standing on the cupboard in the parlour, half a bottle of brandy and a little rum; they opened a jar of pickles, to see what was in it I suppose; they took out a black waistcoat and a pair of breeches out of the drawers the bottom of the bureau. There were taken out of the kitchen, a pair of silver spoons, the table spoons, a silver pepper box, two damask linen tablecloths, and a great many things, the linen apron and black gown; there was a pair of shoe buckles, they were not mine, in a bureau, and some checked cloth, enough I believe for three shirts, and a great coat. Here is a piece of the bottom of the window, that the shutter comes to, to keep the bolt that they wrenched out; (producing it) there was another bolt about the middle of the shutter upon one side, that they shoved back with some instrument; I am certain it was fast over night.</p>

             struck a light; we both went in, and shoved the window up;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090023"/> we pulled the window shutter to again, and he had a key that he pulled out of his pocket, or was in the bureau; he pulled the door open; he had a candle in his pocket, wrapped up in a bit of paper, and a tinder box and matches, and pulled the drawers open, one at a time, and took out what was in them; there was a blackish gown, and some cotton to make shirts of, some striped cotton, and a great large table cloth flowered; there were a great many more things I cannot justly mention.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the bureau?</p>
               <p>Evans. Standing on the left hand side when we went in at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. to Spratley. Is that right?</p>
               <p>Spratley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Evans. Then we went on three or four steps the same side of the room, where there was a good deal of china; we saw the pepper castor with some pepper in it, and a silver spoon; one spoon bigger than a tea spoon; there were two bottles with liquor, one wine I believe; Chapman drank, and then said to me drink; I did; we laid the things upon the ground. I went backwards and searched where the coppers were, there I found half a dozen of tea spoons, in a cupboard where was victuals; the handles of the spoons did not turn up, they went downwards.</p>
               <p>Spratley. They were so, they were in such a cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read and write?</p>
               <p>Evans. Yes. We looked down upon the ground, there was a great deal of copper saucepans and some shoes; I took some of the buckles of; I took one buckle out there in a place on the right hand side in the cellar; I saw some e shoes, and took another buckle out of an other shoe; the buckles have a stamp in the side much like silver, I thought they were her.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Evans. I am not very much acquainted with it; he tells me he is a sea-faring man.</p>

               <p>Evans. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. How many candles did you take there?</p>
               <p>Evans. We had but a little piece in our ket; John Chapman took a bunch of candles a little place in a cupboard, and lighted</p>

               <p>Evans. We tied them up in bundles, and brought them over the fields; he carried me down Old Gravel-lane, to (I believe the place is) Broad-street where Mrs. Nimmy lives; he carried them up stairs, and I lay with him all night. Chapman lodged in her house then.</p>
               <p>Q. Does she live with her husband?</p>
               <p>Evans. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Evans. A watchman I believe; he watches in the night, and works in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him there next day?</p>
               <p>Evans. No. Chapman carried the things away in the morning; I got the cotton to make some shirts of; I brought it to Mrs. Nimmy; I knew her very well; she asked me whose they were; I said my brother bought them for me; I said I was going apprentice, and my mother would pay her, when they were made; I cannot tell where any of the other things were carried; Chapman gave me 12 s. for my share; he sold the things.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom?</p>
               <p>Evans. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see any of these goods at Mrs. Nimmy's?</p>
               <p>Evans. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you carried the shirts, were none of the goods there then?</p>
               <p>Evans. No, I did not see any; the gown was the same colour and same sort as this. I kept the buckles I believe a week; I came down with a pair of buckles on my finger; I said I bought them for silver, and they were not; I changed with her; these are the buckles that were taken out of the house.</p>

On the Saturday immediately preceding the 11th of March, I went out of town; I counted the money I had in a little bag in my desk; there were fifty-four guineas. When I came to town, on Wednesday morning, my son-in-law paid me twelve guineas he had received for me, which I put in the bag; and on the 11th of March I put in eleven guineas more. I was alarmed the next morning by my maid, who informed me that the prisoner had told her the house had been broke open. The head of a pin which fastened the cellar door was filed off. I found sixty-two guineas and a half spilt; the bag was taken out of the desk, and another bag, in which was a single half crown, was cut in the corner; there was a small hole cut in the desk, hardly large enough to put a half crown in. The desk was locked when I came to it; several of the guineas were pitched; they adhered together so, that if lifted up with a stick or any thing they were too wide to come out of the hole, and so I suppose dropt down again. The bags were upon the ground, and one corner of each purse was cut. From all appearances I suspected it must be done by somebody in the house; I charged the prisoner and the rest of the servants, but made no discovery till the 28th of March; when, while I was at Blackheath, I was informed the prisoner had bought a watch of one Mrs. Parker, at Greenwich; her son brought me a guinea they had received of the prisoner, which had pitch upon it; that made me suspect the prisoner. I had him before a justice at Greenwich; there he confessed that he had taken out of the desk fifteen guineas, a half guinea, and a half crown piece, and that he had bought the watch he had been seen with, with part of the money, and that ten guineas of it were concealed in my cellar, at my house, in Tokenhouse-yard, under some planks, near the small beer cask; he said, he took the money out with a small piece of wood pitched, to which the money stuck. I desired Mr. Cooper, my son-in-law, to make a search for the money, and to get Mr. Norman to assist him; he being a carpenter, he would be useful if it was necessary to remove any planks.</p>

               <p>Leader. No.</p>

               <p>Court Swear him - (he is sworn.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner took it?</p>
               <p>Leader. Yes; between six and seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to Mr. Burt's, he called for a pint of beer, and enquired for one of the lodgers. I drawed him the beer and he sat down, and stayed some time; soon after this a gentleman's servant came in with a bundle of linen.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the last witness?</p>
               <p>Leader. Yes; he called for a pint of beer, and laid the bundle down on the table; he went to the door and took a coach; somebody called to my master, and asked whether he had put the bundle by?</p>
               <p>Q. Who called to your master?</p>
               <p>Leader. My fellow servant; he said, no, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090028"/> had not, and sent me after the man to see to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know the man took it?</p>
               <p>Leader. Because the man was missing, and there was nobody in the house but him; I went after him, and catched him at Green's, the Three Tuns.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go into the Three Tuns?</p>
               <p>Leader. Because the prisoner had bid me to tell one of our lodgers to come there to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he tell you that?</p>
               <p>Leader. Before this man came; the lodger was an old clothes man; I was to tell him to come there at breakfast time, and bring the hats with him. On going in, there I found him; he asked what I wanted; I told him I wanted him, and told Mr. Green to keep him there till I fetched my master; he sat by the bundle, and had his arms on the table; my master took it away from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when he took it?</p>
               <p>Leader. My master took the bundle and gave it to this man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man say it was his?</p>
               <p>Leader. No; he asked my master to drink; he said he would not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went to the Three Tuns; a man came in and laid the bundle down by me, and said, will you take care of this bundle, I am going two or three doors further. I never had it in my arms.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body come to Mr. Mitchel's shop in August last to buy a sword?</p>
               <p>Lunn. Yes; a person who called himself Johnson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bargain with you for a sword?</p>
               <p>Lunn. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it?</p>
               <p>Lunn. Thursday the 20th.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day?</p>
               <p>Lunn. Between four and five o'clock; he bargained for the sword for four guineas and a half, and said he would go to a coffee-house, and send the waiter for it; in giving him change I gave him a guinea too much; out of the change he was to give me four shillings, two of which he gave me; he tendered me a bank note.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the note? ( shewing the witness the forged note.)</p>
               <p>Lunn. Yes, it is; I gave him three guineas, two moidores and half a moidore; he gave me two shillings in the shop, and said he would send the other two by the waiter whom he should send for the sword; when he was gone, I counted it over again, and found I had given him a guinea too much.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not mention any coffee-house then?</p>
               <p>Lunn. He said he would go to a coffee-house, and send the waiter; when the young man from the New York Coffee-house brought me the two shillings, I found my mistake; I gave him back my figures, and desired he would send me a guinea and two shillings; while he was gone for the change I sent the note to the next door, to know if it was good; they sent it to a banker's, and the answer was, I think rather suspicious;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090029"/> at my request it was sent to the Bank; the Bank stopt it, and some of the gentlemen came to know whom I had taken it of; I gave the best account I could; they sent, but the man was gone from the coffee-house. He returned me the one pound three shillings; the sword never was delivered; the young man was to have had the sword at the time he gave me the one pound three shillings. I had sent to the Bank, and detained him till the messenger came back.</p>
               <p>Q. After you heard this note was not a good one, did you ever see him any more?</p>
               <p>Lunn. No; the Saturday following one Mr. Williams came.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the person is they called Mr. Johnson?</p>
               <p>Lunn. I never saw him before; he is not the person that came on the Saturday, that is the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come?</p>
               <p>Lunn. Between seven and eight in the evening; he asked me if a Mr. Johnson had not bought a sword the Thursday before; I told him he had; he asked me if the note was good that I took of him; I told him it was not; he said Mr. Johnson had been imposed on by a horse dealer, who gave him two bank notes, one of which proved bad, and fearing mine might be so, he had sent me back five guineas and six-pence, that I might be no looser. I told him Mr. Mitchel was out and I had not the note; he seemed desirous of leaving the money, but I refused it, not having the note with me; he wished to leave the money, and I was to send the note on Monday to Mr. Williams, at

            's coffee-house; I refused the money, and said I would send it on Monday; then he made the offer to come himself on Monday at twelve o'clock; he went away. On Monday morning I went to the Bank to ask for the note; there was no-body of any consequence at the Bank then to give me an answer; I told them I should get the money at twelve o'clock for the note. Mr. Russel and Mr. Payne came over, and said they would send two proper persons to apprehend the man when he came; they sent the note; I was to give it the man and get my money; two proper men came over, but Mr. Williams did not come till the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What time?</p>
               <p>Lunn. I believe about six or seven o'clock; he then asked me if I had got the bill; I asked him if I was to keep the silver hilted sword or the steel one, that Mr. Johnson had looked at; he said the steel one should be laid by for him. I then asked him for the five guineas and six-pence; he did not give it me till I produced the note; I gave him the note, and then he gave me the money; I gave him the note, and then the proper people the governor of the Bank had sent got hold of him; after that he gave me the money.</p>
               <p>Council. Describe the manner of his taking the note.</p>
               <p>Lunn. I cannot; when he came for the note the first time he seemed much flurried; he said he had run, and was out of breath. When the men laid hold of him, he enquired the reason of that treatment.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the note at the time he was apprehended?</p>
               <p>Lunn. I don't know he had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note, and see whether you are certain by any mark upon it, whether that is the identical note he gave you?</p>
               <p>Lunn. Yes; here are the initials of my name upon it, which I wrote at my Lord Mayor's in the evening</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write your name upon it before you went to my Lord Mayor's?</p>

            . I am one of the cashiers of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this note first brought to you?</p>
               <p>Boult. On the 20th of August, about a quarter before five in the evening, it was brought to me for the money; the lad that handed it over, said he wanted the money for it. I having many of the banker's clerks round me, in a hurry took the note; at first sight it appeared to be a bank note; seeing Jackson's name, I went to write my name, in order that they should have the money; perceiving the ink sink I turned my eye to the Britannia, there I saw it blotted; I turned it up to the light to see if it was our paper, and I saw it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the mark in your paper?</p>
               <p>Boult. There is wrote Bank of England in the moulds, and that makes the impression in the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. You are satisfied that it is not a real bank note?</p>
               <p>Boult. Yes, I am certain of it; I then asked the person who produced it, who he brought it from.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not material.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe that mark is not always in bank notes visible in the paper?</p>
               <p>Boult. Sometimes it is not so, when a note has been long worn in the pocket and is dirty; it is always so when we issue them.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes it is so feebly marked in the paper that it is very difficult to trace it at first?</p>
               <p>Boult. Yes; there are other marks besides that.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any instance of your issuing a bank note upon the paper of which these words are not legible?</p>
               <p>Boult. None at all; we never issue them without its being very plain.</p>

I called at the Counter and took Mrs. Butler with me to search the house? she has the upper part of the house; the lower part is a coffee house; when we came to the house she sent a girl to see for the key; she wandered up and down the street, came back, and said she could not find it; I sent a person after to watch her; she went to no one place, upon which Mr. Payne, who was with me, burst the door open; I entered the place immediately; we searched the one pair of stairs; then we asked to search the garret; Mrs. Butler said she had not a key of it, for the man that rented the room of her had got it; I asked where he lived, or what his name was; she said she could not tell; upon which I burst the door open myself, and upon a large oval wainscot table, I found a number of counterfeit shillings, I believe between 1300 and 1400; they were in separate papers, but laid open, and very regular. Upon the same table we found a couple of crucibles which had several sorts of metal in them, seemingly for melting; we crossed the room, and came to a moulding trough, which is to hold the earth in, where we found a pair of brass flasks; that is a thing that holds a quantity of earth to put metal into; we found a lathe likewise that appeared as if it was for turning something of money under it; and there was a crown of a hat with some turnings in it; (a large bag of sand produced) this we found in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the money in court?</p>
               <p>Thompson. Yes; (producing a large bag of counterfeit shillings) in picking them up, I mixed some good shillings with the bad ones; I picked out afterwards all I could find, there is forty-two of them; there was a bench vice, a crucible, (produced) with some shillings unfinished in it, and a piece of wood with a mark for a shilling in it, supposed to be put in the vice to finish the shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no skin at all?</p>
               <p>Thompson. No; we found a Dutch stove, with abundance of charcoal about it; a bottle of quicksilver, a bottle of aquafortis, a bottle of sal prunella, which is proper for the fluxing of metals; we found sheers and tongs, and three sleves full of dirt of the same sort as that ( pointing to the sand used to cast metal in.) The prisoner was brought down to my house next morning; I found upon him the key of that room I broke open. These two pieces of iron match; I don't know the use of them; one I found in his possession, in a basket; the other I found in the room; this file (producing it) was in the basket; there was some metal upon it which seemed to be of the same kind as the fileings in the hat? I found this shilling in his pocket; (producing a counterfeit shilling;) there were besides a crown piece and a sixpence which were good. I found this file (producing it) in the shop, it is smooth on one side. I asked him how he came by that key, which I apprehended would fit this lock; he said he had lodged there formerly, but did not then, and as to any thing found there, he knew nothing at all of the matter; he said one key might fit another lock for all that he knew; he mentioned a house in Shoreditch where he lived; he told me his name was

               <p>Q. The man was brought to you?</p>
               <p>Thompson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a shilling in his pocket, you believe that to be a bad shilling?</p>
               <p>Thompson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have refused it if it had been offered you in payment?</p>
               <p>Thompson. I believe I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever taken such a shilling?</p>

               <p>Thompson. I cannot tell; a man often takes bad money in change and does not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in a metal business?</p>
               <p>Thompson. A watch finisher.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that an instrument that is made use of by a great many trades that work in metal?</p>
               <p>Thompson. It may for what I know.</p>

               <p>Thompson. At founders.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is proper for different kinds of business?</p>
               <p>Thompson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try that key with any other lock, it is a common key?</p>
               <p>Thompson. I tried it with no other.</p>
               <p>Q. You talked with the man; he said he did not lodge at Mrs. Butler's, that the key might fit the door but he knew nothing of the matter?</p>
               <p>Thompson. Yes.</p>

            . I went with Mr. Thompson, when the search warrant was granted, to Mrs. Butler's, in Bartlet's-court, yesterday was fortnight; Mrs. Butler was at the house with Mr. Thompson, and two more constables. Mr. Thompson broke open the prisoner's door: we went into the room and saw the counterfeit shillings wrapped up in different papers, and found the things the same as Mr. Thompson has mentioned. I carried six of the counterfeit shillings to Mr. Lucas, the assay master. I went next day about nine o'clock; I found nobody there; there was a padlock on the outer door; as I was coming back, in order to go to Mr. Thompson's, just before I got into Holborn, in the passage, I met the prisoner, in a green apron, and he had a basket in his hand; he passed me in the narrow part of the passage; it struck me as soon as I saw him, that he was the workman; he passed me, and went up close to Mrs. Butler's door; I was close after him; as soon as he heard somebody behind him, he turned round and looked at me, upon which I said, who do you want here honest friend? he said he wanted Mrs. Butler; I said I suppose you are the person that used the two pair of stairs room; he replied, I did lodge here about six months ago, when I first came to town, but I don't now; I said if you want Mrs. Butler, if you will go with me you shall see her; I went with him to Mr. Thompson's, in Bride-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear as if he wished to go?</p>
               <p>Pain. I told him I should insist upon his going; as we were going along I told him the whole affair; he had several filings in his baskets, and meat and bread and cheese, and that bit of iron which has been produced, and we found two keys on him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked him what he wanted, he readily told you Mrs. Butler?</p>
               <p>Pain. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer to make any resistance?</p>
               <p>Pain. No; when I told him I would take him where Mrs. Butler was, he said then, any time would do, and appeared loth to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what business he had with Mrs. Butler?</p>

            . I am the king's assay-master at the mint; I received six counterfeit shillings from Pain; the value upon an assay was about 4 1/2 d. a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these ( shewing him the good shillings.)</p>
               <p>Lucas. They appear to be good shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. to Thompson. Did you make any observations upon the good shillings as to any use they might have been applied to?</p>
               <p>Thompson. I imagined they might have been used as patterns from the yellow colour of them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Lucas. Would their having been applied in that sand account for their yellowness?</p>
               <p>Lucas. It might be contracted from thence with that sand, I think it is very probable and it may be by time.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of the aquasortis and quicksilver?</p>
               <p>Lucas. He may make use of the quicksilver<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090033"/> to make it appear as good silver; this metal could not have a white appearance, there is a great portion of copper in it, it will be of a yellow cast; it is necessary to use quicksilver to give it a white cast.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe aquafortis is necessary to dissolve the quicksilver?</p>
               <p>Lucas. Yes; but I believe they generally use it in a powder; about half of them is silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they would be of more value than 4 1/2 d?</p>
               <p>Lucas. No, they are not the weight of a shilling; I take this bit to be the cutting off of some of the castings.</p>

            . I was with Mrs. Butler in August last as a chair woman; I have known the prisoner about two months; the prisoner had the two pair of stairs room and a garret at Mrs. Butler's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the garret the whole of the two months you was there, or part of the time?</p>
               <p>Topham. About five weeks I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he it about the time he was apprehended?</p>
               <p>Topham. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who used to keep the key of it?</p>
               <p>Topham. Himself I believe; I never saw the key; sometimes he used to come about eight, sometimes later.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay at a time?</p>
               <p>Topham. From eight in the morning till about four or five in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never an opportunity of going into the room yourself?</p>
               <p>Topham. No; the prisoner used to call Mrs. Butler, and Mrs. Butler used to send me for some beer; he came out of his room and gave me the money upon the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How often was that?</p>
               <p>Topham. Several times; I used to carry the beer, and leave it upon a little landing place, and give a knock; Mrs. Butler bid me knock at the door, not to offer to go in; I used to leave the beer and the change at the landing place, and he never opened the door till I was got into Mrs. Butler's room.</p>
               <p>Jury. What money did he give you?</p>
               <p>Topham. A shilling, or sixpence sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it ever refused?</p>
               <p>Topham. No; I suppose they were good.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make that observation of his not opening the door till you was in Mrs. Butler's room more than once?</p>
               <p>Topham. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did he go by then?</p>
               <p>Topham. By the name of Gill; Mrs. Butler told me his name was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come to ask for him during the time you was there?</p>
               <p>Topham. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How often might you be sent for beer in a week?</p>
               <p>Topham. Five or six times almost every day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you knocked at the door, having brought up the beer, how long was it before he opened the door?</p>
               <p>Topham. Never till I got down stairs; that was always the case; I never saw the man out of the room.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any directions from him to leave the beer upon the stairs had you?</p>
               <p>Topham. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else with him?</p>
               <p>Topham. I believe he was alone; I never heard any voices.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other lodgers in the house?</p>
               <p>Topham. No; there were two men used to come to him, that were supposed to be his sons.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you otherwise just now?</p>
               <p>Topham. They never asked for him.</p>
               <p>Q. He never gave you directions not to open his door himself?</p>
               <p>Topham. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You was there about five weeks.</p>
               <p>Topham. Yes, I believe so; it may be rather less than more.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived in the house before?</p>
               <p>Topham. Mrs. Butler herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether his door used to be locked when he went away.</p>
               <p>Topham. I do not know; I have swept the stairs; it appeared to me to be locked; it was always close shut; I never tried.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never had any connexions with Mrs. Butler in my life, nor did I take the room of her; I never received, nor paid, nor dealt with her in the whole course of my life. She told me some time ago, that she would give me something to wear in my pocket to stop me of the rheumatism; I am troubled with it; I was there the week before, she said she had not got it ready, and bid me call some other time; so I called that morning, and Mr. Pain being at the door, took me up.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner at the bar about eighteen years; he lived in Birmingham the greatest part of his life time; his wife died about eighteen years ago, and left him a large family; he worked in one house of great repute till about six months ago; I was informed his reason of coming to London was, a son of his went for a soldier, and was returned, that he got into some way of business that enabled him to support his father, and therefore induced this poor old man to come from Birmingham. His character in Birmingham is very good; I believe there is not a person ever knew him guilty of a dishonest thing; he was intrusted by gentlemen I am concerned for, for many years, with all their stock in great manufactures; he always behaved well.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago did he live at Birmingham?</p>
               <p>Jefferies. I have not been informed of his being in London more than three months.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately did you know him in Birmingham?</p>

               <p>Q. Then for nine months last past you knew nothing of him?</p>
               <p>Jefferies. No; I have seen him but once since.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his business?</p>
               <p>Jefferies. He is in the gun-smith way, and blueing and blacking barrels, and such things.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a cleaver artificer; ingenious?</p>
               <p>Jefferies. He was not an artificer.</p>
               <p>Q. The Birmingham men are very good artists?</p>
               <p>Jefferies. Them that are apprentices to the trade.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a very ingenious man I suppose in the trade he was employed in?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether that account has been settled between Sir Robert and Mr Alexander?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alexander. This is my cash-book, in which the account is kept between the banker and me ( producing it); I generally send it to be settled about once in two months.</p>
               <p>Q. to Murphey. How long was it after the payment, before Mr. Alexander left his book to be settled?</p>
               <p>Murphey. I believe he left his book about the 25th of July, it might lie two or three days before delivered back again; it was returned back on the 27th of July.</p>
               <p>Q Had you at that time charged Mr. Alexander with this 300 l. as paid for his use?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Yes; when we settled the book, we delivered up the vouchers in the pocket of the book; this draught was with the others; on the 27th of July, an hour or two after Mr. Alexander had received his book, he brought it back; he did not recollect that he had drawn such a draught, upon inspection it appeared to be a forgery. (The draught read.) We distinguished a cross upon the name, Alexander, had been erased, we perceived that the 1 of 1771, had been altered to a 2, to make it 1772.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember ever after this seeing the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Yes; he came to our shop with Mr. Alexander's son; on the 29th of July, in the evening, between four and five o'clock; I sent over to the Bank to know if Mr. Larchen, the cashier, was there, in order that he might see him, I had been informed that one of the banknotes of 30 l. had been paid at the Bank on the 27th; Mr. Larchen was not at the Bank, an appointment was made for this prisoner to come next day at twelve o'clock; he promised to come, but did not; about a week after we heard he was going down to Gloucester by Mr. Alexander's son; we had notice, on the 10th of August, of the other 30 l. note, having been paid at the Bank; we were informed that he had negotiated this bill at Gloucester; I went down on the 10th of August at night to Gloucester, and we took the prisoner into custody on the 13th; he was taken in the house of Mr. Chamberlayne, at Colthorpe, within four miles<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090037"/> of Gloucester, the constable called me in as soon as he was taken. I asked him if he knew Mr. Alexander; he stammered or hesitated a good deal, and said he did not; I repeated the name several times; I then said you certainly must know Mr. Alexander, you have been a clerk there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him the occasion for which he was taken up by the officer before that?</p>
               <p>Murphey. No; he then said he had been clerk, and knew Mr. Alexander; I then asked him if he recollected having any bank-notes in his custody lately; he said he did not; I then asked him if he recollected his having changed one with Mr. Everett of Gloucester; he made no reply.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he appear when you asked him that question?</p>
               <p>Murphey. He turned aside and made no reply; I said, you promised to come to Sir

               <p>Q. Upon this discovery, and after Rogers was taken in custody, what has been done since? where did the loss fall?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Upon Sir Robert, and Co. we have replaced the money to Mr. Alexander, and Sir Robert and Co. have charged themselves with the loss; the entry is in our cash book, that is the same book wherein he had been made debtor. (reads)</p>
               <p>"J. Alexander, his draught paid a second time, 300 l. that is, creditor; in Mr. Alexander's book, it is passed to his credit, his draught paid a second time, and placed to his credit." It was placed to his credit the 19th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there been a balance struck since that?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Yes; the book was balanced, and his account settled; he is totally discharged from that payment; the book is looked upon as a receipt.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said, Mr. Alexander has kept cash since the 16th of April 1771, at your house, has he not often draughts for payment?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever recollect to have seen the prisoner at your house?</p>
               <p>Murphey. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you cannot say that draught was paid to him of 300 l.?</p>
               <p>Murphey. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him when you went down to Gloucester who you was?</p>
               <p>Murphey. No; I believe he recollected me; I fancy so.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked him, do you know a Mr. Alexander, then not knowing who you was, do you think he might not have imagined it a Mr. Alexander in that part of the world?</p>
               <p>Murphey. I cannot tell; I thought it unnecessary to say Alexander of Grocer's Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he seemed to turn aside when you mentioned charging the note with Mr. Everett, might not that be by the common manner of turning himself?</p>
               <p>Murphey. He appeared to be a good deal confused and made no reply.</p>
               <p>Q. It did not seem a confusion arising from guilt?</p>
               <p>Murphey. I imagine it was from guilt.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. As you frequently paid several considerable sums for Mr. Alexander to me by the name of Rogers, how came you to pay it to me then as by the name of Berg?</p>
               <p>Murphey. I do not recollect to have seen him till the 27th.</p>

I took him into my service, January 1769; he continued with me to about the middle of July 1771; I gave him a guinea a week.</p>

               <p>Alexander. Here is a difference in the s in Westport; he seldom made a long s, which that is; he wrote an indifferent hand: the writing upon that bank-note, Geo. is like the handwriting of the prisoner, and the first part of the sirname, West.; I do believe it to be his handwriting.

            . As I was coming along Bevismarks,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090045"/> yesterday was a week, I saw the prisoner walking with a tankard under his arm; he asked a man to buy it; he asked a guinea and a half for it; the man said he would not buy it because he did not believe he came honestly by it; he went away, and I followed him; he shewed it to another man, and that man said if he came honestly by it he would give him 4 s. for it; I secured him and I gave the tankard to Marks.</p>
               <p>- Marks. Levi gave the prisoner in charge to me, and gave me this tankard; (produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I put my foot against the tankard as I was coming up some steps near the Fleet-market; it was under some straw.</p>

               <p>"without benefit of clergy." The court were of opinion that the act meant to present killing, maiming or wounding of cattle while in the field, &amp;c. in the possession of the owner, and therefore that the present case was not within that act.</p>

I went to bed before 12 o'clock; I fastened the doors myself: about four in the morning one of the neighbours called out in the street, that my house was robbed and broke open; a lodger in the house got up and called me; I found the house broke open, and missed in the bar all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) the bar window was broke open; the rail the shutters slide on was cut on the outside, and then the shutters fell down. I found the marks of three chissels which had been used to force the window, one large, another smaller, and the other smaller than that; there were two panes of glass in the window broke, and I suppose day light came on, or they would have taken all the things I had there.</p>

            . I use Covent-garden market. On the 1st of September I went to market about five in the morning; I saw Wood there; when I went home I found I had been robbed; the street door lock was picked, and the parlour door broke open. I lost a box out of the parlour with thirteen or fourteen pounds in it; I missed the plate out of my bed-room, and the rest of the things mentioned in the indictment. I suspected the prisoner. As I stood at the door the prisoner, Smith, came by; I charged him with robbing me; some of the neighbours came and searched him, but found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>Isabella Shields was called to prove that the prisoner, Wood, was seen about the house, about the time the fact was committed, but she only saw her go into the other prisoner's cellar.</p>

I and Stephens searched a cellar which she went into, and there we found a parcel of pick-lock keys, a fork, and some chocolate; one of these pick-lock keys opens Mrs. Wish's street door.</p>
               <p>Joh Trip. These buttons (producing a pair of gold buttons) were brought to me by the prisoner, Wood, along with Sims; first she said she found them; then that she had had them seven years. Sims desired me to let her have a shilling on them, as she was going to prison without a farthing; the buttons had the stones knocked out.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wish deposed to the buttons and chocolate.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Farrell deposed, that she gave the prosecutor this chocolate, and knows the mark upon it.</p>
               <p>- Kelly. I first apprehended Smith, and asked him where he lodged; he said he would show me, and carried me to this cellar: we searched there, but found nothing; I took him to Sir John's.</p>
               <p>- Stevens. I was present when the things were found in the cellar; the keys and chocolate were found.</p>

The prisoner came to me on the 2d of August, I live some considerable way from where the ship lies; he delivered to me twenty-four guineas, and seven pieces of foreign silver, a watch, a breast-buckle and a ring, and desired me to lay them up till he called for them.

             M'Nabb, one of Justice Sherwood's men, deposed that when the prisoner was taken up, he took them to the place; that they waited two hours, and Coombe not coming home, he broke the chest open, and took out the things, and put the money in his pocket without examining it; that he took the prisoner immediately to a public-house; that then he looked at the money and found there was but twenty guineas, and seven pieces of silver; that then the prosecutor had received ten guineas, and he produced the other ten in court, and the buckles and seven pieces of silver, (which were deposed to by the prosecutor.) +</p>
               <p>+ The court ordered M'Nabb to pay the prosecutor four guineas, which were so strangely melted.</p>
