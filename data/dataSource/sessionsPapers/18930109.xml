You cannot do anything with them"—as I was coming out I saw two policemen walking by, and I complained to them and they went into the house with me, and then I saw the two prisoners there—before I got to the lodging-house I saw them coming through a court towards it, facing me—one of them said something to the other; they passed me, and I watched them go into the lodging-house—I had never seen them before that night—the seizing and trying to rob me was all the work of a very short time—the night was a bit hazy, not foggy.</p>

I am the wife of Elijah Hewett, a confectioner, of 9, Maygood Street, Barnsbury—about half-past one a. m. on 20th December I was coming through Holloway Road home, as I had lost the train, and I was suddenly seized by four men and dragged into a passage—they put their hands over my mouth, and I was robbed of my purse, a silver snuff-box, brooch and earrings, and my jacket was torn and my hat thrown on the ground—the prisoner was one of them; he stripped my earrings from my ears—I was thrown down, and while I was on the ground the prisoner's face was over mine; I could see him perfectly well—I could not scream, as their hands were over my mouth—I struggled us violently as I could, and managed to get the hands from my mouth, and screamed, and the police came to my assistance—I was kicked very heavily in the side—I have not been able to work since—my lip was cut by their hands over my mouth—when I got up I followed one constable into a house and saw him dragging from under the bed a man who I believe is the prisoner.</p>

I am a telegraphist at 161, Highbury Hill—about 1. 30 on 20th December I was a few strides the other side of this court in the Holloway Road—I had seen the men there previously, but did not observe any of them particularly—I heard broken screams of "Murder!" by a woman, and I turned, and soon after the scream she seemed to break away from the passage, and a policeman came very cautiously alongside the shops, and, when he reached the passage ran after a man, and I ran too; and then Aiken came and asked me what I knew about it, and dealt me a very severe blow on the forehead, which gave me a black eye—I ran to the end of the passage and whistled for another policeman, as the one seemed badly handled by the man—a policeman came up and arrested the prisoner and Aiken.</p>

I am a constable—on 13th December I was in Victoria Street off duty and in plain clothes—I was just parting with Frederick Rule, who has gone to Madrid—the prisoners came up, and Bevington said, "Give me a light"—I said, "I have not got one"—he became very abusive, and tried to pick a quarrel with me—I said, "You had better go away; I do not want to have anything to do with you"—he said, "That is your game, is it; do you want to fight? I can fight," and took off his coat, and struck me on my chest with his fist—he was quite sober—I said, "Come along, Fred, we will get out of this"—they both followed us across Victoria Street, and Bevington got in front of me, and struck me again on my chest; I struck him with my stick—he closed with me, and I felt a tug at my watch-chain and missed it, and heard him say to Berry, "I have got his watch-chain; here you are, take it"—Berry held out his hand, but I did not see the chain pass—Berry hustled me—I caught hold of Bevington, but after a struggle he wrenched himself away—I followed him into Pear Street, calling "Stop thief"—a soldier stopped him, and I gave him in charge—he had no coat on—Berry ran away—my chain broke and my watch did not come out of my pocket—when Berry was stopped he said, "What do you stop me for? I know nothing about it."</p>

Can you fight now? Come out now, and have a go"—the deceased and the prisoner were not quarrelling; they were just having a few words—I have heard them quarrelling or disputing, but not on this occasion—they were disputing about something; there was something about a pot of beer; that was all I heard—I have seen the prisoner three or four times a week, perhaps; I never worked with him—I should say the deceased was rather a big man—I cannot say that he looked a very powerful chap; he had the appearance of being a man who could take care of himself; I cannot say he had the reputation of being a fighting man—it was on Christmas Eve I heard them talking about Boxing Day—I don't think they were on very good terms with one another—I have only been in the Camden Arms about once in my life—I was not there in November—I know Quill; I did not hear him tell the deceased one Sunday even<lb/>ing to stop quarrelling with Hos'er, or he would not play with him any more—I think I have seen the prisoner leave the deceased's company after having a few words to prevent a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—on 24th December the prisoner's thumb was candaged up; he was out of work in consequence of his thumb being disabled—I did not hear him say "I cannot fight; I have only one hand"—I don't know whether the prisoner or the deceased went out first; I was not paying particular attention—the deceased did not drag the prisoner out, nor catch his coat as they went out at the door; I did not notice that—the prisoner is a labourer—men of our class of life use knives of this kind for cutting our food; I have seen them frequently—I never heard that the deceased was a quarrelsome man, nor about his breaking the leg of a public-house landlord.</p>

Dave Bryan got me against the wall"—I looked at his face, but could see no marks on it—he had an old injury to one of the fingers of his left hand—he said nothing about it—I received the clothes and a knife from the inspector, and I handed them to Dr. Thorn at St. Mary's Hospital.</p>

               <p>"I am sober, and know what I am saying. I have known the deceased man by sight for about five years. I went to the Bedford to-night, and played two games of draughts, and paid for a pot of beer. The deceased came in and asked me if I was going to pay for the pot of beer, referring to an affair which took place some time ago. I replied, 'No!' He then said, 'Come out and fight it out.' He dragged me out of the house, and struck me. We fell together in the roadway. We got up again and struggled, and then several men got hold of me. One of them, David Bryan, asked, 'Have you got a knife?' I replied, 'Yes, in my pocket,' and I took it from my pocket and gave it to him. I had not used it, and know nothing of how it occurred. There has been an ill-feeling between us for some long time. I have tried to keep out of his way. When Bryan asked me for the knife, he said, 'You have been and stabbed a man;' I had been in Bryan's company previously, playing draughts. There was no one else present that owed the deceased man any ill-feeling, as far as I know. Last Monday night, when I was going home in Peel Street, he (the deceased) hit me in the back of the neck, and in trying to save myself I hurt my finger on the rails. My niece, Emma Wright, was with me. She lives in the same house as myself. I have met him once since. I believe it was Wednesday or Thursday night. He invited me into the Macaulay and called for a pot of beer, and at once said, 'I have no money' I told the landlady that I would pay for it, and I intended to have done so to-night"—when I had written it down I read it over to him, and he signed the original—I then charged him with killing and slaying the deceased by stabbing him in the neck with a knife—he made no reply—when the knife was brought to me I opened and looked at it, and saw on it what was apparently fresh blood—in consequence of the prisoner's mention of Emma Wright and a person from the Macaulay I took steps to have them at the Police-court.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was between half-past nine and ten that the deceased was brought to the hospital, nearer half-past nine than ten, after half-past nine—there was no external bleeding from wound when the deceased came to me—there were marks of blood round the wound; probably it had oozed from the wound—I should say that the hemorrhage had principally taken place through the mouth—I stopped the bleeding by pressing with my hand on the common carotid artery lower down—the man had lost a lot of blood—the external carotid artery was cut into,</p>

               <p>but not completely across—it is one of the most important arteries in the body—if it had been completely severed there would probably have been less bleeding, but almost certainly there would have been a fair amount—after some time the blood would have been congested and formed a stoppage—when the deceased came he was dying and almost pulseless—possibly if a doctor had been called immediately he could have successfully stopped the bleeding, in the same way as I did, when he came to the hospital, by pressure a little below the wound—the wound need not of itself have been fatal, if all the apparatus had been ready immediately to be applied—it probably would not have been fatal if it had been ligatured—I do not think a doctor could have tied the artery in the street very well; I do not think he could have done everything we can do at the hospital—I do not think the jolting of a cab would affect it much, because the cab would support his head; but it would probably increase the hemorrhage.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Wright's Road, Bow, and am the wife of Charles Palmer—I knew the deceased as Mrs. Nash; she lived with the prisoner as his wife in one room above mine; they used it as a bedroom—they got on very badly together, quarrelling a great deal—I had known them since August—I have seen her throw a kettle of water at him—she was a great drunkard—I believe she pledged things in the-house—the prisoner has come home and found the door locked, and had to go away again—they were constantly quarrelling—on 19th December, at three p. m., I saw her intoxicated; I did not see him—I did not see-her afterwards that day—between midnight and one o'clock on 20th December I and my husband were in bed: I heard the prisoner and the-deceased come in and go upstairs to their room—I heard her use very bad language, and raving at her husband—I did not hear his voice; I did not hear any scuffle or sound of violence, only a fall, and then I heard her moaning—I took no notice of it, because she was in; the habit of moaning and talking to herself when she was in liquor—two or throe minutes after the fall I heard the prisoner come down and go straight out at the street door—I fell off to sleep—I next heard knocking at the street door—my husband got up and went down and opened the door, and then I got up—I saw a policeman and Mr. Reyden come with the prisoner—they went upstairs, and I followed them into the prisoner's room—I saw the deceased lying on the bed—her clothes had a quantity of blood on them—there was a wound on the right side of her stomach and one on the left of the collar-bone—there was some water upset behind the door; that was the only sign of a scuffle I noticed—I asked her what had caused</p>

               <p>her to do such a thing, and she pointed to the prisoner and said he had done it—after that Dr. Roberts came—I saw a knife on the floor by the fireplace—I did not notice whether there was blood on it—I afterwards saw the constable take something, which I believe was the knife, from the mantelshelf—the prisoner was taken into custody—when I saw the knife on the floor it was rather close to the deceased, but she could not have put it where it was unless she was up at the time; she might have thrown it—the prisoner and the deceased had been drinking—next day she was taken to the hospital—I went with her—I had given the prisoner and the deceased notice to quit—the prisoner was very much upset—he was at the foot of the bed crying.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased was of very drunken habits—as far as I know, she was in the habit of getting drunk continually; I had not seen her for three or four months—when she was in drink she was very excited—I never heard that on previous occasions she tried to take her life—the prisoner seemed very confused when he came round to me—I asked her who did it—I don't think I was under the impression that she had done it herself—I don't think I should not have been surprised; I never knew her to hurt herself before—she said "George" when I Asked who did it; and the prisoner then said, "Say I done it. If you do I will leave you"—from the tone of his voice I knew he meant to say that he had not done it—this is an ordinary bootmaker's knife—she was not undressed in the usual way.</p>

She stabbed herself, I never touched her"—he was the worse for drink—a doctor was sent for—I saw the knife covered with wet blood on the mantelpiece after sending for the doctor, and before he came—I left it on the mantelpiece—about three-quarters of an hour afterwards I looked for it again, after the doctor had come—I then found it in a box with other knives wiped clean, barring a little blood on the end of the handle—all the knives in the box except one were clickers', knives—the doctor came and attended to the woman—I took the prisoner to the station and charged him—he said in answer, "I never touched her, I never done anything, that is truthfully.

               <p>me this knife in the room—the two wounds might have been inflicted by it—there need not have been a great degree of force if the wounds were inflicted with this knife, because of its pointedness and stiffness and edges—the wounds I saw might have been self-inflicted—their appearance was consistent with their being inflicted by a person holding this knife, or they might have been inflicted by some other person holding it—I advised the deceased's removal, and she was taken to the Sick Asylum, and passed out of my care—after hearing of her death I and Dr. Pearce made a post-mortem, and found the cause of death was peritonitis consequent upon the injury to the abdomen—I think the condition of drink she was in would not tend to produce the peritonitis we found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was present before the Coroner—the Jury there returned an open verdict, I believe, that there was not sufficient evidence.

                  </hi>. I am a furniture dealer, of 8, Worship Street—I give out work to outside workmen; they bring it back to be inspected by Mr. Harris, my foreman; he passes it, initials the invoice, and they take it to the cashier and sign for it—I employed the prisoner as an outside workman—this document, dated 16/12/92, for 10s., is receipted "Jas. Grant"—I can't say whether the prisoner presented it; it is for a double leg-rest—here is another, dated 24/12/92 for a mahogany leg-rest for 10s.—I paid that to the prisoner; it is in the same handwriting as the other—in consequence of something that came to my knowledge I spoke to Mr. Harris, and afterwards saw the prisoner—it is initialled A. H.—when I paid it I did not think they were Harris's genuine initials, B. but I paid it that I might have something to convict upon, as several, C. bills had been presented with false signatures—I paid the prisoner the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was cashier on the 16th and on the 24th—when Harris initials an order he does not put any date; he only puts his initials in pencil—I put this in as the order issued by the prisoner to me for payment—he has been in my employ five or six years—he has made five or six leg-rests within the last twelve months—when he made this one I did not give him a written order to bring it about three o'clock on Friday—he made it by order in writing—I do not think the order was returned to the firm when the leg-rest was brought in—I can't say whether it was handed back at the same time as the last order—Harris knew that the price was 10s.; the price varies, they have not all been 10s.—this was not the first 10s. leg-rest the prisoner made for us—we put these red letters here, I fancy, after we charged him—I did not put them, or order them to be put; they are Mr. Day's writing; they were not there when we paid the 10s.—Harris's signature is not genuine; these are two forgeries—the red letters are the date on which the bill was paid—Day is not here—here is one order for a leg-rest at 7s. 6d.—the prisoner has probably made four or five at 10s.—when I pay money it is entered in a book at the time—he would not sign the bill till the goods were delivered to him—he would not initial the invoice—it is the custom to exchange the work for the invoice—I keep a record of all sums I pay out to the workmen, and of all goods that come in—if I find four orders to pay for leg-rests, and only three have been delivered, I should see that there was one rest short, or one order too many; the thing could not pass unobserved; the order would show to whom I had paid too much—I was at the cashier's desk the greater part of the day on the 16th; I was there ail the morning, and I should say I was there at half-past three; but I can't say for certain—I will not swear I was there as late as four—I swear that I paid the money on the 16th.</p>

               <p>prosecutor and then prepared this agreement of 7th November—I sent it to the prisoner, at Brentford, on the 6th, making an appointment to complete—he saw me on the 7th—on the 9th the prisoner brought back the document, signed as it is now by the four persons—I gave him this cheque for £150, in exchange for the document—in October I was informed the half-year's interest was paid, but none of the principal—the prisoner came to my office early on 15th November—he asked me to make new arrangements to pay £5 a month—I said, "The money must be paid, or a substantial part of it; otherwise I shall take immediate proceedings against all parties"—he said, "Well, you have get no security in those three signatures; I put them there myself"—I said, "I must immediately communicate with my clients," and suggested he should call in the afternoon—I telegraphed to Newins, who reached my office a little before the prisoner returned in the afternoon—when the prisoner come in the room I asked him to repeat what he had said in the morning, which he did—he said, "Henry Hope was dead"—I told him communications would be addressed to two of the signatories, Mark Horwill and Thomas Hope, and I must await their answers to see what to do—that was to test the truth of what lie said—I wrote to them, and received the answers annexed to the depositions.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I took the names the prisoner suggested on a piece of paper, drafted the agreement, and sent the fair copy by post a few days after the first interview—the prosecutor said he had known the family twenty years—I did not believe the prisoner when he said he put the names there; it might have been a mere trick to get off; I was very doubtful about it—I did not have the signatures witnessed because it is only a promissory note or bill of exchange.</p>

I am the prisoner's father—I live at South Grove House, Brentford—I am a commercial traveller—I received a letter from Mr. Earee, and replied to it—the signature "Mark Horwill" on this agreement is not mine—I have no recollection of authorising anyone to put it there; this occurred some time ago; I do not know when—I have read the document—it purports to make me liable for an advance of £1 50 to my son—I have not become surety, to my knowledge—this letter is my writing—I am fully aware of all that is in it—I still say I have no recollection of having authorised anyone to sign my name—I might have done so—I do not suggest anyone—if it was put there by my authority, I know I am liable for the payment of £150—I do not admit that responsibility, because I have no recollection of it—I do not remember whether I had seen it before it was produced at the Police-court; possibly it was left at my house, as far as I can gather—I do not know that 1 have seen it—I know it was left; I objected to sign it—I believe some application was made to my wife to sign it, and become security for the prisoner for £140—I have not the slightest idea when it was—I cannot commit myself to having done anything of the kind—I do not think I was applied to the second time—I have been applied to on several occasions to become surety—I do not speak to the amount—I have become surety for as large a sum before—I cannot say if I have forgotten having become surety for so large a sum before—I objected in the first instance; I do not remember doing it afterwards—I do not think I should become surety for £150—I say I have</p>

               <p>no recollection; that means the same thing, as I have forgotten becoming liable for £150—I received two letters from Mr. Earee; I do not recollect their dates.

I am a barge builder, living at Thames Wharf, which is approached from the public street by some wide gates which are always left open day and night, so that bargemen mooring at the jetty can get in and out—inside the gates on right and left are several stacks of timber, so that you walk down a kind of alley of timber—on the wharf premises there is a dwelling-house, on the ground floor of which there is an office on one side of the passage, and on the other a bedroom in which I have lived for fifteen years—a watchman, William Hart, is also about the premises at night—a little after eleven p. m. on 23rd December I went through the gates on the way to my house—the gates were open and the timber in its ordinary position—I went into the house and shut the door after me—I went into the office; the window there was secure, and the safe was secure; the key of it was in my pocket—the three desks in the office were safe and locked up—the poker stood in the office fireplace, alongside the stove—I leave just a glimmer of gas burning at night—I shut the office door, but do not lock it—after looking round I went into my bedroom and undressed—in one of my trousers pockets I had £5 in gold, six shillings in silver, and fourpence-halfpenny in copper; and in the other a bunch of keys and a bit of chalk and odds and ends—I had a purse—I placed my trousers on taking them off, on a chair at the head of the bed—I got into bed about twenty minutes or half-past eleven—about 2. 30 or 2. 45 a. m. I woke up; I lifted my head about three inches off the pillow, and saw a dark form standing in front of me delivering a blow—I lifted my bedclothes with my left hand and held up my right, and bobbed a bit, when the poker came down and hit me on the left side of my head, where the bandage now is; the clothes were between the poker and my hand and my head at the time—the blow fell on the clothes and my hand, and the end of it caught the back of my ear as I bobbed—I grabbed at the poker with my left hand and the clothes with my right, and fell back on the bed again—I then felt someone grasp at my throat with his left 'hand, and scratch it very much, and that brought me to; he squeezed my throat as hard as he possibly could; it was all black and blue next morning; a bit of skin was torn out by his nail—I then seemed to put out all my strength; I don't know much about it; it was pitch darkness—the man, put his knee on my stomach, but I lifted him from one side of the bed to the other—we rolled over together, and struggled on the floor for about half an hour—I had on an under-vest and a shirt—we struggled to the left side of the room, and turned over and over till we came round to the foot of the bed, when I put my arm over him somehow or other, and he got hold of me and bit the muscle of my left arm very hard—we both then fell towards the door, and by the glimmer of light that came through the two doors I saw that it was the prisoner—the door was open</p>

I have made a mistake; I did not intend to come here"—I said, "You villain!"—the prisoner also bit a piece off my breast and my thumb—the struggle wont on, and after a time I overcame him—I had him by the throat holding him down rather tight when the watchman (Hart) came down and stood at the door—he had heard me before, but he was frightened to come down before, so he told me; he was in the room over me by the fire—I said, "Come and lend me a hand; hold him"—he did so, and then I got the revolver which I keep in my room and fired some shots out of window to bring assistance—Hart and Kemp, two watermen, then came, and the prisoner was further secured—I held the pistol to the pri<lb/>soner the whole of the time, and told him if he attempted to move I should shoot him—when he moved once I fired a shot right by his ear to frighten him—he went down on his knees then and begged for mercy—I was very much exhausted at the time, and could hardly hold the pistol; I had to take two hands to hold it at all steady—I saw the prisoner take his hand from behind him, when he was between the window and door, held by Hart; and lay down my gold watch-chain and some money and a purse on the floor—when Hart came and he said, "It is all right now, you dress yourself and we will get the police, "I struck a match and got my trousers, and found everything was cleared out of my pockets—my keys were gone—after dressing myself I went into the office and saw the keys thrown about the place, over the desks and the floor—my desk was farced open, and two other desks had been tampered with but not opened—the key was in the safe, but it was not open—the left-hand window was open; the corner pane was broken near the latch, so that the latch could be reached through the hole—near it a little screen hanging on the window, about eleven inches wide, was pulled up—the police came—as I went to the station I noticed that the gate was fastened, I could not get out, it was barricaded with a piece of oak 4 ft. by 2 ft., and weighing about 3/4 cwt., laid across the bottom of the gate, so that I could not get out—it had been taken off the tier of flitches, and then a trussel, 7 ft. by 3 ft., was put. in strut fashion, under the bottom of the gate, and an old windlass, weighing about 3/4 cwt., put across it, to keep it from shifting—the gate could not be opened—the prisoner was charged at the station—I was attended to by the doctor—I was too bad to go to the Police-court that day, I could not get out of bed till about one that day—on 31st December I first went to the Policecourt—in the course of our struggle in the room the prisoner got me down once, and I said to him, "For God's sake, spare my life, take what you like, but let me live"—he said nothing, but squeezed at my throat all the more—this is the office poker; it is a long heavy one; it was made by our own blacksmith—I have known the prisoner five or six years, but have not seen him about lately—for five or six years he has worked at the wharf, on and off, as an extra hand—I should think it would be from six to ten months since he did anything for us, but I cannot say from memory—he has been in the office to receive his money, and has seen us take the money from the safe—his name was never on our books; he was a casual hand—I have no doubt that ho was perfectly sober—being Friday night, the wages were in the safe for next day;. there would be £70 for wages, and I daresay £120 altogether.</p>

I am the wife of Charles Earlswell, of 4, Burton Crescent—Mr. Broughton came to lodge at my house in October, 1891, bringing a little child, apparently not more than four years old—he said it was his own child—I did not notice the condition of the child very much when he first came; he used to clean and wash her himself—she was not very clean, but he had her cleaned a little before we saw her—she was not clothed so very badly at first—she remained at my house till May, but sometimes the prisoner took her away for a day or two, because he said the old lady wanted to see the child—when she returned after the day or two she was not so clean as when she went—when she wont away in May she was very clean, and had plenty of clothes; she was rather thin, but she was getting on nicely and improving—she came back six weeks afterwards, and was with us up to September—when she came back she was very bad with vermin; I had to have her hair all cut off by the barber, and I had to burn her clothes; she had only a few things on—she was thin—she remained till September, and then she was quite clean; there was nothing on her, and she had good clothes on when she went away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I am a journalist, of 26, Exmouth Street—I know the defendant; I also know Marc Friedlander—I remember his returning from Paris last August—on the Thursday before that I was in a public-house with Hens—Friedlander arrived on the Sunday, as far as I can remember—Hens and I had a running conversation on the Thursday—he made me acquainted with Friedlander's affairs, which I did not know—he said that Friedlander had several warrants out against him for theft from Baron D'Alkemade and several others, and he said, "As you know him well, you ought to advise him not to return from Paris, also to tell Victor Charles to be off"—as I did not enter into the conversation as he liked, he said, "Do you think of Friedlander as your friend? I have the proofs in my pocket that he is not your friend, and he has written to his wife to beware of you, as he suspects you"—I said, "I do not see any motive for it," and the conversation ended—After Friedlander's return from Paris and his appearance at Bow Street, I saw Hens again on 11th September, about nine p. m., coming out of a public-house, 49, Charlotte Street; that was about fifty yards from where he lives—he asked me if I had seen Marc a few days since—I said, "No"—he said, "You are very wrong to walk with us, because he is not your friend; the Baron is pretty rich to take you out of embarrassment," at that time I was a little short of money;" he will pull you through, as he has paid me and paid others; you must come and state before the Bow Street Magistrate that you heard Friedlander say he had paid £15 for the photograph business, Vallée"—I said, "I did not hear him say anything of the kind," and I asked him if he was serious in saying so—he said, "Never mind whether he said anything of the kind; we intend to crush him," or "ruin him"—I told him that the laws of this country never permitted perjury—he said that I was to say that I heard Friedlander make that statement at the New Inn, without saying the date—he said, "If you state that it will give more weight to my statement," and the conversation ended, because he saw I would not</p>

               <p>enter into his wishes—he spoke to me again the same day on the same subject, and two or three days afterwards he proposed to take me to a solicitor in Bow Street and make a statement, and I should be paid, and not be in need any more—that was on the 12th or 13th of September, the day before I wrote this, which is dated 14th—I took this letter to Bow Street, and handed it to Friedlander's solicitor before the case was called on—I remember receiving this mourning letter with a black border towards the end of September. (<hi rend="italic">This invited the witness to attend the funeral of his brother Claude, at Enghien Parish Church, Paris</hi>)—I fix the date of receiving that letter because I received it forty-eight hours from the time mentioned for the funeral, which was October 2nd—when I was at Bow Street 1 was not prepared for questions of that sort, and I said it was the day before the sitting of the Court—the name mentioned in this is the name of my brother, and he is alive; I had a letter from him this morning, with a postal order in it—I was a little moved when I first received that letter, but when I received this letter from the deceased the same day I went to a public-house that evening, knowing he was not dead, and showed the letter to the landlady—she read it, and Hens was sitting down two or three yards from the place, and I said, "You are the person that wrote that letter; you know what the contents are"—nothing had been said relative to it by me to the landlady—I never heard Friedlander say that he had bought Cauchefert's business for £15 or £18, or any price—he never spoke to me about it; Hens could see the black border on the letter, but not the contents.</p>

I live at 29, Alfred Place—in August last I was in partnership with Baron Gustavo de Roest D'Alkemade, as photographic enamellers, at Alfred Place—I was in Paris on business about August 16th or 17th, and received information from Victor Charles—I returned to England on Saturday, the 27th, and on the 29th I surrendered on a warrant and went to Bow Street, on a charge of obtaining £150 from D'Alkemade on the pretence that I had bought Cauchefert's business for £150, whereas I had only bought it for £15—on the 29th I had been in. communication with Mr. Dear—I was aware that Hens had been in Brussels, and brought Cauchefert back and had assisted in removing the partnership property—on 29th August I saw Hens; he said he wanted to have a private interview with me, and asked for an appointment for an explanation—I said, "Don't begin it if Charles does not; we will meet at the New Inn public-house at nine o'clock"—after that I saw Charles and Pellat—Pellat gave me some advice—I went to the New Inn next morning—I saw Pellat in Tottenham Court Road; he had a lad with him named Louis Le Boy—Hens came about 9. 30, and I went into the bar with him and Victor Cauchefert—no one else was present—I asked him what was the explanation he wanted to give me; he said he had none, he wanted me to give him one, and asked why he had served Charles in the way he had—I said if he had done so it was on his own responsibility—Charles and Hens had a" quarrel—Hens had a claim on me for a small sum; I think it was £2, but I had a claim against him—I told him I would not give him any more money—I never said that I had bought Albert Cauchefert's business for £15; Cauchefert's business was never mentioned—the conversation could be heard by Charles and by Le Boy—I never heard from the pro<lb/>secutor what evidence Hens was going to give till he was called into the box—on October 6th the case was commenced before the Magistrate, and afterwards I was brought here by indictment, and was acquitted, and an order for the payment of my costs was made upon Garston—I have a Chancery action pending, and my means of livelihood are altogether gone.</p>

I live at 74, Hanbury Street, Spitalfields—I am Mr. Freedman's housekeeper—Joseph Kopelewitz was in his employ—I have seen his wife call at the business premises in Hanbury Street—Joseph left that employment—I cannot remember the month—he afterwards called, when I gave him a suit of clothes—on Monday, 14th November, Mrs. Kopelewitz called—she said she wanted to see Mr. Freedman—I said he was not at home—she left, but came back at five p. m.—she went in the parlour and sat in front of a little desk—I left her alone a' short time, and on returning I saw her at the desk—she had the lid in her hand, and was just closing it—I said, "What are you looking for?"—she replied, "Oh, I only should like to see Mr. Freedman's handwriting"—I told her to leave—she said her husband had returned, and "He has got money to pay Mr. Freedman his debt," and if Mr. Freedman would not go her husband would lose his money in card-playing—she called again about 8. 30 next morning—she said, "I should like to see Mr. Freedman"—I said, "He is still asleep"—she came back between six or seven p. m., and saw Mr. Freedman—he went away with her—I heard her say, "My husband will pay you"—Mr. Freedman answered, "I shall send somebody"—she said, "No, come at once with me, and you will get the money"—Mr. Freedman left Hanbury Street about seven o'clock—I next saw him a little before twelve at night—there was a knock at the door; I went downstairs, and there was a cab standing outside—I paid the cabman—when Mr. Freedman got in the house he was very bad—he went to bed immediately—I remained with him during the night—he was ill the whole night—he drank about a bottleful of water—he vomited—I went for Barnett Aaron about 6. 30 a. m.—he used to be his manager—I went with Mr. Freedman and saw Dr. Phillips about eight a. m.</p>

Will you sign this paper immediately, or else I will tell everybody that you have slept with my wife?"—he pulled me off the bed, and I halloaed for the police as well as I could—I walked to the door as best I could, I could not run, I felt so bad I could not stand—I could not halloa much, my throat was too sore—the male prisoner ran quick and locked the door, put the key in his pocket, pushed me back, and I fell to the ground on my back—I got up and tried to get to the window to break it and call for help—he pushed me back, and I fell to the ground a second time on my back—I saw Mrs. Kopelewitz lying on the other side of the bed when I got up the first time—she was dressed, and I think she had her hat on—the husband picked me up after I was down the second time and pulled me to the table—I saw an inkstand—I was still very bad—he said,</p>

I have examined this debt document very carefully, and find at the end of the second line the word "hundred" is squeezed in, and is on a different slope to the other writing—there is no writing before it—it is not "a" hundred, only "hundred"—the word is not completed, and the "and 50" is written in the margin—the "0" after the "5," making 150, is better written than the figures "1"—the £ for pounds and "150" in figures are enclosed in brackets; the first bracket comes through the loop of the "£"—I measured from the figure "5" to the "p" in pounds following, and I find the same space would have been there if the "0" had not been there—it strikes me that the "0" has been put there afterwards—there is no alteration in the body of the document—it originally was, "I promise to pay Mr. Joseph Kopelewitz, of 16, Netherwood Road, the sum of £15," and that has been altered to £150—"Signed" is in the same writing as the body, but the signatures are not—the document has been folded before it was dry, and I find each side partly recopied on the other—the signatures are not re-produced, which leads me to the conclusion that the signatures were put there at a different time, otherwise. they would have blotted as well, you see the "J" reversed—on page 2 of the book, February 26th, the entry appears to have been crushed in, at the very bottom of the page; the line dividing the pages cuts the last entry—on page 15, April 26th, the word "April" is in the margin in the proper place; there was something underneath which has been erased and "April" written over—the proof of erasure is seen by looking through the leaf, something has been scraped out—on page 16 at the top is 29; there is a long entry of May 1st, and several entries without dates; then comes one of May 10th which is very much squeezed, coming over to the following page where May 1st is continued—the final entry is on page 30—there are four entries of one line each; the first is in pencil, "l-10-92," the second, "3-10-'92," the third, "3-10-'92," and then comes "15-10-'92 £50"—that is written in German.</p>

I have examined a letter which Kopelewitz wrote from prison, and from two signatures I feel certain that the letter was written by him—his writing is rough and irregular and untidy; it is not uniform—there is crowding now and then—people writing, looking forward, often crowd at the beginning, and then widen and fill out again—the word "hundred" on one side of the fifty necessitated the "0" after the "15"—I believe this bracket was added after the "£" was done—I draw that conclusion from the aspect of the "0," which is written more carefully than the "15," which is angular and jagged—I say the same as to the brackets—I think the whole 150 was written by Kopelewitz, but at different times—I agree that people's writing varies considerably at different times, only in the word</p>

               <p>"hundred" you have got a long word to get in, and it is on a different slope, but you must bear this in mind in "the sum of £15" there is no necessity for brackets, but they' are there, and cover the "£," showing that it was done afterwards—I mean that putting a bracket would not be usual where there had. been a prior writing of the amount—there was "£15," and no bracket at all—I do not point out any trace of the prior writing; there is no erasure there, the figures stand alone—I say that this "A. I. Freedman" is not Freedman's signature, it is much freer, and much larger and bolder—the signatures which are admittedly his differ from the others—evidently he was excited; the signatures are very shaky; his hand trembled—I have been in Court all the time—he would not write like this unless he was under strong excitement; the "F" in this signature is concave, the others are either straight down or slightly convex—from these two cheques of July 27th and September 19th, 1892, not written under excitement, I say that the signature is decidedly not in Freedman's writing—the difference between these nervous signatures and the cheque signatures is greater than the difference between the signatures of the cheques and document C, but I believe it is imitated from some signature of Freedman's; it is de-liberately written—the "a" and "c" are totally different from those letters on the cheques—some forgeries are so good that the man himself cannot tell which is his writing—I say mat this is a copy made from his signature, but not traced—in this class of forgery it is not contrary to experience to find that it is written firmly and boldly; I find it both ways—it is an indifferent imitation of Mr. Freedman's writing—I saw it before there was this blot; the blot does not alter my opinion—it is the "F" in "Freedman" that I speak of; the hand has gone round to make the cross to the "A," which is totally different to the cheques; the "A. I." on the cheques are a mono-gram, two letters joined together; and in document C they are totally distinct letters—putting aside the monogram, there is a freeness about the cheques which I do not find in Mr. Freedman's common writing—as to the doubling, I do not think the signatures were blotted and dried first, and if they dried from other reasons than blotting, why should not the upper part dry?—if it was blotted wet, it would take the ink away; you can always tell—the ink of the signatures has a purple colour, which is not in the body of the writing—if the colour is different, the ink must be different—this is not sympathetic ink—there are inks which get darker when they are dry, but this is a perfect colour slowly done, therefore more ink would come out of the pen—there is not ink adver-tised as writing a purple colour and turning black; there is blue-black ink—if you blot any writing it will take away some of the depth of colour; it would not make black ink purple, but it would make it a lighter colour—I do not agree with you that this might all have been written with the same ink—I believe I heard Freedman swear at the Police-court that his hand was guided when he signed something; this is not a hand-guided signature—on page 2 of the day-book the word is squeezed in at the bottom of the page, and the line is in different ink to the one above—I conclude that it is crowded in—the last entry is darker than the previous entry written at a later time—on page 15 there is ample room at the bottom of the page, only there has been an</p>

About 5. 45 p. m. on 31st December I was in Wood Grange Road, Forest Gate, in company with Cam and Macdonald, in plain clothes—I saw Capper and Tree loitering in the road for about half an hour—they went into the Princess Alice public-house and stayed there about twenty minutes, when they joined Johnson—the three came out, walked down Romford Road and stopped opposite Mr. Barnes's shop, 305, Romford Road, when Capper tugged at some aprons which hung just against the window—a uniform officer came down Spruceton Road and stood at the corner—Johnson then spoke to the female prisoners, and they all walked away together for about fifty yards and stood in the dark—this was about 6. 30 or 7—the officer went away and the prisoners came back and stood opposite Mr. Barnes's shop—I went into a garden, Johnson walked across the road; I came out of the garden and got into a goods delivery cart; Johnson spoke to the females; I got out of the cart and went back into the garden, when Tree took this linen and placed it on the pavement and then under her petticoats, and walked away with it for about ten yards—Johnson stood by—I ran across the road and caught Capper, and Tree by putting my arms round her neck—the flannel fell to the ground and I told Tree the charge—neither replied to the charge—Pearce, Cam, and Macdonald came to my assistance—Johnson ran away—Capper and Tree were taken to the station—they made no reply to the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Venue Street, Bromley—on Saturday last I met Vincent in the East India Dock Road, after twelve at night—I went with her to 11, Gerrard Street—I was sober—I saw Truslow there, after I got in the house—I went with Vincent upstairs into a bedroom—I gave her six shillings—I was going to stop the night with her—she said, "You get into bed, I will be back in a minute"—she went out and did not return—in about twenty minutes Truslow came and asked me what I was doing in her bed—I said I was waiting for a young lady—she said, "There is no young lady here, you had better get up and clear out of it"—I said, "I find I have got in a wrong house, a wrong place"—she said, "You are not going out of this house till you have paid half-a-crown for my bed; I cannot let my bed for nothing"—I said, "I have not half-a-crown"—she said, "Then I shall take your overcoat"—I said, "You will not take any of my clothes"—she said. "I'll soon have you bundled out of that"—I saw three men there—I walked quietly out and went to the Police-station—she would not give me my coat, and I left it—I saw the men when I first went into the sitting-room—I made a statement to the sergeant at the station—I returned with a constable—the constable knocked, and Truslow opened the door—he told her she had got my coat—Truslow said she had never seen me, and I was a wicked man—the constable pushed his way into the. house and said, "I have come here to search this house"—one of the men there said, "When he first came here he wanted to quarrel—the policeman said, "Then you have seen him before; you must know him"—Truslow said, "Oh, now he is in the light, I can recognise him, but he had no over-coat on when he came to this house"—the policeman said, "Put your shawl on and come with me," and I went with them to the station—I charged Mrs. Truslow with stealing my coat containing a diamond pin and silver watch and chain, that I put inside my coat previous to going into the house—she said she knew nothing about them—in the morning I was called up by the police to go and identify my coat—I went to 44, Railway Street with the policeman—he said he had come about the coat; had they a coat there?—Vincent said, "I have sent to the Police-station, but I know nothing about the watch"—I said, "That was not asked for; it is the coat we have come after"—Railway Street is about seven minutes' walk from Gerrard Street—I then charged Vincent with complicity with Truslow—she admitted she had had the coat—she had not then been charged with stealing the watch—she said I gave her the overcoat and 2s.—she was taken to the station.</p>

I live at 11, Gerrard Street—Truslow is the landlady—I remember about 1. 30 seeing the prosecutor's back as he went out—I was in bed when I heard him distinctly say he had 2s.—I sleep in the back room upstairs; there are two rooms on the floor—there is only a wooden partition and the stairs between; you can hear every-thing that is said in either room—I know Vincent's voice; I heard her and her gentleman in the room—the gentleman said he would pay her 28., and leave his coat till Sunday evening, when he would pay the remainder—I cannot say whether with the 2s. he would give her 6s., or whether it was to be 6s. altogether—they remained talking about ten minutes, then I heard the gentleman say he had been robbed—I did not hear anybody go down or come up, because it does not suit me to listen to other people's business—I did not hear Truslow talking in the room—he said, "I have been robbed of my coat"—I have a furnished room there—I am married; my husband lives with me when he comes home—about an hour after I went to the Police-station—I heard the charge against Truslow—the prosecutor said he had left his coat, and if I brought it back he would withdraw the charge—I went with the policeman to see whether Truslow was charged—I asked the inspector, and he told me she was charged with theft of the overcoat—the conversation with the prosecutor at the Police-station was on the top of the steps—I swear that—I went and found Vincent because the man said, "If you will bring back my overcoat I will withdraw the charge against the</p>

Do you know where the overcoat is?"—she said it was given to Brachley—afterwards the sergeant said, "What about the watch and pin?"—she answered she had never seen any watch and pin—that is all I remember—I was not at 11, Gerrard Street that night—I have been there—I know Vincent has been there; I suppose with men—she told me she had been once—I was not examined before the Magistrate—I was in Court when the prosecutor, gave his evidence—I heard him say she mentioned about the watch first, and I knew it was wrong; it was the sergeant—I knew she had an overcoat, but she had no watch—she did not know about it—it struck me as an awkward thing—I did not give my evidence because I was not asked—I was in Court the whole time—I suppose she was asked if she had witnesses—I believe so—I did not say I could give evidence, because I did not know the rules of the Court, and what I was to do and what not—I learned the rules of' this Court when I heard the officer in charge of the case say I could see the prisoner, and that is the reason I came—I have not heard that the sergeant denies it.

What shall I do?"—then he said, "Tell Mrs. Burden"—he knocked at my door, and said, "Oh! she is dead.

Well, I came over here with the intention of giving myself up to someone I knew. I gave her all the money I had last night. She returned drunk without any food. We had a few words, and then she threw the poker at me. I. took up the poker and threw it back. She has been drunk for the last three years on and off. I slept downstairs last night. I sent the boy up to call her this morning; he came down and said, 'Mother is so strange, father. ' I went up and kissed her; I found she was very cold, and I left with the boy"—after that he said, "If I had not been stopped I intended to go to Mr. Hamper or Mr. Eldridge and give myself up"—those are the names of two constables—I took him to the Police-station and gave him into the charge of Inspector Sewell.</p>

                  </hi>. lama surgeon, of 410, Brixton Road—on the morning of 4th December I was called to 8, Stockwell Cottages—in an upstairs room I saw the body of a woman kneeling by the bed—she was dressed in a short thick jacket and skirt, with a little scarf round her neck, but no boots or stockings—I examined her head and found a small wound at the back of it, and a good deal of blood; her hair was all soaked in blood, and her face was smeared with blood—two pillows were stained with blood—there was a good deal of blood on her scarf and collar, and on her jacket collar—later, at the post-mortem, when we took the jacket off, we found that a large quantity of blood had passed down between the jacket and the body from the wound at the back of the head—it was a contused, bruised wound, distinctly on the head—this iron bar might have caused it, or any heavy blunt instrument—the body was quite rigid; she must have been dead for four or five hours at the very least—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—I found a large effusion of blood underneath the scalp; it came from the wound at the back of the head—one pupil was contracted and the other dilated, which showed some injury to the brain—there was a good deal of hemorrhage from the wound—also found a bruise about three inches square under the right breast—I found corresponding with that bruise that internally part of the bowel and the pancreas were bruised—a blow from a heavy object, or a fall</p>

               <p>upon such an object as the corner of a table, or a kick, or any such cause as that would produce such an injury—it would require a severe blow to cause it—there were no other injuries about the body—the effect of the bruise and its internal injury would be to produce a con<lb/>siderable amount of shock—the cause of death in my opinion was syn<lb/>cope, or failure of the heart's action from loss of blood from the injury to the head—I should consider that the bruise would augment the effect of the hemorrhage, and would make the woman more likely to have syncope.</p>

I have heard the evidence in the case—her death was caused practically by loss of blood—when the blow occurred on the back of her head it cut a small artery, and it is evident that she had bled slowly for an hour or two—I think the injury was quite compatible with her going downstairs and out of the house after it occurred; for some time she was losing blood slowly, and it had not stopped, but had gone on for a couple of hours; she had gone to bed, and evidently wanting to pass a motion, she had got out of bed to do it, and passed it on her clothes, and died from syncope—I think the injury had caused her to bleed to death slowly—the whole body was blanched, and there was no blood in the heart at all—there was no food in the body, and I have no doubt that had helped it—it is quite possible' that she could have gone out and got more beer with such an injury a few hours afterwards—the wound was about three quarters of an inch long; it did not look a large wound; it was difficult to find, in fact—I think it is a fair construction to put on it to say that the woman would have gone into a drunken sleep and quietly bled to death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a varnish maker, of 54, Lyon's Buildings—about one o'clock a. m. on 28th December I was in Borough High Street—one of the prisoners, I could not say which, asked me for a light—I said I would give him one; it was either blown or went out, and I was asked to get into the shelter of a court to get him a second light—I had no sooner got there with the second light than I was hustled up into the court; I received a blow on the jaw; I could not say who hit me—I was knocked down, and four persons were over me, and I lost my watch and fifteen shillings I had with me, four half-crowns and small silver—I might have had a few coppers—I had had several glasses that night, but I was perfectly capable of looking after myself—I called out for the police, and the police appeared <hi rend="italic">to</hi> come as if by magic, and they arrested two of the men who were on top of me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 29, Lambeth Palace Road, and am de<lb/>puty registrar of deaths for Lambeth—in October Mrs. Phillips came and gave me this certificate, dated October 22nd, and signed "Robert Graham"—assuming that the cause of death was as there stated, <hi rend="italic">deli rum tremens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">syncope,</hi> I could not refuse a certificate, but in a case where the doctor had not seen her for a few days I should have gone and seen him—I would have accepted it if he had seen her the day before her death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not register many deaths from private houses in my neighbourhood—most of them are hospital cases, signed by the surgeon as a rule—the certificate is brought to me, and the only part I take is <hi rend="italic">to</hi> see the cause of death, the name of the practitioner, and his qualification—the date when he last saw the deceased is not entered in the register, nor that he was attending her in her last illness—I am bound to take a certificate from a medical man, even on an ordinary sheet of paper, provided it states the cause of death and the name of the practitioner—if he had been attending the deceased, but was not present at her death, I should accept the certificate—in a case of heart disease, a man may be ill and attended for years and die suddenly, then the certificate would be given.</p>

I live at 31, St. Gabriel Street, Newington Butts—in September, 1891, I went into the service of Mrs. Voules, 27, Lambeth Road—Matilda Clover lived there in two rooms—on 21st October, about two a. m., I heard her screaming—I went to her, and found her with her head fixed between the wall and the bed, screaming at intervals—she appeared in great pain while the fits lasted—when the fits were not on her she was quite conscious—Mrs. Voules came in and went for Dr. Graham twice—he did not come, but Mr. Coppin came—I gave her some of his medicine; but it turned her black, and I did not give her any more—she died about nine a. m. in my presence—Mrs. Voules was not present—no doctor "saw her but Mr. Coppin—I do not know if Dr. Graham ever visited her; but he came that afternoon, and was shown to the room where she was, and asked me questions—I told him that some pills had been given to her by a man, and that she had convulsions and turned black—I told him what sort of pains she had, and that I thought they were caused by the pills—after he had seen the body he and I and Mrs. Voules went downstairs, and I left him and Mrs. Voules together—Clover had been out and</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She had been a hard drinker, and never ate anything—Dr. Graham had attended her for a bad leg for some time previous to her death; I do not know how long—I do not know that he attended her for complaints arising from drink—I am almost sure I mentioned her taking pills to him—I think I must have told him about it—it might have been Mr. Coppin that I told—Dr. Graham was ten minutes examining the deceased.</p>

I live at 27, Lambeth Road—in October, 1891, I had a lodger named Matilda Clover—on the morning of October 21st I was called to her room; she was ill—I went by the name of Mrs. Phillips then—I went to Dr. Graham about four o'clock, and he was not in—I. went again about two hours later, and found him at home, but he had another engagement, and could not come, and at his suggestion I got Dr. McCarthy's assistant—I remember Coppin coming—I got this certificate and took it to Mr. Thernal, the Registrar, on the Wednesday—Clover was out as usual the day before, and she had been quite as usual for some days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She was a very. heavy brandy drinker, and ate very little—the day before her death she had taken almost a full bottle of brandy—Dr. Graham is the medical referee of a club of which I am a member, and I advised Clover to become a member in consequence of her health, which she did, but only for a few weeks—she used to go to the doctor—her ill-health was through drink—a fortnight before her death she went to Dr. Graham's surgery—she went there eight or nine times, nearly every day in fact—she told me that Dr. Graham said he might be able to pull her through if she gave up drink—when I went to Dr. Graham's surgery on the 9th, about four a. m., he told me he was in attendance at a confinement—I went again at five or six a. m. and he said, "I cannot attend to your case because I have to attend to a confinement," and he told me to go to Dr. McCarthy, not to Mr. Coppin—about mid-day Dr. Graham came to my house, and while he was in the room where the deceased was, I went up just as the doctor and Rose were coming out—during the time I was in the room I did not hear the girl Rose tell him about the suffering of the deceased—they came downstairs—I heard no conversation between them about the deceased having had any pills—there was no conversation of the kind downstairs.</p>
