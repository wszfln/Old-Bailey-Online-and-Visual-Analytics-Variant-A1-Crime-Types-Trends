            . I am a watchman in St. George Hanover-square Parish; last Friday morning, just as I called the hour four, I saw the prisoner go by drest in a linnen night gown; I thought there goes a butterfly, so I went out of my box, she had lost her way amongst some timber and met me. I asked her where she was going; she said she wanted to go to the turnpike to meet a waggon to carry her goods down to Edgar ; she had a box on her head, and an apron full besides. I suspected she had ran away from her service by seeing her tremble, so I said you shall go back along with me; she said, she lived with Mr. Mitchel in North Audley-street, I took her there, and in going along she made an attempt to run away, but I laid down the box, which I had taken from her, at a door, and ran and secured her. After I had secured her in the prisoner's kitchen, I went and fetch'd the box, which was lock'd, and they open'd it in my presence, in which and in her apron they found the goods mentioned by the prosecutor, which he said were his.</p>

            . I work under the last witness at the duke of Rutland's; on the 17th of Sept. about noon, I heard a turkey cry out in the prosecutor's grounds, I went to see, and heard some people whisper, I imagined it to be some of Mr. Shakespear's people, so I went to my work again; then I saw a man stand upon a mount in that field, I looked hard at him, and he seem'd in a surprize; then I saw Holt look up at me, but the other man gave him a signal not to come in sight yet. Then I went and call'd the other witness, and we pursued, there were three men of them, they all ran together, he that stood on the watch got away, I saw something hang from him like a turkey. The prosecutor lost two turkeys, but did not lay the other in the indictment. We took Holt in a ditch, and Evans surrendered. Holt had the two ducks and turkey about him.</p>

I went and enquired for her, they denied her, but as the young woman had told me she was then at home, I insisted on seeing her, and went up stairs and found her concealed amongst some curtains to a turn-up bed. I asked her why she hid herself, she said she heard my voice and was afraid of me. She desired to talk with me by myself, so I went with her into her own room, where she said she hoped I would be merciful unto her; I said I would as much as I could. Then she said the tankard was at a pawnbroker's in Cursiter-street. I took her before alderman Bethell at Guild-hall, who granted a search-warrant to search the pawnbroker's house. We went there, and she asked for the tankard she had pawned in the name of

               <p>Q. Don't you usually read the advertisements in the papers.</p>
               <p>Marsh. I generally do, but I don't remember seeing this advertisement.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lend her upon it?</p>
               <p>Marsh. I lent her four guineas and a half upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you remember the letters on the handle ?</p>
               <p>Marsh. I believe this is the tankard here produc'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the weight of it?</p>
               <p>Marsh. It weigh'd twenty-one ounces and odd penny weights.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This weighs twenty-one ounces fifteen penny weights.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Martingale. I knew the prisoner's father and her from a child; she was well brought up, but debauched by her father's apprentice, who is a very bad man, and I think necessity was the cause of her committing this action.</p>

            . I am a broker, the prisoner Bridges brought the saddle and bridle to me to sell, on the 17th of September; he agreed to take 3 s. 6 d. for them. I said, if he came honestly by them I would have them, but by the price I suspected him; I stopped them, and charged a constable with him, who carried him before an alderman, and he sent him to the compter. After this I was informed by the landlord at next door to me, that there was the prisoner's partner, so I went and there was the prisoner Bisset, with the other things here produced; he said they were what he used to wrap himself up in when he was in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoners both own'd the fact before my Lord-Mayor.</p>

I look after Mr. Davison's horse, and know these things here produced to be his property, all was fast at the stable over night, in the morning a casement was taken down, and an iron wrenched out that went across.

               <p>John McPhearson.

I believe he had many of his friends there, it was as much as the people could do to hold him. I got hold on him and received several blows; however we at last tied his hands, and then some gentlemen proposed searching him. I was one that searched his pockets, and saw, among many others, a handkerchief come out of his pocket, which I thought was my own, I felt and found mine gone, then I look'd at that handkerchief and found it was mine; it is a silk India handkerchief of the best sort.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it before?</p>
               <p>McPhearson. I had seen it the day before.</p>

            . On Monday last, about two o'clock, I was on 'Change, and seeing a mob, I ran towards the people. I heard the people say, take the fellow and duck him, so I laid hold on him, and received a blow from some by-stander that drew blood on both my hands; he was searched and ten or twelve handkerchiefs I believe were taken out of his pocket. The gentlemen got hold on them, one said this is mine, another this is mine, and took them and went their way. When they talk'd of ducking the prisoner, he desired they would save his life, for this was the first fact he had committed. This he spoke on the open 'Change.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you before he took it ?</p>
               <p>Coultis. No, he did not; he ran away, and I after him to a packthread ground, where he stopp'd and swore he'd not give it me, and that he'd knock me down if I offered to touch it, he had it on his head, and his own in his hand at the time, I saw him put it on his head. Then I went to my friend's house again, and told them I had lost my hat. The prisoner was taken up, and he own'd before the justice where he had sold it for 1 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he taken up on this account ?</p>
               <p>Coultis. No, he was not; he was taken up last Thursday night, for stealing some beef out of a shop that very night that he took the hat.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not endeavour to take him up in that time ?</p>
               <p>Coultis. I could not, he had made an information against me, so I was forc'd to keep out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know he had made an information against you?</p>
               <p>Coultis. Mr. Ward told me that he had against me and three more for, stealing this beef, and there was a warrant granted against us.</p>

He dropp'd the wig about twenty yards off, and took my hat to Privy-garden-gate; I followed him, and took him hold on the collar, and there was a Plaisterer's man coming along, and a watchman, so we took him, and carry'd him to Justice Lediard, he was not at home, we then took him to St. Martin's round-house, there he charged the watch with me, as well as I did with him. I sent for a Gentleman, who said he would be answerable for my appearance the next day. We went the next day before the Justice, there the Prisoner said, there was two gentlemen fighting, and he found the hat, and was coming to bring it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you say he had the better of you, did he attempt to pick your pocket ?</p>

               <p>Q. Was you in liquor?</p>
               <p>Howard. No, I was as sober as I am now.</p>

My brother then said to the prisoner, what do you want, do you want to rob us? the prisoner then said, d - n you, come a little further, and I'll tell you what I want, we had both sticks in our hands, my brother told him to go on before, or he would knock him down. He went on about 150 yards towards Charing-Cross, then he went up against the well, and as we went by he started out, and said, d - n my eyes and limbs, I'll do for you, then my brother struck him with his stick, and knock'd him down, he then got up, and threw my brother down, and put his knees upon his belly, my brother cried out; I struck him several times on the head with my stick, he then got up, and took my brother's hat and wig, he dropp'd the wig upon the ground, just as he ran away with the hat, he carried the hat as far as Privy-garden-wall, there he dropp'd it, and there we found it we came up, and took him by the collar, and called out to the watch, the watch came, we charged them with him, and he charged them with us; we carried him to the round-house, there he damn'd us for scoundrels, and said, we had robb'd him of 2 s and 2 d. or 2 s. and 4 d.

I was at work upon a scaffold on the 28th of August, there came word to me, by two chairmen, that there was a boy kill'd in the park, and that it was said it was my son. They had carried him to St. George's hospital at Hide park Corner, I went there, and found it to be my son; he was laid in bed in all his bloody things. I spoke to him, but he gave me no answer. I saw the blood running down his head, then the chairmen took me to the place where they took him from in the park, it was about fifty or sixty yards within <placeName id="t17531024-39-crimeloc177">Grosvenor-gate</placeName>

I enquir'd how he came by his hurt, but could not hear any thing of it. I went on the Wednesday to see him, and was told he had spoke, and had told several people that the park-keeper had beat him. I went to Mr. Fielding for a warrant to take up the prisoner on suspicion, but the justice would not grant a warrant, except I would bring the man that heard the child say so; then I went back to the infirmary, and the doctor that examin'd the child said, possibly the child may come to his senses, and might tell who hurt him, and that it would be better not to take him up till we saw whether he would live or die.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the child speak after this?</p>

            . My child received his hurt on Tuesday the 28th of August, and on the Thursday following I was standing by him some little time, I thought I found him partly sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Chavace. It was about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you judge him partly sensible?</p>
               <p>Chavace. By his knowing me and calling me mother. I asked him what ail'd him, but he made no answer. I asked him who beat him, he answered, Pray mother give me a little tea and I'll tell you. I gave him a little tea, and asked him again, he said, the park-keeper struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention his name?</p>
               <p>Chavace. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell at what gate he stood?</p>
               <p>Chavace. No, he did not. I asked him where he was hurt, he said on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe any place else?</p>
               <p>Chavace. No, he did not; then he repeated the same words again, saying, the park-keeper beat him, and pray mother do you take care of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his head was very much hurt?</p>
               <p>Chavace. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came by that wound on his head?</p>
               <p>Chavace. I did not, his senses were with him but a short while at a time; when he was sensible he'd cry for mercy in these words, Pray forgive me, that staff is too big; oftentimes he said so.</p>

               <p>Chavace. No, I did not, that was the only time that I counted him sensible for so long a time together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not judg'd insensible from the time he came into the hospital to his death.</p>
               <p>Chavace. At times he was sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you look upon the child to be sensible, at the time he said, Pray forgive me, that staff is too big.</p>
               <p>Chavace. I did imagine he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there ever a staff in the room?</p>
               <p>Chavace. No there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you done any thing to him?</p>
               <p>Chavace. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you affrighted him?</p>
               <p>Chavace. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you look upon him to be in his senses, when he asked you forgiveness?</p>
               <p>Chavace. He said, pray forgive me; he did not say mother.</p>

            . I liv'd in Upper Brook-street, and kept major Burton's house, a little after eight o'clock in the morning, on the 28th of August, a gentlewoman passed me, and told me she saw a man beating a boy; she was very uneasy, and went down Brook-Street, and I into the park, the minute I went into the park, I saw the boy lying on his face, I thought him to be dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout did he lie?</p>
               <p>Wells. He lay under the walnut-trees just by the park-keeper's house, I turn'd him on the right side and he groan'd; he seem'd not to lie easy, so I turn'd him on his face again. After that I turn'd him on his back again, and wip'd the blood and froth out of his mouth. I ask'd him who had beat him, but he could not speak. I look'd round the park and could not see any body. I saw the park-keeper's house door was shut, but the windows above and below are all open. I went to the house, and spoke to Mr. Turner, the master at the gate, and asked him where his servants were, and where the parkkeeper was, but he made no answer. I told him a boy lay dead in the park, but he made me no answer to it. I went down to my husband, and came back again, there the boy was then, and two women washing him with heartshorn and water, and a gentleman gave some people some money to carry the boy to the infirmary: I saw him no more till after he was dead.</p>

I was riding on my mare in the park at that very time, about a quarter past eight o'clock in the morning, a boy was in the walnut-tree, I saw the prisoner at the bar with a pole, which he held much about over his head; but as for striking him I did not see that: The boy said, Pray don't strike me, for God Almighty's sake don't strike me any more.

            . I am the master or keeper of Grosvenor's-Gate, the prisoner is my servant ; on Tuesday morning the 28th of August, about eight o'clock, I was sitting at work below stairs in a room that looks into the park, the window was open, there came a man to me and told me thro' the casement, that there was a boy killed in the park. I said, I can't help that; he asked me were Richard was, meaning the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that person?</p>
               <p>Turner. He was a servant belonging to Mr. Spinneys ; said I, Richard has been gone with his linnen to wash about twenty minutes; he usually carried it once a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How long does he commonly stay when he goes with his linnen ?</p>
               <p>Turner. He commonly stays two hours, his sister washes for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what time do you judge he went out ?</p>
               <p>Turner. I believe he went out about twenty minutes before eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does his sister live?</p>
               <p>Turner. She lives in Portland-street, beyond Chandois-square; the way there is from my house through Grosvenor's-gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go out?</p>
               <p>Turner. I did, with his bundle in his hand, and a cane.</p>
               <p>Q. What does he do with his staff at such times.</p>
               <p>Turner. He lays that down sometimes within, and sometimes without the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it his nearest way to go by the walnut-trees ?</p>
               <p>Turner. No, that would be almost the length of the park about.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he return that day.</p>
               <p>Turner. He returned about ten o'clock. The prisoner has been my servant about two years: when he came to me, he said, he very seldom worked with his chair on a Sunday (being a chairman) and desir'd I would give him leave to go to church as usual; I did; he has continued that practice ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he for natural temper ?</p>
               <p>Turner. He is the best behaved man I ever had, he is not swearer or drunkard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Catherine Wells talking to you that day.</p>
               <p>Turner. No, my lord, I do not; it has slipp'd my memory if she did.</p>

               <p>C. Wells. It is; he was pulling hair to pieces. I put my head in at the window, and said, sir. where are all the park-keepers gone, here is a boy lies murdered in the park ! he made me no answer to any thing I said ; in about twenty minutes after, I and a footman went to the window ( this was as I came back) and the footman spoke to Mr. Turner ; then his answer was, he knew nothing about it.</p>

            . I was at the Golden-lion door, which is opposite to Grosvenor's Gate, a little before eight o'clock. I saw the prisoner with a handkerchief, and something in it like linnen, in his hand, and a cane in the other; he went under the wall towards Tyburn: about half an hour after eight o'clock I went into the park, and saw the deceased lying on his back, between a post and a wallnut-tree; there was a man with two horses and a boy with one; the man called to me and desired I would help the boy up. I assisted him and undid his stock-buckle and collar; there were ten or twelve drops of blood, I can't say more or less, upon the ground; there was a cut on one side of his head were the blood came from: there were two pieces of bread and butter lay behind his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sensible ?</p>
               <p>Mills. No, he was not. When I came into the park was the first of my hearing of it.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is that from Grosvenor's Gate.</p>
               <p>Bunce. I believe it is about a mile; my brother's usual way is to bring his linnen once a week to be washed: he brought it that very 28th of Aug. when he came in it was turned of eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How much after eight?</p>
               <p>Turner. I believe it was not quite half an hour, or about twenty minutes past eight.</p>

               <p>Davis. I had never seen the prisoner then in my life. There were two gentlemen riding by, one on a black horse, the other on a gray one. one of them smack'd his whip; we conceived that assrighted the boy and made him fall down: he got up again and ran towards the gateway and fell down again.</p>

               <p>Davis. It was between eight and nine in the morning.</p>

It was dark, there is no lamp where I was robbed : the man prisoner immediately came back upon her crying out, and struck me several blows in the little: entry ; there was much light in Chick-lane, by which I could easily see the prisoners, and believe them to be the same: the man had a cape coat and a red waistcoat, I saw his face; the woman struck me several blows in Chick-lane with her hand, and also with the basket there: they were both on me together: I tried to push them both into the Black Raven alehouse that is opposite Black boy-alley; but the man pushed the woman in and shut me out; I was pushed back down the steps and fell down, I was never down before that: I told my name, and where I was going, and said, I had been robbed of 11 s. and some halfpence, and said, the people that robbed me were in at the Black Raven, and desired assistance, I got assistance, and we went into the house, they were there at our first going, but at last they were push'd out of the house and were taken before I got out of the house; I got hold on the woman, I took hold of one arm, and another man on the other, and we had her to a constable at the Butchers-arms, in Smithfield; after we had been there some time, a man bid me look about to see who I knew ; I saw the man prisoner, and said, he was the man that was in the robbery, and the people secured him : I charged the constable with them both,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175310240019"/> and they charged the constable with me and the man that assisted me in bringing the woman there.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination he did not vary in the least.</p>

            . I live in Peters-Lane, near Hicks's-hall, and am a shoe-maker, I had been about business up the water, and landed at Black-Fryars, on the 13th of October about seven in the evening, and walked up the market, when I came to the bottom of Field-lane, next to Chick-lane, I heard a crying out, so went up to it; but before I got there I heard a man say, I have been robbed, thieves I ran and saw the prosecutor had hold of a woman, either of her arm or skirt of her gown, I saw them scuffle cross the lane, the woman had a basket in her hand with which she struck the prosecutor. The man prisoner was there, and push'd the woman into the Black Raven alehouse, she turn'd about and with the basket struck the prosecutor, or whether she pushed him with the door, as he wanted to follow them in, so that he fell down at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a basket was it?</p>
               <p>Murray. It was made in the form of a boat, or oval, I help'd the man up, and asked him what was the matter; he said, he was robb'd of his money by that man and woman and another person. I said, if any body would assist we'd go in, and see if we could take them; so we went in and the prosecutor pointed to the woman, and said she was one of them; she and the man were both taken in the house, but the people in the house rescued them from us, and they were conveyed to a sort of a back door, where was a stair case, I went backwards and saw them both, and another woman with them, that door goes into an inn-yard. The people turn'd the prosecutor and two or three more out of the house, and was going to turn me out, but I said I would have a pint of beer, and insisted upon being there, and it was then that I went backwards and saw the prisoners. I ran to the street door, and told the people that the prisoners were not gone out; upon which they rush'd in again, and pull'd them out of this place, which was a sort of an entry into the tap room, but they were rescu'd from us a second time, and pushed out at the street door; they made an attempt to run down Black-Boy-Alley, but the woman was taken before she got into it, but by whom I know not. Then she call'd out, Charley ! Charley! then I went to get a constable, and she was taken to the Butcher's-Arms in Smithfield, but the man got off. The woman behaved at the Butcher's-Arms with very indecent language not to be mention'd, and in about an hour's time the man came in, I believe of his own accord. I sa w him, and said to Mr. Coombe, get up, look about. and see if there is not somebody here that you know, immediately he got up, and pointed to Mr. Attonbury's apprentice, who was sent for to him about business, said he, I know that young man. I saw the prisoner was screening himself behind the people, and pushing to get out at the door; as soon as Mr. Coombe saw him, he said, that is the man that was concerned in the robbery, I seized him and delivered him to the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross Examin'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that third person you saw with the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Murray. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q Did you hear this woman complain that the prosecutor had used her ill ?</p>
               <p>Murray. She said he wanted to be great with her.</p>

            . I am an iron back maker, on the 13th of this Instant about seven in the evening I was at my father-in-law's door, which is opposite the Crown in Chick-lane, I heard a disturbance in Black-Boy-Alley, and went to see what was the matter, where was Mr. Coombe. who stood against Mr. Doleman's door in Chick-lane at the corner of the alley, and somebody pushed him way from the door, and said, don't make a disturbance here ; then he went down to the next house, and the two prisoners at the bar followed him and collar'd him, and dragg'd him across the lane; the woman struck him several times with a basket over his head and face, and pull'd off his wig, the man held him all the time; then she threw his wig in his face, and said D - n a - n seize you, ye thief, take your wig again. I asked them the meaning why they used the man in that manner; she said he knock'd her sister down in the entry; then she said, Charley, go and fetch a constable, they were then got near the Black Raven door, and Charley endeavoured to get her away, but she would not be persuaded; then he push'd her into the Black Raven, and the prosecutor fell down at the door; he got up again, and said, gentlemen, I am used very ill, my name is Coombe, I am a carpenter, and live in Clerkenwell</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175310240021"/>Green, I have been stopt by a man and two women; the man struck me on the face, and the woman run a basket against my face, they held me fast and robbed me; this was in Black-boy-alley, and that he got hold of one of the women and dragged her into Chick-lane, and that a man and one of the women were now in the house; I, and others went in to secure them; we secured them; but they were twice rescued from us in the house. The rest as the last evidence, with this addition ; that when they were taken before the alderman, the woman said, the prosecutor took hold on her sister's arm and dragged her about, and said, come along you bitch and drink a pot of beer.</p>

            . I am a Wheelwright. on Saturday was sen'night at night, my partner and I had left off work, and were going to the Crown in Chick-Lane to make our bill in order for the receiving our money. We heard the cry of murder! murder ! I am robbed; I went up to the prosecutor, and said, are your actually robbed ? he said yes, of 11 s. and upwards, then I said, I'll assist you; then he, and I, and another man, went in at the Black Raven; the people of the house shoved us back again after we had got the people, and got them backwards by a staircase and a backdoor; I knowing the backdoor, when I was out of the house, went towards it to see if they were gone out or not; when I came there, the two women and man were shoved out at the foredoor ; I ran and laid hold on the woman, I took her by one hand, and Mr. Coombe by the other, and we carried her to the constable, at the Butchers Arms, in Smithfield : after we had got her there, she swore I had robb'd her, so I was detained; whilst we were there the man came in. The rest as Murray had deposed, with this addition, that after the woman was in the watch-house she denied what she had said about his robbing her, so he was let go.</p>
               <p>Cross Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear the woman say, she, or her sister, had been used ill by the prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Fennel. No, I did not hear her say any such word, that they had been either of them abused by any body.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cheene. I am constable; I and my brother constable had them in charge, I never heard the woman make any complaint of any indecency from Coombe.</p>
               <p>The other constable deposed the same.</p>
               <p>Mahagen's Defence.</p>
               <p>We came to London on the 4th of October, from Ireland : I got a room to lodge in at Mr. Reynold's, in Black-boy alley; I was recommended there by the people at the Raven: The prosecutor met me in the alley and knocked my wife down; I went up stairs; they called me down; my wife said, the man was gone ; I saw him running, I ran after him, and said, how came you to knock my wife down? he said, I will go before a justice, or any place; the woman recovered herself, came up and said to me, don't be concerned with him; some people said, why don't you take him into custody; I said, I am a stranger, nobody will assist me, so we let him go; then he went to the others, and they contrived this thing against us.</p>
               <p>The Woman's Defence.</p>
               <p>As I was coming with my sister I had a basket in my hand, the prosecutor knocked my sister down, and put his hands up my coats and down my bosom, and bid the whores come away with him, and said, if we would not, he would knock our brains out.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Gibbon Smith. I never saw the prisoners before this thing happened, which was on a Saturday night. I think this day fortnight, near seven o'clock ; I was coming from Cow Cross up Black-boy-alley with my wife, we heard a great noise and a woman calling Charley, Charley; when we got up to it, they were all out of the alley in Chick-lane; there was quarrelling and fighting, a woman beat a man with a basket, and I believe the men had blows; I can't recollect that the prisoners are either of the persons; there was another woman came to a door, and said, for God sake Charley come out, for there is somebody quarrelling with your wife; there was somebody came down stairs, but they were gone out of the alley before we came there.</p>

               <p>Q. HOW came you by that basket ?</p>
               <p>Smith. I pick'd it up after they let it fall, and deliver'd it to the Raven people.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Barton. I have known the prisoner about a week, they lodg'd in Cock-court, Black-Boy-Alley, I know the other woman, they all three lay together when they came to town.</p>
               <p>Q Is the other woman related to them?</p>
               <p>Barton. I don't know whether she is or not; on this day fortnight I was getting some water, I had just put my pail under the cock, I heard a great out-cry, which was two women and a man fighting.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>Barton. It was between seven and eight o'clock. The women call'd out, Charley! Charley! I look'd at them, and thought they were the people that lodg'd next door to me. I call'd the man, and I believe he made no more steps down stairs than one, for he had like to have tumbled over me; he asked me what was the matter, I said, if that is your wife here is a man beating her, she will kill her he stings her about so, I suppose he'll smother her; I believe he was stopped in Chick-lane, but I did not go to see.</p>

            . I have known the prisoners about a week; they lodged at my house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That evidence keeps a lodging house for such sort of people in Black-Boy-Alley.</p>
               <p>Reynolds. I did not see the beginning of the quarrel, if the robbery, as is pretended, was after the cry, Charley! Charley! I know it could not be ; for I saw the Alley clear. I was in my own house, and heard the prisoner's wife call Charley. I think three times, the prisoner was then in his own room, he came down to the assistance of his wife ; I saw the prosecutor run away, and the prisoner after him, calling out, Stop him, stop him. I heard the woman say, Charley, Charley, I have been ill used; I think she said she had been knock'd down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come down stairs ?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. No, but I heard him: I went to Chick-Lane with a candle in my hand, then they were fighting ; I said to Mr. Mahagen. why can't you charge him? charge him, he said, what is that ? I said, with a constable: the prosecutor never mentioned any thing of a robbery as.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you near him?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. I was as to this man, pointing a man within a yard of him, I returned home: them fighting ; and after that the prisoner came to me, and said, they have taken my away, what can I do?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175310240023"/>Prisoner. She is my wife's sister.</p>
               <p>Reynolds. As for Mr. Kelly, and the other man, they were never in the alley.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. I was there all the while; he charged the man with the robbery, I went to the Butchers-Arms with the man, where there was nothing talked off but hanging of him; they took him into custody: I staid there some time, and then went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they charge one another?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. I don't know for that; the prisoner and I had been at the Raven together that day, we went home, and he went up stairs; he had not been out of my house to my knowledge ?</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been out again in the time ?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. I had been up and down the alley several times.</p>

One day since this happened I stood at the end of Mutton-lane, and heard the prosecutor and another man talking together about this robbery, the other man asked him if he was sure this was the woman that robb'd him; he said, I don't know, I cannot be positive whether the woman in custody, or the b - h that is run away, robb'd me, but I was robb'd of 11 s.</p>

No. I went with him to Mr. Watson, there he pawn'd it; on the Friday night I saw the prisoner, I believe it was in Parker's-lane at a private house, I am not acquainted in that part of the town. I was going along, and Lattey passed by me himself ; he said, he was going to a publick-house, (pointing to one) and wanted me to drink. I went on to do my business, and then went there to him, where we had two tankards of beer; there was another person with him, which he said was a surgeon, whose name is Crosby ; he said, Hambleton is very bad and not likely to live, and that is his surgeon: I went along with them to see him, where he was lying in Parker's-lane; I spoke to him, but he made me little or no answer being very weak.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any discourse with him about that watch, or the robbery?</p>
               <p>Kennedy No, never.

               <p>John Leadbeater. On the 18th of August I was going in a post-chaise to my own house at Barnes, in Surry, I intended to go as far towards home, as the chaise would carry me on this side the water, and about eight o'clock in the evening, in the lane leading to the water side from the Bohemia Head, I saw a person come up to the chaise, there was one Mr. Dell in the chaise with me, and said to the post-boy turn your head the other way, or I will blow your brains out, the chaise then stopt; he then put a pistol into the chaise, and said, give me all you have, or I will blow your brains out, or words to that effect; I gave him five guineas, half a guinea, and six or seven shillings in silver, which I put into his hand; he then demanded Mr. Dell's money, and while he was taking that I was striving to save some little trifle, which the prisoner observing, said, d - n you, don't<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175310240025"/> trifle with me, for I will search you afterwards, and if you have any thing I'll blow your brains out. I then told him, I thought he had a pretty good booty, and might give us something back again; the prisoner then said, d - n you, I have dropped something, you may take that if you will, the post-boy then got down and found a shilling.</p>

            . I am the post-boy that drove the chaise when the gentlemen were robb'd, and am sure the prisoner is the man that did it; I had seen him many nights before, and once in a morning he rode round my chaise several times, but never stopt it before. I took particular notice of him the first night.</p>
               <p>Q. How light was it at the time the chaise was stopt ?</p>
               <p>Nicoll. A person might see to read very well at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man?</p>
               <p>Nicoll. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross Examin'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner at any other time?</p>
               <p>Nicoll. The first time I saw him was at Hide-Park Corner, about a week before this robbery was committed, he rode overagainst the chaise for twenty yards together, and seemed to take great notice, and when we came just by the half way house to Kensington, he turn'd round and look'd into it: When I came to Kensington he asked me whose chaise it was, I bid him go look.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the chaise at this time?</p>
               <p>Nicoll. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to rob them?</p>
               <p>Nicoll. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever in company with him?</p>
               <p>Nicoll. No, no further than seeing him at four different times before ride by my chaise.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, but call'd the following witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore. I live in the Strand, and have kept the house these nine years, I have known the prisoner near eight months, he work'd for one Mr. Brown, a printer, near St. Martin's-lane in the Strand; I was present when their boy came in on the 18th of August, about six in the evening, from the prisoner with his compliments and thanks to me for some tea and bread and butter my wife had sent him that afternoon ; he came home himself about nine o'clock, he lodged and boarded with me, and never was out of my sight, except when he was at work, and at sleeping time. I can give him the character of a very sober man, one that was never given to any extravagence, and one that always kept good hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him booted ?</p>
               <p>Moore. The most times I ever saw him booted was twice, and both times on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. to the post-boy. Did you ever see the prisoner about your chaise on a Sunday?</p>
               <p>Nicoll. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Moore. Did the prisoner keep a horse ?</p>
               <p>Moore. No, he never did.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. I have known the prisoner Thompson ever since the beginning of last April, he has lodged in our house ever since ; upon the 18th of August we had Mr. and Mrs. Kelly, and Mrs. Mercer drinking tea, the prisoner did not come home, so I sent him some; while we were drinking tea, Mr. Kelly said, when he had done, he would go to Westminster to look at a lodging, and that he would call at Mr. Brown's and take Mr. Thompson along with him. Mr. Kelly went, I desir'd him to make haste home to supper, and Mr. Thompson and Mr. Kelly came home together about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner booted?</p>
               <p>Moore. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What dress was he in?</p>
               <p>Moore. He had on a brown coat, a light waistcoat, black breeches and stockings.</p>
               <p>Q How came you to remember the day?</p>
               <p>Moore. We was to have gone up the river that day, but it happening to be a wet day we could not go, so we appointed the next day, which was Sunday, and we were obliged to get a warrant to authorize the waterman to carry us, and here is the warrant (producing one) dated the 19th.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time the prisoner lodged at your house, how often did you see him booted?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175310240026"/>Moore. Twice: he always behaved himself well, and during the time he boarded with us, he never was absent at supper time, unless we were all out together.</p>

I was very much startled, the moon shone very bright; I gave myself a little consideration what I had best to do, and now I might best attack him; I thought there might be some danger in coming out to breast him, for fear he should have arms, so I thought if he went to go away I would take hold on him: when the prisoner found I was awake he moved off, and got up two steps of the ladder, and was one foot upon the third, I then walk'd my man that lay in the next cabin, and told him there was a thief; and as the prisoner was just got within one step of being out of the cabbin, my man catch'd hold on him by one leg, and I by the other, and we pull'd him down directly into my man's bed, which is near the ladder. My man then said, master see that he has not got your watch, I was afraid it was gone, but I had no occasion to search his pockets, for when the prisoner sell the watch fell with him ; I then said, Jack, we have no need to search his pockets, for here it lies close by him.

            . I am a pawnbroker, on Monday the 17th of September this spoon (producing one) was brought to me to pawn by the prisoner at the bar, I ask'd her whose it was; she said, what was that to me whose it was; she asked 8 shillings upon it. I told her I would know whose it was before I lent any money upon it; I kept the spoon in my hand, and when she found I would not give it to her again, she said it was a young woman's that was at her house: I said I would go with her, and carry the young woman the money. I went along with her, but as I went along she said I must not see the young woman, and that I should not go to her house; so I then carried it home, and next day a young woman came for the spoon, but as she could give no particular description of it, I would not let her have it.</p>

               <p>Ann Green. I am servant to Mr. Strahan; I left a pan at the prisoner's house, and told her she might bring it home; she came and brought the pan home, and put it into the kitchen, and when she found nobody was there she took the spoon and put it into the pan, and carried it back again to her own house; some time after she sent to me and confessed that she took it after the manner that I have describ'd; we missed it about a quarter of an hour before she sent.</p>

               <p>Bourne. It was called after its mother's name, it was a bastard child, I deliver'd it to the prisoner at the bar, in order to get it in. I was recommended to her by the landlord of a public-house, where I drank. It was to have been put in in May or June, and the prisoner was to keep it till it was got in. I was to give her a guinea when she got it in, and 3 s. a week, so long as it was to be with her, before it was got in. I returned again to Rochester, when I had been there some time, the parish put me to the test, to know what was become of the child. I was obliged to come to London to the prisoner at the bar, to know what was become of it. She told me it was dead, and that she had paid 2 s. and 6 d. for coffin and shroud, to bury it in, and a week's board was owing, both which I paid, which was 5 s. 6 d. but she could not produce a certificate that the child was bury'd.</p>

            . I saw the last witness drinking at a public-house, and heard him say, he deliver'd the child to the prisoner at the bar. I did not see him deliver it, but I saw Mrs. Thornton, and heard her say in presence of Mr. Bourne, that it was a foul child, and would hardly live till taking-in day.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bourne. Did you hear the prisoner say so?</p>
               <p>Chambers. I heard her make some remarks on the child, but I cannot tell what. I think she said it was a poor puney child, and that she believed it would not live till taking-in day.</p>
               <p>Chambers continues. After the child was dead, the prisoner came to the public house where she took the child from, and said, that the child was dead, and desir'd the man of the house to write down to let the father know that it was dead. She came several times afterwards to know whether the father was come up, or whether he was acquainted with the death of the child or not.</p>

I then cried out to the watch, and people came from the Wells to my assistance. I told them I was robb'd, and almost murdered, I was afraid to go home, so I went to Clerkenwell round-house, there I staid till 4 o'clock next morning, and then went home into Silverstreet. I advertised the stockings, but could hear nothing of them. The prisoners were taken up for another robbery, I went to see them in Bridewell, there the evidence Bullock said he knew me, and that I was the man they robbed of the stockings.</p>

            . On the 26th of September, the two prisoners at the bar and I met the prosecutor up by the Water-works, it was about 11 at the night, we follow'd him down till we came to the Dog-and Duck, there the prisoner Clark knock'd him down, then he took a bundle of stockings and went away. In about an hour after, I went to his lodgings, then we went and pawn'd the stockings at several places, and shar'd the money, which amounted to about 9 or 10 shillings a-piece.</p>
               <p>James Brabrook. (He produces some stockings;) I had these stockings from several pawnbrokers, all but one pair, which I took off from the legs of the woman that lived with the prisoner. Jackson said that Clark knock'd the prosecutor down, and took the stockings from him, and that he had part of them. Clark would not confess any thing.</p>

I saw the prisoner striking him on the right side of the head with a hammer ; I cried out, and my neighbour, the next witness, came to me, the deceas'd then got up, and went into the house where he lodg'd ; he went into the kitchen, and the prisoner was secured by one Mr. Field. I saw the deceased about an hour afterwards in Mrs. Reed's kitchen, where he lodged, he was very bloody, there had been no Assistance sent for, we could not prevail with him to get assistance till 5 or 6 o'clock, he then went to Dr. Simpson's, and two of our neighbours went with him, I saw them go, but did not go myself, he was then very weak, but he could walk. Dr. Simpson sent him to the Infirmary, I went to see him about a week after he was there, he said he was very weak, but hop'd he should get over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what was the matter with him?</p>
               <p>Moody. I did not ask him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he came by this blow?</p>
               <p>Moody. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you of any thing that had happen'd between him and the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Moody. No, he did not tell me any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any previous quarrel, or any ill-will between them ?</p>
               <p>Moody. I don't know that there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the affair begun?</p>
               <p>Moody. I do not. He died on the Wednesday, and I saw him on the Saturday afterwards. I saw his head uncover'd, and his skull all open.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean his skull was open'd by the surgeons, or by the blow of the hammer?</p>
               <p>Moody. By both, I believe, for before he went to the infirmary, there was a cut so long that one might lay ones hand in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any marks of the hammer?</p>
               <p>Moody. I was not so near to examine so far as this, he was so nauseous nobody could go near him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of any quarrel between them?</p>
               <p>Moody. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon the prisoner at the bar to be a person in his senses or not?</p>
               <p>Moody. He always behaved in his senses so far as ever I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you look upon him to be of a weak understanding ?</p>
               <p>Moody. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they work together?</p>
               <p>Moody. They did, and was seemingly good friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not the opinion of the world, that the prisoner was a weak infirm person?</p>
               <p>Moody. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no weapon in the deceased's hand?</p>
               <p>Moody. No, none at all.</p>

            . I live in Phoenix-street, Spittal-fields, in the same house with Mrs. Moody. On the 9th of September, between 2 and 3 o'clock, as I was sitting in my own room, I heard an outcry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175310240031"/> of murder, and having two rooms on a floor ran to a back window and look'd out, there I saw the prisoner laying on the deceased over the head with a hammer, just underneath the window; I saw the hammer in his hand, and spoke to the prisoner, and said, Lord Jesus! James, how can you do so ? he made no answer but kept laying him on, I saw him give five or six blows, the deceased then got away and walk'd into his landlady's kitchen, and I never saw the deceased afterwards, till he was dead, which was about a fortnight and three days, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him did you take any notice of his head ?</p>
               <p>Hoard. I saw his skull open, it was saw'd off by a surgeon, it was much broke on the right side.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side did you see the prisoner strike the deceased on, when you look'd out of your window?</p>
               <p>Hoard. On the right side of the head, and I saw the skull broke in the same place.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the deceased any weapon at the time the prisoner took him?</p>
               <p>Hoard. No, he was upon the ground all in a heap, and the prisoner striking him.</p>

            . I live in Phoenix-street, Spittal-fields, in the same house with Mrs. Moody, and have known the prisoner about two years, and the deceased above six years; on the 9th of September, between two and three o'clock, I heard some body cry out Murder! I ran and opened the door, and saw the prisoner striking the deceased, he struck him two blows with a broad hammer; the deceased was endeavouring to open our door; he cried out, O Lord! O Lord! the prisoner then got away, and went back into his own room, but did not speak a word to me nor I to him. The deceased came into my kitchen, he was all over bloody about the head, and said to me, I cannot tell what I have done to him, meaning the prisoner, for I have not offended him ; he staid at our house till five or six o'clock, and then went to Dr. Simpson's, who sent him to the infirmary. I went and saw him there the next day, I asked him how he did, he said he was but very poorly, and further said, he had no words with the prisoner at all, I went three or four times in all, the third time I went he said, he was quite cheary and purely, and was in hopes of coming out again; the fourth time I went he was so bad he could not speak to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get at any spirituous liquors?</p>
               <p>Reed. Not as I know of.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any previous quarrel between them?</p>
               <p>Reed. They both fought together, and the deceased served the prisoner with a warrant, which I believe was the reason he ow'd him a grudge.</p>
               <p>Q. In the time you say you knew the prisoner did you ever see him out of his senses?</p>
               <p>Reed. No, I never did.</p>

The night this affair happen'd I was going into the Green Man, (I was not there at first) and just as I entered the door I saw the prisoner and the deceased fall, I made up to them as fast as I could, and as soon as I got up to them, I observed the deceased was uppermost, endeavouring to get from the prisoner, but could not, because he held him down with his left hand; somebody standing by said to the deceased, what are you at, why don't you get up? his answer was, he won't let me. While the prisoner held the deceased by the collar with his left hand, I saw a motion of pushing with the prisoner's right hand, (I did not mind that there was any thing in his hand) the deceased was still endeavouring to get up, which kept his body at a good distance from the prisoner; but the deceased had no sooner uttered the words, let me get up, but I saw an uncommon shivering all over the deceased's body, such as I never saw any thing of the kind before in my life, it was as though he was endeavouring to get from the fatal blow, the prisoner then took his hand from the deceased's collar, and Mr. Gee took him up and set his back against the bar. I then heard somebody say, (but who it was I cannot tell) Turney ! what do you die dunghill? he then clapp'd his two hands to his breast and said, What would you have me do? and dropp'd down dead immediately, then Mr. Gee call'd out, Stop the rogue, he has stabb'd the man. I was one that endeavoured to secure him.</p>
               <p>Robert Biggs was call'd, and deposed to the same purport as the last witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. I am constable, I had this knife delivered to me (looking at it) by Mr. Gee the landlord of the house ( the knife was shown to all the other witnesses who all deposed that it was the very knife that was taken away from the prisoner.)</p>

            , surgeon, deposed, that he examin'd the wound, which was of the depth of between three and four inches; that the bag which contains the heart was pierced, and upon opening that found the heart itself was wounded ; and that he dared take upon him to say, that that wound was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. from Mr. Mophett to Rabbit. Sir, please to give an exact account how the deceased and the prisoner lay?</p>
               <p>Rabbit describes the position by himself and another person, supposing himself to be the prisoner and undermost; he takes hold on the others shoulder, the other endeavouring to rise from him at the same time, which made so large a vacancy between them, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175310240034"/> Rabbit had the command of wounding him with his right hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mophett. Indeed, my lord, the wound seems to be given exactly in that position, tho' there is a great possibility the wound might be given by accident, by means of the knife having such a long string, it might entangle with the cloaths, and his weight might have thrust the knife into his body, possibly the string might have turn'd the knife upwards so as to run into his breast.</p>

               <p>After I had been in the house and was going out, one of them came behind me and took my hat and threw it down, he then took away my wig, I turn'd back again and desired him to give me my wig, but he would not, I cannot tell which it was.</p>
               <p>Q. to all the witnesses. Did you see him with a wig on?</p>
               <p>They every one said they did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner continues. He call'd me son of a b - h, and kept pulling me by the hair, then some of them said bring him back again, with that the man that is dead ran and took up a little pocket, or some iron thing, and struck me: Gentlemen, says I, if I was where I was known, you would not use me so, then one d - d me, and another d - d me, then the deceased asked me if I would fight; they were all strangers to me except the landlord of the house; I never took the knife to stick the man since the hour I was born.</p>

            . I live at Paddington, and keep the sign of the Wheat-Sheaf. On the second of October the prisoner brought two bay geldings, and called at my door at four o'clock in the morning, but I would not get up, for I found it was somebody drunk; I got up at five, or half an hour after, and when I opened the door there was the prisoner and the two horses, they had neither bridle, saddle, nor halter upon them, only two little bits of rope; he put them into the stable ; I thought he had stole them, but would not tax him with it. After we had eat and drank he asked me when Craydon fair was, for he would sell the horses there, and I told him it was yesterday ; he said he was very sorry for that, and ask me when market-day would be in Smithfield, and I told him on Friday ; he said that would not do, it was a long while to Friday ; he asked me if I could help him to any body that would buy one of them; I said, friend, if you come honestly by them, I will buy one; I then sent for one Mr. Holmes, and told him the affair, and desired him to buy the other, and not mind what price he gave, for I believed they were stole, so we bought them both, and gave him earnest on purpose to stop him; after we had gave earnest, we taxed him, and he said he had stole them; he said he brought them about 40 miles off on this side Northampton, and gave 10 l. in cash and a note of hand for 55 s. more. He sold them to us for 5 l. 5 s. I then said, now I'll undeceive you, I will stop you; the horses were advertised, and Mr. Bruiton came, and said they were stole out of his field, and that they belonged to the two former witnesses.</p>

My hat fell off, and the young woman call'd out Murder ! they ran away, but one of them turned back, and said, D - n me, I'll have something, and took up my hat and followed the other.

Hailey was one I am sure, he laid hold on me by the left arm, and dragg'd me from the chairman, and by the light of a lamp I saw both their hangers and Hailey's face: I said afterwards I should know one of them, if it was ten years hence, he had a very black beard and pinch'd-in cheeks, and large eye-brows. Such as Hailey. I said, Lord have mercy upon me! Hailey, said, d - n the b - h, hold your tongue, or such words, they both of them cut the prosecutor, I ran in betwixt, and call'd, Help! Murder ! &amp;c. Hailey kept cutting him while he had me by the arm. The prosecutor's hat fell off, and people coming to our assistance they ran away, but one of them came back and took up the hat, which he carried off. I went to see them at justice Fielding's, Hailey was in a room; (the justice was not there) and as soon as he saw me, for I had not spoke, he said, d - n you, what business have you here? I never did you any harm, so send for a pot of beer and let us drink together, and go about your business, if I had done you any hurt I'd own it.</p>

             before the commissioners for the bankruptcy to prove a debt that very day; there was a paper drawn up between them at some house near Guildhall, which was a tavern, some head, I know not the sign. This was about nine weeks before last Christmas; there was a note drawn by the prisoner, which Sopp signed; then Sopp gave a bag to me with some money in it, and ordered me to deliver it to the prisoner Hine, which I did, and Hine delivered it to Sopp. This was all done in about two or three minutes. I don't know what sum it was; but there was thirty-six shilling pieces, for Sopp gave me three out of the same bag afterwards, to pay to the clerk of the commissioners, Mr. Maschal, which I did; then we went all three together before the commissioners, Hine proved the note under the commission, and he was after that made an assignee.</p>
               <p>Q. What date was put to that note?</p>
               <p>Seyden. It was dated 16 or 18 months back, but I will not be positive to the exact time. A note was shewn to him by the prisoner's council, with the commissioners names folded in.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the note?</p>
               <p>Seyden. No, it is not, but when it was unfolded he said he'd swear it was the note.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the note being wrote was it that you went and proved it?</p>
               <p>Seyden. It might be an hour or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had it in their possession?</p>
               <p>Seyden. Hine had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any objection made to the shining of the ink being fresh wrote?</p>
               <p>Seyden. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the body of the note wrote before the date was put to it?</p>
               <p>Seyden. Upon my word, I can't be particular as to that, I know it was consulted betwixt them two to date it back on purpose to prove it.</p>
