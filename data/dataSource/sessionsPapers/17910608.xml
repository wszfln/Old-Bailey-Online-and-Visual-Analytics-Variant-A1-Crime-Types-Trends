The two prisoners were the men that robbed me; they took from me seventeen guineas and some odd money, besides my hat and three keys; I was going on foot from Highgate, where I had left my horse, to my own house, about a hundred yards further.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you positively sure as to the persons of the two prisoners at the bar? - Perfectly clear; for on going down I was quite abreast of them; I had not the least suspicion of being stopped; they both took hold of me by the collar, they were abreast, one of each side; they asked me for my money.</p>
               <p>Court. It must have been perfectly light at that time of night? - Broad day, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Which way did they go? - After they stopped me, I told them they were drunk, they were not serious; and by that time I had some how disengaged myself from them, expecting somebody would pass to my relief; I gave them a few blows, but they got me down, and one of them put his hand into my right-hand breeches pocket, and took my money, as I mentioned before; they crossed the field over to get from the spot, to get towards Caen Wood; I proceeded to a neighbour's, within a hundred yards of the spot, to a lady who holds a large farm under Lord Mansfield, expecting to find some assistance from her servants; I found only one at home, in consequence of which I did not wait there, but made the best of my way by running to Highgate, I got on my horse, and rode round by Hampstead-lane, by Lord Mansfield's; there is a little hut just opposite, there I saw a person who said he had just seen the two men, and he supposed they were then in the wood; having nobody with me, I went to the Spaniard, which is very near, and there were several people proposed looking out for them; I left them, and proceeded further through Hampstead, and came to Red Caps, about half way to Hampstead; there I found the patrol, and after giving them the information, I proceeded to go through Kentish-town; after I passed the workhouse, which is close to Red Caps, there is a vacant field, and there I met two soldiers; it being near dark I could not discriminate, and I went to the next public-house; not procuring any assistance, I rode back and passed them before they got to the work-house, and went to the public-house where the patrol were, and they seized the prisoners, who were just come up to the spot; on being brought into the house they were searched, and the particulars the patrol can inform you.</p>

               <p>The two spades I took from the prisoner I gave to Mr. Price, I received them at the Rotation, and gave them to Mr. Price, and brought them here to-day from Mr. Price; they are the same that were taken from the prisoner; there are two notches on them, which I made, I took them from the prisoner about an hundred yards from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080006"/>my mistress's house, going towards Limehouse; I officiate for Mr. Simper; the prisoner did not come to work that morning, he wanted to go to work at eight; I said, James do not go to work till nine; he said, I do not mind an hour; he went and had some breakfast, and then went and took the spades: he was watched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were the spades concealed or on my shoulder? - On his shoulder; he took another person's jacket, and left his coat; when we went up to him I said, you villain, where are you going to? he was in the regular foot-way, I saw him come over the fence, and Mr. Price was very nigh him.</p>
               <p>Whether I changed any money with Price, after he took me into custody? - He gave me sixpence, and I gave him change.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went to work, I never staid five minutes; in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour her other people went to breakfast; there were four people digging, two of them took their spades, the fourth was left in my charge; if I had lost it I must have been answerable for it; I pulled off my coat, it was nearer the house than where my work was, I thought it safer there than where it was; the foreman, Mr. East, had told me two or three different times, that they had lost tools out of the ground, therefore I took them with me for safety; I went in my shirt sleeves, I had money due to me from my mistress, wages, and I would hardly have gone away so.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. East. Do you know these spades? - Yes, by the marks upon them, J. S. in several parts.</p>

             is a housekeeper, a carpenter and joiner, a journeyman; I have known the prisoner a long time; I went to his mistress the day afterwards, and I asked her whether she would appear and speak in his behalf; Mrs. Simper said she lent him the spades, I can take my solemn oath of this; I heard of it, and I went to know whether or no he was taken and I asked her whether she did not lend him the spades; and she told me yes, and he comes of very honest parents.</p>
               <p>Did she say she lent him the spades that morning? - No; she only said she lent them to him.</p>
               <p>She did not say she lent them to him that morning? - No; she said she lent them, that was all; I have known him thirteen years. he served his time to Captain Barrer, to the seas, and was cast away on board the Old Kingston.</p>
               <p>Have not you mistaken her; you are a little deaf? - No, Sir, I have not; I was very near to her, and I took particular care; I never was before any body till now; my father married his mother, that is all the relation I am; that is no relation at all.</p>
               <p>Does he live in the house that you live in? - No, he does not; I live in Old-street-road, at No. 2, I sells a little tobacco; he lodges at Mile-end, at the Brewer's Arms: it is a great way off.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Simper. When did you see this woman? - This woman called upon me past nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>And did you tell her you lent him the spades? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What did she come about? - To beg of me to be merciful to him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say to her that you lent him the spades, or any thing like? - No, Sir, no such word.</p>
               <p>Did she appear deaf to you? - No, Sir, she did not; she told me she was his sister, and lived at Hoxton, and she begged of me not to appear against him, and not to bring him to justice.</p>
               <p>Then do you mean to say, that what she has sworn is false, that you never did say so? - If I was to say that I did say so, I should tell a falsity.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing that could be mistaken for that? - No, not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was round the world with Captain Cook, and I worked hard for Mr. Hobcroft, and he told me he would have come; but these gardeners and gardenesses hang all in a gang, so that they are obligated<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080007"/>to prosecute right or wrong; they do not stand upon any favour.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there any public-house nigh on the road? - There is one about a quarter of a mile nearer, the Britannia, going to Poplar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was my meaning to go to the next public-house to get a pint of beer, and return to my work like an honest man; I left money in my mistress's hands.</p>

               <p>Did he give you any part of the money he sold it for? - After he sold it he gave me eighteen pence of the money; I refused it, and told him I would not have it, and he forced into my pocket; my hand was in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I take it for granted,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080010"/>my young man, that you are perfectly innocent of all this business yourself? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Are you sure of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know a person of the name of Williams? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Williams had no concern in this? - None.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Now here is the examination returned, in which he says he did; you never agreed to take part of what the lead came to? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>How many times was you examined? - Twice, first I told him, in the morning, when he went to work, he said there was a pigeon; I asked him what he meant; and he shewed me a great piece of lead on the side of the house, and said that was a pigeon, and he went up and cut several pieces; then he wanted another man and me, and we would not; and when I came back, he had it all down; he threw a tile at me, it did not hit me.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Court and Jury: I was going down Rosemary-lane to an acquaintance of mine, where I retained and lodged, in Union-street; I happened to see this fire, I heard a great noise about it, which caused me to hurry down Rosemary-lane, where the fire was; when I saw this fire, opposite to the fire there was a great bustle, and in the mean time one of the gentlemen came and laid hold of me, and said, this is the young man; I believe he said, you took a handkerchief out of that gentleman's pocket; he laid hold of me and called for assistance, and searched me; I told him to examine me, the gentleman searched me, and nothing was found upon me; therefore gentlemen, I think it a hard thing that I should be bound into this disgrace, concerning a thing I know nothing about, and I am quite distant from any of my friends; all my friends live in Rotterdam, I lived some time at a shop in Houndsditch, No. 16, where any body may inquire my character; I served very honestly and truly, I never was out at bad hours, in my life. I am quite ignorant of the laws of this nation, I know not what to do at present, I am out of place, I am looking for a place; I have a mother in Rotterdam, I learned a kind of hatting-way, which I was able to perform at this gentleman's in Houndsditch.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in this country? - I learned English in Holland, I have been here a twelvemonth; I was thinking about learning the painting business.</p>

               <p>I have belonged to Bow-street sixteen or seventeen years. On Monday the 23d I received information from the prosecutor of his being robbed in Newtoner's-lane, I told him to come at eleven, and we went to the Red Hart, and the prosecutor picked out the prisoner, and said he was one that came behind him.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that a house of rendezvous for these sort of men? - I cannot say, there are several such houses in that neighbourhood; the prosecutor said he had no doubt of the man, but he would fetch his sister, who had a better sight of him than he had; the sister came, and I took her in without speaking to her, and she picked the prisoner out again a second time. I found no property upon him.</p>

               <p>If you found nothing in my possession, what have you got to alledge against me? - You stole this watch; you stole this watch.</p>
               <p>I stole that watch! you found it in my possession, you say? - I saw you throw it away, or at least I saw you move your arms as if you were throwing it away.</p>
               <p>How do you know I threw it away, you found nothing in my possession? - I could not observe the watch go, because it was dark.</p>
               <p>Jury. Will you take upon you to swear, that the watch you delivered to that young man, is the same watch taken out of Faulkner's and Radley's yard? - I do, I took it up myself.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did you make any minute of the time you picked it up? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. You have kept it from that time to this? - I have.</p>

               <p>I am an hair-dresser; I was in Mr. Jones's shop when the prisoner came in to purchase the watch; it was taken down and shewn him, and he examined it some time, and closed the watch, and I thought he had settled in himself to purchase it; he stood afterwards for the course of a minute or two, and ran out of the shop; Mr. Jones's man and I run after him, and brought him back from Vine-office-court; I lost sight of him only while the door was shutting; I saw nothing what became of the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was you in the shop when the watch was first missed? - I was.</p>
               <p>How many people were in the shop? - Two or three, I am certain there were two.</p>
               <p>At what time was the watch missed? - Very near eleven.</p>

               <p>Did any body search any other place? - Wine-office-court was examined.</p>
               <p>Who was the first person that found the watch? - The young man that shewed you the watch.</p>
               <p>Shewed me the watch! - Yes, you, Sir, I am certain it was you.</p>
               <p>Was any other person present at the finding? - I was not present.</p>
               <p>What was you doing when the watch was first missed? - I had business there like you.</p>
               <p>Did you come there for a watch? - I came there for the business I wanted, and you seemed to come for some purpose.</p>

               <p>What part of the shop was you in? - I was in the shop close to you, and there was two women in the shop at the same time.</p>
               <p>Do not you think it possible for one man to resemble another? - I am so certain that I am not mistaken.</p>
               <p>Have I any particular marks you know me by? - I know you by your person, and I suppose that is sufficient.</p>
               <p>When there were so many people in the shop, how could you tell particularly who took the watch? - There were two women in the shop, and you was the only man besides myself in the shop.</p>
               <p>Was the watch in motion? - I saw the young man seemed to set the watch a going.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080016"/>Where was the watch put after that? - Into your hands.</p>
               <p>Why the man must have gone to sleep to put it into my hands; how many people searched for the watch after it was first missed? - This young man and one watchman.</p>
               <p>How many watchmen were in Mr. Jones's shop? - One.</p>
               <p>You found nothing about me? - No, nothing.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman, I know nothing of the robbery; I stopped the prisoner on the 21st of May, on Saturday, about eleven o'clock, in Wine-office-court, Fleet-street; I did not see the watch at all. The prisoner is the man I took, he was running along, and upon the alarm of stop thief, I took him prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What time was it you first saw me? - About five minutes after eleven.</p>
               <p>Where did you take me? - In Wine-office-court.</p>
               <p>Where did you take me to afterwards? - I surrendered you up to two young men.</p>
               <p>Was not you in Mr. Jones's shop? - I was afterwards.</p>
               <p>You searched me? - Yes, slightly, but I ordered you to be taken to the constable.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to believe that I had a watch? - You played with your hands, and the watch was found inside the rails the next morning.</p>
               <p>Did not you conduct me to the watch-house that night? - I helped, aided and assisted.</p>
               <p>Do you know what time the watch was found? - I do not know, only what I was told.</p>
               <p>Was your walk from the corner of Wine-office-court? - It is.</p>
               <p>Did you see any watch there; how long might you stop there? - I suppose I stopped there about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave your walk? - About twenty minutes after four, in broad day-light.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see the prisoner make any motion with his arms? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Although my poverty has precluded me the benefit of counsel, yet I thank heaven that that misfortune will be supplied by the humanity of the Judge who tries me; the Jury will observe that I call no person to my character, that the case may be reduced to its own merits; theirs is the character I rely upon; not on my own: On their discernment and not on my own I rely. I sent to none of my friends, because I did not wish them to know the disgraceful situation into which I am plunged; my character is lost by the situation itself: Gentlemen, believe me innocent; I lived till this misfortune by an honest trade, that of a stay-maker, and by that trade I hope to maintain myself as usual, by the favour of your verdict, and the recovery of my usual health and spirits.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired for ten minutes, and returned with a verdict,</p>

On the 28th of May last, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080017"/>saw the prisoner put his hand twice into the chest, and take tea out, and put it under his coat; I gave Mr. Wilson information, he sent for the prisoner to the counting-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. In what situation was the prisoner? - In his working clothes.</p>
               <p>You had access to the teas whenever you pleased? - We had been nailing the teas up.</p>
               <p>Court. What is it the labourers do about these teas? - The teas are stowed before the sale, the brokers come, and the chests are opened for them to take samples, and then a sheet of paper is put over to cover it, and lead over that, and then the wooden lid put on, and then that is nailed down; that is the duty of the labourers.</p>
               <p>- HOWELL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer, I searched the man, and found the tea in a pocket patched to his breeches behind. According to my best recollection there was no hole behind.</p>
               <p>(The tea produced.)</p>
               <p>Was that tea such as they had on shew at this time? - Certainly it was, but I cannot swear positively it is the Company's tea, it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say positively you cannot say whether that is your tea or not? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it a common side-pocket on the breeches? - No, it was a patch behind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was this patch to mend the breeches? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did it look like it? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean to say that it had the least appearance of a patch to mend the garment, or was it a pocket fastened on the outside? - To the best of my recollection, it was a pocket or a patch, outside of the breeches.</p>
               <p>Did it appear as if it was to mend them? - All I can say it, it was sewed outside of the breeches.</p>
               <p>With all these number of ounces of tea in it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>- WILSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an elder; I look over the labourers. On some information I received, I sent for the prisoner to come down to the counting-house, I asked him, Martin, have you got any tea about you? not to my knowledge, says he; on which I desired him to walk further into the counting-house, and desired Mr. Howell to rub him down, and he could not find any, on which his countenance seemed to clear up; (they are commonly rubbed down by their sides) I desired him to examine him again, and he did; and in coming round the second time, he found it; says he, here is a bulk; on examining this we found a large piece of leather sewed to the waistband of his breeches, sewed quite round, separate from the breeches, and open on the top of the waistband, and in it was that tea: on this he said he was sorry for what he had done, and it was the first time.</p>
               <p>Had you at this time any tea of this sort on shew? - A great number, some thousands of chests; it was part of the prisoner's employment to nail up the chests where this sort of tea was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was there nothing passed of holding out any favour to the prisoner at the time, to make him confess? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>The pocket, whatever it was, was open for any one to see? - No, it was not, till the skirts were taken up.</p>
               <p>How long had this man been in the warehouse? - Three years.</p>
               <p>I would venture to ask you this question; whether during this time, you had ever reason to suspect him before? - I cannot say I had.</p>
               <p>He had been three years however? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Court. What had he on when he was brought down to the ware-house? - He had a coat and a great coat on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to the Court. My Lord, we have not had the fact proved, that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080018"/>ware-house was the property of the East India company.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There is not a single witness, my Lord, that has not stated it.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Knapp. Under circumstances of this kind, I think it has been proved; but if it appears a doubtful question, and you wish to ask concerning the fact, let Mr. Tadmire stand up.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Tadmire. From what warehouse are we to understand that the tea was taken; did it belong to the East India Company? - It did.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am innocent of putting it in, my Lord.</p>

               <p>This fork was missed about two, on Thursday morning, the 2d of June; it is marked with L. M. in a cypher at top, a four-prong fork; on the Wednesday night I put it into the closet myself, and locked the closet-door; the next day the fork was gone, I am sure of it; here is another the same, we have only these two.</p>

               <p>Last Wednesday week, at night, Miss brought the knife-box down as usual, and this fork was in it; I put it into a kettle of water, and after washing my dishes put it into the kettle, it went into the sink; one end went in, and I was trying to get it out; it bent, and bent it so that I strove to straighten it, and it broke, and that is the truth; I would have wished to have made it good, and my mistress had hired a cook; then I told her I could not stay; I had a scald in the house, and came out to help her, I never robbed her; I meant to have made the fork good when she paid me my wages; I had all my witnesses here till nine at night, I did not think my trial would come on; I am a poor widow woman with three children.</p>

               <p>I am employed by Messrs. Nicholson and Harrison as a traveller in the country: the prisoner at the bar was their <rs id="t17910608-19-deflabel114" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <persName id="t17910608-19-person212">
                  Jacob

            , a farrier, in Wells; I procured a search-warrant, to search Bartlett's house: when I went in, I inquired for the prisoner, and was informed he was below stairs in the kitchen, under ground: I sent down, in order to speak with him, but he would not come up; I went down, having assistance with me, and told the prisoner I had got a search-warrant to search the house, respecting a parcel of goods which had come down, which were suspected to belong to the prosecutor; he affected to know nothing about the matter; I do not recollect the words he said; upon that I observed to the constable and the vergers, who were with me, that we had better go up stairs, and search there: when we got up stairs, on the first floor, we found a trunk, which we searched; (the prisoner staid below stairs:) I do not recollect whether it was locked or no; in this trunk I found a great many suspicious goods, which I suspected might be the property of Messrs. Nicholson and Harrison; in the same trunk also were many of the clothes of the woman who cohabited with the prisoner. By this time there was word brought up stairs that the prisoner had made his escape: there was a young man with me of the name of Nesbitt; says I, Nesbitt, do you go after him, I cannot leave the house: after that, I went into another room on the same floor, a back room and a bed-room, in which the woman who went by the name of Jenkins at that time was.</p>
               <p>Had you known her in London? - I had not. In the corner of the room were four or five boxes, some of which were locked; I asked the woman for the keys, which she readily gave; in these boxes I found a great many haberdashery goods; and at the foot of the bed, at the window, lay a chest; and I asked her for the key of that, and that I did not immediately procure: we got removing some part of these goods to the mayor's house: during this time, I set a man, in one room, to watch what goods I had there; and when I came back, I found this chest, which I had before left found,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080022"/>broke at its hinges; I looked into it, and I saw clothes in it, it was not quite empty; and we went on to search again, and went up the second pair of stairs, and there we searched the bed; and between the bedclothes we found a great deal of sewing silk loose, in skains, about ten or twelve pound weight: then we came down to the bedroom, on the first floor; in a box, at the foot of the bed, not the chest, we found several more modes and Persians, in half or quarter pieces, quite new: then we proceeded to search the cellar again; or, as it may be called, the kitchen; the place where we first went; there we found some black lace and some Persian, just put on a shelf, put out of the way, in a place where they were liable to be spoiled: these goods were conveyed to the mayor; a part of which I proved to be the property of Messrs. Nicholson and Harrison, by their marks; I cannot swear to all, but I swear to some by the private marks of the prosecutor: the examination took place before the mayor, and Mr. Lovell, a justice; he was asked how he came by those goods I pointed out; he said he knew nothing at all about them: the mayor then enumerated several other articles, which are now produced; he said he bought them of the Jews; some others he said he had bought on board a ship, and pointed at the Nankeens. -</p>
               <p>[Mr. Fielding, Prisoner's Counsel, moved the Court, that, before any further proceedings were gone into upon this trial, a felony should be proved. This was objected to by Mr. Garrow, as he conceived he had a right to carry on the prosecution in his own way; and if, at length, a felony was proved, I was sufficient. Mr. Fielding's objection was over-ruled, and Mr. Garrow directed to proceed, by the Court. The examination of the witness was then continued]</p>
               <p>Whiteman. He was afterwards committed.</p>
               <p>Have you since examined into the Nankeens which he stated he had bought on board a ship? - We generally tie up the Nankeens in bundles of ten pieces in each bundle, and we mark the outermost of them; one of these was marked by Mr. Nicholson himself.</p>
               <p>Is there any regular course of their trade by which such goods are carried on board a ship? - No, not Nankeens; their trade is principally in the country.</p>
               <p>Have you looked at any other articles; were there any marks on those which he said he bought of the Jews? - Yes, on two pieces of Scotch linen.</p>
               <p>Are those the linens without stiffenings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever sell linen in that state? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you was not present at the time the prisoner was taken? - I was not. (Some goods the witness selected before the mayor of Wells, and deposed to then, were now produced.) All these he said he knew nothing of; I found them with the other things which he said he had of the Jews, and bought on board of ship.</p>
               <p>Did you find any cloaks? - Yes, scarlet ones; and at the mayor's he desired me, when I wrote home to Mr. Nicholson, to be as favourable as possible to him.</p>
               <p>Did you give him any reason to expect he would be at all benefitted by making this confession? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you threaten him? - I did not; I do not know I said any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. There was one word you made use of, and very properly, and that was, that you do not know you made use of any inducement to make him say what he did? - I do not recollect what I said to him; I cannot swear I did not; for I forget what I said, as to the words.</p>
               <p>You live with the prosecutors, Messrs. Nicholson and Harrison, as a rider? - I do.</p>
               <p>In that employ you are mostly out of town? - I am.</p>
               <p>It is not your business to transact the business of the shop? - I do frequently, when I am in town.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived with Messrs. Nicholson and Harrison? - Since September last.</p>
               <p>Of course, then, it is only from September last you can speak to the marks used<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080023"/>in this firm; what part of that time have you been in the country? - I do not suppose above five weeks in the house.</p>
               <p>Five weeks, taken at different times? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then five taken altogether, at different times, is all the time that you have had opportunity of knowing the marks? - By no means; for I take patterns, that are marked, out with me.</p>
               <p>How many people does Mr. Nicholson deal with in Somersetshire? - In Somersetshire there are many customers.</p>
               <p>When you came into the house first, there were a great number of goods made up, with marks on them? - Undoubtedly there were.</p>
               <p>They did not vary the marks at all? - I do not know they did.</p>
               <p>So that goods sent out last month, or those that came out a twelvemonth ago, would be marked in one and the same manner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Scott? - Mr. Scott was a warehouseman to Mr. Nicholson when I first came into employ.</p>
               <p>These Nankeens the mayor did not ask any question upon them? - The mayor enumerated the article of Nankeen.</p>
               <p>Was that bundle of Nankeen produced and put before the prisoner? - All that the mayor asked was on the different goods that were there; the mayor asked the question; there are Nankeens, and several other articles, where did you get these?</p>
               <p>He did not put any distinct question on that bundle of Nankeens? - No, not as to the producing of them before him.</p>
               <p>Now then, when you went down to the house of Mr. Bartlett, you seem to have made the search immediately on your entering? - No, we went down into the kitchen below first, and there he was.</p>
               <p>You got an easy access to the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And was let in immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe, when you took away these goods from Mr. Bartlett's, you likewise took away a quantity of goods that were certainly not with any mark of Mr. Nicholson's; India goods, smuggled goods? - I do not know; I cannot swear to India goods.</p>
               <p>They were goods, however, in this way of business, that you had not the least suspicion of their belonging to Mr. Nicholson?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You do not mean to say that? - I did not mean to take any thing that I did not suppose or believe belonged to Mr. Nicholson, although I took away many goods that were not marked.</p>
               <p>Jury. I think you said Mr. Nicholson never exported Nankeens? - Never, to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Did you employ the woman that you thought was his wife? - She was employed for a considerable time to make up scarlet cardinals, and hats, which we sell both abroad and at home; the man had so much the good opinion of us, that he used to take the cloth home, and cut it up at his own house, and the woman made them up.</p>
               <p>When did the prisoner leave your service? - On the 25th of March: he applied to me to make him a warehouseman; as he was in every respect a very useful man, I told him, if you could any way try to write, I should give you the preference to any man I know: he told me he intended to try for such a place; I told him, I would have you to consider that you have a very advantageous place, and, added to that, your wife has work; and, if it is wages you want, four or five guineas a year more shall make no difference, for I will give it you: after two or three days, he said he would quit the place, and go and learn to write, and fit himself for a better place.</p>
               <p>Did he intimate to you any intention of leaving London, and taking his wife with him? - No; but, on the contrary, begged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080024"/>she might work for the house as she used to do; and a few days afterwards we had occasion to send to employ her: on inquiry, the house was found shut up, and he had left the place, having quitted it with great caution.</p>
               <p>How soon after this was it you discovered he was at Wells? - About ten days or a fortnight before Mr. Whiteman went down. On finding he had quitted the town in that way, I thought it necessary to inquire more particularly what the neighbours would say, from which I had reason to believe that he was at Wells; in consequence of which I directed Mr. Whiteman to go down.</p>
               <p>Have you since looked over any of these articles which are produced? - Here are forty-six yards black lace, I can swear to the mark on the card, it cost 2 s. 8 d. per yard; here are sixteen yards of Scotch linen, cost 10 1/2 d. per yard, an article bought in a state to be stiffened by me into buckram, and not at all saleable.</p>
               <p>Did you ever sell any in that state? - No, except to one country customer at Norwich, and that must be at least two years ago. Here is another piece of buckram, cost 10 3/4 d. per yard; here is another piece of Scotch linen, unstiffened, of the same value of the former, 10 1/2 d.; here are forty-two yards of black lace, which have my own mark upon them, at 2 s. 3 d. per yard; here are thirty-eight yards and a half of black lace, at 15 d. per yard; here are twenty-six yards of Irish linen, in an unstiffened state, at 12 d. per yard; we have never sold any of this quality in that state.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about that linen being your property? - I have not the smallest doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Court. What is it worth? - Twenty-six shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What is the course of your trade respecting Nankeens? - Chiefly the country trade; and, in case of Nankeens going for exportation, they go without any mark upon them, with the other goods, on board of ship.</p>
               <p>Are these Nankeens marked? - They are, one of them.</p>
               <p>Then you are able to say, for a certainty, that that never was intended for your export trade? - I can beyond a doubt.</p>
               <p>Whose marking is it upon these Nankeens? - These Nankeens have my mark, with my own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>What is that piece worth? - About six shillings, or five shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of all the property which you believe to be yours? - I did not make an estimate, but I believe it somewhere better than 200 l.</p>
               <p>Upon looking at them, are you able to say that you have a strong belief that they have been your property? - I have, most certainly.</p>
               <p>Now I will ask you a question; are you able, by any examination into the state of your affairs, to say whether you have been robbed or not robbed? - Our gross profits have been less for two or three years back, and I had reason to suspect that some one or other had robbed us.</p>
               <p>That we may go to the whole fact, are you able to say that any particular piece, of Nankeen, or silk, or any other of the articles there, has been missed? - It is impossible I can, in my business; I am not able to say as to one article.</p>
               <p>[Mr. Fielding submitted to the Court that they would not call upon the prisoner for his defence; Mr. Garrow objected; and the Court allowed the objection.]</p>
               <p>Court. As to the Nankeen, that is certainly evidence for the consideration; but, as to the general evidence which has been given in this case, there is nothing at all applicable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Mr. Nicholson. You say there is a piece of Irish linen you never sell in that state? - Yes, there is, and it has my own mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Can you say that Nankeen to be yours? - I say it was mine, and I think it is mine.</p>
               <p>- SCOTT sworn.</p>
               <p>I am employed by Messrs. Nicholson and Harrison, as a warehouseman.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any night-caps being made for a customer? - They were bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080025"/>for a customer, and returned by that customer to our house.</p>
               <p>Were such ever sold by the trade? - No.</p>
               <p>Were they afterwards missing? - They were.</p>
               <p>Did you find these night-caps on examining your stock? - They are amongst these articles.</p>
               <p>(The night-caps produced.)</p>
               <p>Did you ever sell such night-caps in your shop? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>They ought still to be in your stock? - They ought.</p>
               <p>What do you know of these kerseymere waistcoats? - They are damaged in the printing, and returned; and therefore I believe they were never sold; and they are not in our stock now, where they ought to be; because, being damaged, they are unsaleable.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Nicholson. Why are they not saleable? - Because the colour of the spots and stripes is run into the ground.</p>
               <p>What was the wages of this man? - Half a guinea a week.</p>
               <p>How much might he make of his situation altogether? - Sixty or eighty pounds a year.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to - Scott. How many lived in the house of Mr. Nicholson altogether? - Five altogether, exclusive of Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Harrison.</p>
               <p>Are you the sixth? - No, I am the fifth.</p>
               <p>What is your employ? - My employ is to prepare the goods for orders.</p>
               <p>Then you yourself do not make any bargain of sale with the different customers of Messrs. Nicholson and Harrison? - Sometimes I do.</p>
               <p>Did you ever sell goods yourself? - I have.</p>
               <p>Did you order goods without their knowledge? - I have.</p>
               <p>Have you ever sold any goods to the prisoner at the bar? - I have frequently let him have goods.</p>
               <p>How did he pay for those goods? - He allowed for them out of his wages.</p>
               <p>Can you say whether you ever sold him a kerseymere waistcoat? - I believe I have sold him one waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that you have frequently let him have goods, and he was to pay for them out of the deduction of his wages? - Some goods he has had.</p>
               <p>He used often to have small articles, and allow for them out of his wages? - That was very seldom the case.</p>
               <p>Did you know the wife, or the woman he lived with? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She was employed in making up cloaks? - She was.</p>
               <p>Some goods then you have let him have? - I have.</p>
               <p>Did you live in the house all the time he was there? - I was in the country about four months.</p>
               <p>You might have sold many articles that Mr. Harrison and Mr. Nicholson might not know any thing of, except by your account? - Certainly I might.</p>
               <p>You therefore have taken many goods out of the shop, have determined on the sale, made the agreement yourself, without the interference of your masters; so that it might have happened, that many of these articles, so sold by you, would not have been known by them as sold, unless Mr. Nicholson or Mr. Harrison should come to the spot and make the search; they could only rely on your account? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My learned friend, by repeating it so often, has made it appear that you might have sold many articles to this man; how much might you have sold to him altogether? - About two guineas worth.</p>
               <p>Were they things to sell, or for his own use? - For his own use, or his wife's.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him wear it afterwards? - I believe I have.</p>
               <p>Did you ever sell him more than one waistcoat-shape? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Had you any conception that he was going into trade that required such a stock as this? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Did you ever sell him any quantity of sewing silk? - Never.</p>
               <p>Any buckram? - Never.</p>
               <p>Any Irish linen in an unfinished state? - Never.</p>
               <p>Any night-caps? - Never.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at my house at Wells when they came to search.</p>
               <p>How long had these boxes and trunks been at your house? - One had been some time before he came down, and two more came down with him; what was in them I did not know; I never saw what was in them till I saw them before the mayor.</p>
               <p>When he came down to Wells, had you and he any talk about the goods to which this letter relates? (A letter produced.) Did he inquire whether any boxes had come down before him? - He did; I had had advice, by letter, they were to come.</p>
               <p>Is that the letter that brought the advice? - I cannot say, unless I read it.</p>
               <p>In whose bed-room was it the chest was found? - In the room the prisoner lay in.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any money he had when he first came down? - I know he had money, five or six and twenty pounds, or more.</p>
               <p>What did he come down into your country for? - My wife died, and I thought that my daughter could mind my house, and, as I heard he was a young active man, I could learn him my branch of business, especially as I was in low circumstances.</p>
               <p>Then when he came down what steps did he take for that end? - He paid the most of my debts; I owed, I believe, fourteen pounds, and was afraid of being arrested; and he laid me in a stock of leather besides, about five pounds worth or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>How long had this partnership been thought of before he came down? - I suppose very handy on a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>How often, during that twelve months, did you receive goods of him? - I never received any thing but one box.</p>
               <p>Some of these goods came to you by this letter, dated in February, 1789? - That was the first box that came down.</p>

After the robbery they dropped from the side, and left the door opened; I saw no more of them. They swore a good deal, and used intimidating and gross language, but no other bad usage; there was a cart which I got behind, and I saw them no more. One of them gave one of the horses a blow; we proceeded to Ponder's-end, where there was some of the militia, we sent them to pursue them, they returned without success. We went to Enfield-highway, I went to the ale-house, and sent for the constable, I ordered my groom to go with him to town, to lodge an information at Justice Spiller's, and also at Bow-street: the officer's name was

               <p>To Mrs. Bristow. Was you in the carriage at the same time Mr. Adair was robbed, Madam? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any thing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. I object to this; that is the subject of another criminal charge in this court, and I am sure on having an opportunity, by another indictment which lays before you of inquiring into the loss of Mrs. Bristow will not multiply charges on this indictment; she has a charge before the Court, that is before you and the Jury to decide, and regularly, whatever she has lost, is the subject of inquiry on that charge.</p>
               <p>Court. What her evidence will be, I do not at present know; but in the present opening, it seems to me it will be material; the articles were afterwards found in the chaise, in which the prisoners were, and will have an influence on this trial.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You lost your watch, Madam? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you seen that watch since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The watch produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, another of the Prisoner's Counsel. It is not evidence at all for her to prove her property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Have you had that watch long? - About nine months.</p>
               <p>Are you able to ascertain the number? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor the maker's name? - No; it is a silver watch gilt, the chain and the seal, from the appearance of them all together, I can say I had such; it is a small antique, I had such an one.</p>

I searched Bates, but found nothing particular on him; then there came up three gentlemen and assisted us; then Gillekey came out second, and Mr. Lindo got into the chaise, and delivered to me these two watches; they are the same I received from him, there was a brace of pistols brought in by somebody at the gate, they told me they brought them out of the chaise, they were not loaded, and these pieces of a bullet I found in Bates's breeches pocket; a guinea dropped when I was searching Mackaway, but I cannot say where it dropped from; no more money was found on them that night only six pence. When they were searched on Friday morning, six guineas and a half in a bag, was found upon Mackaway.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How far is Tottenham-High-cross to the place where you took the chaise? - It is more than four miles.</p>
               <p>How soon after you took the chaise, did you come up to the persons you describe? - As near as I can guess, it was three quarters of an hour, or an hour.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you might have got three or four miles further? - I do not know, I am not used to these things. I have had the watches ever since I took them before the Justice.</p>

               <p>Was you able to discern their persons? - One of them, the man on the right hand, that is Bates, he had hold of my horses, and presented the pistol to me.</p>

Mr. Clayton, as you have ventured to say you have seen this man before,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080030"/>and as there is a reward in this case, I think that you should tell us, where you have seen him; because if you do not do that, we shall give no credit to your having seen him at all? - I cannot say where I have seen him in particular.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear, you ever saw him before? - No, my Lord, I will not swear to that.</p>
               <p>Now, a little as to this night; this was ten in the evening, and as we have heard from your master, whom I would rather trust than you, it was a dark evening, he says he could not see? - It was so light, that I could see him perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Had this man on a round or a cocked hat? - He had a round hat on; he was at my near horse's head.</p>
               <p>Now I will venture to ask you, do you venture to swear to him, from a supposition of having seen him before, which you cannot prove; or whether you had at that light such a distinct view of him to know him again? - I had a distinct view of him.</p>
               <p>How long did this transaction take up? - About eight or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Now, as to his coat, will you venture to swear that his coat was not a black one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was not a blue coat? - No.</p>
               <p>It was not brown? - It was a dark drab colour.</p>
               <p>That you could see at ten at night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As well as you could see his face? - Better of the two.</p>
               <p>You say this was ten or twelve minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As we have heard the transaction stated, it does not appear to me that it would take up so much time; was it five minutes? - It was more than five minutes.</p>
               <p>Was it seven minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. During the time this man stood at the head of the horses, your attention, I suppose, must be engaged entirely in observing him and no other object? - I had him under my eye, for I was afraid to look off him, for fear of having my brains blown out.</p>
               <p>Therefore your observation was confined to his person? - My eye was particularly upon him.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to swear positively, that that man you speak of now, was at your horse's head, from the observation you made at the time? - Yes, he is the very man that was at the head of my horses.</p>
               <p>Unassisted from any observation you made of him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

               <p>What passed on your coming up? - Before we came within thirty yards, we cried London, hoy, for to take up passengers; when we came along-side of them, they halloo'd out, and asked what he would take for them to Shoreditch; the boy said eighteen-pence a piece; they said that was too much, the boy agreed to take two shillings; the constable came out; they said, do not let us disturb you; they got in, and the constable got out, and pretended to give him a shilling, and bade us all a good night, and we wished him a good night; we staid a little that the constable might get on; the gates flew open, I saw no person at the gates; as soon as we got half way through, the constable stopped the chaise, and took the three young men; the prisoners are the three young men; I saw the pistols, a gentleman, Mr. Lindo, brought the pistols first, and then the two watches.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What time was this? - To the best of my remembrance, it might be between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>How far off the turnpike from Tottenham-high-cross? - I really cannot say, from Enfield Highway I believe it is five miles, as nigh as I can guess; it was half after eleven or twelve before we finished the job.</p>

               <p>I came up to the turnpike when the chaise came up, I got into the chaise as the third man was getting out, and found a brace of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080031"/>pistols in the front pocket, and I found two watches close together under the cushion of the seat; I delivered the pistols to the postchaise-boy: when I found the watches, I carried them in my hand till I got into the turnpike-house; then I took down their numbers, and delivered them to Mr. Law, they were the same watches which I found in the chaise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. You know pistols are commonly put into the pockets of a chaise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In travelling, is it not a very common thing to take the watch out of your pocket, and put it into a place of security? - I never did myself.</p>
               <p>Have you ever travelled at night? - I have all hours.</p>
               <p>Can you judge what other people do? - No, I cannot; as I never did it, I suppose they do not.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to answer me? - I do upon my oath; I never knew that any body did do it, and therefore I must suppose they do not do it; I never heard of any person who hid a watch in my life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not be alarmed, you are just in the same situation with me, for I never did neither.</p>
               <p>(The watch deposed to by Mr. Adair.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair. It is a new watch which I have had by me some time, it is scratched in the opening, which I observed before I lost it: it has my seal of arms to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you been into this post-chaise, and hid your watch? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. You do not know the number of this watch? - No, I do not, I have not had it above nine months.</p>
               <p>It is a very common watch? - It is a very dear one, it cost me forty-seven guineas.</p>
               <p>You do not mean by saying it is a dear one, that it is an uncommon one? - No.</p>

               <p>Any watches under the cushions? - None at all, I turned the cushions.</p>
               <p>When you came towards the hill, did you see any body? - We came up with three men about one hundred yards on this side the ship; I saw them in going along the road, and halloo'd out, London, hoy, once or twice; and they said, stop, my lad, are you going to town; and they asked me if I would take them to town; I said yes, at one shilling a piece the tall one said, I cannot afford a shilling a piece, we will give you two shillings for the three; well then, says I, jump in, somebody that can afford must pay another time; Law got out, they would not have had him he said he was going to Stamford-hill, he got out there, when he came to the turnpike gate, and halloo'd out gate, I drove the horses through, the constable came and opened the chaise door, and clapped his hands round them, and said, you are all three my prisoners; the constable said, I know it very well my lads, I hired the chaise for you, I had a suspicion of you; they said they would not get out, they would be searched in the chaise; he could not search them properly, so the groom said, he insisted on the constable doing his duty, and they were searched, one at a time, in the turnpike house. This gentleman, Mr. Lindo, jumped into the chaise, and I with him, as close as I could, he put his hand into the pocket of the chaise, and gave me a brace of pistols; I delivered them to Law, they were the same I saw Mr. Lindo find in the pocket of the chaise, which he delivered me; and then he got the watches, and I delivered them to Mr. Law.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you search your chaise in general? - When we deliver a gentleman we sometimes search when we come in, and sometimes when we go out.</p>
               <p>You did not find any watches in the last journey? - No, I searched for my short whip.</p>

I saw Mrs. Hooper afterwards, and it was a fiction. She had given her no order, she had lived with her. On Saturday the 28th, the day week after I hired her, she went out, and returned much the worse for liquor; she went out the second time, and did not return till near eleven o'clock, very much intoxicated, and went to bed: about one o'clock my wife came down to me to inform me that her sister had been robbed; I went up to her room and enjoined them silence; accordingly I recollected the Brown Bear in Bow-street, and went there, and staid till Croker came in; I then went with him to my house, and opened the business to my waiter, and had him examined, and had his box opened, and nothing was found; we then proceeded up to the prisoner's room, she was locked in and in bed; after some time we got her to unlock the door, and let us in, and then seized the prisoner's pockets; and in one pocket we found some silver and some copper, and in the other four guineas and two half guineas, and the paper and rush-box, and the bank-note in it.</p>

               <p>About a quarter after twelve I was coming from Great Earl-street, and I saw the prisoner at the bar and this boy having a scuffle about this basket of bread; I said nothing at all, nor interfered till the prisoner knocked the boy down; he gave him a blow on his forehead, and I catched him as he was falling; then he asked him if he would give him his basket, and go away quietly; I advised him so to do, but he would not; he said he lived with Mr. Paine, and he would take me along with him, if I would go with him; afterwards he made some objection, and said he would go to Litchfield-street; I took him there, the magistrate told the lad to take the basket home, and put a mark upon it, that he might know it again.</p>
               <p>Court to Curl. Did you mark the basket? - The officer that went home with me put six notches on it, just by the handle.</p>

               <p>I was going along, and out of place, and I met a baker, and asked him, if he could inform me where I could get work; he said he would, if I would go along with him; we went into a public-house, and had some beer and gin, and coming along afterwards, he asked me to carry his basket for him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>

The prisoner at the bar came into the shop, on the 21st of March last, and asked to look at some silver watches; I handed him down two, and he looked at them, and he asked me to look at a metal watch; I left those two silver watches on the counter, to reach for the metal one, as he wanted, with a long handle, and in that moment he made off with the silver watches, and went out of the shop at the front-door: I saw him go out, I cannot say I saw the watches in his hand when he went out, but I saw them in his hand the minute before. and I missed the watches from the counter; I pursued him but did not see him; I saw him again on the 23d or 24th of May, about two months afterwards at Guildhall; I have never seen the watches again at all; I went to Guildhall in consequence of being informed that a man was taken up on suspicion,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080046"/>and went to see if that was the person, and I recollected his face again.</p>
               <p>Was he long enough in your shop, so as you can say decidedly that is the man? - I can.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - I have not.</p>
               <p>How long was he in your shop? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>What may the value of these watches be? - They had cost as much as laid in the indictment; one cost thirty shillings, the other twenty-six shillings. It is uncertain what they would have sold at.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How long is it ago since these watches were first missing? - The first of March last.</p>
               <p>Was there many people in the shop? - Only one person as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Who was that person? - There was a woman standing pretty near you, on the same side of the shop.</p>
               <p>Do you know that person? - I know her very well; she remained after you was gone.</p>
               <p>Court. What is that person; is she of a good character, how does she get her livelihood? - I do not really know, but I fancy she is a woman of repute; she lived then in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>That woman is not here? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you not to have that woman her? - She could not recollect his face.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it? - About eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>When he went out of the door did he run or walk? - I did not see him, after he got out of the door.</p>
               <p>How did he get out of the house? - He pulled the door open.</p>
               <p>In what manner, when he left the counter, did he go out? - He went out in an instant, quite abrupt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Have you no reason to suspect that person in the shop? - I had not.</p>
               <p>You did not search her? - I did not.</p>
               <p>It is very extraordinary you should not see the watch go out; as that woman came to pawn things, she might be distressed for money.</p>
               <p>Court. Was she, when in the shop, near the counter, so as to have the watches within her reach? - She stood very near to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am entirely innocent of the fact.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the woman come in before him or after him? - She came in I believe after him.</p>

I am quite sure I saw it drop, and when I went out I passed that place, and saw the place quite clear; I told her she had no call to drop it, I was certain she had it; I gave it to the constable.</p>

            ; Mullen had forgot something, and went back to the coffee-house, and asked Warren for a direction where he should join them; this was just across the street; Warren gave him a direction to a house of which the last name of the firm was Johnson, and told him the street, and the number of the house; we went on, to go to the warehouse, and I asked him if it was far off; then we went on, and came to a public-house in Bunhill-row, kept by Fitshee; I asked him whether we were now near the warehouse; he said, just by, but he had some errand to call on at that public-house; he asked me in; he should not stop, he would not desire me to sit down; we went into the house, and Warren called for a room; I sat down at the head of the table, and Warren on my left, and the other on my right, who has escaped; they asked me to drink; they called for a glass of rum and water; I refused to sit down; before that was come, a stranger came, and begged pardon for coming in, but asked leave to sit down; that person was Oxton; he sat by, at a little distance, and began talking that he was very much fatigued with his journey, for he had come about ninety miles; he asked Warren, (who called himself Johnson, describing himself as the last person in the firm; he had heard my name in the coffee-room, and shook hands with me; glad he was to see his namesake, and would serve me still on lower terms:) Oxton asked Warren if he should be able to get him a porter, to shew him (Oxton) the other side of the water; he wished to get an honest man, for he was a man of property, that he might not be taken in by him, as being a stranger: Warren said to him, he did not appear to be a man of property; Oxton seemed to be affronted at this; he put his hands by the side of his coat, and pulled out a quantity of notes, in a shabby-looking pocketbook, and said, I have fourteen or fifteen hundred pounds, why do you talk so to me? A parcel of beggars and day-labourers, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080050"/>talk to me in such a stile! You cannot even shew me gold, instead of Bank notes! Warren took out of his pocket one or two guineas, and said, here is gold; says the man who escaped, I do not know whether I have gold or no, and pulled out a guinea or half a guinea; and Warren asked me if I had any gold; I told him I had got no gold, nor silver, except half-a-guinea: Oxton then said, I will hold you twenty pounds to ten, that you do not produce me an hundred pounds; this he said to Warren: Warren then asked me if I had got any notes about me; I told him I had not, but I had some bills on banks here, and I was going to purchase goods, and should draw the money that afternoon: Warren said he was going to the Bank this afternoon, and to do some business for the house, and to draw money; he seemed very glad, and said we will both go together; Warren had laid down the bet of 10 l. note, and Oxton laid down the 20 l. note, as they said it was, I did not examine it, and they were put into the other man's hands, and we went away to the bank together, I and Warren, according to agreement, and got the bill accepted for next day; Oxton and the other man staid in the public-house till we were to come back: Warren said, as we could not then be paid, what will you do now? I said it made no odds to me: he then advised me to go to some place and buy five pounds worth of goods, and they would give me the balance: I then said, I would call on Mr. Clark, an acquaintance of my own, and he probably would discount it: I did not know the distance, he said: we took a coach, and I told the coachman to drive to the Swan with Two Necks, and Waring called there for Mullen, and then we went to Mr. Clark's, and he discounted the bill; I desired him to stay there till I returned; when I came back, he was in Lad-lane; he asked me whether I had done my business, and got the money now: I told him I had got a check on Mr. Clark's banker, and was going to get the money; he seemed to be very glad; I asked Waring where he was going to draw his money, to make his shew; he said, I have done that, I have drawn three or four hundred pounds; he asked me what banker I had got the check upon; I told him; he asked me if I knew where it was; I told him no; he said he would go along with me; he did so; I presented the check, and was paid in four 20 l. Bank notes, nineteen guineas, and a shilling; this was paid in the presence of Warren: we came out of the Bank; Warren seemed very glad, and said, now we will take a coach; in the coach he told me he was a man of fortune, seven or eight hundred pounds a year, besides his business, and would serve me remarkably cheap; we found Oxton and the other man exactly as we left them, and sat down on the same seat, and Warren sat on my left, and Oxton asked Warren if he had done his business; he said he had. Warren and the other man asked me what I would drink; Oxton says, taste something now you have been out; he asked me to drink some wine and water; I did. I then told them I had occasion to go to the door; I was going out at the front door, and he pulled me by the coat, and said, here was a more private place, and I wished still to go out at the fore-door; they said this is the room, then they wished me to drink again. Oxton began talking, and said that last night he picked up a girl at Covent Garden, and went home with her, and there was a person in the house, and the supper not being ready, he and the person had amused themselves with chalking; Warren said to Oxton, let me see what chalking for money is; I know not what it is: Oxton says, if I had a piece of chalk, I would let you see. Oxton got a bit of chalk, I do not know where he got it, and laid his hat down; the other man was entertaining me about Scotch cattle, stating that he had formerly been a drover; then about two minutes they had a good scolding, Oxton and Warren had, and Oxton rose up to get away; and then Oxton said to Warren, can you let me see the money you promised to produce? Yes, Warren says, I can shew you money and more, and laid down his pocket-book and did not take out the notes;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080051"/>and says, Mr. Johnson, how many notes, or how much money have you got? I cannot positively recollect: he knew perfectly well what I had, and I think he said how much money I had; he desired me to take out my money; I then took out my pocket-book, and took out of it four twenty pound bank notes, the notes I had received at the banker's, and laid them down on the table, and my left-hand firm on the notes; my nineteen guineas in gold was in my right-hand pocket: Warren says, take out your gold; I then took out eighteen guineas and put it down, and had hardly counted it, while Oxton wished to get a hand of the money; my left hand was both upon the money and the notes; indeed both my right-hand and my left; I put the guineas on the notes, just by the edges; and while I put my right hand into my pocket to take out the gold, my left hand was on the notes, and I kept both my hands on the notes: Oxton then put up both his hands for the money; I did not know what he meant: Warren was on the right-hand, Oxton was at the foot, holding out both his hands for the money; Warren then lifted up my left hand to enable him to get the money by force: his right-hand was towards my left, he griped it up, and assisted Oxton with the money. He kept my hands with one hand, and shoved the money to Oxton; and the other man that has escaped, he took hold of the other hand, and assisted likewise. Warren swept it cross the table to Oxton, both the money and the notes; the other man assisted likewise, just as Warren did. Oxton took the money and notes right off the table, and put it into his pockets, and was going off with it to the door immediately, as quick as he could; the man on my righthand, who escaped, followed Oxton as fast as he could, and Warren was the last out of the room. I attempted to get out before him, and he pushed me back, till he got out. When he went out at the door, he shut the door after him as fast as he could: I lost sight of him till I opened the door, and I went after them; they all three went out at the outward street-door; I looked round me when I came out, and I saw Oxton running down the street as fast as he could. I saw the other two at the same time, Warren running the same way as Oxton; I observed perfectly where he run to; Warren went into some place and shut the door, but I still ran after Oxton; the other man ran a contrary way. I followed Oxton, and called out stop thief; a young lad took him hold by the tail of his coat: I come up to him in a very short time, the lad had him; this lad and another man was holding him when I came up to him: I laid hold of him by the breast, and brought him to Mr. Fitzhees public-house, where we were before, and into the same room, and he asked me what he had got of me; says I, four twenty pound notes, and eighteen guineas in gold; he acknowledged he had; and I said to him, give me my money this moment: yes, says he, I will give you your money, but I do not choose to do it before so many people. I ordered the people all out except six or seven: I shut the door upon them, I then come back to get my money of him: says I, give me my money now; he then said no, without that the whole of the people should go out; I then told him I would have my money directly; Oxton then put his hand into his breeches pocket, and took out the gold before these persons: he says, there is the gold, and was counting it on the table, and the constable was wanting to get in, and Oxton told me to let nobody in; the door not being open, the constable opened a window and got in, and asked what was the matter; then Oxton put the money into his pocket again; I told the constable what was done, he demanded the money, and Oxton refused to give it at all; he then seized him immediately, and took the money out of Oxton's pocket, four twenty pound notes, and the gold; he took the twenty pound notes from his right waistcoat pocket, I am not certain as to the gold. The constable then told him he must go to the Justice; and the constable and I, and two or three more, came out and had a coach, and conveyed him to a magistrate, and there he was committed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Have you been in town before? - No, never out of Scotland before.</p>
               <p>What became of Mullen? - He went home about a week after this happened.</p>
               <p>You knew the town; was not you recommended to any body in town? - No.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in town? - About four or five days before this happened.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - About twenty-four.</p>
               <p>You seemed to have closed your acquaintance with Warren very easily? - I took him to be a friend, to be sure.</p>
               <p>What made you take him to be a friend, only having that small opportunity of knowing any thing of him? - Because I did not presume that any body would do such a thing, whom I found at such a respectable coffee-house.</p>
               <p>When you went away from this public-house with Warren, what should lead you to discount your bill at this time? - Because I wished to draw my money from the banker's to buy goods.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it you returned to this public-house, before you saw Oxton? - Between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you mean to purchase articles that day? - I did positively.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go? - Because I could not get them out of the house.</p>
               <p>When you came back to this house, and had changed your note, you complied with Warren's request to go into the house; why did not you say, I cannot go into the house with you now? - He had this other man there that made up to him in the coffee-house, and he would call upon him before he would go.</p>
               <p>Then when he had an opportunity to go in and call upon his partner, what should induce you to go into the room, or to stay there; did you at all at that time, tell him you could stay no longer? - I did, I told him I did not choose to sit down at all.</p>
               <p>Why did you not choose it? - Because I wished to do my business.</p>
               <p>If you was determined to do your business, how came you to be such a fool as to take out this money? - Because I was attending upon Mr. Warren.</p>
               <p>What was there that induced you, wishing, as you did, to buy your goods, to have pulled out your money? - Because this man, Oxton, called us all beggars before.</p>
               <p>What should induce him to call you beggars? - Because he had so much property upon him.</p>
               <p>So that he was vapouring you were beggars, and not fit to compare to him, and that was the reason, you, in order to shew you was no beggar, went to the banker's to get this money? - I told him I was going to draw money in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>What induced you to tell him you was going to draw money in the afternoon? - I do not know what induced me, I did not think of any accident happening to me.</p>
               <p>What time was this conversation about beggars? - About eleven o'clock, or a little after.</p>
               <p>Did Warren join any part of that conversation? - Yes, he did; he seemed to be a stranger, and as if he had never seen Oxton before.</p>
               <p>You was willing to shew you was not a beggar? - Warren asked me if I had any money on me to shew we were not beggars.</p>
               <p>Was there any bet made between you on this discovery? - Yes, after that Oxton said, I will hold you twenty pounds to ten pounds a-piece, that you do not produce me a hundred pounds; that was to Warren: Warren said he had not got so much, and then asked me if I had got so much; I told him I had not got one pound, I had but half a guinea; I told him I was going to draw some money at the bank that night; but that would not do for the mean time.</p>
               <p>Now in consequence of this, did not you go to the Bank for the express purpose, in order that you might shew the sum about you? - I did not, it was not in consequence to produce the money there again that I went back again.</p>
               <p>What after you had got away from Oxton, what should lead you back again to this place? - Because Warren would call there before he went to the ware-room.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080053"/>Was any bet made between Oxton and and Warren? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you know you was coming back to this house in order to determine this bet? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>But you was going back to Oxton, had Warren got any money at that time; was Warren either to win the bet, in case of your producing the one hundred pounds, or his own producing one hundred pounds? - It was his own producing one hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Then Oxton challenged you both, that none of you, or altogether, could not produce an hundred pounds? - He did.</p>
               <p>Then you see, when you came back with the one hundred pounds, you could enable Warren to win the bet of twenty pounds, had you come on purpose for that? - No, but he desired me to take out the notes, to shew the man that we were not beggars.</p>
               <p>Now in the coach Warren began telling you the story about the chalking? - No, not in the coach; it was Oxton talked about it in the house.</p>
               <p>Oxton then and Warren shewed how the game was played among themselves? - I do not know as they played at all.</p>
               <p>What! did not Oxton and Warren play, or pretend to play, at this game of chalking? - I did not see the game at all, I saw Oxton chalking.</p>
               <p>When you came into the room, how were they situated that were left, and what did they say? - Oxton asked Warren if he had done his business; he said he had: Oxton then wished to sit at the end of the table.</p>
               <p>Did Warren then produce any notes? - No.</p>
               <p>What did Oxton do? - I then went out of the door, and did not know what they meant to be about, and I wished to ask the landlord about Oxton, because of the other two I had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go about your business and ask this question? - I went out on purpose, and Warren then followed me out to the door; I was going out at the fore-door, and he says, don't go that way, there is a privater place on the back way.</p>
               <p>Did this increase or diminish your suspicion; I should have thought that it was most probable, your suspicion would be extremely increased by Warren's wanting to keep you in the room? - Not at all, he did not wish to keep me in, only when I wanted to go out of the door.</p>
               <p>Having no resistance made to you, why did you not go from these people, and ask the landlord or landlady something about them? - I was coming in to do it, and passed the room-door, thinking Warren would have gone into the room again; and he takes hold of my coat, and said here is the room.</p>
               <p>I want to know why it was, when there was no absolute resistance made to you, and with these suspicions that you was with people that would possibly cheat you, that you did not get away from them? - Because the men were with me.</p>
               <p>So at length you did, notwithstanding your suspicions, come into the room with them again? - I had no suspicion at all of Warren and of the other man, my suspicion was of Oxton.</p>
               <p>When Warren and Oxton were describing the game of chalk, were they playing together? - I did not observe them playing.</p>
               <p>How long was this conversation with the pretended drover? - About three minutes.</p>
               <p>Had they made any chalk marks on the table? - Yes, they had.</p>
               <p>Did not they ask you to join in the game? - They did not at all; the other man and I were talking about Scotch cattle, and how he got his fortune.</p>
               <p>Was there no money staked on the table to play this game? - I did not see any money at all.</p>
               <p>You did not stake any money at all? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Nor win any money? - Nor win any at all.</p>
               <p>Was not your suspicion doubly increased when you saw these marks on the table? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>How long was it after this before you was induced to lay your notes on the table? - In a very short time.</p>
               <p>How came you to lay your notes down?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080054"/>- Because they disputed among themselves about the chalking; and then Oxton stood up, and seemed to take something amiss that Warren had said; and Oxton said to Warren, do what you promised, shew me the money; upon which Warren took out his pocket-book and said, there is money plenty.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect you was examined before the magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>What did you say there? - I said he took out his pocket-book.</p>


               <p>Only his pocket-book? - Only his pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Did you say at the magistrate's he took out nothing else? - He took it out, and opened it, and there seemed to be a large parcel of papers in it; he laid it down, and said to me, Mr. Johnson, how much money have you got? says I, you know perfectly well what I have got, because he was with me the same time when I drew the money.</p>
               <p>How did you proceed then? - I took the pocket-book out of my pocket, and took out the four twenty pound notes.</p>
               <p>Was not that on purpose to shew Oxton that you had so much money? - It was to be sure, and to shew Oxton I was not a beggar.</p>
               <p>Did you think there was any money in Warren's pocket? - I thought there was three hundred or four hundred pounds, I thought the English notes were all so as his appeared to be; I had never seen one in my life till that day I took the money from the Bank.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the magistrate on your examination, that Warren pulled out any notes? - I did not; the notes were in his pocketbook, and they had a large appearance.</p>
               <p>When was it you went to any body that you employed as a lawyer in this business? - I went to my friend Mr. Clarke that night, who was my particular friend; I went to him, and wished him to inform me how to behave, as I was a stranger.</p>
               <p>Did any body go with you? - The constable went with me.</p>
               <p>Was he the only person that directed you to an attorney? - The Justice directed me to an attorney.</p>
               <p>Did you employ the attorney whom the Justice directed you to? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Who is the gentleman that is employed by you here now? - Mr. Newman, I suppose you know the man.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the man to whom the Justice directed you? - I did, but the gentleman seemed to be engaged.</p>
               <p>Did the magistrate tell you that night, that he should look upon this as a felony? - He did.</p>
               <p>Now, if you please, we will go back to the public-house: during this time of chalking between these people, and Oxton's explaining the business to Warren, did not you join with them to wish to know what the game was? - No, I did not at all attend to that; we could not see at all.</p>
               <p>Of course then you will tell me that you did not play, or win any money at all? - I will tell you that plainly.</p>
               <p>And these men, Oxton or Warren did not play? - They did not play to my knowledge, Oxton was shewing how the person and him had behaved the night before.</p>
               <p>When this money was before you, did not Oxton pretend to have won this money? - He did not at all.</p>
               <p>What made you, when you produced the notes and guineas out of your pocket, to put your hand down on them; had you any suspicion? - No, I had not to be sure.</p>
               <p>What made you keep your hands down upon them then? - Because being in a house where I did not know where I was, I always should keep my hand on it.</p>
               <p>Having done this, then it did not strike you there was any danger in putting your money on the table? - I did not think it any danger at all.</p>
               <p>Did you think it safe? - I did.</p>
               <p>Would have thought it equally safe if you had put it on the middle of the table? - It would not have been so convenient to me, but I might have thought it equally safe.</p>
               <p>Would you have had any suspicion of Oxton in laying down your money? - I should not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080055"/>Why was it that you now describe your hand as placed upon this money covering your bank-notes and your guineas, and having no suspicion at all; was that the case? - I had no suspicion at all.</p>
               <p>Why was it that Oxton wanted the money any more than Warren? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>In fact, Oxton called out for the money? He did not call out at all.</p>
               <p>Did not he want the money? - He wanted the money to be sure, but he did not ask for it at all, not a word.</p>
               <p>Bless your soul, not ask a word! he counted this money; did not he? - Yes, because he got it.</p>
               <p>He said he had won it, did not he? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Did you yourself make any sort of a noise at this time? - Yes to be sure.</p>
               <p>What sort of a noise? - I wished to keep my money; I then thought he had no title to put his hand to my money.</p>
               <p>Did you call out for any assistance at this time? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You knew there was assistance near; you knew there was a landlord and a waiter? - There was some people in the house, but when my money was gone, I thought it was better get it back again.</p>
               <p>But you did not call out for any assistance at this time? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Why did not you? - Because I thought these men and the people of the house might be concerned together, and then what would become of me then? and so I thought it was better to get out.</p>
               <p>Then that suspicion instantly seized your mind, that the people of the house might be in confederacy with them, and therefore you would not call out? - Yes, it was so.</p>
               <p>When Oxton got out of the door, Warren wanted to keep you in; how came it he did not keep you? - I got out as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>When Oxton was gone out of the house, did you attempt to alarm the house? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>You say Warren was desirous of going too? - Yes, as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>What part of the house did you go through before you got into the street? - A small passage.</p>
               <p>How many people did you see in your way from the parlour? - I did not look at any people at all, because I wished to get out as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>How far was Oxton from the house? - About three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>When you told him you would have your money again, he acknowledged he had this money? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did not he say he won it? - He did not; he seemed very much frightened.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt but a man that has played a trick, would wish to give it up to get clear of it; however afterward he was in the very act of delivering this money to you when the constable came in? - Yes, he would have delivered the whole of the money.</p>
               <p>The constable, and the attorney, and the magistrate, all agreed in it, that to get the money back again, you must consider it as a felony, not as a fraud? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The conversation the gentleman alludes to, passed after you was bound over? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever stake or bet any money with these two men whatever? - No, none.</p>

I began to talk about trade, he said he wanted some hardware; I said I thought I could suit him; me and another person went down to Basinghall-street, and had sixpenny worth of rum and water; we went from this house to the Crown in Bunhill-row, there we had six-penny-worth more, I believe it was rum and water, but I am not positive. We got into conversation, Johnson said he was not a poor man, so we laid a wager; Johnson laid us all three a wager that we could not produce 100 l. a piece, in the course of one hour; I put down 20 l. for me, and Mr.

Scotch bills, which he has omitted to tell you of, which I never saw before, therefore I put down the 20 l. we put down 100 l. a-piece; he put into my hand a draft for 50 l. we went to Moorfields for a coach, and went to Lombard-street for 65 l. there he got his bill honoured; he begged exceedingly hard of the banker's clerk to get that bill discounted; the clerk said he could not do it, except he found some person that they knew; Johnson still urged very much, and offered to pay any premium; but he would not do it: then we took coach to go to Lombard-street, and then to the Strand, to Mr. Coutts a banker; then Johnson said, I think I can do my business, I owe a tradesman some money, and he will let me have cash for the 100 l. says I, that will save you all the trouble. We came down to the Swan with two Necks in Lad lane: says I, I am afraid we shall be past the time of the wager for the 20 l. says he, never mind, if it is half an hour, it will make no difference? says he, you stop here, and I will go to my friends; he went and came back again; says I, well have you got your bill honoured; yes, says he, I have 100 l. check on their banker; you must go with me: I did so; we took coach again, we went to No. 12, in Birchin-lane; there he got four 20 l. banknotes, nineteen guineas and a shilling: we came back in the coach, there was Oxton and the other man in the room; the chalk was put on the table, and the other man brought the money; so then there was a piece of chalk on the mantle-piece; we began playing, I won a guinea; there was A, B, C, and D on the table; I began playing with Oxton for six penny worth of rum and water, which I won; I then played him myself for half a guinea, that I won also; I had my odds of the game, which was four to one against him; I wanted to give Oxton his guinea again; after that I shewed Oxton the odds of the game, he was to turn his back, and to name a figure, which was four to one against him; I referred to Johnson, says I, it is a pity to keep this man's money, I will give it him again, for if he had the Duke of Bedford's estate he would lose it: says Johnson, no, damn it, keep it, he would keep yours: so then Oxton says, I will go back to them gentlemen and play them all round; says I, then you may as well lay them a guinea a-piece: I put down one guinea to Johnson, he covers that, and puts a guinea to another man that is absent, the same three guineas we won, we all three won a guinea of Johnson; then Oxton said, I could make a letter any way, and he would not play if I made the letter, but if I would let that man make it, referring to Johnson, he would play for 100 l. a piece; Oxton turned his back, and Johnson makes the letter D, and Oxton come to name the letter, and instead of putting down 100 l. he put down eighteen guineas, and four 20 l. notes; he made the letter D, and Oxton turns his back, that is one of the four letters, and he came forward and named the letter right, and Oxton came and named the D, then he lost his money: there were four letters made separate, A, B, C, and D; then in order to game, you must name one of the four, he was to turn his back, and I was to make one of those four letters, and he was to come forward and name the one I had made, which was put under the bowl: I made an A, and put the bowl upon it; then I laid him six-penny-worth of rum and water that he named the wrong. Oxton won the 100 l. then Johnson wanted to play on cards, he would not play with him, because he had no more money.</p>

               <p>I have nothing to say but on the same ground as this man says; this man I understood was a person that got a good deal of money, and he wished to engage in playing with me, after he lost the money; when he came back to the public-house he says, give me my money again, I did not understand the game, and go about your business;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080058"/>when we came back into the room, all the chalks were on the table, which was A, B, C, D; and the letter A and the letter D, which Johnson made while he put down his money: Johnson said when we came into the street that I had cheated him; I told him I had won it very fair, and would keep it; he would not have given me my money if I had lost it: I said I would rather go before a magistrate. He never said any thing about a robbery, till we came before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to my house, No. 56, Bishopsgate Without, on Monday the 25th of April; I am sure it was the the 25th, it was Easter-Monday, he came to acquaint me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080060"/>that he had a parcel of hair to dispose of; I then asked him when I could see them; he said not until after his holidays, then he would bring them; he mentioned the quantity to be about an hundred, or an hundred and an half: soon after he was gone I received this hand-bill, and he was taken the next morning.</p>

             being in the hospital? - Yes, he came in the 30th of March, and was discharged the 13th of April.</p>
               <p>What was his complaint? - A complaint in his side and his head, no wounds.</p>
               <p>He was attended I suppose by the faculty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner, and see if he is the man? - That is the man, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>And are you sure he came in the 30th of March, and was discharged the 15th of April? - Yes, a better man I never wish to see; I wish I was always treated as well by every man as by him; if I had twenty oaths I would swear it was the same.</p>
               <p>That is an additional reason for your remembering him.</p>
               <p>Court. Does not it appear by the books of the hospital, the time of the dismission, and the time of the discharge? - I sent him to the steward for the discharge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Your Lordship sees the indictment charges it to be committed on the 7th, which could not be.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the nature of the prisoner's disorder such as confined him to the hospital, and that he could not go out occasionally? - Certainly, the hospital confines them to it, they will not let them go out.</p>
               <p>Are those that are in the hospital so confined? - Not without leave of the surgeon or physician, or by a discharge.</p>
               <p>But such a leave would be on application given? - Yes, if he asked it, but he never did.</p>
               <p>How do you know? - Because I should have known, because he was under a particular gentleman, that is Doctor Pitcairn, and if he had said he had wanted to go out, the doctor would have said, let the sister know when you go out and when you come in.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear here that this prisoner at the bar was never out of the hospital from the 1st of April to the 8th? - Not to my knowledge he was not.</p>
               <p>But he might without your knowledge? - He went down stairs to fetch provisions, we give them leave to do that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080061"/>How many persons have you under your care? - Fifteen.</p>
               <p>Can you give an account of every thing these fifteen persons did during that week? - When I am present I can, but not otherwise.</p>
               <p>Do you believe that that man was in the hospital without going out, from the 1st of April to the 8th? - He was to my knowledge, I know we sent him down stairs, he had his linen washed in the place, so he did not go out for it.</p>

            , with his pistol, threatning them, and the mate came up to our assistance, and we got to Jones's, and they throwed stones and glass bottles at us all the way, and the gentleman Edwards came up with a cutlass, now, damn your eyes, says he, now will you shoot me? I said yes, unless he would keep off; he said, I will cut you down like a bullock, you b - g - r; he held up his cutlass towards me, and then he went down lower out of my sight; the mob was all surrounding the house, heaving the stones through the window, and broke all the glass windows outside, and through the casement of glass belonging to the parlour where I was; they kept heaving stones continually till night.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was this? - I believe it was about from two or three o'clock till the candles were lighted.</p>
               <p>What happened to you personally at this time? - My arm was quite black, and they cut my leg with a stone, that I could not walk to the cutter, but was obliged to be carried.</p>
               <p>What else did you see Edwards do? - I saw him do no more; soon after I got into Jones's parlour, I saw the prisoner Balless come to the window and say, you may as well give yourself up, for you shall never go home alive; he had got a large stone in his right hand, but I did not see him heave it, but he had got it in his hand, and there might be above two hundred people near him at the time: I did not see him do any more.</p>
               <p>What became of the liquor that had been carried out of Jones's house? - They did not take any out of Jones's house, it was so secured.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it before this was well over? - I cannot tell what it was o'clock, it was just dark, and the candles were alight, I had directions to three other houses, but neglected to search.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Prisoner's Counsel. The mob first collected about at Prouse's house, and from thence you was driven about one hundred and fifty yards; how long do you think the mob was surrounding you before you got to Jones's house? - It might have been an hour.</p>
               <p>Did not you drink at Jones's house? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You are sure you did not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was three years ago? - Yes, better than three years ago; I knew the house where Balless lodged, he lived on the Causeway.</p>
               <p>Did any of your officers stay behind? - Yes, I was taken to the cutter, being disabled.</p>
               <p>I believe Balless and you had had some quarrel since this matter happened? - No, no quarrell.</p>
               <p>Was not you drunk once, and threatened him with your cutlass? - I attempted to duck him once; I suppose you would wish to know the truth, I attempted to duck him in Cawsand, and I caught him by the collar, he tried to heave me down, and he snatched the cutlass, and ran away with it; that cutlass was returned to me by the surveyor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080063"/>coming over to demand it; it was returned by the woman he lived with: I say I was not drunk at that time, I am sure I was not.</p>
               <p>Had you never said to the defendant Balless, that you knew no harm of him, and could swear nothing against him? - I said he never did me any harm, for a good reason, because he could not; he strove all he could do do it.</p>
               <p>Now could not he have thrown that stone at you at the time? - Yes, but he could not have hit me, for I had nothing to do but defend myself; I think if he could have hit me with it, it would have been very agreeable to himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. It is a desperate undertaking to attempt to take one of these men in Cawsand? - Yes, without it is in day-light, and you know them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you one of the assistants to the mate of the Eagle, the 31st of January? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You went to make this seizure? - I was at Prouse's house, we went into his house, down stairs in the cellar, and we proceeded to make a seizure, I believe I took the first keg out, and Mr. Bradley desired me to go up to Jones's, they were all got up, four or five, and I heard a cry that the men had got Felton upon the green; then I took my pistols and went into the middle of the men; there were one hundred and fifty or two hundred smugglers assembled about Felton, the place was full, and May had hold of Felton by the collar; then I gave him a stripe with my stick, immediately the stones began to fly like shot, as thick as hail, at Felton, and the rest of the officers; when he got round the corner, I had four or five stones on my back, I did not see either of the prisoners at that time; I saw both the prisoners at one time, one of them had a stone in his hand, that was the prisoner Balless, he was doing nothing with it; I asked him what he was going to do with it, and if he did not put it down I would fire at him; then he dropped it; I did not know him before: I called him Brisk, a man said, mind what names you are speaking; then I thought it was not the same man; I saw him two or three minutes afterwards, I am sure he is the man; I saw the other prisoner looking into the window with a cutlass in his hand, holding it up, and he said he would be damned but he would have me out, and cut me down; we were prevented from effecting our purpose; we had three houses more to search. I tasted the liquor at Prouse's, it was brandy and gin; the windows were all broke in, with the discharge of the stones from the smugglers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, another of the Prisoner's Counsel. You stated that there were a great number of persons present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The only person that had a stone in his hand was Balless? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The moment you desired him to put it down, he did put it down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not Balless, at the time you challenged him with the stone, say, he was going to do nothing with it, and drop it down directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said you did not know Balless before? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you known him since? - I have seen him since, many times since.</p>
               <p>This happened in 1788? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you not drank with him in a friendly manner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you drink with him that very afternoon after this took place? - I was in the Black Bull when he came, I had a pint of porter before me, he partook of the porter with me.</p>
               <p>Did not Edwards speak out so loud, that every body might have heard him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you ever any warrant against Balless, when you was in the public-house? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Attorney General. You are the Comptroller of the Customs at the port of Plymouth? - Yes. On the night of the 30th of January, 1788, a large smuggling cutter, by the name of the Revenge, was stranded on Kingston-beach; early the next morning I was informed of it, and went to secure the property: in the afternoon of the day about two, I received a message from Mr. Bradley, mate of the excise cutter, saying that he had made a seizure of a quantity of spirits, and was presently opposed by a large mob, and begged for God's sake, I would go to his assistance: I went; when I came up in the square, before the house of Jones the victualler, I saw a mob of people, to the amount of two hundred: the windows were broke presently, I saw Bradley, I made the best of my way to him through the mob with my men: the mob appeared to be very outrageous, and Mr. Bradley appeared to be very much agitated: I went with Mr. Bradley into the house, there I saw Felton, with (I think) a brace of pistols presented towards the door, he was very much agitated; the mob was still riotous, I saw the prisoner

             was a black silk-dyer in Spitalfields, that the prisoner had formerly lived with him as a servant or journeyman. On the 7th of December last, about eighty pounds weight of raw silk was taken by 
               <persName id="o17910608-1-person500">

            , then a journeyman, to his own house, and delivered by him to his wife, Mrs. Purser, and who received this silk; she deposes, that on the 17th of December, after she had received this silk, the prisoner came to her house, and applied to her for eight pounds of silk, to take to a Mr. Hacker's, who dyed colours, and she told him, she had not so small a quantity; upon which the prisoner said that it was to be eight pounds weight of that silk wharpe she had had that morning delivered to her; and that Mr. Hacker, a dyer of colours, had sent for it to Mr. Desormeaux, and his son had sent the prisoner to her for the silk. She then asked him if he was sure he was sent, he then produced this warrant or order; which is set forth in the indictment, informing her at the same time, that the son of the prosecutor had sent him with that order; she also swore, that understanding that the son was an apprentice to his father, the prosecutor, and managed the father's business in his absence, she gave him the goods, and he received them. She also said, that at the time, she believed the prisoner had been seen by the son, and the name to the warrant or order, was his hand-writing; she did not at that time attend to the spelling of the name, nor did she know how he did spell it, for the name on the order was Desamoacks, and the name of the prosecutor was Desormeaux. She said she gave him the silk on the credit of the said note, about seven pounds ten ounces, and she proved the warrant or order, which warrant or order was proved by the prosecutor's foreman and son not to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>This seems to be the evidence in this case, and after the evidence had been gone through, the Counsel for the prisoner took several objections on the act of parliament, and also on the form of the indictment; and this being a new case, sentence was respited in order to take the opinion of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080068"/>twelve Judges, whether the warrant or order as stated in the indictment, was a warrant or order against the statute.</p>
               <p>The Judges have taken this case into their very serious and deliberate consideration, and they have had more than one conference upon it. On the result of which they are of opinion,</p>
               <p>First, that on the construction of this statute, on which the prosecution is founded, that the warrant or order for the delivery of the goods, must be either by the owner, or the person who has the disposing power to do it. This judgment on this subject was supported by a variety of cases, as in Mitchell's case in King William the third's reign, and in Jones's case in the Old Bailey, from which they thought that the warrant or order must be directed to the holder, or to the person interrested in, or having the possession of the goods. But in this case, by this warrant or order, set forth in this indictment, it was not directed to any person whatever, for the whole of the warrant is, Please to send by the bearer eight pounds of that wharpe unmarked, L. Desamoacks, without giving any direction to any person whatever. On that ground they were of opinion, that this case, in this indictment, could not be supported.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they were of opinion that this indictment was informal, for it ought to be stated in the indictment, that the person subscribing his name had an authority to do it; and in this case it is only to be collected by an infant whose name is Desormeaux, that such a servant had such an authority, and therefore we were all of opinion, that an express authority ought to have been alledged: on this ground <rs id="o17910608-1-punish260" type="punishmentDescription">
