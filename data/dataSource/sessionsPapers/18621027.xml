I am the wife of Mr. Charles Newton, of Harringay-house, Hornsey—on the morning of 3d September I came down at half-past 6 o'clock—I was the first down—I found all the doors open leading into the back yard; there were fourteen doors in number open, with the room doors and back doors; there were two doors leading to the back yard—the doors of the house were all open except the hall door—I missed articles to the I amount of about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—this workbox (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is worth about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is my property; it was in the drawing-room the night before—the things that were missing were taken from various parts of the house—the two doors I found open were the only two back doors which lead into the yard; there is another door leading into the conservatory—there were some candles which had been taken from the morning-room and burnt in the drawing-room—we searched to see whether there were any traces of how the entry was effected; we suppose some one was secreted downstairs in the billiard-room; there were marks of pressure under the table—this handkerchief is one of a dozen that were taken; it is my property; it was on the library table the night before—all the doors were locked the night before; I know that as a fact myself; I always examine them myself; in the passage upstairs I always look—they were all locked the kitchen back door, I cannot say about that, it was closed, but all the other doors I am positive were locked—I found the kitchen door and all open.</p>

I was a servant of Mr. Newton's on 3d September—in consequence of what I heard, I made a search round the premises, and found the ivory workbox now produced—I went into the field from the front of the conservatory, and there I tracked some footsteps; there was dew on the ground—those footsteps led through a hedge; on the other aide of the hedge there was a heap of rubbish, and there I found this ivory work-box underneath it; it was quite underneath the heap of rubbish.</p>

In consequence of information I re<lb/>ceived, I, with another constable, Gall, went to watch this workbox; it was concealed under some rubbish on the prosecutor's premises—we went to watch about 7 o'clock, and about a quarter past 9 the prisoner and another man came direct across the field to the heap of rubbish—I saw the prisoner stop down, take the rubbish off, and take the workbox and try to place it in a leather bag which the other man held—we pounced upon them at the time, and both men ran away—I made after the prisoner, and my brother officer went after the other—after the prisoner had run a little way I took him into custody—he spoke first to me, and asked what I was going to do with him—I told him I was not going to do anything with him provided he would go to the police-station with me—he went along about the distance of one hundred yards quietly, when I had to open a gate; he then threw me up behind, and fell on the top of me—we had a desperate struggle, and I got the best of him—I tried to get my hand round his throat, and he seized my finger in his mouth, and drew the flesh from the nail to the first joint—it drew the flesh and nail right off; I have a new nail now—I then got my staff out of my pocket—I felt very faint and sick—he drew a knife out of his pocket, or from under him, in some way or other, and stabbed me—he at first pricked me a little way at the back part of my head; in a few minutes, as we were lying on the ground, he got it in dagger fashion, and gave me a desperate stab in another place—I felt very faint, and he got away—I went after him again, and just as I got to him I slipped down; he instantly turned round and said, "You b——, that will do for you now," and gave me another desperate stab in the head in the same dagger fashion—the three cuts were all within about an inch of the same place—I halloed out "Help" and "Murder," and my brother constable came to my assistance, and took the prisoner into custody; I was almost insensible at the time; I lost a great deal of blood—I am not out of the doctor's hands yet; this is the first time I have had my uniform on—I am not able to do duty yet.</p>

I was on duty at the Hornsey Station on the night of 3d September—the prisoner was brought there—his face was pretty nearly covered with blood—I took off his hat to look at the nature of the wound, and in doing so I felt something rattle in his hat, and I found this knife inside the lining of his hat—this is the hat (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I examined the knife; there was blood on the large blade; it was wet fresh blood.</p>

I am a gas-fitter, at 108, Fore-street, City—on 20th September, about a quarter to 9 in the evening, I was coming down Snow-hill with my wife and child—my wife was a few feet in advance of me; I had hold of my child's hand—I had my watch with me—as we came to the corner of George-yard, opposite a baker's shop, a man laid himself down across the pavement, with his feet in the gutter, and his head towards the shop window, leaving sufficient room for one person to pass between his head and the shop—the prisoner spoke to my wife; I came up at the time—he preteuded to be helping the man in the pretended fit, and as he spoke I heard a click, and saw my chain go—I turned round and said, "You vagabond" he said, "I have not got it, sir," and ran away through Fox and Knot-court into West-street—I did not lose sight of him a moment till I left him locked up—he ran into the policeman's arms—I am positive the prisoner is the man—I have not recovered my watch.</p>

I would not have drawn it"—I trusted them with that, and Dailey then called for a pint—he gave me sixpence, and I gave him threepence change—Maher then called for another pint, but I said, "No"—he put his hand into his pocket, and said, "You draw it; I will pay you"—I drew it, and he put down a shilling, which I found was</p>

I am the manager of the Tees Woollen Company, carry<lb/>ing on business at Barnard Castle, in the county of Durham—Thompson, Richardson, and Co. form part of the company—a person named Thompson is an agent of the company in London—he has an office at 17, Ironmonger-lane—he was appointed agent in August or September, 1861—he had authority to open accounts with persons in London—among other persons with whom he opened accounts was a person named Cowan, carrying on business at 12, Union-court, Old Broad-street—I have been to that offices; there are two rooms—between the 1st and 19th August, inclusive, goods to the amount of 504<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., were supplied to Cowan, as against, I believe, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., credit—on 1st August, I sent goods to the amount of 368<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., minus discount; and, on 19th August, I sent goods to the amount of 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making 504<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—on 7th August, Cowan came to me at Barnard Castle—he asked for further goods; he said they were for a house in Paris that he represented—he said he would pay 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if they were sent to London—he said the house in Paris was a large cash house; that they paid cash in twenty-eight days, less 2 1/2 discount—Cowan met with the directors—they refused to increase the account, except to a very small amount—we said we would send the goods if he paid money on account—he offered to pay 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or more—I received this letter on the llth—it is in Cowan's handwriting—it is dated from Edinburgh—(<hi rend="italic">This being read, requested the goods to be forwarded at once, with the addition of ten pieces of second quality</hi>)—in consequence of that letter, I forwarded to London, next day, two bales of tweed, addressed to him at his office—the| two bales of second quality were not sent—the value of the two bales was 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—I sent no invoice with the goods—on 13th August, I came to London to the Waverley Hotel—I saw Cowan there that morning—he said the goods had not arrived—he said he had bought largely in Paisley, and was not able to fulfil his engagement as to the payment of the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—he said, should he fail in meeting the engagement, I might hold the goods to my order when they arrived—I do not think I saw the prisoner on the 13th—on the 14th I saw Cowan again at 10 o'clock in the morning; he said the goods had not arrived—I saw him a second time that day; he then said they had arrived; that he had sent them to his Packer—the prisoner called a little after Cowan's second visit—I went to Lumley's with Cowan, upon something that appeared to be business at the time; and when we came back to the Waverley, the prisoner was waiting there, as if</p>

               <p>to meet him by appointment—we then went to Cowan's office to see what money could be procured, Cowan and the prisoner walking before me, apparently consulting—Cowan first gave me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—he then asked the prisoner how much money he had paid away that day—the prisoner apparently looked over his books, and said from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—Cowan then asked the prisoner how much money he had in hand—the prisoner said two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Bank of England notes—I got that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—Cowan then asked the prisoner to take a receipt stamp, and go to Mr. Something, I did not catch the name, and ask for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for Mr. Cowan—the prisoner came back in about ten minutes, and presented the gentleman's compliments to Mr. Cowan, and stating that he paid only once a month—the prisoner said, "You know, Mr. Cowan, these large houses will not make an entry of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I went again on Friday, the 15th August—I went purposely to get Cowan's receipt that the goods were held by him at his packers to my order—I asked him for it—I then had perfect confidence in his honesty—the prisoner was there, out and in—I would not swear that he was there at the time I asked Cowan for his receipt—Cowan said he was a business man and the proper way was to have the packer's receipt, to which I agreed—we then went into the large apartment, and I am certain the prisoner was then present—Cowan said, "We will go and get the receipt," meaning the packer's receipt—I then left the court by the right-hand and they by the left—I went back to the Waverley—they left together—about twenty minutes afterwards they came together to the Waverley—they both came into the smoking-room—I believe Cowan brought the receipt; whether it was in his hand or not I will not swear, but my impression is that he carried it in his hand at the time he came into the smoking-room—I went out of the smoking-room with Cowan into the coffee-room—the prisoner stayed in the smoking-room—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the receipt—he said it was the packer's receipt—it is dated 14th August (<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "25, Jewry-street, Aldgate; received from Mr. James Walker, two bales of goods, which are at his disposal. Billengay and Co., paid carriage"—the words "paid carriage," are my writing—it is a mere memorandum—after I had received the receipt the prisoner and Cowan left together—I never saw them again until the prisoner was taken into custody—in the early part of September I went to the office in Union-court—I did not find either Cowan or the prisoner there—I did not go up stairs—there were a number of gentlemen in the lobby, or on the stairs, apparently creditors—I afterwards saw some of the goods at Mr. Venables'—on 4th September, I sent this telegram—"James Walker, Barnard Castle, to Henry Cowan; say prompt by telegram when you will be here or remittance may be expected; why not here, Saturday?"—the first visit on the 14th was near 10 o'clock—the second was between 1 and 2—on the 15th when I went to the office it might have been about 4 in the afternoon—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are part of the goods made by us—they are not part of those that were sent between 1st and 19th August—they are connected with a sale to Cowan on 5th June, through Mr. Thompson, the agent.</p>

               <p>he was—the goods were delivered on the 14th—Mr. Cowan came for the money shortly after the goods were delivered—in fact, I saw Cowan before I saw the goods—the goods came within two hours after the prisoner had concluded the bargain with me—I don't know what they were delivered in—I saw them after they had been delivered in my warehouse—we have trusses constantly delivered—they were unpacked when I saw them opened out—I gave instructions to our young men to bring the goods for me to see—when I first saw the goods they were all unpacked—I do not know how the invoice price that was made out to me was arrived at—of course I valued them; it is not likely I should buy goods without putting a value upon them—Cowan quoted the price, and I said, "It is no use my looking at these goods at this price; these prices are perfectly ridiculous"—he said, "I will take you a discount off"—I said, "What discount?"—he said, "Twenty-five"—I said, "That won't do; I could not sell them at the price"—I was going to leave the goods—he persuaded me to buy them, as he wanted the money—I had not seen the invoice that came from the Tees Company in the first instance—I have not seen it now—I do not know how it is that the invoice corresponds with the other—I did not see it at the time; but previous to completing the first transaction I asked Cowan to give me satisfaction that everything was correct, and I wished to know that he regularly dealt in woollens—he said he did, and he went to his desk, pulled out two or three invoices, and said, "See there, I deal regularly in woollens; and for further reference I refer you to Messrs. Spielman, my bankers; they will give you every satisfaction as to my respectability"—I went there, and the answer was perfectly satisfactory—those were the only two parcels I bought of him—I paid a commission to the prisoner on a third parcel of goods—my brother bought them during my absence in the North—I did not pay that money to the prisoner—I did not agree with the prisoner about it—the third transaction was not with me—it was a similar transaction to the others—that was on 23d August—it was not a trans<lb/>action of mine, it was my brother's—I paid the prisoner the commission myself—I paid him the commission on the two amounts together, of the 14th and 23d—I find in our petty cash-book two amounts of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., each entered to him for commission—altogether I paid 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., commission to him—that was on the three parcels—when I went to Cowan's office, I do not recollect seeing any other woollen goods there except those I bought—he told me that he was an importer of French and German goods and optical instruments, and he exported British goods—I fancy I know the value of goods, and the market from which they come—I knew the description of goods that these were.</p>

Q.</hi> Are these sort of purchases customary in the trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They frequently occur—the prisoner came to me in the usual way as an agent, or intermediate party between myself and the principal—very respectable firms have at times sold under the invoice price, and if they had not done it they would have been insolvent—the prisoner did not bring a sample the first time—he told me the goods were Tweeds, trouserings—he at once mentioned Mr. Cowan's name and address, and I went and saw him—I arranged with Cowan about the price, in the private office—the prisoner was present only a portion of the time; while we arranged the price he was not present—he was in and out—he was not there the whole time the negotiation was going on—Cowan did not show me the invoice of the goods; he told me the price—that was before he made out this invoice—he quoted the prices as I looked over the goods—I said at once I could not pay that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270018"/>
               <p>price; it was a ridiculous price—I refused the goods at 30 per cent of, and was going to leave the office, and then he consented to take off 35—it was after that that the invoice was made out, after I left the office—it was made out at the original price that he asked me, and then the 35 per cent deducted—I believe it was made out by Cowan—I should say it was his writing—he presented the invoice when he applied for the money that day at my place—no invoice was made out while I was at his office; at least it was not handed to me then—Cowan came for the money one or two hours afterwards—the prisoner came into the shop—I don't know whether he went into the counting-house—I believe Cowan and I were alone in the counting-house—it was then that he presented the invoice—the 35 per cent. was taken off, and I paid him the money—I gave him a cheque and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in gold—on 14th October, the second transaction, the prisoner came with samples, in the same way as at first, and Cowan came with him and brought the goods—I feel almost certain that the prisoner was with him—Cowan came within one or two hours after the prisoner had been first; I can't say the exact time—Cowan came directly after the goods arrived—the first I knew of the arrival of the goods was when Cowan presented me the invoice—I am speaking of the second trans<lb/>action—he came and brought the invoice, and said he would accept the price—I don't know who brought the goods—I saw the prisoner afterwards in the shop—I saw Cowan first—I don't know whether the goods had arrived before Cowan came—the same thing happened as on the first day; he deducted the thirty-five per cent., and I paid him the money in the counting house; my brother was present—the prisoner was not there at the time I paid Cowan—I gave him a cheque—the two sums of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., paid to the prisoner for commission, were paid from the petty cash—I should think it was paid about the 5th or 6th August—the commission on the second transaction, I think, was paid about the 28th—the reference to the banker was quite satisfactory to me, and it appears that it was quite satisfactory to the Tees Woollen Company—in a transaction with a stranger, I should always make an inquiry—since this we have purchased goods of the Tees Woollen Com<lb/>pany, through their agent—I have bought precisely the same goods as those I bought of Cowan, and I bought them considerably under the price that Cowan asked me; they offered them at from twenty to forty per cent, less than Cowan asked me—I could have purchased precisely the same sort of goods at nearly the same price that I paid Cowan—I did purchase some at a less price than I paid Cowan—I purchased three pieces at the average of about twenty-five per cent; if I had cleared the lot they offered me, I be<lb/>lieve they would have averaged over thirty-five per cent less than they sold them to Cowan—those I bought of the Company averaged less than those I bought of Cowan, less than the price Cowan asked—that was ten per cent higher than the price I paid Cowan, but they offered me other goods as high as forty per cent. less than Cowan's price—the prices of these goods fluctuate according to the exigencies of the trade, and what suits one man's trade does not suit another—in one month they are frequently twenty per cent. cheaper—at the present time I could buy fancy goods like these at twenty-five per cent. less than I could two months ago.</p>

I certainly did go into the first public-house, and have a glass of ale, and I called for a pint of half-and-half in the second. I paid with the first coin that came up in my pocket, and did not know it was bad. I was in deep conversation concerning business, and put it down carelessly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Barnham, of Zion-lane, Isleworth, and am the mother of the deceased Ann Jane Barnham—I have known the prisoner rather better than four years—he was married to the deceased on 29th September, 1858, in the name of Charles Robert Cope<lb/>land—she lived with him as his wife for some time, up to about eighteen months ago—they had two children; one is alive, and one is dead; the name of the one who is living is Mary Ann—my daughter went home to her grandfather and grandmother, who brought her up—she did not take her maiden name again, but she was called by that name through the vil<lb/>lage; she always went by the name of Barnham—I remember the 7th August last—the prisoner came to my house the afternoon before that, and stayed there that afternoon, had tea with me, and waited until my father came home from his work at the Duke of Northumberland's; he said that Annie and my mother were coming—my daughter was not at home when the prisoner came, she was at Richmond helping her sister do her work—she came home it might be from 6 to 7 o'clock—we have no clock; my father leaves the Duke of Northumberland's, which is about a mile off, at 6 o'clock, and when he came in he said that Annie and my mother were coming—the prisoner went into the washhouse—he was there when she came in—I went to the washhouse and called him out; he was doing something with his back towards me—he came out, and my mother came in at the time—she told him not to come there to up set her child, as she called her, for she said she had told her about his ill-treatment to his first wife, who he had married thirteen years ago—she told him to leave the house as he had upset her so the night before, telling her that he had married his first wife thirteen years ago, and that he would write and ascertain the rights of it whether she was alive or dead—my daughter told him that she could not trust him any more, and she had made up her mind that she would not live with him again, as his brother had told her he had had wives before, and that a policeman might come at any moment and take him as a deserter from several regiments, and she had made up her mind to stay with her grand<lb/>mother, and do the best she could for herself and child—he went across the room, took her by the hand, and said, "Then we will part mutual, Annie; I shall marry another woman; will you interfere with me if I do?"—she said, "No, I never will, if you will let me rest in peace;" she said, "I am a wife, and no wife"—they seemed very comfortable and quiet then, and he left the house very quietly—he left alone—I am speaking now of the Wed<lb/>nesday evening; the murder happened on the Thursday, the 7th—on the Thursday the prisoner came to my house after dinner; he came alone; he asked me where Annie was—I told him she was gone to Richmond to help her sister do her work, with my mother, and she would return with her—he stayed there that afternoon and had tea with me—he took some letters from his coat pocket, and a likeness of Annie, and showed me the likeness, and asked me if I knew it—I said, "Yes, it is Annie; there she is"—he said, "Yes," and he would not harm a hair of her head, for she had been a good girl to him; he put it back in his pocket again—he stayed there till she came home from Richmond, and then he went up on the top of the railway steps that lead to the top of the road—my mother told him to go away, or she would give him up to the police for desertion—I went out at the door, and beckoned to him to go away, and I would come down the lane to him—my daughter Annie said, "Wait a moment, mother, I will put on my boots and go down the lane; if I don't, grandmother will give him up"—we went down the lane, and halfway down the lane there is a turn that brings you across</p>

               <p>where the neighbours were looking at the riflemen shooting; I went down there, and met the prisoner at the bottom; he was looking over at the rifle<lb/>men shooting—I left my daughter talking to some women, and went across the road to Mr. Blackburn's to fetch a pint of beer—when I came back with the beer my daughter, the prisoner, and my father, were all standing talking together; we all four drank out of the beer—my daughter then turned on the Hounslow-road to go to Hounslow; the prisoner followed her, and I turned round the corner and watched them—that was the last I saw of her that night; I never saw her again alive; I saw her the following morning, dead, at the union workhouse—some months before, I remember seeing the prisoner at Chelsea—I found three bullets which were left in his waistcoat-pocket—I showed them to my daughter—the prisoner was not there at the time, he came home at dinner-time; I showed them to him when he came home—my daughter told me that he brought them home for us—she said, "Charley brought these home from, Ireland, and said one was for you, one for me, and one for the first man that took him"—I showed them to him, and he made no remark about them at all; he only laughed.</p>

I am landlord of the Swan, at Isleworth—I remember hearing of the death of Annie Barnham, on Thursday, 7th August—on the Monday before that, the prisoner came and engaged a bed—he did not sleep there that night, or Tuesday night; he slept there on the Wednesday night—he had a bag with him—on the Thursday morning he left the house, and left the bag in the room where he had slept—he never returned—he had not engaged the room for any time; only by the night—he told me the bag might be left till Saturday; it might be called for; but nobody called for it—he had not told me, on the Thursday morning, whether he was coming back, or not—I did not know whether he was coming back or not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The following letter was put in and read:</hi> "Isleworth, Wednesday evening. I am wretched, indeed. I am sorely depressed. I love my dear Annie. How can I see her with another man night after night, and pro<lb/>mising me that she never do go with another man; but when I met her at 12 o'clock, or rather 1 o'clock, on Tuesday morning, arm-in-arm with another, and a little the worse for liquor, and when I accosted her, and she did not scarcely notice me, my blood at the very moment curdled, my brains were hot with passion, and Satan, that goes about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour, I am his victim, and may the Lord have mercy. Oh, I cannot bear to live to see my dear, dearest Annie, that I love better than my own life. Yes, I would starve for her. I have fallen on my bended knees, while the tears fell like large drops of rain from mine eyes. I have begged, time after time, for her to be true to me, but she has dis<lb/>carded me, and how can I live when she has trifled with me whom she has once loved, and who knelt on his knees and prayed to his God, from his heart, to guard her life through her confinement, scarcely two years ago. Yes, I am sorry for her; my dear, dearest Annie, my heart bleeds for you. I am a wretched young man; I find you have deceived me. On Sunday, when I came from the country, you said you were happy to see me. I said, 'I am overjoyed to see you; and how is your dear babe, Mary Annie?' You said, 'Dear Charles, she is quite well,' and immediately kissed me. I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270032"/>
               <p>gave you ten shillings to put into your pocket, and you seemed quite glad, and said, 'Charles, you are very kind;' and you spent the remainder of the day with me; but when I asked you to stop with me till Monday, you said you could not, and I found out you wanted to meet another, and he was the one that you were with on Monday night, between 12 and 1 o'clock. Oh, Annie, my dearest, dear sweet Annie, how I love you; and that very day, in Brentford Park, you and I walked affectionately together with our lovely babe in your dear arms, and there you promised me that you would visit the Crystal Palace with me, on the Tuesday, and that I was to come early in the morning. I gave you a sovereign, and you went to fetch everything you thought best, to that amount, out of pledge, of your wearing apparel, and I found that it was all you wanted from me. Your grandmother told me to come and have some supper along with you, and you told me in the park you would go to bed early, as we had not much rest on the Sunday night, for you and I did not go to bed at your grandmother's till half-past 12 o'clock. I slept with you, and how affectionately you acted towards me, and promised, that day week or so, you would come back to your dear Charles; but when I went home to supper, you told your granny to say that you were gone to Turnham-green; but I myself thought different. Some sudden change came over me, and told me that you were with another, and my steps were directed to Hounslow, and it was there that I met you arm-in-arm with another; and your wicked mother—a bad, bad woman—she brought you to ruin. Many a time hast thou said those words to me, and, my dear, dear Annie, it is her that stole you from me, full of deceit. (Read the seventh chapter of Proverbs.) I was driven to commit the fatal deed; and oh! what an awful thing it is to commit murder; our dear babe left behind. Oh! young girls of Brentford, think of the result of tampering with a young man's feelings that love you; take my advice, and do not (<hi rend="italic">here a word was omitted</hi>) a man that loves you. Look at me, poor, wretched, unhappy man, how kind I have been to my Annie—people knows it in Brentford (Mr. Upton does). I told him on Tuesday morning how unhappy I was; he pitied me. How can my Annie respect herself, and go on board barges up and down the river for two or three days? But the deed is done; look to my child. Good-bye. Farewell all who know me May God have mercy upon me. I am writing this in a public-house, in Isleworth. Annie, dearest Annie, if you had not tampered with me I should not have felt the pangs I now feel. How could you pull one young man's face downwards to yours, and kiss him, time after time, in front of me, and tell him you loved him, and yet told me quite different? Did I not send you ten shillings, and seven shillings, weekly, when I was away from you? I have wronged you, I confess, but I have been forgiven by you; and you told me my kindness made you so that you could not keep away from me. You really did love me, but your mother was the cause of our separation. I have suffered for her, and bad has come to her; she is the cause of all this. Good-bye, sweet Annie; oh, that I could lie is your grave with you, that we could be buried together, but I shall be else-where. I have watched and guarded you, and my heart has been breaking for you a long time. You remember telling me that your mother gave you those bruised eyes that you had a few weeks ago, but, Annie, I have found out that you told me a falsehood; it was at Ealing fair, by some man. You have deceived me, cruel-hearted Annie. Several men I know have cohabited with you. I hope they will remember seeing me. They may live to think of the manner in which you and I met our deaths; and all young females,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270033"/>
               <p>take a warning by me; do not deceive one that loves you. I leave this world a wretched sinner; and may the Lord have mercy upon my soul through the blood of Jesus Christ my Saviour."</p>

I went to Childs' assistance—I took Bryan for being drunk and disorderly, and assaulting Orgar—Childs had him on one side and I on the other—I was on his right—he got Childs by his stock, and got him down—I thought he would strangle him, and made him release his hold, but he got hold of his stock again and got him down, and kicked him very violently in the stomach—the two female prisoners also kicked him while he was down—he became very sick, and was obliged to be taken out of the crowd—I then had Bryan by myself—he made use of a dreadful oath and said, "I will hang at the Old Bailey for you"—he bit me through the fore finger, which caused the blood to come, even though it was through my glove—he also kicked me about the legs and in the stomach—I became very faint, and asked for help; two civilians helped me, who are here.</p>

               <p>every twenty minutes; sometimes I might pass oftener, sometimes not quite so often—nothing attracted my attention that morning—on Monday night, about 10 o'clock, I heard of the occurrence which had taken place—I saw the prisoner some time after 10 o'clock, between 10 and 11—I rapped at his door in consequence of seeing the figures remaining on, to know if he wanted to be called or not, and he came to the door—I said to him, "Mr. Gardner, I am sorry for this occurrence that has taken place"—he replied, "I am sorry too; I did not think she would be guilty of the like, as we were on good terms"—he asked me whether I saw a light in his bedroom after his leaving that morning—I said, "No"—he said he thought she might have taken up the candle that he left on the table, as she had some time previously received letters insulting to her character, which were laid on a chair beside her bed, together with a wedding ring, and a brooch with his likeness in it—he also remarked that whenever she took up a newspaper and saw an account of a suicide, that she always passed the remark that those persons who committed it could not be in their proper state of mind—the prisoner said, "I left the candle on the table"—he did not say where but he made a sort of an indication as to its being downstairs—it was standing downstairs at that time, but he did not say whether it was down-stairs—he did not say whether he left it alight or not—it would be quite dark at a quarter past 3.</p>

               <p>hand, would the hand have been contracted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would have been firmly grasped round the knife—the hand was clenched up to a certain point, but not so as to make it difficult to get the knife away—when the prisoner took the knife, I am not certain whether he passed it to me or put it on the table—he immediately looked across to the woman Humbler, and said, "You wretch, you have done this"—Humbler then fell down upon her knees, and called God to witness that she knew nothing about it—I did not notice the prisoner's taking the child—I said I would not have anything moved till a constable was fetched—the prisoner said nothing, but left to fetch a constable—he took the child with him—there were several chairs in the room, but one particularly attracted my attention at the foot of the bed—there was on that chair a wedding-ring, a brooch, with the likeness of Mr. Gardner, also some valentines, and some other letters unopened—there was a table in the room opposite the door—the things in the room were quite orderly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see any marks of any kind upon Humbler, any marks of blood on her clothes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw her hands examined by the policeman in my presence, and I did not see anything upon her hands, except dirt—they did not appear to have been washed for some time—there was no blood on the bed clothes that were covering the bed—the sheet appeared to have been pulled or dragged down, and a portion of it was lying underneath the body of the deceased—after the prisoner left, Mrs. Spencer came in, and the policeman soon after—the policeman took charge of the things on the chair, the valentines, letters, the ring, and the likeness—I had previously examined the walls of the room; I did not examine them thoroughly—several marks were pointed out to me afterwards that were not there when I first examined—those marks were pointed out to me on the Friday morning; several of them I am quite sure were not the room previously—one of those marks was on the wall on the other side of the bedstead, the right-hand side; and there were some marks on the wall at the head of the bedstead—I after<lb/>wards examined the hands of the deceased; I found cuts across the fingers of the left hand, there were two on the middle finger, one had gone com<lb/>pletely through the hone; those on the other fingers were slighter, they only grazed the external cuticle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whereabouts were the cuts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Across in that direction (<hi rend="italic">inside</hi>)—it appeared as if those wounds had arisen from the grasp of the knife; as if she had laid hold of there knife, the direction corresponding with that in the palm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a cut on the palm as well? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—on the right hand; there were several cuts, but slight—those were irregular, over the hand; there were five cuts on the left hand, and six on the right—the insides of the hands appeared as if they had been wiped, because they were perfectly free from running blood, they were merely stained—the backs of the hands were very bloody—there was no blood underneath the hands—I minutely examined the body; on the thigh there was an impress of the palm of a hand, and the thumb; this was on the right thigh; it was a bloody impress—I could trace the mark of the thumb distinctly, it was pointing downwards; it was broader than my hand—the deceased was a thin, spare woman—I felt the body; it was not the mark of my hand—I saw it before I touched it, and the mark was broader than my hand—there was no blood on my hand that could have made it—it was on the inside of the thigh—the blood on the knife was dry—I did not go up into Humbler's bedroom that morning, the constable did—some days afterwards some</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270049"/>
               <p>clothes were shown me; I examined them; I did not find any marks of blood about them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you a physician? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and a Licentiate of the Apothe<lb/>caries' Company—I have been so since 1852—I say the body had been dead about four hours; it is impossible for any one to say—it may have been longer than that, but I should say it was quite as long—I think it could not have been shorter—I will not swear that it may not have been half an hour shorter, but I should think it was more likely to be rather more than four hours than under, very much more likely—I will say that it could not have been an hour under; it is quite impossible that it could have been three instead of four; that is my opinion—I swear it is impos<lb/>sible that it could have been three hours instead of four—I won't swear as to the impossibility of three hours and a half—I think it is impossible it could only have been three hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you had much experience in examining dead bodies? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have about five thousand patients under me in the course of a twelvemonth—a great many of them unfortunately die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you had that experience which enables you to know what time it would take to produce coldness in the human frame after 
death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have had very great experience, being connected with a public charity; I am medical officer to one of the poor law unions—I fre<lb/>quently have occasion to examine dead bodies—I am frequently not sent for till after 
death, and then they wish to say how long the patient has been dead</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When has a case of that kind last happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say; perhaps not more than a month ago—I do not mean a case of this kind, but a case in which a person died, and I was called upon to give my opinion how long the patient had been dead—I was called in and shown a dead body, and I was asked to give my opinion how long it had been dead, and I did so; I forget now the time I said—I forget the case but I know it was within a month ago—I say I cannot remember the case—they asked my opinion on it, which had been frequently done before—they did not themselves know how long the body had been dead—nothing that I am aware of occurred in that case to test the accuracy of my opinion—there have been many other cases where it has been tested afterwards—I cannot tell you any without referring to my books—I could if I had my books, but without them I cannot—there may have been six, eight, ten, or a dozen cases where my opinion has been proved to be accurate—cases have often occurred in which I have been called in and asked my opinion as to the time the body had been dead, and I have found what I have said was correct—I have found that from the circumstances that have transpired; perhaps one party may have been absent at the time, and when he has come home he has said, "I left so and so"—there was one case in particular, I remem<lb/>ber; that was perhaps twelve months ago; a neighbour called on me to come and see so and so; I found the person was dead; I pronounced an opinion as to how long the person had been dead; my opinion was about three or four hours; I found the body almost cold—that was proved by cir<lb/>cumstances to be correct, by the man, whose wife it was, being out, and they imagined he went out to work and left his wife dead in bed—when he came home of course I inquired of him, and he told me—it was in the morning that I was called in to see her—I cannot say exactly the time now, but I recollect those circumstances—the man told me he left his wife dead when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270050"/>
               <p>he went out in the morning—he did not tell me the time—he told me the time he went out in the morning, but I forget now what time it was—I neither recollect the time he told me, nor the time I was called in to see her—I recollect it was in the morning—my opinion was proved to be correct by the man's own statement—I cannot recollect any other instances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell me any scientific principle by reason of which you would be able to tell the length of time a body has been dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it is impossible to say positively.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you found what you are pleased to call sooty marks on the elbow and wrist; did you find those marks before the prisoner had arrived? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—I did not see the knife in the hand of the deceased before the prisoner came in—I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long was it before he came in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two minutes—the body was so shaded by the bedstead that it was almost impossible to see.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you did not see it because it was shaded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> it was shaded by the bedstead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then I suppose the first you saw of the knife was as it left the hand of the woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I saw it before it left her hand, because I saw the prisoner stoop down, and I bent in that direction to see what he was about, and I saw him distinctly take the knife out of her hand—I saw the knife in her hand before he touched it—the hand was closed—the handle was not grasped firmly in her hand, because if it had been grasped firmly, in taking the knife he would have carried the hand with it; he could not have taken it out so easily—I have not described it as having the knife clutched in her hand—I said "clenched "—I never used the expression clutched—I did not say so before the Coroner—I swear I did not say it was "clutched"—if it is put down so, it is a misunderstanding; I said "clenched"—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being referred to, the expression "clutched" appeared to be used in one instance, and "clenched" in another</hi>)—I did not use the word clutched; I swear that—the woman Humbler was on the other side of me at the time the prisoner took the knife out of the deceased's hand—he was standing jnst at the doorway—I was standing next to the woman, and then Humbler.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose I may take it as a fact, although you say you saw the knife in her hand before he touched it, that you had but a momentary glance at it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only a momentary view—he stooped down and immediately put his hand upon it—it was merely while he was in the act of passing his hand downwards that I saw it before he touched it—immediately on taking the knife out of the hand he looked across to the woman Humbler, and said, "You wretch, you have done this"—when she made the exclamations, calling God to witness that she knew nothing about it, the prisoner said, "Well, we will see about it"—I do not recollect his using the words, "She has never done it herself"—he may have done so—that may have been in my recollection before the Coroner, but it is not now—my memory will not serve me whether he did say it—I cannot recollect now—I may have stated it before the Coroner; if I did, I have no doubt that he did say so—the wound on the throat could not have been inflicted with the right hand—it is not impossible that it may have been inflicted with the left, but it is very improbable—I say it is impossible that it could have been inflicted with the right—I swear that—the first incision appeared to have been made just at the apple of the throat; I cannot say positively—I cannot say whether it was at that extremity of the wound or the other—I can only form an opinion upon that—I formed an opinion that it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270051"/>
               <p>commenced at the apple of the throat, and passed down towards the shoulder, but I cannot say it may not have been commenced at the other extremity—the wound was deepest at the further extremity—I say it is impossible that the wound could have been inflicted with the right hand, whether it had been begun on the one side or the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why do you say it is impossible? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because she could not have done it under any circumstances, not in any position, whether the knife was turned one way or the other—in my judgment, the wound could not have been inflicted with her right hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Dismiss for the present the position in which the knife was in her hand; do you mean to say that, under any circumstances, a person having a knife in her hand in the proper way, could not have out from the shoulder to the apple of the throat with the right hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider it impossible—I am sure she could not have got the hand suffi<lb/>ciently over, in order to carry the knife inwards as it was, and cut through the bone, and the cartilage of the larynx—the extreme end of the wound was about two inches from the apple of the throat—it commenced over the apple of the throat (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>), and went two inches backwards, downwards towards the left side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to tell me that the right hand of a person would not reach to that extremity of the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> But the direction of the wound was downwards, backwards and inwards towards the spinal column.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your opinion nobody could get the right hand so far as to commit a wound of that description? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the edge of the knife was in the ordinary way in the hand of a person, do you mean to swear that the right hand could not have been got back far enough to reach the other extremity of the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the condition she was it was impossible, because her hand would be pre<lb/>vented by the rail of the bedstead, and had she turned over, she would have been impeded by the ground—even supposing she was not lying under the bedstead, and that her arm was not interfered with by any obstacle, I still consider that she could not have reached to the extent the wound went, with her right hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although you with your hand easily reach it now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With a knife I could not—I have not had much experience in examining wounds on the throat—this was the first I have examined myself—that was the reason I called in an older practitioner, in order to confirm my opinion—it is not im<lb/>possible that the wound might have been inflicted with the left hand—I have heard of persons who are called ambi-dexterous, who can use the left hand equally with the right—the cause of 
death was suffocation—the carotid artery was not divided—when the carotid artery is divided, death is instan<lb/>taneous—it is not so in cases of suffocation—there would be some convulsive strugging—the time of that struggling would depend upon circumstances—if she was exhausted and fainted, blood would go on trickling into the larynx, and would suffocate the moment the came to, without any struggling; but there might be convulsive struggling accompanying the suffocation)—she might have been able to scream.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the wound had been inflicted with the left hand, do you think it possible that, in the agony of suffocation, or in the convulsive motions accompanying suffocation, she might have grouped the blade of the knife in her left hand, and then, that it might have passed on to the right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would have been impossible to out through the bone of the finger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I did not ask that; answer one question first; do you think it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270052"/>
               <p>would be impossible, supposing she inflicted the wound with her left hand in the convulsive struggles accompanying the suffocation, she could have grasped or clutched the blade in the left hand, and then passed it to the right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite impossible—because no one could possibly clutch or clench the fist sufficiently to cut through the bone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you get rid of the bone for the present? suppose the bone was not cut; I repeat the question; is it impossible that a person in the agony of suffocation, in the convulsive struggles accompanying suffocation, might have clutched the blade of the knife in the left hand, and then seized it, and pulled it out by the right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is not impossible—I think it impossible that that would have divided the finger in the way it was cut, because it is a thing almost without parallel for a person to commit an act of that sort lying down on the floor, in the condition she was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said it was not impossible for her to have clutched the blade in the left hand, and then passed it to the right, in the agonies of suffocation; do you assert that it is impossible that the bone of the finger could have been cut in the way you found it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not impossible, but most improbable—blood was on the sheet—I am certain it was on the sheek that was pulled down by the side of the bed, and lying underneath her, because I pulled it out myself—the table was almost close to the foot of the bed—the letters were not on the table, they were on the chair—thering was on the chair at the foot of the bed—the ring, letters, and brooch, were all on the chair—the feet of the body came a little beyond the bedstead—there was about three-quarters of a yard between the door and the feet of the body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at 71, High street, Whitechapel—I have been in practice about thirty-two years—on Tuesday evening, 16th September, I accompanied Mr. Sequiera to Northumberland-alley—I was present when he made a post-mortem examination of the body of Mrs. Gardner—I have heard his description of the wound—I concur in that description—I heard his account of the cuts on the hands—that is quite correct—I noticed a mark on the right thigh—it was the mark of a left hand, made with the fingers and thumb—it was made with blood—I noticed the palms of the hands, they were just stained with blood, as if it had been wiped off—Mr. Sequiera told me that the woman was pregnant—I did not know it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is your reason for saying it was not self<lb/>inflicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The nature of the wound was deep backwards, and turned inwards, going to divide the thyroid artery, muscle, and cartilage, into the larynx, which could not have been done by a person's own hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I think it could not, neither by the right hand or the left—I do not think the left hand could have done it—it is possible the left hand might, but the right hand, I am sure, could not—the left hand might have done it, but it was a sort of edging wound, not a regular clear cut—the right hand could not have done it, from this circumstance, it went digging downwards and inwards—it was an incised wound—it came down, and went backwards, and then inwards—I say, the left hand might have done it, because it could have turned in so easily, whereas the right could</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270053"/>
               <p>not—she could not have got the right hand round to as to make the would—that is my opinion—I think it is most improbable; hardly anything it im<lb/>possible at the present day—the palms of the hands were stained with blood, as if they had been wiped—I say "as if they had been wiped" from the smeared appearance—there was just a sort of half red appearance about them—the palm of the hand, with fresh blood on it, grasping the handle of the knife, would not have caused that smeared appearance, because then the hand would have been full of blood, and it was perfectly discoloured—I should say the blood would have flowed into the hand—supposing the hand was slightly stained with fresh blood, and then grasped the handle of the knife, that cer<lb/>tainly might have caused a smeared appearance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it any part of a medical man's scientific, or medical, or physiological learning, if a body is shown to him with a certain degree of warmth in it, to form an opinion how long that body has been dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is—I think, from the nature of the case, as described, and the woman being with child, which would keep up partial heat, that the body would not have got cold so quickly as it would otherwise.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The woman was found at 8 o'clock with her feet and shoulders cold, and the lower part of the trunk warm; can you form any opinion from that, according to your experience, how long she had been dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say about four or five hours—I have been called in to a number of 
deaths at the police-station—it is sometimes of importance to ascertain from the state of a body how long the person has been dead—it is a matter of ordi<lb/>nary surgical and medical skill to be acquainted with that, and to form an opinion upon it.</p>

               <p>examined the whole of the clothes in the room; bedding and everything—there were no appearances of blood whatever—on a chair in the bedroom, on the first-floor, I saw a night-gown, chemise, and drawers, these two valen<lb/>tines, and this wedding-ring, and brooch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is a likeness of the prisoner—I saw the room and examined it minutely—it was the first floor room; the bedroom; where the body was—I found no marks of blood on the wall; none whatever, with the exception of just where the head of the deceased lay, about a foot up, there was a little splash—I saw no marks on the table in the centre of the room—there was a thick woollen cloth on it—we took it off and examined the table—there was a cornice which formed part of the bed—I brought it to the window, and examined it in the presence of the beadle and another officer—there was no blood on it what ever—that was the cornice leaning against the wall—a piece of it was broken from the top—it was one of those old-fashioned four-post bedsteads—this was a piece of the cornice that had not been put up, or if it was put up, it had been broken off—the window, opposite the foot of the bed, was without a blind—the other blind was drawn down—there were no marks of blood on the bed—I looked at the fire, on the ground-floor—it was alight, but the bars were cold; it had not been alight a sufficient time to warn the bars; I could hold them in my hand—I felt them with my hand—the sticks were remaining in the fire, and a portion of the paper it had been lighted with—it was burning but very slow; it was not out, but it was not properly alight—I examined the room on the ground-floor minutely—there were no marks of blood there—there was a short curtain to the bottom part—the window shuts with shutters outside—there were no marks of blood on the curtain, nor on the shutters, nor any part of the room—I searched in the cellar, the sink, and the closet, that morning; and six or seven days afterwards, I pulled them up—I found no traces of any blood, nor yet any wet cloth in the house that would be sufficient for any person to wipe their hands on; not so much as a damp cloth—I looked at the prisoner's clothes as he wore them, and his flesh—I did not see any appearances of blood on him—he had evidently been at work, and was in his sweep's dress; in fact, it was sooty—I afterwards searched his clothes in the house, but not that day—on the Thursday everything was minutely searched—I found one black and of his, a brown suit, a corduroy suit, and two canvas jackets, which had been used for sweeping chimneys—there were no marks on those—the inquest was on Wednesday, the 17th—I know that Dr. Sequiera was examined there—I went on the Thursday to the prisoner's house with a constable of the name of Monger, and minutely searched the place again—the prisoner was there—after we had been upstairs and made the whole of the search and came downstairs again, he said he was sure that his poor wife had been murdered—I asked him what made him think that—he said because the girl Humbler knew she had to leave on that day; and, not only that, he had heard her more than once threatening her own life, and his too—he said that on one occasion he went up to her bedroom before she was up in the morning and saw a knife sticking in the ledge of her door, that he asked her what that meant, and she said she did not intend that he should have found her alive; and at other times he had seen her sharpening knives on the step of the door, and on the sink-stone in the cellar, and when he asked her what she was doing it for, she sometimes said for herself, and at other times for him—the prisoner said his poor wife's hands were cut about so, because he had seen them after she had been washed and put into the coffin—he said that at the same time that he said he thought she had been murdered—on the following day,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270061"/>
               <p>Friday, I and Monger went again to the prisoner's house—I do not thin Pallet was with us then—when we went I saw the prisoner on the ground-floor—he then said he had seen several spots of blood on the wall upstairs—I went upstairs, and found several spots of blood on the wall at the head of the bed—they were small spots, sprinkles, as if it had been thrown against the wall, and also at the aide of the bed several other spots, and on the wall near the feet, a large splash, and across the rail at the foot of the bedstead—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is paper off the wall—I am positive that this was not on the wall when I searched it previously, nor were the spots on the wall by the side of the head, and on the head—on the rail along the foot of the bed<lb/>stead there were the appearances of a wet bloody cloth having been drawn across it—it was dry on the rail, on a piece of cornice standing at the head of the bed there was a large splash of clotted blood, not quite dry—the greatest portion of it was wet—that was the cornice I have spoken of as having examined before—it was not there then—when I discovered it, I turned to Gardner and said, "There were none of these, neither on the wall, bed<lb/>stead, or board, when we searched the premises before"—he then said, "Perhaps it might be done in washing the body"—the body was washed, I believe, some time on the Wednesday—I do not know when it was put in the coffin—it was out when I was there on the Wednesday—we then went downstairs on the ground-floor—Gardner pointed to the short curtain on the window—I then saw a stain of blood on the top of it—he said, "She opened the window that morning"—I then opened the window, and on the shutter, on the inside, I saw a mark of blood, apparently of a person with the finger doubled as if it had been splashed on; as if a finger had been doubled up in that way, and put it on in a heap; it was as if done with a knuckle—I then turned to Gardner, and told him that I had examined it seven or eight times previously, and was positive it was not there even the day before—he made me no answer—the shutters were two shutters, folding back against the wall on the outside—at this time one was shut and the other open—the one that was closed had the blood on it, the part facing the room as it was closed, it was quite dark, but easily discovered—I had examined the shutters eight or nine times previously, for we had been there daily—the blood was on the inside—on the following Saturday I went with Monger, and took a change of clothes for the girl Humbler to Gravesend—I asked her to change them for those she was wearing—we then examined the outside clothes there, and the linen we brought to Mr. Sequiera—there were no signs of anything on them—Humbler was hop-picking at Gravesend when we went down—we had to wait till she came from the field with her friends—the Coroner expressed a wish that the stockings should be got, on account of the girl's statement on her examination—I took her into the end of the court, and she instantly pulled them off in my presence and gave them to me—they were then examined by Dr. Sequiera—I looked at them myself and the gentlemen of the jury also, and they were given back to her—they were brown stockings—I saw no trace of anything on them—they were very dirty—we inspected them minutely, but we could see no trace of any blood upon them—we could have seen it on the leg if there had been any there, but on the sole of the foot the dirt was too thick—she had been running in the dirt with them, there is no doubt—they were given back to her.</p>

               <p>Yes; and her feet and stockings—I did not examine the soles of her feet—she had a pair of slippers on, I did not take them off—I did not examine the soles of the slippers—I examined the whole of her clothes as she was standing—she said nothing then to me of her having trodden in blood—she seemed in too excited a state—she hardly knew what she was about—she showed me her clothes, taking them up one by one—she knew I was ex<lb/>amining her for the purpose of finding whether there were any marks of blood upon her—the stockings were given up on the Wednesday following, at the inquest—they were examined at the inquest, the second time—they were taken off on Wednesday, the 17th, and given back to her on Wednesday, the 24th—that was done at the inquest after she had made her statement, in conseqnence of her having stated that she had trodden in blood—I can only say they were the same coloured stockings that she had on—if a person had trodden in blood it would leave an imprint on the floor—I saw several prints of that kind outside the door, and on the carpet, became there had been a dozen persons up and down—it had been puddled on to the floor—the head lay close to the door—they could not avoid it—the prisoner did not give me an account of what took place between himself and his wife on the Sunday night—he told me the girl had got to leave on the Monday morning, that he had given her warning, that he had ordered her to leave the house on the Monday morning—he did not say to me that the girl was annoying and teasing his wife on the Sunday night, and that he spoke to her about it, and that she kept on laughing and singing.</p>

               <p>and duly cautioned, says: "I am willing to tell all I know about the matter. Deceased has been my wife for seven years. We lived together before marriage. We lived comfortably together for some years after marriage. Elizabeth Clark first came to my house five or six years ago, at servant. Three years after that we cohabited together. When the deceased found it out she was very disagreeable to it, and Clark had to leave the house. She has been away several times. She lived with me and the deceased. Clark then married a man named Humbler. I knew that she was married to Humbler. Deceased said the girl was worse after marriage than before. On Sunday morning I went out at 11 o'clock, and returned at 2 o'clock. Elizabeth Humbler and my wife were both there. I did not go out again after 2 o'clock. On Sunday evening, from 5 to 7, I and the girl had words together; deceased was there also. The girl was annoying and teasing my wife, and I spoke to her about it. She kept on laughing and singing. Deceased said to me, "When your back is turned it is worse than that" I then said, "There shall be an end to it." I then spoke to the girl, and said that next day I should have a few words to settle the matter; that I should not put up with such nonsense. The girl went to bed at 7 o'clock. I and deceased remained up. We slept together. We were friends then. At half-past 3 on Monday morning the police called me, as I wished. I looked at my watch, and found it was too early to get up, and I went to bed again. Deceased then said to me, "Did you hear that creature up and down in the night?" I said, "No." Deceased said, "I heard her at one o'clock come down from the top room, go to the bottom room, and then come into this room and take the candle off the table, and go down into the kitchen, and then up to the top room, and then come back and place the candle on the table where she took it from." I said, "Oh! well, don't bother, it will be decided to-day; we will have no more of it." I meant the girl's nonsense. That was all that passed between us. I got up at twenty minutes to 4, left the room at a quarter to 4, and dressed myself downstairs, and left the house at 4 o'clock. When I left the room, deceased was lying in bed, on her right side. She was awake. She had our child, three years old, with her. I covered deceased up with the bedclothes. I did not see the girl Humbler before I left. I went to sweep chimneys at Pope's Head-alley, Change-alley, and Purssell's. I went home at 8 o'clock, and then I found the doctor there. I never heard the girl threaten the deceased. The brooch found on the chair contains my likeness. It was locked up in the desk on Sunday. The key of the desk was kept in my trousers' pocket. Deceased had her wedding-ring on on Sunday night when we went to bed. I can't tell who wrote the letters produced. Deceased often spoke about them. They were kept in the top drawer. When I got up on Monday morning I saw them and the brooch, and the ring, on the chair. I swear that I took the knife out of deceased's right hand. I did not put it there. I have not spoken to the girl since about it. I did say to her on the Mon<lb/>day morning, "You've done this." I thought they had been quarrelling, and that she had done it; that she had killed her. I fancy I heard the knife drawer rattle on the Sunday night; I am almost certain that I did. I never had any quarrel with Humbler's husband. When I left home on Monday morning I pulled the door to, and no one could have got in without a key. It is a lock, not a mere latch. I washed the floor of the room next day. Deceased was not left-handed.—S. Gardner."</p>

                  </hi>. I attend to my uncle's business at Coles' Upper-wharf, Horsleydown—my uncle and father are wharfingers—Kent and Symes were in our employ at the time this matter happened—Kent had been in our employ three or four years as a lighterman—on Thursday, 2d October, we had two barges of wheat, the <hi rend="italic">Exchange</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Scion</hi>, wh ch had loaded from two vessels in the Victoria-dock, and from there they come to our two wharves, one to Coles' Upper-wharf, and the other to a wharf higher up the river, where they were to discharge—my uncle gave the men the directions, in my presence; I partly directed them—the <hi rend="italic">Exchange</hi> had 284 quarters 6 bushels—I know that from the meter certificates—the barges ought each</p>

               <p>to have been at the wharves on Thursday evening, 2d October, about 9 o'clock in the evening—Symes, and Wright, one of the witnesses, had charge of the <hi rend="italic">Exchange</hi>—her cargo was 284 quarters 6 bushels of American spring wheat—it was the duty of one of them to stop with the barge until it came to the wharf, and the duty of the other to come home and say where it had got to—I was not there when it arrived—it arrived early in the morning—I first saw it on the Friday morning, between 7 and S o'clock, at the wharf—the men had left the craft; it is usual for them to go and get their meals if they have not had them—the cargo of the <hi rend="italic">Exchange</hi> was loaded into the warehouse at Coles' Upper-wharf—it was afterwards weighed by Kelly, by my instructions; I did not see it weighed—the cargo of the <hi rend="italic">Scion</hi> was American winter wheat—Kent and Gresham had charge of the <hi rend="italic">Scion</hi>, the cargo of which was landed with the bulk in the warehouse—that was measured—I have been shown samples of both parcels, and we have com<lb/>pared them with the bulk in the warehouse; we have compared these samples with each of the cargoes, and found them correspond in every par<lb/>ticular.</p>

I live at 22, Salisbury-lane, Bermondsey, and am in the employ of the prosecutors—on Thursday, 2d October, between 6 and 7 o'clock, I came out of the Victoria-docks, with a barge called the <hi rend="italic">Exchange</hi>, which had a load of corn—I do not know the quantity—Symes was with me—as far as I know, it was wheat in bulk, but I could not see; it was locked down—I had a key of the batches, and so had Symes—we two were all hands—the <hi rend="italic">Scion</hi> came out at the same time, just ahead of us—she had a cargo of corn, as far as I know—Gresham and Kent were with her—those hatches were locked in the same way—we came to the Surrey canal buoy, which is about a mile from my master's premises—we made the barges fast there at about a quarter to 9—there was another barge there, with flour in it—that was in the middle, and we made ours fast one on each side—I then went up to Mr. Keen's, and after that I got a night's work—we all four came on shore together, and I and Kent went up to Mr. Keen's—I went to no public-house first—the others went to their homes, as far as I know—some one ought to have remained with the barge—it was Symes' duty; he ought to have gone back again—when went to the <hi rend="italic">Exchange</hi> in the morn<lb/>ing; about 6 o'clock, I found him there waiting for me to come up—we then took the <hi rend="italic">Exchange</hi> to the wharf and got there somewhere about 7 o'clock.</p>

I am a surgeon, and medical officer of the parish of Kensington—on 1st October I was sent for to the police-station—I found the prisoner's wife there, bleeding very profusely from several wounds in the head—she had evidently been drinking—she was suffering from loss of blood—some of the wounds were punctured and others incised in the scalp—there was also a severe wound between the right forefinger and thumb of the right hand—some of them were severe wounds, about an inch and a half in length—some of them were of a serious character—erysipelas might have followed—I sent her to the workhouse—I was afterwards sent for to attend her again there, in consequence of her bleeding from the hand—she remained under my charge for about a fortnight—the wounds could certainly not have been inflicted by a fall—they could be inflicted by such an instrument as this knife.</p>

I am a City detective—I went with Russell to some dining-rooms in Nicholas-lane—as I was leaving there I saw a piece of paper on the table—when we entered the room the prisoner, who was there, had a quan<lb/>tity of gold in this piece of paper—he appeared to be counting it—he took the remainder of the gold out, and as we were leaving the room he left the paper on the table—I noticed it, and said, "You have left your paper"—he said, "Never mind about that"—I went back and fetched it; this is it—he gave his name and address, "Fenne, 1, Russell-place, Old Kent-road”—the other officer then asked Mr. Haas what address the prisoner had written on the back of the note which he had changed at his place—Mr. Haas said, "14, Peacock-terrace, Victoria-park”—one of the notes was torn—when I searched the prisoner I took some money from him, English and foreign—previously, at the Bank of England, I asked him if he had any notes about him—he said; "No," but when I searched I found a five-pound note on him—he said, "I should like to write my name on that note"—I gave him the note, and my pencil, and he tore a piece off the corner of the note, and said, "That is my way of marking a note"—I directly snatched it away from him.</p>

I live at 4, North-east-passage, and keep a shop there and at No. 8, New-road—I am a grocer and tobacconist—on the evening of 4th October I was standing outside my door, and saw the prisoner come down from Davy-street—I followed him in the direction of the crowd, and three minutes afterwards he was a prisoner—he was alone when I first saw him; there were three persons behind him coming down the same way—the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was there about a quarter of an hour before the prisoner came up; they hallooed out that there had been a knife used—three minutes after he came down, I saw him struggling with the policeman opposite the railings in Wellclose-square—directly he got among the crowd some persons came up and got him between them—I did not like to go so close, and all at once I saw a struggle opposite by the side of the railing, and the policeman had him—some Englishman said that he took the wrong man—that was when the prisoner was taken in custody—I do not know whether the man who said that is here—I am certain that an Englishman did call that out—I have only known the prisoner by sight before.</p>

I was on duty at about two or three minutes to 4 o'clock, on the morning of 22d October last, in Charterhouse-square—I heard some footsteps in the opposite direction to where I was standing—I listened, and saw the prisoner John Williams against the gate leading into Carthusian-street—I asked him where he was going—he said he was going home—I observed the bulky appearance of his right-hand coat-pocket, and asked him what he had there—he said he had nothing there which concerned me; that it was his own property—not feeling satisfied with that, I walked with him through the square into Charterhouse-lane, questioning him, as I was going along as, to where he lived—he refused to give his name and address—when I got into Charter-house-lane, I saw him put his hand into his pocket—I said, "I must see what you have there"—he then immediately ran away—I pursued him down Charterhouse-lane into Cross-street, where he threw away something which sounded like copper money—he turned up Peter's-lane, and then into St. John's-lane, at both of which places he threw away something which sounded like money, and also in Eagle-court—during the pursuit I called "Stop thief!" and sprang my rattle—when he turned out of Eagle-court he was pursued by 141 G down Albion-place, and was caught just before he got into Passing-alley—we then took him to Bagnigge-wells station—he was asked by the inspector where he lived, but refused to give his address; he gave his name as John Williams—I searched him there, and found in each trousers pocket a package containing 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in copper money, done up in brown paper, and 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 3 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in copper money, loose in his coat and waistcoat pockets, also sixteen threepenny-pieces in his waistcoat-pocket, and some silent lucifer matches—after the charge had been given, I went back over the ground over which I had followed him—I found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in copper money; I found that in the streets we had run through.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the cashiers at Messrs. Coutts'—on 14th October, about 12 o'clock in the day, the prisoner presented himself at my desk—I asked him what his business was—he said, "I want to draw some money"—I did not know him, and I said, "Have you an account with us?"—he said, "I have"—I then handed him one of our blank cheques—he filled it up in my presence—this is it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "London, 14th October, 1862, Messrs. Coutts and Co. pay to George Jordan, or bearer, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Henry Hardy"—he then handed it to me written—I examined the signature—I did not know it or the name, so I went for reference, first to the ledger and then to the signature book—I then went back to him, and said, "Do you draw this on your own account, or have you any authority to draw in any other person's?"—his reply was, "Oh, if it is not here, it is at Herries'"—I communicated with the principals of the firm, and the officer Hanscomb was ordered to take him into custody—we have no customer named Henry Hardy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John McSwinney, and live with my husband at 13, Rose-alley, Bishopsgate—the prisoner lived next door—his wife was a sister of mine—her name was Eliza Keefe—she was about forty years old I think—she had been married to the prisoner about thirteen or fourteen years, to the best of my knowledge; I do not know—she has had children by him—three are living, and she has buried two or three—Mary Ann, the eldest, is between eleven and twelve years old—the boy if about five, and the other about three—the prisoner and his wife occupied the front room on the ground floor of 12, Rose-alley—part of it was divided by a wainscoting from the house where I lived—if they spoke very loud, I could hear in one room what was passing in the other—I saw my sister about 8 o'clock on the Friday evening before she died on the Monday—I do not know the day of the month—she seemed then in pretty good health, but expecting her confinement—on the Saturday morning, about 2 o'clock, six hours afterwards, I was in bed, and heard the children scream dreadfully—I listened, and knew her children's screams—I sat on my bed, and heard a great weight fall, and then I heard a scream, and listened to it, and knew my sister's voice—I came down stairs directly, and went into her passage, and found her lying there—I saw the prisoner standing in his own room with a stick or piece of iron in his hand—on my coining there my sister said, "Mary-Ann, I'm done;" and she put her hand right down by the side of her belly—she was then lying on the floor with her feet towards her own room door—at the time she said "I'm done" the prisoner wanted to rush out at her from to his room—I stood in the doorway, turned my back to him, and opened my two arms to keep him in—he said, "I will kick the b——y bastard out of you; you have come to take her part, you old w—e; I will serve you just same"—I would not let him out, and he struck at me with something on the right elbow—it is quite purple still—I screamed for the police, hallooed out "Murder," and some men came up the steps—I heard them come up, and heard two or throe voices in the court—they were the scavengers, I think—one of the men made an attempt to come into the passage, and my sister said to him, "He is a blind man"—when the prisoner heard the people speak in the court he went into his room, shut the door, and made it fast—we heard him fastening it with something inside—I went into my house, and returned shortly afterwards to the passage—my sister was still lying on the floor of the passage—I helped her up, and sat her on the stairs—the prisoner was</p>

               <p>then in his own room—I did not hear him say anything in his own room—I went upstairs to my own room, and came down to my sister two or three times during the night—she told me she had no pains of labour, but felt very faint and weak indeed—she did not appear to be in labour, but she complained of the side of her belly—about 6 in the morning, Mary Ann, the little girl, opened the door, and I came down stairs—she did not come out; I looked in—I stood it the door of the room where the prisoner was in bed—when he heard her voice he said, "Oh, it is you, is it, you b——y old w—e; get my shirt ready; you know where I am going this morning"—he was going to a blind asylum to get his money—I was with her at different times on the Saturday—on the Sunday, at 8 o'clock, she sent a little girl up to me—I went round, and found her lying in her own bed—she told me she was in labour, and I went to Mrs. Lewis, a Midwife, who came back with me di<lb/>rectly—I remained in the room with my sister and the midwife; and I afterwards went for Dr. Fowler, in consequence of something Mrs. Lewis and to me—I remained there till the child was delivered, which was about 12 o'clock, I should say—the child was not alive—the prisoner came to the door while the doctor was there—the doctor told him he could not come in—that was, I think, about the time of the delivery—he then went away, and I next aw him on Monday evening, between 7 and 8 o'clock—he came into the room—there were a few others there he was in liquor—they told him to make no noise; that his wife was very ill indeed, and the child was dead—he said, "Yes, the b——y old w—e, her sister, has killed her and the child with brandy"—he said, "Eliza, take no more of it; you must have tome beer "—he remained there about three-quarters of an hour—I next saw him on the Tuesday morning about 12 o'clock—his wife was then dead—Mrs. Sutton was with me—they told him his wife was dead, and he said, "A b——y good job; I am rid of the lot of them now; Dr. Fowler and her b——y old sister have killed her "—I have seen him use violence towards my sister several times before—I have seen him use her shamefully.</p>

Murder, murder—I heard the prisoner say, "You wh—, you have come in to take her part; I will kill you; I will take your chemise off and turn you out," and he made use of a fearful expression which I cannot mention—I was in my room all the time, and never opened my door—I heard a scrimmage, and then I heard a man's voice—that was after Mrs. McSwinney had come in—I did not hear anything besides words before I heard the groaning, or before Mrs. McSwinney came in—the groans and screaming were imme<lb/>diately after the fall—after Mrs. McSwinney came in I heard a man's voice, not the prisoner's; I cannot say whose it was, but I imagine it was one of the scavengers, for I heard Mrs. Keefe say, "He is blind"—that was the first word I heard her say after the fall.</p>

I am a widow, And am the appointed midwife to the East London Union—on the evening of Sunday, 28th September, I went to the prisoner's residence about 8 o'clock—I found his wife there, standing by the side of her bedstead—when I made a professional examination, I found she wag in strong labour—the pains continued for, some three-quarters of</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine, residing at Bishopsgate-street-within, and am district medical officer to the East London Union—about half-past 9 o'clock on Sunday, 28th September, I was sent for by Mrs. Lewis to attend the deceased woman—I got there between half-past 9 and 10, and found her presenting some of the most serious symp<lb/>toms which can possibly arise during a state of midwifery—she was in a state of perfect collapse, the face pale and very anxious-looking, breathing difficult; her tongue and breath were cold, her pulse scarcely perceptible at all at the wrists; there was an entire absence of all uterine action, and she was vomiting—from the examination I made of the state of her labour, I found that the child was in such a position that a few expul<lb/>sive pains should have brought it into the world; those symptoms indi<lb/>cated internal hæmorrhage, the result of some serious internal mischief—my judgment told me that her only safety lay in immediate delivery—I proceeded to attempt to obtain pains by medicinal and other measures, by stimulants; being unable to do so, I returned home for my obstetric instruments, and attempted to deliver by instruments; I was unsuccessful—I then effected the delivery by the operation of turning, and the woman was delivered of a still-born child; it was a large male child—I cannot positively state when its death occurred; it might have been dead between two and three days—I should say that it did not appear to have been alive within a few minutes or hours of delivery—it was a full-grown child—there was no alleviation whatever in the patient, of the symptoms produced by the delivery; in spite of domestic and other stimulants, she died in about twenty-four hours after delivery—I had once attended her about two or three years before, in the absence of a midwife; that was a natural labour, of twins; that was without any difficulty whatever; she was delivered before I could get there—I was subsequently present, when the post-mortem examination was made by Dr. Holden, in consequence of my declining to make it—I suggested that I would rather have some inde<lb/>pendent medical gentleman to perform it—on opening the belly, we found about half a pint of blood in its cavity, and, tracing for the source of that we discovered a large laceration at the posterior wall of the vagina, near to its junction with the neck of the womb—as regards the vital organs of the body generally, there were very slight indications of some old disease of the lungs, but quite insufficient to have prod need death—there was, in my opinion, nothing in any of the other vital organs which conduced to accele-rate death—there was hæmorrhage into the cavity of the belly—in my opinion, the kick which has been sworn to having been received by the woman, produced, at the time of its infliction, a certain amount of injury of the part, which injury became extended during the expulsive efforts of the mother in labour—from the fact of her being in perfect health up to the time these injuries were inflicted on her, and from what I saw in her life-time,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270113"/>
               <p>and on the post-mortem examination, the cause of death, in my judg<lb/>ment, was the laceration of the vagina—there is no doubt that that was the cause of death, and the cause of that laceration was a kick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Unless there was some previous injury, could a natural de<lb/>livery have produced that laceration? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—they do occur when there is no symptom of external violence, but in those cases the woman has pre<lb/>viously had very severe labours; she generally, during her last pregnancy, complains of some fixed pain in the womb, and the labour itself is more than ordinarily difficult—then the womb is more or less previously diseased, and the labour more than ordinarily severe—cases of laceration have occurred where the labour has been very severe, and where the previous confinements have also been very severe—if there has been some previous injury, it is hardly in its normal state—supposing it were in its normal state at the time of the delivery, very severe labour pains could undoubtedly have pro<lb/>duced this state—labours very severe, have effected that injury, where it has been in its normal state at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLIEGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do those cases of laceration occur more frequently in first labours than in subsequent ones? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Less frequently in first labours—in a case when a woman has had some six or seven children, and the labours were without any unfavourable character, it would be very impro<lb/>bable that there would be such laceration—the woman died on Monday, between 11 and 12 o'clock, and the post-mortem was made on the Thursday, about 10 o'clock—the body was in a perfect state of decomposition—I had not examined the exterior of the body previously—the decomposition was such that the evidence of bruises or ecchymosis would be quite destroyed—I heard of the acts of violence just subsequently to the delivery; previous to the time of death—in consequence of rumours during the morning of her death, it being stated that myself and the midwife were instrumental in causing the woman's death, I declined to give the certificate of death, and intimated that I would rather have a post-mortem examination—I believe the rumours emanated from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you not think that blood was caused by a rupture? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A rupture was the cause of the blood in the belly, undoubtedly—it is morally certain that the turning of the child had nothing to do with the state of the injury, because the symptoms, which are recognised by all autho<lb/>rities in midwifery, as indicative of the occurrence of these injuries, were antecedent to Mrs. Lewis sending for me.</p>

I am just turned thirteen years old, and live at 39 1/2, Curtain-road—I recollect going for a ride one night in the prisoner's cart—the prisoner and Mrs. Barr, Mr. and Mrs. Saunders, and two more boys, were in the cart—it was about 11 o'clock at night—we went to Mr. Sunders' house in the cart—that is down by the Rosemary Branch-bridge—I cannot tell how long we stopped there—it was more than an hour—I stayed in the cart—the prisoner was in Mr. Saunders' house, and Mr. Saunders also—I remember two or three pints of beer being sent for and taken into the house, while I was in the cart—afterwards Mr. Saunders and the prisoner came and got into the cart, and we all drove off together—the horse did not gallop; he trotted till he got to the City-road—I remember being stopped in consequence of some one being knocked down—the horse was then going at ten or twelve miles an hour—the prisoner was driving—he slashed the whip at the side of the cart—I do not know whether he hit the horse or not—I was at the back—the cart stopped when the man was knocked down—the prisoner afterwards drove off again at ten or twelve miles an hour—he merely slashed his whip at the side of the cart as before—we went down Britannia-street, at the same pace all the way—I was thrown out—he struck the horse when we were about three parts up Britannia-street—I cannot tell how long that was before we were thrown out; I have no recollection—the prisoner was neither drunk nor sober—he had supper, I believe, before he went out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you ever been out for a drive with the prisoner before that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; not very often—I have not been out with his wife before, but in the cart with him—no accident ever happened before when I was with him—I recollect observing something in the action of the horse before Mullens was knocked down—the horse shied when we were coming away from Mr. Saunders,' after we had started—I know what is meant by a horse shying—he did not shy again before Mullens was knocked down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ginger-beer seller, and have a stall in Barbican—I know Messrs.

               <p>in the morning—I think it was the next morning, or the morning after I had seen the man come out of the house; I won't swear—three or four policeman came for me—I went with them to Bethnal Green-road, to see if I could identify the man—I waited some time in the outer room, and then went in—they said, "Is he there?"—there were three men there, and he was the middle one—I said, "That is the man"—I believe that was on the 6th; I won't say for certain—I was sent for to Moor-lane before that, but I did not know anybody there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Free Hospital—on Sunday, 21st September, the deceased, William Smith, was brought there at 2 o'clock—I first saw him at 8 in the morning—he died at half-past 11 on Monday, the 22d—when I first saw him he was perfectly insensible, and suffering from symptoms of apoplexy—I visited him from time to time during the Sunday—he gradually got worse till he died—twenty-four hours after death I made a post-mortem examination of the body—externally I found a small bruise below the left ear, and a small abrasion over each eyelid—I opened the head, removing the top of the skull, and found an effusion of blood on the brain on the right side between the membranes on opening the brain, immediately underneath the effusion, I found a large, clot of blood, in the right ventricles of the brain—I examined the chest and all the other organs, and they were perfectly healthy—that clot of blood</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270128"/>
               <p>was sufficient to account for death—the immediate cause of death was the extravasation of blood by the pressure on the brain—I think the bruise on the left side would produce the effusion on the opposite side—in my opinion, it was caused by a blow behind the left ear; I have seen the effusion on both sides, but more frequently on the opposite side—in my opinion, the effusion was the effect of a blow or fall, I could not say which—I found no injury beyond what I have stated—I could not connect the extravasation of blood at all with the marks on the eyelids; the skin was just rubbed off; such injuries as those could not produce effusion of the brain—a fall on the front of the head on a kerb-stone might have done it—I should think the abrasion on the eyelids had been done within a few hours before I saw him, and the injury behind the ear the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, is it possible that the extravasation of blood might have been caused by the abrasion on the eyelids? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think not—I attribute it to a blow behind the ear, or a fall—the extra<lb/>vasation, and therefore the death, could have been caused by the abrasion of the eyelids; it depends upon what obstacle was in the way; if a person fell forward on a kerbstone it might cause the extravasation of blood on the brain; if an upright projecting object was in the way, and the face struck against it in falling—I think the injury by a fall at the side of the ear would also have produced the blow on the eyelid—effusion takes place very slowly—the man might have walked to the hospital before it took place—sometimes it takes place suddenly, but generally slowly—if it occurs from apoplexy it occurs very quickly, but if from a blow it occurs slowly—when I saw the deceased on Sunday morning he had all the symptoms of apoplexy—supposing there was a violent blow and a fall, and immediate insensibility, and a few hours afterwards the deceased was suffering from all the symptoms of apoplexy, it would be a difficult matter to decide between apoplexy and compression of the brain; when I said apoplexy, I meant com<lb/>pression of the brain; the blood is effused in both cases—if the man recovered, and fell down again, I should take it that that was effusion of the brain—in this case I should attribute the death to a fall; I should attribute it to violence, not to any constitutional cause—I do not think it is doubtful which.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SHARPE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In certain cases of injury, where the injury is very violent, is not the effusion of blood on the brain very sudden, as in apoplexy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends upon the vessel that is ruptured and the size of the vessel, and it also depends upon whether a man is intoxicated; blood would be circulating more freely if that was the case—Mr. Selwood left the deceased in my charge at 8 in the morning.</p>

I live at 61, Turnmill-street, and am a glass<lb/>cutter—on Saturday, 20th September, I came out of the Red Lion and Punch<lb/>bowl public-house about 12 o'clock, in company with the deceased and the prisoner—we stopped on Clerkenwell-green, and after some little time White<lb/>head and the deceased had a spar—I saw the deceased run away, and White<lb/>head's mother came and took him away—I did not see what became of the deceased then—Hanks was in our company after that; he was standing talking to us, when Whitehead's mother took him away—he then left, and I heard a man fall—I can't say where Hanks went—I did not see in what direc<lb/>tion—he might have gone up to the deceased—I went up to the man when I heard him fall—I might have been ten yards from him when he fell; I can't say exactly—I took hold of his hand and found it was Smith—I saw Hanks then just running from the deceased—the deceased was insensible; he could not speak—I remained with him until the policeman Browning came up, and took charge of him—Hanks had a black velvet cap on, all the time he was with me; it had no tassel, it had a peak.</p>

               <p>—I came out in company with Chantrey, and afterwards went on to the Green with him—Hanks was with us during that time; he remained with us a little time on the Green, and then we missed him, and heard a man fall on the ground—I and Chantrey ran over to see who it was—I saw smith on the ground, and Hanks ran away when we turned round to go to Smith—he turned from the deceased and ran down by the Sessions House, I believe—I know the Lamb and Flag—he ran in that direction, down that narrow turning.</p>

I live at 35, Clerkenwell-green, and am a colour-printer—my house looks out on Clerkenwell-green—sometime after 12 o'clock on Sunday morning, 21st September, I heard a disturbance, and looked out—I was on the third-floor—I saw several persons quarrelling, as I thought—two men came from the party and pulled off their coats and commenced sparring—Whitehead made a strike at the deceased, but did not hit him—I knew the deceased; I kept my eye on him—they sparred, and then the deceased ran down the hill, and Whitehead followed him—the deceased ran down to the bottom of the hill and fell forward on his hands and knees—a female then came up and took Whitehead away—the deceased after he fell got up and brushed his trousers and walked up the hill to where he threw his coat down—he picked his coat up, put it on, and was in the act of arranging it, when another man came from this party, who was standing at the other end of the Sessions House, came up to the deceased and said, "You are a b——coward for running away, you talk about fighting; you can't fight a little"—the deceased made some answer, but spoke lower; I did not hear what he said—the man said, "I can box such a b——as you myself," and he up with his fist and struck the deceased a violent blow on the side of his head—I should think it was the left side of the head, it was with his right hand—the deceased shook and fell right back on the back of his head, a tremendont fall—he laid there and groaned, and the man looked round to see if anybody was looking, and ran away, past the Sessions House, and down to the right by the side of the Lamb and Flag public-house—there was nobody but him and the deceased there at that time—I ran after the man but I could not see him—when I came up to the deceased I found him in charge of the constable—the prisoner resembles the man who struck the blow very much—he was a man of about five feet four, and he had a tight fitting cap on his head, on one side—a loose cap over at the side, a darkish cap with a peak—I should not wish to swear to the prisoner—I believe he is the man; I can't swear positively.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Truman, Hitchcock, and Co., warehousemen, of Wood-street, Cheapside, and am one of the creditors' assignees—I have known the prisoners about eleven or twelve years—they have been in the habit of dealing with us for goods throughout that period—they owe us under the bankruptcy about l,035<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or somewhere there-abouts—I was acquainted with the firm of Kortoske Brothers in Canada—I first heard of them about 1854 or 1855—we understood the component members of that firm to be Kortoske Brothers and Mr. Keppel Fox; not the prisoner Kortoske—I do not know whether there were two or three Kortoskes—we knew them under the general name of Kortoske Brothers—how many composed the firm, I never knew—I am aware that during the early part of the prisoners' dealings with us he sent the goods he purchased of us to that firm, and we had some dealings with the Canada firm direct, not passing through the prisoners' house—those dealings commenced about the beginning of the year 1857, and went down to the autumn of that year, when the American panic set in; when, acting on a general principle of our business not to have shipping accounts at that time, I intimated to the person who represented himself to be Fox, to close the account, and that we should require, as it had been up to that period, the responsibility of Braun and Kortoske on this side—I communicated that by word of mouth—I called on Fox, who at that time had an office in Aldermanbury-postern, and said to him that, acting on a general principle of our business, we being almost entirely a home-trade house, must decline direct transactions with the Canadian firm, and should require a responsible house on this side, or</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270134"/>
               <p>cash, and should be perfectly satisfied with Messrs, Braun and Kortoske, of London-wall, as we had heretofore; charging the goods, in point of fact, to them—we then closed the account with the Canada house, and never re<lb/>sumed it in a direct form—we continued our sales to the prisoners with a knowledge that they would ship to the Canada house themselves, and be re<lb/>sponsible to us—we continued to do that until a very recent date before they stopped payment—I ought perhaps to state that the bulk of the goods for which we are creditors under the bankruptcy, were supplied to them in the spring of 1861, they suspending on 3d September, 1861—it was our habit to draw on the prisoners for the goods we sold, and down to the early part of 1861 those acceptances were met with unfailing punctuality, for until they suspended payment on 3d September they never asked an hour's grace—in May, 1861, we found that the bills they owed us exceeded 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and, in consequence of that, on 14th May, I addressed a letter to the firm, it being a principle of our house to limit drawing credits—I have a copy of it here in our letter-book—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 14th May, 1861, from the witness to the defendants, requesting them, at their account exceeded</hi> 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic"> to suspend further orders until some part of that amount was written, off</hi>)—in consequence of that letter, Braun called upon me, and we had some con<lb/>versation as to their dealings with the Canada house, and the state of our debt—we inclosed in that letter a statement of the account, by which he might see for himself, and he called and said that he was much surprised to find that the shipping part of the account was so large; that he was scarcely aware of it, but that Messrs. Kortoske Brothers, of Canada, had represented that they were in a flourishing condition on the other side, and had remitted to them, during the year 1860, about 24,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but had made no remittance since January I understood him, that being in May—I still adhered to my decision and Braun left me—I deemed it a very liberal credit to give the house, our firm being a home-trade concern almost exclusively—I did not know at that time that Mr. Fox had retired from the Canada firm—I never knew that until long after the suspension—the account was then full; but if they had been prepared to discount part of the account, on the payment of that bill on 4th September, we should have been open again to that extent—there were acceptances running—a bill of theirs for 682<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., odd came due on 4th September—I believe that was the very largest bill in one lump that we ever had in the twelve years—they suspended on 3d September, and that bill was never paid—Mr. Hackwood, of the firm of Linklater and Hackwood, called on me on the evening of the 3d, and represented himself as solicitor to the bankrupts—in consequence of the interview with him and Mr. Lad<lb/>bury, I went, I believe, on the next day, the 4th, to their place of business, at London-wall, and found Mr. Braun and a gentleman who I had not the pleasure of knowing until this case, and who he introduced as Mr. Callisher, Kortoske's father-in-law—I understood his name to be Matthew—I had, in his presence, a conversation with Braun, and said that I was very sorry to find that they were obliged to suspend payment, he having intimated not very long ago that they were in a very good state—he replied that he had no doubt whatever, that if the debt due to them in Canada, which was a very heavy one, should turn out good, they had a surplus of several thousand pounds, and it would be merely a temporal arrangement for them—he said, also, that he had not had much to do with the books himself, and that Mr. Kortoske, his partner, had gone to Canada to look after this heavy debt—that is the prisoner Kortoske—I do not thing he mentioned what the amount of it was—while I was there, somebody applied to see Braun—I do</p>

               <p>not know who, but I think it was a creditor, from his manner—Braun appeared very nervous throughout the interview, and very agitated—he was evidently averse to see the party, but he did not say so—Callisher said to Braun, "What are you afraid of; are not you a man?" or words to that effect—I do not remember that Braun made any answer—I do not think he saw the party who wanted the interview while I was there—a meeting of creditors was called on 19th September following, at our City rooms for holding those public meetings—I attended it—neither of the prisoners were there—they were represented by Mr. Linklater—Kortoske at that time was said to be out in Canada—at my previous interview with Braun I told him I called in consequence of the communication of Mr. Hackwood—I saw Kortoske again in this country, to the best of my belief about the middle of November, when he returned—I then saw him at the office of Messrs. Lad<lb/>bury and Co. the accountants, and we had a lengthened interview, at which we made most express and particular inquiries (myself and my colleagues appointed by the committee of creditors, of whom I was one) as to what he had been doing in Canada, and how it was he came to go out without coming to consult any creditor—we begged him to give us the fullest infor<lb/>masion in his power as to the estate of Kortoske Brothers, on the other side, it being so large a component of our estate here—he gave us substantially no information about that house, after two hours' hard, and I regret to add, ineffectual attempts to get information—we knew at the first meeting that 36,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was due from the Canada firm—I asked him whether he had seen his brothers when abroad—he said that he had seen them, and had done his best to get information, and understood that they had promised detailed accounts through the accountant, Mr. Court, of Montreal, to whom a power of Attorney had been sent out by the official assignee, and that when those accounts came he would look them over, and see if they had omitted any<lb/>thing, when he should possibly be able to give some information—at that interview Mr. Baggally and Mr. Chadwick, my solicitor, and the Committee, and Mr. Sole, of Aldermanbury, were all present—knowing that large quan<lb/>tities of goods professed to have been sent through their house to Canada, I asked him many times what had become of them, and pressed him closely on that point—it was the gist of our inquiry—he said that he was unable to obtain much information, but he thought that goods had been deposited with various parties—we tried hard to get the names, but could not—he said that he went out to Canada to look after the large debt due to himself and partner—I told him that it would have been better if he had consulted some creditors before going; as a more usual proceeding—I asked him many times what chance there was of the debt being paid—he said, that as a power of attorney had been delegated to Mr. Court, in Canada, by the official assignee, he thought he was relieved from further duties, and therefore he at once came home—he said that he understood the firm in Canada were willing to make an assignment of their estate and effects, and pressed us to take it—we pressed him many times at that interview to make an offer of compen<lb/>sation to the creditors, which he declined—as a reason for urging him to make an offer, I told him that he could deal so much better with his brothers than we could—all this was after the September petition for arrangement—after it had been turned into bankruptcy, and I became an assignee, I again saw the prisoner, Kortoske, with Mr. Linklater and Mr. Ladbury, on 24th January—I do not think Braun was there—Kortoske made no com<lb/>munication about the assets that day that I remember—that day was the choice of assignees at the Court of Bankruptcy—I was over at the Court of</p>

               <p>Bankruptcy, and Kortoske came there with Mr. Linklater, and brought a parcel, which he said contained precious stones, and gave them into the care of Mr. Ladbury, the accountant, in my presence, saying that he had others as well, at London-wall, and the total value of the whole, including those at London-wall, and likewise some out with his two brothers, would be about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—the others which he mentioned were subsequently given up—from 19th September, when the petition for an arrangement was filed, down to that day, I had never heard a syllable about that property—I did not know that they had any dealings in precious stones, or I should have had no deal<lb/>ings with them—we had a meeting of assignees at Mr. Ladbury'a office early in February—I believe it was the 5th—I sent for Kortoske to attend me in my capacity of assignee—Mr. Boggallay and myself were there, and likewise Mr. Chadwick—we made the fullest inquiry of him respecting the estate of Kortoske Brothers, in Canada—the inquiry lasted, I believe, five hours, but we learned, I believe, substantially nothing—we heard nothing at that time from either of the prisoners respecting Bernard Kortoske, but in consequence of a letter, informing us that Bernard was over, the assignees sent for Kor<lb/>toske to the office of Sole and Turner, the solicitors, and told him that we were surprised to hear that his brother Bernard had come from Canada, as had previously promised that as soon as he arrived he would let us know, and we understood he had been in the country a fortnight or three weeks without letting us know—he appeared very nervous, and said that his brother Bernard should come round to me on the evening of that day, which he did—this was some time in February, 1862—it was then arranged that a meet<lb/>ing should be held at Messrs. Sole and Turner's office, of Benjamin Kortoske, the bankrupt, and Bernard, his brother, and on the following morning they came—Mr. Ladbury was present, and Mr. Baggallay and myself—a note of the conversation which transpired was taken, partly by Mr. Turner and partly by Mr. Ladbory—I had no official powers to look at the bankrupt's books; but about the middle, or latter end of January, 1862, I made a most critical examination of them—I had not then looked at them for several months—I did not, on the last occasion, see all the books which I had seen on the first occasion—I looked at them at Mr. Ladbury's office, and likewise at the solicitor's, and I missed a journal which I had before seen at Mr. Ladbury's—we went to Mr. Graham, the official assignee, whose clerk assisted us, and we made a search, but as far as I know it has not been found to this hour—it is, I should say, a book of very great importance.</p>

If I understand right, it was in Sep<lb/>tember, 1861, you were applied to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was; and I went to the premises and saw the books the same evening; 3d September—Mr. Kor<lb/>toske had not gone to Canada then, but he was not there; he had left—he, I believe, subsequently went to Canada, and returned—Mr. Braun only was there; and I was informed that he attended exclusively to the manufacturing department—he had nothing to do with the books—I have been told that he is not able to do much more than sign his name, and I believe it to be a fact—I do not think he is capable of keeping accounts, and I do not think he understands them—I know that Kortoske and his clerks managed all the export trade, except the manufacturing—I do not think Mr. Braun could give me any more information than about the goods in the warehouse—it was shortly after that that I made the first statement that was appended to the petition for a private arrangement—that was before Kortoske returned—I made it from such materials as I could, in his absence—since I made the account, and Kortoske has returned, the assets of the estate have been increased by the precious stones, and by the return of the Spanish stripes—those are not included in my return of assets—some car<lb/>peting has, I believe, also been added—Spanish stripes are cotton goods—I am not aware of assets to the amount of nearly 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being added since—the debts have lesseued, and the property has increased by 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I take the stock added since at 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the stones at about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—that is the value I put upon them—I have not taken pains to value them, but I know what the goods realized, and I heard Mr. Hennell give an opinion about the stones—I take my valuation from him—we sold the Spanish stripes—we thought we should lose about 30 per cent. and taking off that 30 per cent., they come to about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I do not know the amount of the carpeting—when I spoke of the debts last night, I took Wilhelms' as one of those, at 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., odd, but I only calculated him at 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I do not know that Wilhelms has settled that debt, and got his discharge from the assignees—in addition to the increase in the shipments from 1860 to 1861 of 7,893<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which repre<lb/>sents the amount of goods given by them to the firm in Canada, they paid on account of Kortoske, in 1860, 5,507<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—those two sums make 13,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—they paid for them in this year—I am quite certain of my accuracy there, because the account balances exactly with the ledger—this is the ledger, and here is the account—Fox and Co.'s account is not in the large ledger; it is transferred in December, 1860—I take the 13,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not from the old ledger,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270143"/>
               <p>but from Fox and Co.'s account—that sum represents payments for goods on account of Fox and Co.—that represents the whole transactions of the year, but not bill transactions as well—I understand it to include goods shipped and bought, and payments made on their account to large wholesale houses, but I do not think it would include bills accepted in their behalf—I know of no bill transactions in addition—I have not particularly looked to see, but I do not anticipate that there are any—I ascertained that, in 1860, Fox and Co. remitted 13,964<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was all they were liable for in 1860—I do not consider that Kortoske Brothers were in existence in 1860, because that account commenced in 1861—there was no separate account in 1860 with Kortoske Brothers—there was a remittance in 1860 when only one account existed—the 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., odd was to the general account—at the end of 1860 there was a balance, including interest, of 10,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—in 1864 they received a further remittance of upwards of 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with which they wrote off the debt of 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and appropriated the rest—when I speak of these shipments to Canada, I receive the whole of my data from entries in these books—every one of those shipments is entered—the account I made out on 14th Septem<lb/>ber, 1861, I took from the ledger—I did not go through the other books to see whether the ledger was correctly posted—a balance sheet was subsequently prepared, not by me, but under the superintendence of Mr. Hart, who was at one time a clerk under Mr. Pennell, the official assignee, and set up after<lb/>wards in business for himself as an accountant—the books were for a long time in his custody at Mr. Pennell's office—they first got into Mr. Hart's custody about January, I think, when they were absolutely declared bank<lb/>rupts—he very likely had access to them on the bankrupts' premises, but I never saw him there—it would be quite in the ordinary course if he did, as he was employed by them—there was a messenger nominally in possession of the books at the bankrupts' office, but the bankrupts had access to them, and Mr. Hart, or anybody else—they were not bankrupts then—it was a private arrangement—if Mr. Hart was making their balance-sheet, and found things not entered, he would enter them, but in blue or red ink, not black—that is the understanding with the official assignees—the books would not remain intact—it is understood that the bankrupt is to balance his own books—the accountant would in the ordinary course, if he finds things not entered, enter them himself, and there are a good many alterations here in blue ink—they carried on business after this petition, to some extent, and those transactions would be entered by their clerks—those entries would not be in blue ink—leaving the books in September, I should certainly expect to find some additions in January—taking all the accounts, the balance now due by Wilhelms is 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—I cannot say whether that is correct or incorrect—Tallerman's account is in the private ledger, folio 85—I did not look at that account in September—it was not on the premises, and Kortoske was not there at that time—I have examined the books, and that account exists in no other books but these two; it is not in the bill book—I have not seen this bill before (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I fancy this bill stamp is in September—I think it is 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—in this entry "170 Contra P.L." contra means "opposite"—it is entered 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 24th August in the petty ledger—I am not able to say whether this entry was there in September—I only made up my account from the books I had—I examined them carefully—a number of new accounts had been opened, but I did not see that a number of old accounts had been closed—I think you will find that from the beginning almost every account is open, except trifling ones—those which are closed are very unimportant—I have not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270144"/>
               <p>looked to see how many are closed—I can tell that they are unimportant, because I have looked at the books, but I have not counted them—it is probably more than a dozen—I am speaking entirely from guess—I believe the stamp on this bill is of a date subsequent to that upon the face of it—it appears to me very much like a 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have spoken of certain alternation since you saw the books in September, and additions and subtractions as might be; have you traced through the other books to see whether there is any foundation for their having been brought into the ledger? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have looked in the bill book, and this bill is not there—any alteration in the books would arise from having discovered a wrong entry—that would be discovered by looking at the bill book for it—we enter all bills from the ledger—with regard to Wilhelms I cannot tell whether the 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or the original amount is correct—I am not able to trace how the balance has been reduced to 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I think I found the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., transferred from the private cash book to the ledger—the private cash book is here—this small book the private ledger—here is an entry in it of cash, "June 27, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the account is very irregular, there is date after date, May comes after August there again—I find two sums of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—and here is an entry in the large ledger, "By acceptances on June, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—here is no entry in the private ledger on June 1, applicable to that, but here is an entry on June 27—June comes here after May, end May comes between two Jones—these entries in blue ink are made by the accountant—this is purely a cash transaction—they are so confused that you cannot trace them—after I had examined the books in September, there was a petition for a private arrangement—those proceedings are existing in the Court of Bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLIER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There is a certain 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in this ledger, and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the the other book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The entry is, "By cash, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." and here is "Petty cash;" and "By contra," and "By contra and cash;" so that you really cannot trace the figures—the figures in blue ink are Mr. Hart's—it is im<lb/>possible to make out what this "July 3d, 500<hi rend="italic">l.;"</hi> and "115" next to it, means—the 115 is made by a professional accountant, but a cash trans<lb/>action has no business in the goods ledger—according to me, Mr. Hart has acted improperly—the cash tranactions ought to be by themselves—there is "By cash, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." there; and I think you will find "To cash contra," which means nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> No; there is not; it is a delusion on your part, here is nothing of the sort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are lots of "contras," but perhaps you have got a wrong account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Here is "By cash, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." and "115;" and you say that I shall find per contra on the opposide side; where is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Here it is, "June 14th, per contra"—I do not know what that refers to—you will only find one 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., there, and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the other side—one is July 3d, and the other July 14th; I do not say that they are the same; I say that that confuses you—there is no "Per contra" to July 3d.</p>

I am a manufacturer, carrying on business at Wind<lb/>hill, near Leeds—I have an agent in London, named John Hart, who solicits orders for my firm—in consequence of a communication from him, I went with him on 4th August, 1861, to the house of business of Braun and Kor<lb/>toske—I had had no transactions with that house previously, and have had none since—I went on the subject of some Spanish stripes they were pro<lb/>posing to purchase—they were all woollen goods—I saw Kortoske—he</p>

               <p>looked at my patterns—he said that he had a customer for them, and could I leave him the patterns while he saw a customer for the Indian market, whom he had in the City, about them—I left then, and saw him again after<lb/>wards but he had not seen the customer—I saw him again, and he wanted me to send up ten or twelve pieces for the customer to look at, as he would rather see them in bulk—I did not decide at the moment, but went back to Yorkshire—I afterwards sent up twelve ends; twelve pieces, merely to look at, worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., each—he wrote down to me, and I came up, and we agreed for one lot at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a yard, and another at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—Iagreed to sell 100 yards, which would come to about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I saw him on 3d August—I returned on 16th August, and sent them on the 17th August—he got them on the 19th—he said, when I was in London, that he wanted them for a customer he had in the Indian market, and if I could supply him with the goods, he could do a large business—he was to have them on Monday, the 19th, as the vessel was going to sail on the Tuesday—I came up to town again about the 25th or 26th, called on Kortoske, and agreed to take a four months' bill for them—he said "I cannot pay you, unless you deduct 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for them; I have sold them to my customer, and have got 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., profit, which is very small; and, therefore, I want you to deduct 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said that I would not allow him 19 pence; I had rather have the goods back—he said "I cannot let you have the goods back, because I have sold them"—I got his bill at four months—I sent my bill up on 2d September—he accepted it, and sent it back—I got it on the 3d or 4th—the goods were light things, with a stripe running along the outside edge of the cloth—they were flannels, scarlets and yellows, magentas and blues—the stripe is a different colour—I sent them direct to Braun and Kortoske.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 34, Monkwell-street, and am agent for several manufacturers in the north of England, and among others for Mr. Willcox—I had only one transaction with the defendants as his agent; that was about August 20th—I called there to sell goods in the regular way, the same as I do at any other house—I took some patterns of Spanish stripes, and saw the prisoner Kortoske; he said, "They are the very things I have been looking for for some years, I can do a large trade with you, as I have a connexion in almost every part of the States," and I think he also mentioned Malta and India—as they were large shippers, I left him the patterns, and he gave me an order for two sample pieces of each colour—I called immediately on receipt of the goods, and saw him; he said, "Look in at half-past 4 o'clock"—I did so, and he said, "We cannot give you an answer to-day, as we have not seen the merchant"—Mr. Willcox then came up, and I made an appointment to see him next morning at half-past 10 o'clock—I saw him, and we were to call again in the afternoon—I did so; he came out and spoke to me first, and then his wife came out; she seemed rather active in the business, and anxious to buy goods—Kortoske gave me an order for 100 pieces, and said that they would take 300, and that they wanted them for shipping, and that they must be there on Monday or Tues<lb/>day morning, as the ship would sail, and they would be too late for the parties they were wanted for—he did not tell me what part of the world they were going to—after the goods were sent up, I saw him; he said that they were not as good as they ought to be, and wanted a reduction on them—eight or ten days after that I went to Britton's, the packers, in Basing<lb/>hall-street—I was told that the goods were there, but the men had gone to dinner, and the old man there would not let me see them—I act as agent for four or five other people besides Willcox, and have sold on their account to Braun and Kortoske—the first sale was in July, I believe, and the next in August—the first transaction was for four out of five of those persons, and the amount was altogether beyond 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—1860 was the first time we dealt with them as commission agents, and the goods were all paid for—I had no more difficulty, when I first went, in selling the goods than I have with anybody else—I found no greater readiness to buy goods till the end of August—I went one day, and they gave me an order for thirty pieces of black cloth, which I never solicited—I then began to be cautious, and never sold them any more, because they were bought in a very loose manner, such as no man, who meant to pay for the goods, would have done.</p>

I am a merchant and tailor, carrying on business at 14 and 15, Poultry—I have known the defendants fourteen or fifteen years—my clerk will produce my books—I cannot tell without them when I first began to do business with the defendants—I do not keep my own books—(<hi rend="italic">The books were given to the witness</hi>)—it was about April, 1861—I know, without my books, that I bought goods of them, and also took dry goods on consignment—my memory is so short that I cannot tell what amount of goods I have taken of them, as a purchaser, unless I look into figures—by receiving goods on commission I mean goods consigned to me, shipped at Barbadoes or Australia, or elsewhere, for their account—the terms are usually such as merchants receive, a commission of, say, 10 per cent., according to the time at which the return may come, also 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., per cent per annum, for bills drawn on their account—if an account is returned in six months, of course it would not be so much as 10 per cent; it all depends upon the distance; but my commission as a merchant is 10 per cent—the defendants did not employ me to sell goods for them abroad; they con<lb/>signed goods to me—I was responsible to them, and charged 10 per cent commission for the purpose of having them sold abroad for their interest, and to guarantee to return the profits of their goods—that is my charge—I am a foreigner, my lord, and I wish you would observe that I am used properly—it was at my option, if the goods were not returned in twelve months, to charge 10 per cent.—I cannot say whether that was the arrange<lb/>ment, because it is so long ago, but that is my charge—I do not think I made a specific bargain with them—I do not think they intrusted me with the goods without asking my charge; but the parties are here, and they know what business is, and whether that is the usual charge or not—I have never been asked for account sales, and they have not come forward yet, but I have some, though I have not been asked for them by the assignees, or any one—some have not yet come at all, but I got some about a month ago—I continued to do business with the defendants up to 1862; the last goods I received were about August, 1862—there was no time to make up any account before their failure; the only account made up was when I received the notice from the assignees respecting it, which amounted to l,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for which I gave them a cheque, and there was a balance besides in my pocket—I remember receiving some stripes—all the communication I had with the defendants about them was, that Mr. Callisher produced an order to me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I advanced 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on it on conditions for me to consign the goods to India; at least, to the East Indies—they remained on my premises, because I could not get any merchant to take them, in consequence of their beings so dear, and the colours did not suit the market—at the time they were delivered to me I had no ship for them, and had made no arrangement—I tried to make arrangements; I showed the patterns to different merchants, and they would not suit the price of the market—Mr. Collins paid me the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by cheque,</p>

Braun and Kortoske—I advanced the defendants two-thirds of the cost price on the goods—I should be very glad to get fifty per cent. on some goods—that is more than anybody would advance for that—I charge the amount—I sometimes advance cash upon goods, and sometimes bills—I do not understand anything about accom<lb/>modation bills—I am referring to my giving bills to them occasionally, by way of advance on the goods, instead of actual cash—to the best of my belief, I never gave them any other bills—I should not call those accommoda<lb/>tion bills; you may as well call the Bank of England notes accommodation bills—I do not call these accommodation bills at all; I have goods to represent them—I do not know whether I gave up the stones a considerable time before the bankruptcy—all I know is, that when Mr. Kortoske came back from Canada, I had not disposed of those stones, and I returned them to him as soon as he came back, having had my 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., back for the Spanish stripes, and there was an end of the transaction—I could not get a price for the stones from several first-rate merchants of the City of London, and gave them back—he put a high value upon them, but very likely he had been deceived, not knowing anything about them—I suppose, if you were to give</p>

I know the prisoner—I first knew him six years ago; at that time he was a married man—I lost sight of him after that until July last—he was then a widower—he was brought to me by the in<lb/>terference of some of his working mates, and I was introduced to him at the house of one of his workmates—I think that was the first Sunday in July last—there was some conversation then in which the prisoner proposed marriage to me—I at first consented, and the banns were afterwards twice published—after that something came to my knowledge about him, and I refused to marry him, on account of his character, it was not satisfactory—I told him so—I have a brother named Alexander—I went with him and my mother to see the prisoner—we told him what we had heard, and wished to have no further intercourse with him; notwithstanding that, he came to me again—I told him at one time that I was of a different religion, and I also told him on that occasion that I would have nothing further to do with him—on Tuesday, 26th August, I went to his sister's at Rotherhithe, soon after 6 in the evening—whilst I was there the prisoner came in, about quarter-past 7—I started between 8 and 9 to go home—the prisoner came with me—I objected to his coming with me, but he came—he came with me to High-street, Deptford, and I again objected—I wished him to leave me and go home, and allow me to go home—he still continued with me—I went into the Broadway, Deptford, and I again entreated of him to leave me, as it was getting very late, and I said I was afraid if my brother met him they would quarrel, finding me in his company—he continued arguing with me, and my brother was at work at a sewer in the Broadway and overheard me, and called out to me by name, and asked if that was me—I said it was—my brother came up and asked the prisoner why he prevented me from going home—he said he wished to speak to me—my brother said there could be nothing very important to say that night, and if he wished to speak to me he was to see me next day, and whatever he might wish to know he should have all the requisite information from my brother and myself—my brother and the prisoner then took some beer together—the prisoner offered it two or three times, and at last a witness fetched it, and they both drank—my brother was called away to his work—the prisoner at this time was talking very loud—I told him to leave me, that I did not wish any further company or conversation with him—he said he would not leave me till he had spoken to me—I said, "You can have nothing to say to me to-night, for your conduct clearly proves what you are, and I have now reason to believe that some part of what I have heard of you is true"—he said, "I want to know your inten<lb/>tion"—I said, "My intention is, after this night, to have nothing further to say to you"—he turned round, and said something to the effect that he would have my life, and I received one or two successive blows in the chest, towards the left breast—I could not see what the blows were struck with—for a few moments I stood, and then I found I could stand no longer, and I supported myself against the side of a shop—in the struggle my shawl came on, and I found that I was bleeding—I went back with a view of getting my shawl, where I knew it had fallen off, and the prisoner again rushed at me—I raised up my right arm and he stabbed me through the muscle of my arm—I then knew it was a knife, and told him so—I said, "You are stabbing</p>

I have got a good many shots in my bead now, and a great many in the body, and whenever I get a drop of drink it takes my seuses away. I do not remember being taken, or anything at all about it; all I know is that I kept company with this young woman, and I gave her money, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at one time, to buy what she wanted, and I bought the ring; I gave 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for it, and she has got it; I gave it her to take care of till such time as we were married. Then, another night after that, I gave her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., more, and money to buy different things for the house. After she got the money she set up to laugh and jeer at me, and always pretended she would keep my company as usual, and get married to me. This night I was drunk and knew nothing about it. My belief is, that what the policeman says is wrong; or if I did say what he says it was through his ill-usage, for I was insensible at the time. I did not feel myself in my right senses for three days afterwards, from the blows I had on my head.</p>

I am the wife of James Eastham, who keeps the Military Train Arms beer-house, High-street, Woolwich—the prisoner, accompanied by a person named Sawtree, came there on 13th October, about half-past 5 o'clock—I had known Sawtree some four or five months before—he has frequently been to the house—the prisoner asked where my husband was—I said he was out, and they said they would return in about ten minutes' time—they went away—I went into the bar-parlour to prepare my money for the brewer—I put down one sovereign and two half-sovereigns for the brewer, on the bar-parlour table—I was called out to the bar to serve a customer, and left the money there—while I was away, William Hall, a young man employed there as a musician, went into the parlour with some tea things—I saw him come out, and as he came out the prisoner and Saw<lb/>tree returned—he made way for them to pass him—the prisoner went into the bar-parlour first—Sawtree remained at the bar with me to ask me to send for some beaf steaks—I did so, and on my turning round, after he had given the order, he went into the bar-parlour to the prisoner—I turned and saw the gas was not lighted there; it was lighted in the bar, and the light was sufficient to see anything on the bar-parlour table—they ordered two</p>

               <p>glasses of ale—I went and drew them, and changed a half-sovereign for Sawtree—that put me in mind of my own gold—I turned to the table to take it up, and it was gone—I asked Sawtree if he had taken it up by mis<lb/>take among the change he had taken from the table—he said, "No;" and showed me the change to convince me that he had not—I had not given the prisoner any change—I then turned to the prisoner and asked him if he had by any mistake taken up the money from the table in any change he might have had there—he said he had no change to take up, and he said to Sawtree, "You know, William, when I came into this room I had but two and six-pence in my pocket"—I said that the money could not be out of the room—I took a candle to look on the floor, but could not find it—I afterwards went up to speak to Hall, after which I came down—I conversed with these two about it, both before and after I went upstairs—my husband came downstairs with me, and William Hall also—a policeman was sent for—the prisoner then went out at the front door and ran down the street—he was followed by William Hall's brother and the policeman, and brought back—I was not present when he was searched.</p>

I brought from home with me a shilling, and I got a savereign on my way at a house I called at, and changed the sovereign when at the London-bridge station. I got half a sovereign in change for the sovereign, and, when I got to Woolwich, Sawtree took me, to a house to have a beef-steak and a glass of ale. He told me the people of the house were acquaint<lb/>ances of his, and we should get it properly attended to. The landlady asked us through the middle room into the bar-parlour. Sawtree called for a pint of ale, and had some conversation with the landlady; there was no light in the room. Supposing Sawtree had got no money, I said I would pay for the pint of ale, and I gave him half a sovereign to pay for it, and the landlady brought in the change and put it on the table. Sawtree shoved the money to me, and said, 'That is your change.' I took the money up and put it into my pocket; I did not examine it. A little while after, we were drink<lb/>ing the ale; the landlady came in, and Sawtree asked her about the steak. She said she had to send for it. She then went to light the gas, and Sawtree assisted her, and she then said she had missed, I don't know whether she said 'two sovereigns' or 'a sovereign and two half-sovereigns.' Sawtree got up and asked her if she was quite certain she left it there, and she said she was. I said I did not see it, but, as there were no others there, she had a right to have us both searched; I told her I was quite willing for it to be done to me. She went upstairs and left us in the parlour, and some time after that</p>

               <p>her husband and these other two men came down. I told the husband I was willing to have my pockets examined, and after that the constable came in. We were then brought to the station, and I had no knowledge whatever that there was any gold in my pocket. The only way in which I can account for the money is, that it was taken up in the change when it was pushed over to me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, living at 13, Church-street, Greenwich—on Saturday last the prisoner Meadows was in my employ as errand boy—I have a warehouse at the back of my shop—in consequence of some losses, I marked eleven bladders of lard, by the instruc<lb/>tions of a policeman, but not in his presence, and put them in the ware-house last Saturday morning—between 8 and 9 that evening the policeman came to me bringing the two prisoners and a bladder of lard, which was mine, and was one of the eleven that was marked, and safe in my warehouse in the morning—there is a back door from my warehouse, so that any one might go out of it without passing through the shop—I had not sold nor authorized any one to sell any lard from the warehouse—the bladder of lard is worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 122). Last Saturday night I was in North-street, Greenwich, where the female prisoner and her husband keep a marine store shop—I saw Meadows come out from there—I stopped him and asked him what he had been there for; he made no reply—I took him back into the marine store shop, where I saw two little children sitting by the fire in the shop—I asked where their father and mother were; they made no reply—I went into the back room, and saw a light up the staircase—I called to some one up stairs; the female answered—I then took the boy up-stairs and met the female prisoner on the landing—I asked her what the boy had brought there; she made no reply—I then took the boy on to the landing and said, "What does he do here? he has been here for some pur<lb/>pose"—she then went into the back room, which was a sort of lumber room, full of rags and bones and different articles; she said, "Come in here and I will give it you"—I followed her in and she took this bladder of lard from among some rags and handed it to me—I said to the boy, "Is this what you</p>

               <p>have brought?"—he said, "Yes"—we went down stairs, and I asked where the husband was—Noakes said he was not at home—I asked the boy, in her presence, if he had ever been to the shop before—he said he had—I asked him what induced him to go there—he said that Noakes' husband had asked him to get some fat—he said, "A few days after, I brought a bladder of lard"—I asked him what was paid for it—he said, "One dulling"—that was for the first of the six; he said he had been there six times and had taken six bladders, for each of which he had received one shilling, each bladder weighing from 8lbs. to 10lbs.—this was all in Noakes' presence—I asked him whether he had ever taken anything else—he said, "Yes," he had also taken a quantity of chaff and corn to Noakes' husband—I then asked Noakes to to go to the station with me; she began to cry and said she could not go, as she had no shawl to put on till her husband came home—the boy said to me, in her presence, that he had not been paid for this lard; that he was to call on Sunday morning for a shilling—Noakes, at the same time, said that she had not bought the bladder of lard; she had not paid for it—I said, "That's no matter at all about paying for it; I found it in your premises concealed"—on looking round, I saw her shawl hanging on the bed—I said, "Here is your shawl; put it on, and come with me"—she did so—on going outside the door, I met her husband—he said, "What is all this about; what's the matter?"—I then told him that the boy was in custody for stealing a bladder of lard, and his wife in custody for receiving it—he said, "I know nothing about it"—the boy repeated his former statement in the presence of the husband and the female prisoner—she said nothing then, but the husband said he had never had anything of the sort, and had never received anything—the boy said, "Yes, you have; and more than that, you have sent a little boy up into the Mews to ask me to get some chaff and corn for your donkey"—he denied that he knew of anything of the sort—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bladder of lard—Meadows made a similar statement at the police-station.</p>

I live at Mr. Riddington's, a baker, at Lewisham, three or four minutes' walk from the last witness—on 2d October, about twenty minutes past 6 in the evening, the prisoner came and asked for some pastry—I said that I had only one tart left—she said, "Have you no more of any kind whatever?"—I said, "No"—she bought a bun and a tart, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and put a shilling into my hand, which I held for it as she did not give it to me directly—I tried it with my teeth, and found it bad—I said, "This is a very bad shilling"—she said, "Is it, ma'am; if it is, I had better take it back and change it, for I have just taken it with another one at a public-house below here"—while I was trying it she said, "Here is another; will you take that?"—Mr. Eedle then put his head in at the shop-door and said, "Mind how you take money to-night, for a woman has just given Mrs. Williamson a bad shilling"—I said, "Is this the woman, for she has just given me a bad shilling?"—he said, "I do not know; but if you get any one to send for Mrs. Williamson, I dare say she can tell you"—the prisoner</p>

               <p>said, "I am sure it is not me, for I have given no one any bad money to-night and do not mind waiting"—I told my shop-boy, Stubbs, to go to Mrs. Williamson, and Eedle directed him where to go—the prisoner passed between him and the door and went out of the shop—I said, "The woman is going," and Eedle caught her by her shoulder—she said, "You are not going to keep me," and resisted him very much, left her shawl in his hand, and went away—I wrapped the shilling up in paper, and put it in my pocket till Fox came, when I gave it to him—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was gaslight in my shop.</p>

I am in Mr. Riddington's service—Miss Lokar called me from my tea, on 2d October, and I found the prisoner in the shop, and Mr. Eedle between the shop and the street—Miss Lokar said that the prisoner had given her a bad shilling, and told me to fetch Mrs. Williamson—I went to do so, but turned the wrong way—I saw the prisoner get away, leaving her shawl in Eedle's hands—I ran after her, and kept her in view all the time, for nearly a quarter of a mile; she was stopped by a gentleman at Vicarage-terrace—as we took her to the station, I saw her put her hand through some railings—we met Fox, and gave the prisoner into his custody.</p>

I was on duty at the Victoria Theatre, on the night of Monday, 13th October, at the front door—the prisoner called to me at the door, and brought a bad sixpence—she said the last witnesses gave it to her little boy in change—I saw him immediately afterwards—he came to the door to me, and said the little boy had given it to him—I then asked the woman to go for the little boy—she went into the pit and sat down, and did not come back again—about five or six minutes afterwards, in consequence of something Cundle told me about another piece of money, I went into the pit, and found the prisoner sitting about four seats from the stage, and the little boy sitting by her side—I brought her out, and she was charged with passing a bad shilling as well as a sixpence—she said she had not done so—these are the coins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked her what money she had got about her, and she handed me her purse—I examined the contents, and found six good shillings, a good half-crown, a bad shilling, and two bad sixpences—going towards the station, I asked what she had got in her hands, and she handed me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in copper money—at the station she was handed over to the female searcher to be examined, and a short time afterwards the searcher, in the prisoner's presence, handed me over a bad sixpence and a halfpenny, and said she had got it from the prisoner's pocket; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner said nothing to that—there is a parade-ground adjoining the station—it was near half-past 10 when the prisoner was brought to the station—she was left perhaps a couple of minutes in the parade-ground, but not by herself; one of the reserve men who was on duty was left in charge of her; I don't know his name; he is one of the A reserve men—on the following morning L 185 pointed out a spot to me—I was not there when anything was found.</p>

I am a porter, at 24, Brunswick-street, St. John-street-road—two or three months ago the prisoner called on me with a young gentleman—he asked me to go and take a drop of something to drink with him—I did so—after we had had the drink, he asked me if I knew where he could get a lodging, saying that he had got a fortnight's holiday—I said I knew a public-house where I always took a friend of mine from the country, very comfortable people, Mrs. Moore's—he said, "Oh, I know Mrs. Moore very well"—he went there and ran up a score of about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in my name—he said he would get some money on the Monday morn<lb/>ing, and come round and pay me in the evening, if I would let him have anything he wanted—I agreed, and paid his bill, but he did not come for a fortnight afterwards—he then came with a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and wanted me to give him the difference out of it—I said I had not money enough to do so—we went to Mr. Wright's, a publican, but he would not change it—we then went to Mr. Langridge's, where he bought a waistcoat, changed the cheque, and paid me my 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,</p>

I am a mat-maker, of 3, Folly-court, Dockhead—in De<lb/>cember last, I was in the employment of Mr. Kompster, of Charles-street, a carman and chandler—there was about two tons of rope in his shed, some months before Christmas, which were put in the van—it was not covered</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270176"/>
               <p>over—Kempster helped me to remove it to Mr. Learey's, 175, Rotherhithe-street. I believe it is—we left it there, and came away—on 18th February last, I was doing a job for Mr. Kempster, between 8 and 9 in the evening—I took the van out by Mrs. Kempster's directions, and went to the Green Man, Jamaice-level, opposite the London Ropery Company's factory—in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, Bassett and another man, I do not know whether it was Stokes, came to me—I knew that Bassett was in the employ of the Ropery Company; and in consequence of what he said, I backed into the gates of the Ropery Company, when he opened them, and about two tons of rope were loaded upon my ran, which I took to Mr. Kempster's stables; next morning, in consequence of directions given to me, I went with the van and rope to the George, in the Commercial-road, by my master's directions—some man, who I do not know, came up to me, from a street by the side of the George, and spoke to me, and I followed him with the van to the Stone-stairs, Ratcliff—I do not see him here—he went into a public-house, facing Mr. Willis's, and brought two other men out of there—a man named Gray, and Mr. Bigford, came up, and we all went into Willis's—the man who I had followed, and the young man who belonged to Mr. Willis, came out and took over a ton of the rope out—I then went to Mr. Vane's—Mr. Gray, I think, gave me instructions to do so—the same men went on with me there, and the rest of the rope was delivered there—I then went home to my master, and told him where I had been.</p>

               <p>to go—he did not answer me—I put that question three times, and he then asked me if I knew the London Ropery Company—I said I knew where their premises were—he said, "It is not so far as that"—we passed a public-house, at the door of which a man was standing, and the prisoner asked that man to get the key, and he brought it, as I suppose, out of the public-house—it turned out to be the key of Kempster's place, where the rope was—one of the two, I can't say which, opened the place—we did not go through the chand<lb/>ler's shop to get to where the rope was—I inquired the price of the rope—I think the prisoner said it was 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a cwt.—I said that was too much, that I thought 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., was sufficient—he said it was cheap at 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—I did not purchase any—it was really very cheap indeed at 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—I had some reason to believe whose rope it was when I spoke, and I believed it was stolen, and I endeavoured to bring down the price—it was so cheap, that I thought it was stolen—I believed it was the London Ropery Company's rope—in my belief, that rope was worth between 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—I went away, and told Turner my suspicions—I met the prisoner in Billiter-square, in the City, a week or ten days after—he stopped me, and said that he had not disposed of the rope, and if I would induce Messrs.

I live at Willoughby-terrace, Stockwell, and am a master mariner, and brother of the last witness—in consequence of what he said to me, I went with him to Kempeter's place, and asked to see the rope there—we did not see it that day—the woman who said she was Mrs. Kempster would not let us see it, and we went away—two days afterwards, as I was standing in Tower-street, a person came up and spoke to me about it—I cannot say who that was—I cannot say that I have seen</p>

               <p>him since, for I did not take much notice of him—I do not believe the prisoner is the person—the person took me to see the rope at Kempster's—I saw a quantity of rope there, which, in my judgment, belonged to the Ropery Company—I am conversant with rope, and with their rope—I was certain it belonged to that company—it was ship rope, not worth more than 38<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—there was a small quantity of lead line, which was worth considerably more.</p>

On 20th February last, I went with a search-warrant to Kempster's premises, 20, Charles-street, Bermondsey—it was a cart-shed, close to a stable, in a court—it was not near a shop—there was no appearance of a rope business being carried on there—I found two coils of rope there, which were afterwards identified by Mr. Hounsell—I did not show them to Mr. Urling Smith—they were also shown to Mr. Spratt, who was with me—it was I who took Kempster in custody—when I saw the rope, I took the person in whose stables I found it, in custody; I took charge of the rope also—after the conviction of Kempster and the others, it was given up to the London Ropery Company—I after<lb/>wards apprehended Bassett, and another officer, who was with me, appre<lb/>hended Stokes at the same time—I have been seeking the prisoner ever since—I have not a warrant for his apprehension—I apprehended him last Wednesday evening, the 22d—I obtained a certificate of a true bill against him at this Court, and presented it to the Magistrate—I knew where he lived, and went there after him—I employed persons, and had his house watched.</p>

               <p>meeting persons he was connected with in the guano trade at the Railway Tavern, Fenchurch-street—he said, "I know a house that is temporary difficulties, and can you dispose of some rope; I know that you are a com<lb/>mission agent for the sale of rope"—I said, "If you can bring me the samples and the price, I will endeavour to sell it"—he afterwards brought me the samples, and a list of the number of coils, and their sizes—that must have been the early part of the year; February, I think—I told him the market price was 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a cwt., cash; and, according to the samples, I thought I could get near that price for staple cordage made from clean hemp, such as the samples were; that I could not attend to it myself exactly, but I would place the samples and the list in a general shipbroker's office named Turner, in Tower-street, to sell, which he agreed to, and I made an arrange<lb/>ment with Mr. Turner, who said that he knew a young man from the country who was a good judge of rope; that was Mr. Gilchrist—I told the prisoner if he would meet me at Mr. Turner's office there would be a com<lb/>petent judge to look at the rope, and report to Turner if he could sell the rope at the price—I met Gilchrist on Monday morning, by appointment, at Turner's office—the prisoner was downstairs—I do not think he came into the office—the prisoner took us to Kempster's, at Dockhead, where the property was lying—I had not seen or known Kempster before—I saw a quantity of rope there—it lay dormant several days, and, when I saw Evans, he told me that the party belonging to the rope, the ropemaker, had an order come in, and had taken the rope back again to execute the order, and therefore Turner could not sell it, which I communicated to Turner—he brought me some samples again, and said that the house was still in difficulties, and could I dispose of a lot, and he brought a list of the number of coils—I said, "Yes, I would try and do so"—I had got a buyer who would take three or four, or half a dozen coils, but he would not divide the bulk, and the buyer would not take the whole—I said that it was a party he knew very well, named Bigford, a large ship-chandler—he said, "If you can get it sold by a ship-chandler, you shall have all above 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for your profit"—Bigford and I then agreed to see some ship-chandlers—Bigford supplies ship-chandlers with naptha; he introduced it to the ship-chandlers with the understanding that he should have half the commission that I received—Bigford knew the prisoner, and knew the party he was in connexion with in the guano way—Bigford effected a sale with Willis, a ship-chandler, who agreed to take a ton at 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a cwt,—I told the prisoner, if he would bring the rope the following morning, according to sample, it could be sold to Willis, and he could take the money—he did so—I first saw the rope at Willis's door in the van—Willis's foreman would only take a portion—he bought about eleven cwt., and this receipt was given, signed by me—the prisoner filled up the body of it while I was calculating what it would come to—I knew no other principal in the transaction—I had never seen the prisoners I was tried with, only this prisoner—excepting the commission, which I shared with Bigford, the prisoner received every farthing of the money—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., was left, after having some refreshment—I gave him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I received the other 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,</p>

I live at Southampton-street, Camberwell, and am a whip-maker—on 24th September the prisoner came to me and offered me this sample of grease (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), saying there were twenty-four casks lying at the Nine Elms station—he asked me 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a cwt. for it, and I bought it—he said there would be charges to pay; would we pay them, or deduct it from the amount—he did not say what amount—I gave my carman 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man who came.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was there anyone else there at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; several persons about—the charges were to be paid out of the bulk of the money for the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Havil-street, Camberwell, and am carman to the last witness—on 24th September I saw the prisoner at my master's premises—my master gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to pay the charges on some grease at the Nine Elms station—I drove the prisoner there in the cart—he went into the booking-office and came out again with a paper in his hand—he said he had found the number and the truck, and they were down on the mid-line—he then said he would go and see what the charges came to—he went in, came out again, and said, "They come to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I gave him three sovereigns and a half-crown, and he went away—he went down on one side of the trucks and I went the other—he said he would go and fetch the porter who was to deliver the grease—he went away, and I never saw him again till I saw him at the Police-court—I am quite positive he is the man—I could swear to him from a hundred.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, at Fulham—on Saturday, 13th September, the prisoner came to my house and showed me a sample of grease in a box, and said he had got fourteen casks lying at the South Western Railway station, which he wanted to dispose of—I asked him about it—he gave satisfactory answers, and I agreed to buy it—he asked me if I could fetch them then—I said, "No; it was no good to go then, because the railway would be closed "—I saw no more of him till Monday morning, at 6 o'clock—I saw him go by my window—my man came to me about two minutes afterwards and I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to pay the railway charges on the goods—my man is here; his name is Henry Chambers.</p>

I am a porter at the Nine Elms station—I have seen the prisoner once on the premises—on 14th September I was spoken to by the witness Chambers—there were not fourteen casks of grease at the station then—I made inquiries from what he said to me, and there were no casks of grease at all there—I was also spoken to by Callum on 24th September—I made inquiries—there were no casks of fat there then—I also had a conversation with Ford—there were no casks for delivery at that time.</p>

I am head porter at the Nine Elms goods station—there was no grease, or bones, or glue, there for delivery about 15th, 19th, or 24th, that I am aware of—I think I should have known if there was—I saw the prisoner there on 24th, to the best of my belief—I am not in a position to swear he is the party—he came and asked me about some empty casks from Portsmouth which ought to have arrived two months previous—I examined the books, and made inquiries of the clerk respecting them—he did not ask me anything about any fat—I could learn nothing about the empty casks.</p>
