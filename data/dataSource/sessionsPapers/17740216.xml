There is one thing very particular; there were three remnants of different colours, two blues I think, but different in point of shade, and there was likewise a pink coloured remnant; they were that day all three on one block; I am very sure they were in the shop; I had seen them just before in the window.

On Sunday the 19th of January I went out to dinner; when I came home, about ten o'clock at night, I was informed by my daughter, who I left at home, that my house had been broke open; I lost my coat, and some excise books which were in my pocket; a sheet, and a bed gown were taken off the bed, and there was a pair of spectacles in my coat pocket; they were all in a back parlour on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any marks of violence done your house?</p>
               <p>Warner. No. Mr. Kenrick gave me my pocket book, about ten o'clock the same night, at Justice Welch's. My spectacles and two excise books were in the pocket book. Mr. Kenrick, the gentleman that took the prisoner, came and informed me of it that night; soon after I got home, he produced the books, which I claimed as my property. I went with Mr. Kenrick to a public house in Broad St. Giles's; there I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing?</p>
               <p>Warner. No. I went home, and the next morning went to Justice Welch's, at about eleven or twelve o'clock; there I saw my black coat and these books, and my spectacles. The prisoner there said he met an acquaintance that gave them to him; this is the coat (producing it); when I went out to dinner it was lying on the bed in this back parlour; when I went out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160005"/> I locked the door of that room; this pocket book was in the pocket at that time.</p>
               <p>- Horner . I am the prosecutor's daughter: my father went out about twelve o'clock; I staid at home till about one, then I went to church.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock the door?</p>
               <p>Horner. I pulled the door after me; it is always on the latch. After I returned from church, and had drank tea, I read a chapter; I thought I heard the door open; it is always on the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the parlour door locked then?</p>
               <p>Horner. I cannot say that; my father left the key with me. I went into the parlour about five o'clock to shut the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the coat was there?</p>
               <p>Horner. I did not look upon any thing of that sort; I cannot be sure whether I shut the parlour door or not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you thought you heard a noise and the door unlatch?</p>
               <p>Horner. Between six and seven; after I had read the chapter I thought I would go and see whether the door was fast; I went up and found the chamber door open; that was about seven o'clock; the street door was open too; I heard somebody in the parlour, and when I came up stairs I saw a man run out, and run into the street; he seemed a more bulkey man than the prisoner; I cannot be sure; I was greatly frightened; I ran out after him to the street door; I knocked at the door; I was so frightened it took my speech away; we went in directly as soon as the neighbours came; I missed nothing at that time but the sheet off the bed; I did not miss it till Kenrick came. The bed top and sheet are my father's property; they were upon the bed in the back parlour.</p>

Seeing the book contained entries of candles, we went to a tallow chandler's, who sent to an excise-man in the neighbourhood, who knew it to be Horner's; by that mean it was I went to Horner's.</p>

            . I am a constable: I took up the women on Wednesday the 19th of January, at nine o'clock at night. I was sent for and informed there was a house broke open; I went, and found a great many people in the house, and the prisoner Lewis sitting on a bed; I was informed they had robbed the next house. I asked them if they had searched them; they said they had not; I saw Lewis had a small key in her hand; she got up; I searched her, but found nothing upon her of any consequence; she sat down again on the bed; I asked her what was become of the key she had in her hand; she said she had none; I made her get up and found it on the bed (producing it.)</p>
               <p>- Tate. It is the key of my husband's case which he had on board of ship; it was in my room.</p>
               <p>The prisoners, in their defence, said they knew nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Stanford called six witnesses who had known her a great many years, and gave her a good character.</p>

I took him to my master, and then he said he was not the man I took the coat from; (the coat produced). My master's name was wrote on the lining of the pocket by the man that made it.</p>

I returned home about twelve o'clock; the prisoner was in the shop; I examined the till and missed some of the marked money they told me they had laid out. I keep the key in my own possession; I never suffer any body to give change out of it; there is a hole to put the silver through; the shillings were marked with a notch in the edge above the head; there were three missing; I sent the prisoner over to Mr. Collyer to get change for a ten pound note, and followed him immediately, and desired him to go into the compting house; Mr. Collyer was there. I then told him I had lost money several times, and believed he was dishonest; he said he wondered I should think so; I said I had reason for it; I asked him how much he had in his pocket; he said he believed about twelve shillings and a guinea and a half; I desired to see the silver, and he took it out, and laid it down on the desk; we looked at it, and Mr. Collyer picked out a shilling that he had marked about an hour before, and sent to my shop; there were two other marked shillings that were laid out by Mr. Hughes; then he begged I would forgive him; I told him I had lost money several times and was determined to make an example of the first I could detect. On his cross examination, he said he did not recollect whether they were queen Annis shillings or no; that he did not know how much ought to be in the till; that if he had a fancy to the shillings, and put others in the room, it would have been the same; that he could not tell whether any shillings were put in the room of the marked ones .</p>

While we were talking of this, this young man, the 'squire, as they called him, came up; he walked about the room and laid down a guinea on the table, and told the prisoner he might take it up if he pleased; the prisoner said no, he did not want it, I have money enough; upon which the 'squire and another began gaming, by naming a piece of money put under a candlestick; the 'squire lost, and then he said, with an oath, I have got among a parcel of barbers, taylors, and weavers, they have not one of them got any money; I will give every one a shilling for every guinea he can produce; upon which every one of the company, the prisoner with the rest, pulled out what money they had, and put it down on the table; then I pulled out my sixteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the 'squire give you the sixteen shillings?</p>
               <p>Leman. No. I was going to put my money in my pocket as the rest had done; upon which a man there, that said he was the landlord, catched hold of my hand, and said, let me have it, you shall have it again, but don't tell my wife; I have lost a good deal, but I will let you have it again; they made some motions among them, and then he said he had lost the money; he said he would give it me, and called me out to the door; by the time we had got about ten yards from the house, the landlord ran away; then I turned back and found the candles were all put out, and every one of them were gone; I enquired of the landlady what was become of them; she said she knew none of them, she never saw them before in her life. I did not tell them I had lost any thing, or make any particular complaint, but went next morning and enquired at the house, and somebody told me the names of them I believe, and I got a warrant; this was about four or five days before the man was taken up. The prisoner was the first man that began the gambling.</p>

             . I am a ticket porter. On the 25th of January, at night, about ten minutes before six o'clock, half a firkin of butter was delivered to me ; I put it into the boot of the coach; I saw Brown by; he was attending upon some passengers while it was put in; there was some cheese, I cannot tell how much; the prisoner took it out of the boot of the coach; I was at some distance, and the prisoner's back towards me; I saw him deliver it to another person, who went off with it as far as the head of the horses; the passengers were on the near side , and the prisoner on the off side; the prisoner in stepping back from the place, after he had delivered it out, tumbled down between the wheel and the wheel iron; upon this I saw the man go as far as the horses; I ran up and caught him; at first there was a great tustle between me and the man that had the butter; for the prisoner calling out, the man came from the horses heads and put the butter into the boot; then he came and hit me with a stick over my arm, and numbed me so that I could not keep my hold; upon that I changed hands and took hold of him with the other hand; we fought together some time; at last I took him away, and then he went to where Brown was, who was gone to call the passengers; I had a tustle with him again, and threw him down; I got more assistance and secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same cask that was carried away?</p>
               <p>Gadsden. I had marked it. ( Looks at the bottom for the mark).</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you made it?</p>
               <p>Gadsden. Not when it went away but when Mr. Brown brought it back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it?</p>
               <p>Gadsden. I read the direction when it went down; I always do; I cannot exactly tell you the gentleman's name, but I am sure it is John somebody, Esq; at Greenwich, or some such name. I did not see his face at that distance to distinguish it, but could have seen any body at that distance that did take it out; but at the time that he took it out he slipped down; I am very-sure that he is the man. When I took the prisoner he said that he was only going to get hay out of the boot for his rabbits.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who said he sold-oranges and lemons, and bore a very good character.</p>

I said I know Mr. Swan very well, you are not him.

I was at Mr. Dodson's in Charter-house-lane; I drank rather too much; the prisoner came in and asked me to drink part of a pint, and said he would have a pint with me; we staid till ten, then they would draw no more liquor; from thence we went to the Wheatsheaf in Fleet-market; there we had two pots; I paid for them; the prisoner had no money, but said he would get money enough before he went home to give me my money back ; as we were coming down Peter-street we saw the alley door open; I stopped to case myself; the prisoner passed me, and said stop a bit for me; I lost him for ten or twelve minutes; then I heard a great noise in the passage; the alley door was open before I went to it; I do not know what the prisoner did there.</p>

               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Here, Warren, I will read the account you gave before the Justice; there you said Walsom told you he would be d - d if he went home without some money; Walsom went up an alley in company with me, between Cow Cross and Saffron Hill; Walsom pulled down a window light belonging to a shop, and another light belonging to a wash-house of one Hawkins, a widow, both which places were adjoining to the dwelling house, and that Walsom in your sight went into the wash-house window; Walsom told you he could not get in at the other window, and upon bearing a woman cry out, you two made off together as soon as Walsom came out of the wash house window, and Walsom left a stick in the wash-house that he borrowed of you; was that account then, or the account you have now given, the true one?</p>
               <p>Warren . I did mention to Justice Girdler that he might let the window down for what I knew, and might be in for what I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you told a lie before him?</p>
               <p>Warren. I said he might.</p>

            , on suspicion of receiving the goods, and was admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald. They carried them there; I followed them unknown to them; he said he would only buy the plate of them two; I went to the Sun, and they came to me, and Warren said he had given them twelve pounds all but a half guinea; I did not see the money paid, and they said he was to give us a leg of mutton and a crown bowl of punch the next day, and then we were to have the half guinea.</p>

               <p>Q. What goods had this man?</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald. All the things I thought, without they took any thing out a going along. I looked through the door and there was a man in Fise's room, talking Dutch; I heard him saw the stones must be knocked out of some of the buckles ; I saw them go into his room with them . I followed them for fear they should run away with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go with them?</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald. He would not buy them of more than two; Warren gave me and the other two prisoners a guinea each, and Hartman had a guinea for letting him see what we had got. These buckles and buttons we took from Mr. Boddington. We kept a pair of silver buckles a-piece, and Warren came back and fetched them, and said Fise was to have them all; I gave them all back but these buckles; there was a hole in my pocket, and they got down into the lining; I did not know I had them.</p>
               <p>Warren. Fitzgerald was committed to be tried here last sessions for picking pockets, but ran away with the hand-cuffs as he was coming to Newgate. I never saw him before he was taken up.</p>

About seven or eight o'clock Fitzgerald came in, and asked me to give him the key of my door; I gave it him; he went up stairs; he staid a little, then I went up; I saw a good deal of silver upon the table; I desired him to take it away for fear I should come into trouble about it. There were silver and stone buckles and silver things of different sorts; Fitzgerald put them into a bag and took them away. Hartman came up in the mean time, and saw the silver things upon the table; he put them in a bag.</p>

               <p>Bigg. No, it was mine; I boiled a pudding in it; he took it, because he said they would tear a silk handkerchief. I lodged in the same house with Hartman; Fitzgerald said he would go and sell it; they were in a public house.</p>

The thief-catchers asked me if I had found any more of the property; I told them they were in a bird cage; they took them out.</p>

             . I believe the prisoner is one of the men that robbed me; I cannot swear to him; it was in the dusk of the evening, about six o'clock; I was robbed of eighteen or nineteen shillings by two men.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any arms?</p>
               <p>Bowkett. They had each a pistol; they clapped one to one ear. the other to the other; they damned my eyes and limbs, and bid me deliver my money; one had a long pistol the other a short one.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the long one?</p>
               <p>Bowkett. Wallis. The accomplice took my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing to you when they went away?</p>
               <p>Bowkett. They d - d me a good deal; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160023"/> returned it, and bid them give me something to drink, and not take all away: Wallis turned back and gave me a shilling. I met them about the middle of Notting Hill .</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass when you first met them?</p>
               <p>Bowkett. I wished them a good night; they wished me a good night as I did them; they passed me, and when I looked back they were standing still; I went on, and they followed me about two hundred and fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance did they follow you?</p>
               <p>Bowkett. I did not see them again till they put the pistols to my ears.</p>

            . Some time before the other robbery, I cannot say to the day, we had been almost to Shepherd's Bush to rob somebody; coming back by a house that used to be a brew-house, I think they call it the Dial house , about the dusk of the evening, between six and seven o'clock, we met the prosecutor; we were a-foot; we passed him; he wished us a good night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. Never a word; we passed him about the space of one hundred yards; then we agreed to rob him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop any time or immediately turn round?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. We stopped and hesitated, and then we agreed to follow him and rob him; we passed him under a wall by the side of the Dial house; Wallis was some yards before me; I turned round and stopped him and demanded his money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or Wallis turn round and rob him?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. I myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you pistols?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. Yes, each one; I turned round, stopped him, presented a pistol to his breast, and demanded his money; he gave me eleven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your pistols both of a length?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. One was longer than the other; Wallis had the longest. When I demanded his money, Wallis came up and presented his pistol to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he present his pistol, to what part of him?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. Rather towards his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make use of any expressions when you robbed him?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. Wallis d - d him, and asked him if he had any more money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say, did you swear?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. No, not at all. Wallis said, d - n you, you have more; he got nine shillings or nine shillings and sixpence; I cannot tell which; it was all we got; then we went home to Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man you robbed?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. He d - d me, and asked for a shilling to carry him home, which I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q. To carry him home, did he say?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. To spend or to carry him home, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you taken up?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore . I have been in custody eleven weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Which robbery was you taken up for?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. Neither of them: I was taken up going along the Park, and charged with having fire arms about me.</p>

               <p>Flaxmore. By my giving information.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been charged with either or both?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. No; the people said that Wallis had declared we had done this robbery, and would be an evidence against me; when I was taken up I mentioned them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Wallis in custody then?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. No; he came to be an evidence against me.</p>

               <p>I was coming along Moorfields, just as I came from on board the vessel, going up to see the captain's sister; this lad went with me across the fields: coming back a man stopped us, and asked us if we would watch the bundle for him; he said he would pay us for our trouble. As he did not come, this lad took it up, and said he would carry it home, and get the cloaths washed; we took up the tinder box and bar with them; he gave me the fiddle. Going along these men stopped us, and took us into the alehouse; there they were bragging they would get 40 l. for us. We asked them what they meant by that; they said they would get 40 l. for hanging of us: the two men said that when they had hold of us.</p>
               <p>Q. to Taylor and Blundell. Did either of you say such a thing?</p>
               <p>Taylor and Blundell. No such word was mentioned.</p>

             and Wheeler went to a barge at Smith's Wharf , Horsleydown, on New Year's-day, about eleven at night; the barge was very near full of malt; we took eight sacks out of the barge, and carried them to Kings-head-Alley , Ratcliff-Highway, to the house of one Petro, a Dutchman, and shot it in an empty room, and then threw the sacks into the Thames: we saw Tavener in the morning; we told him we had four quarters more for him, and gave him direction to go to Mr. Hill and sell it; he brought sacks to put it in. Tavener had deceived us; so we got a cart, and took it to Mr. Hill's ourselves; then the prisoners and I went to an alehouse; I went into another room, and Hill paid Wheeler and Morris for it. Wheeler told me they received four guineas, and gave Hill a receipt for it: they gave me twelve or fourteen shillings: my master, on missing the sacks, taxed me with it; and I confessed it; the prisoners were taken up before.</p>

            . I am son to the prosecutor: I overtook the prisoner by the Bull in old Brentford ; she had a bundle in her lap; that is about three miles and a half from my mother's. I asked what she had in her lap; she said some dirty things: I insisted on seeing what it was, and found the gown in her apron . I knew it to be my mother's. I brought her to the Boar's-head yard, Old Brentford; she said she did not take it, another woman took it, and gave it to her. I saw her loitering about my mother's about a quarter of an hour after two o'clock.</p>

            . On the eleventh of this month, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner came into our shop, and asked if I had any sea cloaths; I said, yes: my sister came out of the parlour. The prisoner desired to see a scarlet jacket. I reached down a bundle from a shelf, and he took off his cloaths, and put one on; he said it was not good enough for him and then my sister reached down another parcel of the fort of this in court. We took out one: the prisoner gave it a pull out of our hand, threw it to another man, and they both went off.</p>

I got away, and called the watch; there were no watchmen where I was robbed. I got the watch, but when I came back there was no person there, and there was a lock on the outside of the door. I got assistance , and took these three girls that were in the room with me when I lost my watch.

Sampson was there , and he spoke to somebody to go to fetch the property where it was. From his so speaking I suspected he had the watch . I talked of searching him; upon that he put his left hand into his pocket, or breeches, and I saw him take the watch out, and drop it in the room; this is the same watch he dropt at that time.

             . I am a hackney-coachman; on the fourth of January, about four in the afternoon, my coach was called from Aldgate by the prisoner , and a man that he called father: they both got into the coach, and ordered me to drive to the Why-not in Mile End road; there are two Why-not's ; one an old one, the other a new one: the old one has since been altered to the sign of the Globe. I drove to the first, then they told me to go to the further one: when I got there, they directed me to drive down a lane just by that; they ordered me to stop a little way down the lane at a house where one Mr. Milner lives; they went into that house; after they had been there some time the prisoner came out, and asked some of those that were there, whether the key was in the stable door, or the door open; then they went all of them. The prisoner, the father, and one or two others that met at this house, went into a shed adjoining to this dwelling house, they staid there about a quarter of an hour: the prisoner came out first, then the man he called his father came out after him, with a sack on his shoulder; he put this sack into the coach. I did not touch the sack, it appeared to me very heavy; when they had put it into the coach, the prisoner and his father got in, and bid me drive to Gravel-Lane, near Radcliff-Highway; and when we got there he bid me drive to Pennington-Street; I got there about five o'clock in the evening; when we got there, a woman came out with a candle, and then this man he called father, and the prisoner, went into that house; as they were taking the sack from the coach to the house I heard it rattle as if there was copper in it; then they paid me my fare and I went away; this sack raised a suspicion ,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160029"/> that they were about coining. I went to Justice Sherwood, and gave information of what I had seen. A warrant was granted; I went with Simmonds, Galpin, Forrester and Sharp, about seven or eight in the evening to that same house in Pennington-Street.</p>

On the 11th of January, Baker came to Justice Sherwood's and said he suspected he had been carrying some coiners in his coach, therefore we went with a warrant about nine o'clock; I went first to the house in Pennington-street, where the coachman had set the prisoner down; we did not find the prisoner at home; we broke open a room above stairs ; searching the bed in that room, behind the curtains, I found the very bag Baker had described, with the copper in it; I looked into it; in it there were sixteen sheets of copper (a sheet was produced in Court), of a proper thickness to make halfpence; under the bed I found another bag with these dies (producing them); and in the window I found a copper counterfeit halfpenny (producing it).</p>

            . I am clerk to Justice Sherwood; after the information of Baker, I went to Pennington-street: after the others had been at Pennington-street, I and five others went to Bow Common; I told Milner I came to search his house; I found nothing in his house; but in the kitchen I found a window that led into a little shed, another shed than what was spoke of before, that is at the bottom of the house ; I got from that shed through the window in the kitchen, into this little back shed in the yard; there I found a large pair of shears fixed, and some cuttings of copper, ( producing them ); in that back yard I found a hole that made into the back of the other shed; after I had taken the shears into that back shed, I went through this place and saw a door facing it, which I broke open and got into this shed in the front of the house, and there I saw the small engine with a vice that has been produced; and I found a press with a fly, that is it at the door; it is very large and is fit to stamp halfpence; we took all the things away with us .</p>
               <p>Milner . This little back shed in the yard was let to Field and Palmer with the other place where the shears were found; they said they wanted it to put sand in; about a fortnight ago I went to the prisoner in prison; he said I hope you will not hurt me; I desired he would tell me where to find Field; he directed me to Brick-lane; I went there but could not find him.</p>

             . I have been used to the button business; the halfpenny produced is a counterfeit halfpenny; the press at the door which was found at the shed in Bow Common , is such a press as is used in the mint for coining; some of these things that were found under the bed at the prisoner's lodging are dies, some are punches; the punches are to make dies with, because it would be very expensive to engrave every time they wanted to coin; therefore they have a contriyance to soften the die; and with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160030"/> these punches to strike the impression on the die; when they have got the die thus prepared, they stamp the copper so as to make halfpence with these dies.</p>

               <p>This Field, that went by the name of Father Field, met me at my father's house, and asked me to take a walk with him; I went with him to Bow Common; then I came back again; I put on locks to the door for him; and several jobs I have done for him; my going there was to ask him for my money, because I could never meet with him; one day I happened to meet with him as I was going to work, in Whitechapel , with a bag on his back; he said he wanted to see me; he asked me to let him leave that bag in my room; I told him he might; after he had left the bag; he told me to meet him at the three Kings in the Minories, at half after three, or at four o'clock; he then took me down to Bow Common to fetch another bag; after the bag was left my wife and I, and all in the house went out together; I did not know what was in the bag; it was never opened; he said he would call for it in the morning, and pay what he owed me.</p>

They were all safe in the room on Saturday; the money was locked up in a writing desk that was broke open. The room is built over some stables; we go through the house to it: I pay ten guineas a year for the room and the house; the room communicates with the house. Several pair of the shoes were taken out of the drawer of the desk; they untiled the house; they tied a rope to the rasters, and let themselves down through the cieling into the room, and got away the same way. I found the rope hanging there in the morning: there was no hole in the cieling on Saturday night. I was in the room after dark, then all was safe; we got up as soon as it was light, and missed the things.

I took him to the watch house, and on the Monday he was sent to the Justice's ; and there I was bound over to appear in this affair: Ashford confessed before the Justice that he and Furbiland broke open Blewet's house; he said they got in at the street door, and went up the stairs, and that at the top of the stairs, for fear of making a noise in breaking the door open, they got out at a little place on the top of the tiles, and made their way through the tiles into a cock lost; there they lay together till they thought Blewet was gone to bed; then they made their way through the cieling of the room, where the things were; that they took away the laths and plaster, and tied a rope to the rasters, and so got into the room. Furbiland denied it; Ashford said they were very much put to it for a light; they had never a candle.</p>

               <p>Tilsdon. It might be about a hundred yards ; he says he was in Church-lane; it is not twenty yards from my house to the corner of Church-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. to the constable. What time did he come to your house?</p>
               <p>Grubb. About half an hour after eight o'clock; the magistrate was rather doubtful of the prisoner; he desired I would go to his mother's, as he said he lay at home all night, to search his lodgings, to see if I could find his hat; she said he came home about eleven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160034"/> o'clock; he knocked, but she would not let him in.</p>

            's; it was so late at night I could not obtain a warrant; I went down early the next morning to Ives, thinking to find him in the house; that was the 5th of this month; I met him three or four hundred yards from the house, with a pitcher in his hand going to fetch water; at that time I did not know him; I came up to his house and found it shut; the officer and I went to a public house in the neighbourhood and asked if they knew Ives; they told us he lived at the house we had described to us; I went to look at the back part of the house to see if any person could make their escape backwards; I found they could; I fixed two persons there; when I came back again I saw Ives go into his house with a pitcher of water in his hand; the house was locked; Ives opened the door himself ; I asked him if his name was not Ives; he said yes; and at that time there was a girl in the room with him, which I believe is a daughter of Mrs. Freeman; there was nobody in the house but myself; I took him into the yard to give the others notice I was in the house; I took him into custody; then the daughter of Mrs. Freeman ran up stairs to her mother; I went up stairs after the girl; when I came up into the bed room Mrs. Freeman sat upright in the bed with her pockets in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. This was I believe between seven and eight o'clock?</p>
               <p>Clarke . It might be half after eight; I will not be certain to the time; I searched her pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this up one pair of stairs?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes; I found in her pocket nineteen counterfeit shillings and a sixpence; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160036"/> who was up stairs; she said a man and a woman; I took the daughter up with me and went up stairs, whilst she dressed herself; when I came up stairs, Pitt and a woman were in bed; I searched the room; there were things lay very open; somebody had been at work the day before there; I found a pair of flasks; these are them (producing them); I found sand and some aquafortis in water, (producing it); I found some what they call facing in the casting business; that is a composition used such as rotten stone powdered fine to pour over the sand to make the pores fine, that when a thing is cast it should not come out full of holes; it is to make it a smooth surface.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of the aquafortis?</p>
               <p>Clarke. If you take a composition of a quarter silver, and the rest in copper, and warm that composition thus mixed together, and throw it into aquafortis and water, it forces all the silver on the out side.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it will serve the purpose of making the composition of a little silver, and a great deal of copper, appear like silver?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever bred up in chymistry?</p>
               <p>Clarke. We are obliged to use it in the business I was brought up in.</p>
               <p>Q. I see there is a tinge upon it; is that the silver or copper?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Silver certainly .</p>
               <p>Q. If silver is dissolved in aquafortis , will hat dissolution be white; the liquid is blue?</p>
               <p>Clarke. The colour of aquafortis is the colour of water , or may be a little yellowish.</p>
               <p>Q. Now suppose nothing but silver is dissolved in aquafortis, what would be the colour then?</p>
               <p>Clarke. When it comes to stand it turns to this colour that is bluish; by shaking it, it turns like milk; I found some crucibles for melting metals; they had been made use of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else in the house?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes, up in a work shop I found what they call a window for casting, and to melt metal , and in searching the work board I found what some of the trade call aspray, some call it aget , (produces it); this is laid in the sand where any impression is meant to be cast; the impression is laid by the side of it, and when the dent is made this is turned out, which leaves a cavity or a gutter to pour the metal in to make the impression; that was found in the workshop, and I found some metal run into that gutter; upon the same bench where I found that aget I found two things that resembled a shilling and a sixpence; I found some files and some metal of the same nature as what that aspray is.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you take that metal to be?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I took it to be a composition of either bell metal and silver, or tutenague and silver ; it is a composition.</p>
               <p>Q. One of the ingredients in it is silver?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a composition in which there is silver, and putting it in aquafortis will make it white like silver?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes; here are two smooth files; I found these in the work-shop; here is a piece of scouring paper; it has been used to rub a composition of metal upon, and the edge of something has been used at one edge; it has all the marks of silver upon it; now there was a winnow stow , a furnace that has an air hole which draws the draught to the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a flue which would give an increase of wind, and performs the office of bellows to make a strong fire?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes; I saw a box under the bed where Pitts was a-bed; I asked him whose that was; he said Ives's we asked Mrs. Ives for the key; she had a bunch of keys; we could not find a key in the bunch that would open the box; I began to break it open; word was sent Mr. Ives of that and he sent me the key; he gave it to Mr. Taylor and Mr. Senhouse brought it to me; in that box I found a small pair of flasks; that was all I found in it; I searched the daughter and found two counterfeit shillings and one bad sixpence; it was the prisoner Freeman's daughter; it was on Mrs. Freeman I found the nineteen shillings.</p>

I went along with Mr. Clarke in the morning he has mentioned, to apprehend the prisoners; I searched Ives; I found ten shillings and seven six-pences in his pocket, which I looked upon to be bad, but they turned out to be some of them good ones when they were examined before the Justice; the good ones appeared to be the patterns of the counterfeit shillings found on the woman, which Mr. Clarke has given an account of; with regard to the box Mr. Clarke has mentioned , I heard a noise above stairs , and asked Mr. Ives if he had the key of that box; that I did not mean to do him any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160037"/> injury ; if he had, to send it up stairs; I do not know what room the box was in; I was below stairs the whole time; I did not go into the work-shop ; he gave me the key, and I gave it to Mr. Senhouse; that is all I know.</p>

             .

            , Mr. Taylor told me he had found some counterfeit shillings; I desired him to let me look at them; he did; I was at a loss myself till I took them in my hand to know the bad from the good; the good shillings had been worked till they were as bright as the counterfeit shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain what you mean by their being worked?</p>
               <p>Clarke. They had been put in the sand; the other shillings were put in; when I came to look at the shillings and examine the counterfeit shillings, I picked out so many counterfeits (producing a paper marked No. 1). There is five counterfeits and a pattern shilling in it with them, that is a good shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. The bad shillings are not all worked from one good shilling?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No; there are seven different paterns; (produces another paper marked No. 6). This paper contains a parcel of bad shillings and a good one; the bad ones have been worked from the good one, (produces another paper marked No. 3). Here is a pattern shilling and two counterfeits; they appear to be worked from the good one; (produces another paper marked No. 5. with two counterfeits and a good shilling; produces another paper marked No. 4 with one counterfeit and a pattern; produces another paper with a crocked pattern and three counterfeits all crooked). I suppose the crooked shilling being pu t in the mould would make the counterfeits crooked just in the same manner; if you look under the head of the crooked shillings, you will find a letter, and close to the letter a dot. which seems to be done by accident in the good shilling; by looking at the counterfeit shillings you will see the like dot there; that is a striking circumstance.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown . I observe there is on the back of the head two or three scratches or dots , that exactly correspond in the bad shillings .</p>
               <p>Jury . They correspond as exact as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what relation Pitt stands in to Ives ?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I cannot tell any thing about it; Pitt says he lay four months in the room, and that he went on errands for Ives.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Ives say whether this was his house or not?</p>
               <p>Clarke. He owned it was his house; and let himself into the house; and he had the key of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. from Ives to Taylor . How many good shillings and sixpences did you take out of my pocket?</p>
               <p>Taylor. All I have shewed to the court; ten good shillings, seven good sixpences, and a note for five guineas; the reason of my taking the note was to endeavour to trace somebody he dealt with.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown . The note must be given to him again.</p>
               <p>Ives's Defence.</p>
               <p>I will say nothing that I cannot stand to; I am not guilty of any of the things these people have charged me with.</p>

I live at Westminster: I lost a sow about a month ago; yesterday three weeks one Mr. Brown, a neighbour, took me to the prisoner's lodging; I saw the sow; it was cut up; it had received a cut a-cross the loins with a saw, that was not healed; I knew it to be mine by that wound. The prisoner had been taken up for something else, and was in Bridewell; I went there, and asked him how he could kill my sow, and he laughed me to scorn.</p>

I know Baalam; he met me at a public house; he asked me to recommend him to a customer to assist him in the disposal of stolen goods; I directly mentioned the prisoner at the bar; he enquired after one Fise; there was no conversation about recommending the prisoner, but only about Fise: I knew the prisoner by his selling greens with a jack-ass; the green-stall in Duke's-Place belongs to the mother of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he desire you to recommend him to a customer, and that you should have a guinea or so?</p>

            . On the 19th of January, in the morning, I went down to the water side; I saw Russel stand on the south-side, and Powell rowing a boat from the north-shore to the south; my brother, who was with me, thought they were smugglers, and asked me if I had any skulls, and said if I had there was a chance for me; as I am a custom-house officer. I went into a boat and overtook Powell; when I came along side I saw it was iron; Powell rowed the boat on shore; I followed him, and found Russel<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160050"/> walking to and fro by a blacksmith's window. I asked him who the iron belonged to; he equivocated; I said it looked as if it was run, and if it was I would seize it for the king and myself; he said it was not worth my while to seize such a piece of iron as that: then he said it belonged to a mate of a ship, and then to

Powell rowed the boat over and went into the ale-house; when the boat was rowed on shore I was about a hundred yards from it; I pursued them directly; when I came on shore they were neither of them in the boat: I left my brother to take care of the boat while I went on shore after them; I secured Russel; the other ran down, put the boat off, and threw the iron over-board; my brother, seeing him throw it over, got a boat, and rowed after him, and brought him back; I gave the constable charge of both of them. I asked him why he threw the iron over-board; he said I might be d - d, the iron in the water could tell no tales. They were carried to the round-house, and my brother and I went to search for the iron, and took up five bars.</p>
