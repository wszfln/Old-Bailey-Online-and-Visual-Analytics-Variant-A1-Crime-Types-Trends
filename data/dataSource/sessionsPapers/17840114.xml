               <p>PRISONER NORBURG's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have had them two pair of stockings a long while, the woman that washed for me is not here, I bought the shirt, the breeches, and the handkerchief in Rosemary-lane; in the public fair.</p>
               <p>Court to Gunhouse and Smith. Did you hear any noise in the night? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. There is no circumstance that affects the prisoner Newton with the knowledge of this being stolen; the crime of burglary consists in breaking open a house by night, that is when it is so dark that the lineaments of a man's countenance cannot be seen, either with intent to steal, or actually stealing same property thereout, where it is laid for actual stealing: but it is accessary that the house should be broke open in the night; now the maid servant went to bed in the night, and did not get up till it was clear day-light; and in all cases you know, if it be a matter indifferent as to the whole of the charge whether the prisoner is guilty or innocent, the presumption is ever in favour of innocence; if, therefore, you think the house was not broke open in the night time, the prisoner must be acquitted of the burglary, for people are not to be found guilty upon conjecture.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have a watchman here that saw a light in my house about 3 o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashurst. They cannot call him now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. I cannot call him rioty, it is a dangerous practice, I have no doubt in this particular case, but the practice itself is a dangerous practice, if after a Judge has made observations on the defect of evidence, then the prosecutor is to come and supply that defect.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentleman, as to the captain part of the charge you have no clear account that the house was broke open in the night as to the other part of the charge which consists of his stealing these things, of that you have such stronger evidence, they were took the 2d, they were found in his possession the 9th, and when called to give an account of them, he gives such an account as is not consistent with truth; that is a strong circumstance that he was the person that stole them; If you think there is no evidence to convict him of the breaking by night, you will acquit him of the burglary, and find him guilty of the larceny only; or, if you think he is not guilty generally, you will acquit him of the whole of the charge.</p>

               <p>Court. Is there any mark on that knife? - I had a mark put on before Mr. Justice Staples, and there is a little crack, a dent on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Whereabout is the crack? - Near the handle where it shuts.</p>

               <p>Was not the rest of your knives chipped in the same way? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Carry it to the Jury yourself, and shew the Jury were the mark is, that you believe it to be your's by.</p>
               <p>Mathews. I went round into Petticoat Lane, where they told me they apprehended the prisoner in a privy, and there I found this ink stand, and this handkerchief together.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Was the box locked at the time you lost it? - The box was locked, but the drawers were open.</p>
               <p>Court to Dillon. Look at that ink stand? - I had but two in my box and there was but one in the time it was opened.</p>
               <p>Mathews. There was but only one, it seemed to be the fellow.</p>
               <p>(The two ink stands handed to the Court, the one that Mr. Mathews found, and the other that was in the box.)</p>
               <p>Where did they say the box was left? - At a person's house at some place, I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Did you go alone to the necessary when you found this ink stand? - I went with the officer.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there any more knives of the same kind than that? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I know the prosecutor, I lodge at one Mr. Grainger's, the Crooked Billet, I was with him on the 18th of December at different places, we had three shillings worth, and about three gallons of beer, and he was drunk before we had that, he was going to fight with a sailor, he was very drunk and very quarrelsome, I parted with him about ten, he would have three pots of beer at Mr. Martin's, he bid me good night, he and one Long that is a witness, and I thought he was going home, I went away, and I came back again, and he was drinking again, where the people's name is Charlton, there he had been tossing up for half a gallon of beer, this was between six and seven, we then agreed among us to toss up,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140012"/> for six pennyworth, and we did so, and he beat three of us, and three of us beat him again, he had not quite money enough to make out the last six pennyworth in his pocket, I held the shilling, and an acquaintance of ours, one Long that will be a witness, lent him the remainder, I think he lent him three farthings, he said he only wanted a halfpenny, then Long called for a gallon of beer out of his own pocket to treat us with, as I sometimes deal with him; after that we had another pot, Mr. Dillon had no money, and he borrowed a penny of Long, to pay for this pot, he wanted to borrow some money of me, but I knew him to be a very bad principled man, he borrowed sixpence of me some time before, and I knew he would not pay me; we then got over to Mrs. M'Clough's, to have a parting pot, he then offered to wrestle with this Long for a crown, he pulled his handkerchief off and opened his bosom, he came to me again, and said, lend me a shilling, I said no, I will buy an article at prime cost, but I will not lend you any thing, he then said he thought he could lick me, and another that was there, I said I did not think he could; words arose and we had some blows, he then said he had enough, he got up and took his box, and staggered out; I saw him no more that night, I waited and had something to drink with my friends, and was talking how likely it was he should lose his box; we said to one another, if he does lose it, he cannot blame us, for we persuaded him to leave it at Mr. Charlton's and Mrs. M'Clough's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. When he staggered out he was very drunk and very quarrelsome? - He was, I was pretty sure he never would be able to carry his box home, the next morning he came to enquire for me, he stood up against the table, he looked very muddy and dirty, I asked him how he did, he said very middling, says he, do you know any thing about my box or watch, he did not mention any money, I told him I knew nothing of it, that he had it safe when he left me, I directly asked him if he was robbed of it, no says he; I asked him two or three times, and he positively declared he was not robbed; if you was not robbed of it says I, Mr. Dillon, I will take the trouble of going to the houses that we use in Wapping and enquire for it, he said he had left it somewhere, or lost it in the street by tumbling about, but he was so drunk he could not tell where, I am positive sure of what I say upon my oath; we went out of my landlord's house with intention to look for this box, we first went to the chandler's shop in St. Catherine's-lane, she said he had not left his box there for three or four months, we then went to St. Catherine's-stairs, sometimes he went with me into the houses, and sometimes not, I dare say we went into one hundred and fifty different houses to enquire for his box, in several of these houses the people asked him how he lost it, he always declared he was not robbed of it, but he was so drunk he could not recollect what was become of it, but he always positively said he was not robbed; I went with him to King James's stairs into this house where we had quarrelled the night before, I treated him there to a pint of beer, the woman asked us whether we had come to wrangle again; I told her no, but Mr. Dillon had lost his box, says I, I should have thought he was robbed of it, but he says not, he put his hands up and declared he was not robbed of it, we went to two or three houses further, and he declared the same thing; we went to Mr. Long's there he said the same, then we were going home and had given it up, I said to him, now I do not know what to say in this matter, I will tell you what I would have you do, get a parcel of bills printed, about a thousand, and offer a small reward of about five shillings, and if any honest person has it, they will return it to you; as we were going home, says he, is there no ditch here, I believe I must have fallen into a ditch.</p>
               <p>Did he talk of being thrown into a ditch? - I am confident he said just as I say, that he did not know but he had fell into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140013"/> ditch by lying so muddy; I took him to the New Cut that leads from Wapping Church to Ratcliffe-highway, one walked on one side, and one on the other, by and by I went to a place where I thought the ice was disturbed, says I, perhaps your box is here, now lend me your stick and I will pok all about, and feel, but I could not find his box in the ditch; after that he was going homewards, and the next day I went to the Justices, and there he said he had been robbed, I asked him why he did not tell me so the day before, he said he did not recollect himself, and could not tell me so because he did not recollect himself; he told me if I did appear to say he had a licence, but he had not taken any out this year, for he had not sold any goods this year; and then he said do not appear at all, but if you do, you may say you heard me say that I was way-laid by three sea-saring men; I told him I did not know I should appear at all in the matter, though it intention was to attend.</p>

               <p>Court. What was the worth of them? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How do you know the prisoner took them? - It was slippery weather and I got down to walk, and I saw the door move, I had tied the two pins in fast with a cord, I called to the man to stop, and just then I saw a person at the hearse door, appearing to me to come out of the hearse; I saw his legs just before they came to the ground; he was pulling at the feathers, and these three he pulled out.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know who that person was? - I believe it was the prisoner, after he had got them into his hands I called stop thief! he saw me a coming and he ran, he took them a little distance from the hearse, and he dropped them, I ran after him, and he was rather to quick for me but I saw him fall, he ran into James-street, on the dark side of the street, there was no lamps; then the next witness caught the prisoner, and said, here he is; I had ran past him, I believe a yard or two yards, I did not see him, it being in the dark; I look upon the prisoner to all appearance as to his size and apparel, to be the same man that took the feathers.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you keep him in your sight till he was taken? - No, till the time he fell.</p>

I looked about and saw the prisoner run from the hearse, he fell down, he got up again and ran into James-street, and I after him; he found I was pursuing him so close and was going to catch hold of him, and about twenty yards off he stopped against the wall and began to run back again, I stopped myself immediately, and went and took hold of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you him in your sight from the time of his falling down to the time of your laying hold of him? - I had my Lord, I called out here he is, he asked me if that was the man that fell down, I answered, yes, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whereabouts was you when you heard the cry of stop thief? - In the street, about forty or fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Did you ever lose sight of me? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Were they in a sack, or were they loose? - All in sacks.</p>
               <p>Have you the sacks here? - No, we had them here the last sessions; the prisoner came through his house, and came out to us, he said he knew nothing about the sacks, he presently went into his house and came out again, and owned the whole.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him it should be better for him if he owned it, or that it should be worse for him, that he should be prosecuted? - No.</p>
               <p>What did he own? - He owned that some laid on the premises, and some not, and he owned that he helped out with one of the sacks out of the boat, he told me that

               <p>Was it below high-water mark? - No, it was not, to be sure they could not be landed there, they were brought by tide.</p>
               <p>Was it above or below high-water mark? - It must be above.</p>
               <p>Why so? - Because I am sure it must.</p>

Gentlemen of the Jury, here is no evidence at all, to be sure it is not necessary in the trial of a receiver to give positive proof that he knew these things to be stolen; but circumstantial evidence would be sufficient, as for instance, if he had bought them at a lower price, or had bought them at an unseasonable time of night, but there is no evidence at all in this case, only, that the sacks are taken out, and that he helped out with one of them, and there they lay on the beach.</p>

               <p>On last Saturday morning I heard a gentleman had been robbed in Hermitage-street, and I saw the piece of the coat which the gentleman had tore off, and knowing Hall wore such a coat, I concluded it must be him, and I went and took him out of a house of ill-fame in Nightingale-lane, I searched for the remaining part of the coat but could not find it; after he had been in custody about an hour, he said he would acknowledge the whole matter.</p>
               <p>Court. Stop a little, do not tell us what he acknowledged; where did you sell the watch? - In Duke's-place.</p>
               <p>Is the person to whom it was sold here? - No, he is upon bail, he is not here, he is not indicted yet.</p>
               <p>Court. You know nothing of the prisoner but from the information of Hall? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find the coat of which the prosecutor had a part? - No.</p>
               <p>Is there any further evidence? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you know any thing of the persons of either of these prisoners? - No, my Lord, nothing at all, it was very dark, I could not discern who they were, nor any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the rule of law, which is founded on very wise reasons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140019"/> is, that no man shall be convicted on the single evidence of an accomplice, unsupported by other circumstances, for nothing would be so easy, if the law were otherwise, as for any man taken up under circumstances against himself, to get himself admitted a witness, and so save himself by a false accusation against others; so that, though the law will admit the evidence of an accomplice to explain and connect evidence, yet, without that, the law will never suffer any man to be convicted on the evidence of an accomplice only.</p>

               <p>Court. How many were there in all? - There were three or four, I am sure it was three, the one that came to me, whether he intended to strike me or catch me by the collar I cannot tell, but as he attempted to strike me, I stooped and he caught my hat from my head; I then stooped between the two that came up first to me, and endeavoured to pass them by, stooping under their ams to make my way under the scaffolding, and as I attempted to pass them the prisoner at the bar said, Damn him, shoot him, shoot him, if he will not deliver his money.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did the prisoner stand? - He stood at the right hand of me.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was the prisoner at the bar? - Very well my Lord, he had his hair hanging on his shoulders.</p>
               <p>How near was you to the lamp? - About four yards.</p>
               <p>You could not observe the features of his face? - I saw he was a little pitted with the small pox.</p>
               <p>You could not see him so as to swear to him? - Not from his being pitted with the small pox, but from the colour of his coat and his face I could swear to him a month after; then they all ran away.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any arms? - I did not, I ran after the prisoner immediately, he ran down Lower Grosvenor-street, I followed him, and at the corner of David-street he was stopped by Mr.

               <p>On Saturday the 13th of December, at seven in the evening, I sent my son to get change for a guinea, and in about 5 minutes I heard a great noise, and a mob came and brought a boy up to my house, which was Jones; and my son was crying, and said, he had been robbed of his guinea, accordingly the boy was brought into my house, and we searched him to see if he had the guinea about him: We found no guinea about the boy, as we went along, some of the mob said, there was another of them, pointing to the biggest of the two lads, and accordingly my son looked at him, and said, that was the boy that stopped his breath, then we went to the Rotation Office and the prisoners were committed.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you afterwards know that this place where you found the things, were his lodgings? - Yes, we knew that from his accounts and from his wife; and I saw some china images there that he bought of us sometime ago, at the first search we found a quantity of drops and various things that are used in our way, he was then committed; as he was going to the Compter, he asked the constable whether we took those things or not, from the box under the bed, and we went to his lodgings again, and found in two baskets some more things, and under the bed we found a box that contained drops of various forts, that had been manufactured at different times for seven, eight, or nine years; the box was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140024"/> about nine inches wide and two foot long. On a second examination he confessed every thing.</p>
               <p>Was any promise of favour made him if he confessed? - No; the Lord Mayor said, he did not know his situation; he said he had done wrong and was very sorry for it, he gave no account as to his taking the things.</p>
               <p>Did he acknowledge that he had taken them? - He acknowledged every thing that was laid to his charge was true; we always looked upon him as an honest, industrious man, till we heard otherwise the beginning of December.</p>
               <p>Court. Has he any family? - Yes, a wife and two children.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Bailey. In what mannr did you supply this man with these articles necessary for mounting the girandoles? - The drops were generally told out when he took a pair of girandoles, but since we knew him he has gone to the drawers and helped himself.</p>
               <p>Court. But was he ever intrusted with any very large quantities for the purpose of mounting? - There were drops that would mount twelve or fourteen pair, and every thing that is used for mounting, in this assortment, the morning this happened I asked him if he had any thing of ours at home, he said he had nothing but that pair; none of the drops that I found there did I give him out for any purpose to mount whatever, there are drops there that the moulds have not been used these seven years; there was a spy glass, I never had but two of them cut.</p>

               <p>Court. What fort of cellar was it? - It was a dead cellar window, nailed with planks over it.</p>
               <p>How were those planks laid on? - It was planked up and the nails drawn.</p>
               <p>Court. What was become of the cask? - In the gin cellar, the lock was wrenched off, and the staple was drawn, and the rasberry gin was taken out, and carried to the hole where they broke first in, ready to take it away, the cellar was eight yards distance from the window, and where I found him was ten yards distance.</p>

               <p>Is it customary for the country butchers to bring up cattle to be killed? - In the manner that he came to me, he came to me as if he had been standing in Smithfield market, and could not sell them, and so he brought them to me to be killed; on Sunday morning following he came to me with Dellow the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Court. Why did not you take the prosecutor to Bradbury's the first time you came to town? - Because I thought it would be very hard for me to lose my money, nobody at London knows me; the hides were both all over blood, and there were more hides like that.</p>
               <p>Court to Bradbury. What reasons did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140027"/> the prosecutor give you for knowing the hides? - When I came in Dellow said, that is my old cow's hide, and then he went to the others; there were some more hides lay with them, but none like the black and white hide.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any mark on the horns? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. What were the cows worth? - About ten pounds.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. Had you any receipt? - No Sir, we never take any receipts; I was bred and born in Ware, I live along with my mother, I have no witnesses, I thought I was to be tried at Hertford.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable of Shore-ditch, on the 6th of January I was sent for to the King's Head, near Haggerstone, a farmer being there who had lost a horse from South Mims, and had found it in a stable there, I went and enquired for the farmer, he was then at the stable door, that is the prosecutor, I asked him his business with me, and he told me he had been robbed of a horse about six weeks ago, and that he had seen it come out to water, and that it was then in a stable, and he knew it to be his horse; I asked him by what marks he knew it, he said his name was branded on the hoofs. I dispatched a man for Mr. Tibbit, and he came and told me he bought it of Mr. M'Clara; Tibbit very readily went with me to the Justice, the farmer made oath of his property, and the justice granted a warrant against M'Clara; on the Friday he came to the Public Office and surrendered himself up, in the mean time he also apprehended the prisoner that he had bought the horse off, and he was examined before the sitting alderman; the sitting alderman took the prisoner's own word for his appearance on the Saturday, when he was examined again; then a letter was sent by Mr. Wilmot to the fitting alderman, and an examination was taken again, then M'Clara gave such a satisfactory account, that the justice thought there was no occasion to bind him over.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the horse produced? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosec utor. You saw the horse before the justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was M'Clara there at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the prisoner owned to the selling of the horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott councel for the Prisoner. You say that upon the first examination before the alderman, the alderman discharged him on his bare word to appear again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140028"/>Court. This may hurt a man's character, or else I should not upon this evidence sum up to the jury.</p>
               <p>FOR THE PRISONER.</p>
               <p>- TAVERNER sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Harlow.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner Lightman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. White? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Lightman and White come down at any time to your house? - Yes, they came to my house about half an hour after three o'clock, the 27th of November enquiring for lodgings, that was the day before the fair.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing Lightman purchase a horse on the 28th? - Yes.</p>


               <p>Do you recollect what the colour of the horse was? - Yes, it was black, a long raw honed horse with a long tail, I believe his off eye was out, and one hoof behind was off to the best of my knowledge; he wanted change for a guinea, I gave him 5 s. in part of change, and he gave me a guinea, he then went to pay him: it is the custom in these times to sell a little beer, and he called for a pint or a pot of beer, and he took his horse, says he I do not know what to do with him; says I, put him into my yard.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was your horse a long tailed black horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he an eye out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Upon the evidence for the prosecution, you find the prisoner directly owned where he had the horse, and this was five or six weeks after he was stolen.</p>

               <p>I live within two doors of the prosecutor, on Friday the 2d of January, I observed the prisoner Lyon go backwards and forwards by the prosecutor's door; he went a few doors below the prosecutor's and from thence brought the other prisoner; as soon as I saw the prisoners come to the prosecutor's window, I run to the next door neighbour but one on the other hand, and told him I suspected there were two men going to cut the prosecutor's window, and I saw them turn away from the window, and I went up running to see if the window was broke, I found the window broke, and we took the two prisoners, and he went and fetched another neighbour.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you present in the shop when the tooth-pick case dropped? - I was, I was as close to the prisoner as I am to this gentleman, I heard it drop, it dropped from Rigg.</p>
               <p>(The tooth-pick case produced, and positively deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, on the 10th of December, the prisoner brought those goods, which I now have here, he pledged them for four shillings and sixpence, I did not ask him whose they were, I am positive it was the prisoner, I never saw him before, it was in the middle of the day.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I carried the things three or four different times, and pawned them; the gentleman <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140032"/>that I worked with had taken my wages, and carried into Yorkshire, and I had almost broke my thighs, and the men told me, if he had served them so, they should have been glad to make a shilling.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Where did you go to? - I went to Westmorland.</p>
               <p>Did you owe him something at that time? - I owed him eight shillings, but I agreed with Mr. Fox, with whom he was to work, for fourteen shillings a week, and Fox was to receive sixteen shillings instead of fourteen, and we were to settle it when I came back, instead of that I was six weeks gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In the room of giving me fourteen shillings, he gave me five shillings and promised to give me the remainder and did not: I told the pawnbroker, that as soon as ever the man I worked for returned I would fetch the things, and as to the plow, it was in the shop when he returned, and I only took the things for money to keep me, and the foreman and the men said, if he had gone away with their money in that manner; they said they would have taken three or four of his things.</p>
               <p>Court to Marshall. How came you to know that these things were at the pawnbroker's? - He told me of it.</p>
               <p>Court. He was in distress and he pawned them, and you owed owed him money; this seems to be a very hard prosecution, and he acknowledges he pawned them through necessity.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I asked him about them he abused me very much.</p>
               <p>Court. Did any accident happen to him that you know? - None at all that I know of.</p>

               <p>Jury to Webb. Did you ever hear that he used to pawn his own tools, or other peoples tools? - He never pawned any tools of mine, he might pawn his own.</p>

On Monday morning a little after six o'clock, I heard the street door open, it was double locked; the door stood open for some considerable time, for a few minutes; and I said, damn the fellow, he has left the street door open; and as I got up the door shut too; I went down and called to my wife, and asked her if the bed and bedding was in the one pair of stairs, she said yes; I said they were gone; and I heard no tidings of them till my wife brought the prisoner to Guildhall.</p>

               <p>I took the prisoner in out of charity, I let him have that bed and blankets, he said he paid one shilling a week, and had only the floor to sleep on; I thought it very hard as I had that bed to spare; I bought him a halfpenny worth of bread when I had not another halfpenny in the world, because he brought home turnips and potatoes and had no bread; I told him if he would come home at twelve o'clock the next day, I would endeavour to get something for him for dinner after his being at work, for he said he had a place at a paviour's; he never came home again, and I never saw him again till I met him on London Bridge on the Saturday after; with that I asked him how he could be so cruely after my being such a friend to him, to take these things away as I was but poor myself; he said, he knew it was very wrong, but he expected to receive some prize money, and he would make me any acknowledgement whatever I desired; but he said, he had not made away with the things, he had them all, he told me, he would take me where the things were; I said, I did not chuse to go where they were; I said, if he would go home with me to my husband he might acknowledge the things to him, with that he walked out of Tooley-street to go with me, and he came down Thames-street, then he turned up a turning where I did not know my way home, I told him it was not the way home, I had hold of him by the right arm and he shifted to the left and gave me a terrible lick on the side with his elbow, and threw out my arm; he turned down a turning where a man stood at a cart, and I bid him lay hold of that man and he did; I took him to the Lord Mayor; when he was at my Lord Mayor's, I said, I believed he had the trowsers on, and they were taken off, when my husband came, he said he knew the trowsers were his; I never found the things again.</p>
               <p>Did you mention to him what things you had missed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What things did you tell him you had missed? - I asked him what he had done with the bed, he said he had got it; I mentioned the shirts, he said he had not made away with any of them, nor would on any account; I never found any thing but the trowsers.</p>
               <p>What were these things worth together? - About nineteen shillings and six pence.</p>

               <p>Then what did you mean by telling me, that was the common time of your being at work? - We had been having a supper that night.</p>
               <p>Why did not you say so? What time had you supped? - About ten, and we were drinking after.</p>
               <p>Were you sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon yourself to swear that? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>How came you to put your money in your waistcoat pocket? - I put in my money there accidentally.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you did put it in your waistcoat pocket? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How long was it after she had been with you before you missed your money? - About a minute, she went home, and I went back to the public house, I missed my money before I got half way there.</p>

               <p>But if you had gone but one yard one way, I suppose she would have gone but one yard the other? - I went into the public house to tell some of my fellow-servants of it.</p>
               <p>The first thing would have been to take the woman? - She might run up any alley.</p>
               <p>But did she? - I had my back to her.</p>

               <p>When she laid her arm round your waist she run away directly - Yes, as soon as she got loose.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by that, had you hold of her? - No.</p>
               <p>Then what had she to loose from? - Only to take her arms off my waist.</p>
               <p>Why did not you run after her? - I did not miss the money then.</p>
               <p>Did you stand still? - I stood still to make water before I went away from the place, after I missed the money I went to the public house, and told one of my fellow-servants, and we went and got a constable, we could not find her that day, we found her about a fortnight afterwards;</p>
               <p>Did you know her before? - I never saw her before; she was in the public house while we was there.</p>

               <p>- JONES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Twyford, the window of my master's shop was broke open on the 2d of January, between the hours of seven and eight; I was in the shop, and the prisoner came to the window, he stood upon his toes and looked over the things in the window, to see, as I imagine, who was in the shop; there was a light in the window, I did not see him at that time attempt to do any thing at the window; about ten minutes after, I saw the prisoner at the window again, and I saw his hands<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140042"/> at work, I did not observe any instrument in his hand any more hearing a window crack, I immediately went out, but he was gone, the window was not broke, only cracked at that time; I came into the shop and was in the shop about ten minutes or thereabouts, and I heard somebody rustle and I thought it was some of his accomplices got into the shop, I looked behind the counter, but there was nobody at all there, and presently afterwards I could see the prisoner at the window again; I saw his hands at work, but not to see him take any of the things away, and I heard a piece of the glass of the window drop; I went out immediately, and found that the window was cut and the goods gone; I called my master out and went after the prisoner; I had not gone but a few yards, and he was coming back again.</p>
               <p>How do you know him to be the same person? - I saw him three times, the light was in the window, and I am very positive he is the same person; upon his perceiving me he crossed over the way and turned to a window where there was a light in it, on the other side of the street, and he took out his watch and pretended to see what o'clock it was, I looked him in the face and found he was the same person; I took him by the collar and told him he must go with me; he made no hesitation but came with me immediately; when I told he was the person that cut the window, he told me I was mistaken, for there was a person with such another coat, waistcoat, and the same kind of hat just gone by; I told him I did not know him by his coat or waistcoat, but I saw him three times at the window and I was positive to his face; Mr. Twyford went for a constable, and by that time the prisoner was returned to the shop; a man that kept a publick house next door but one, came in and two or three more men with him.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found upon him? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Was any thing missing out of your shop? - Yes, the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, when I was committed, he swore he missed nothing.</p>
               <p>Were they in the window of the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they in that place where it was broke open? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When had you seen them there before? - I had not seen them, Mr. Twyford had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Twyford. I saw them in the evening when candles were lighted, they were close under the part of the window that had been broke, the window was broke sufficiently for the things to be taken out; they were of no great bulk, they might have come through the hole made in the window.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood Prisoner's council. You mean by the candle light, three or four o'clock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was near eight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To Jones. He did not offer to run away? - No.</p>
               <p>There was nothing found on the prisoner? - No.</p>

               <p>Can you speak with certainty to the things mentioned in the indictment having been among those that were lost? - Yes, I had given him an inventory of them at the time, there were eight cloth coats, and a great number of waistcoats, regimental and others, more than twelve.</p>

               <p>Court. Who were these things pledged by? - By the prisoner; on the 15th of December there was a shirt also.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - I never saw him in my life before.</p>
               <p>How do you know he is the man? - I questioned him, he told me his master was a colonel, and his pay was not due, and he was very much in want of money, and he had sent these things by him, and as gentlemen send things to our shop I did not doubt him.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, I will state to you what I take to be clearly the law upon this case; that the value of the things must not only be in the whole such a value as the law requires to constitute a capital offence, but the things must be stolen at some one particular time, and no particular acts of stealing must amount to that value; for the law will not permit the value of things stolen at different times, which are in fact different acts of stealing, to be added together; because as no number of petty larcenys will amount to a grand larceny, so no number of grand larcenys added together will amount to a capital charge; it seems to me that there is no direct evidence before you of things taken at any one time, of the value of forty shillings; and though there seems to be no ground for lessening the value of the things which has been put on them by witnesses, yet I do not think a jury is warranted against a prisoner to extend the value; the sword is valued by the witness at twenty shillings only, and by that value I think in such a case you ought to be bound; whatever your opinion upon the view of it may be, you should not, against the prisoner, depart from that; and no value you put on the black silk stockings and shirt, will bring it to 40 s. the pistols he says were under 40 s. there are two others who both speak to other things pledged on the same day, now it would not be a strained inference to say that they were taken at the same time, but they both added together do not amount to the value.</p>

               <p>Then how came this business out against Welch? - Why Daly was going to begin first.</p>
               <p>Begin what? - To speak about it, he was taken once before with Welch.</p>
               <p>How came Welch to be taken up upon this business? - Because he was concerned in something before.</p>
               <p>How did this come out against him at all; you understand the question well enough if you chuse to answer it? - Because he owed me money, and he would not pay it me, it was concerning a robbery that he had done at Hounslow heath.</p>
               <p>Did you inform against him for this? - No, not for this only.</p>

               <p>Who did you give the information to? - To a justice in the Borough.</p>
               <p>How came he to Bow-street? - We were taken from the Borough, to be carried up to Bow-street the next day; the justice desired me to speak all I knew. I did not like that way of living, I wanted to drop it if once I got out of it.</p>
               <p>It does not seem to be much, because you did not like the way of living, but because this man would not pay you the money; on your information he was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing more of this indictment? - No, not this indictment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Welch. It is of no use to speak to him, he bears a very bad character, he was cast for death down at Plymouth, he was in gaol at Bristol; and I never was tried before a judge or jury before.</p>

               <p>Why to be sure a man must have a good memory for that? - The Justice wrote them down.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Council for Prosecution. Had you lately before the robbery seen that door was shut? - It was a pannel broke out of the door, it is a side door that goes into a passage, a door we do not use.</p>
               <p>Was you alarmed at all in the course of that night? - Yes, about one a servant man called from the room adjoining where I lay, and told me there were people breaking into the house, I got up directly, we went into the maid-servant's door, and as soon as I entered in at that door, they had just forced another door of the same room, and were coming in.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you observe when you went into the room? - The people that were in the house heard me.</p>
               <p>Did you see any of the people? - No, there was no light, I heard somebody say we will blow your brains out, immediately two pistols were discharged, either in the room, or in the door-way, we found a slug in the room, it went just over the door that I came in at.</p>
               <p>With a direction to have hit you then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards see any of the persons go out? - I saw one go out as soon as they fired off the pistols, we immediately made back into another room and hallooed out of the window, and then I saw a man go away in front of the house, the door they came in at; I could not see him come out of the house, but I saw him walk from the front door.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any thing? - Yes, Sir, there were some things taken out of the house, but they left a great deal behind them.</p>
               <p>From what part of the house were the things taken? - From the parlours, I am not sure of any of the things, I have seen some of the things, my wife knows them.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of a pocket book? - Yes, I saw it at Bow-Street, it was my mother's, she had such a one, I cannot swear to it, there was a buckle found in the room, and it was produced at the Justice's in Bow-Street, I left it on the table, I should know it again, I think the prisoner was present then, he said he know nothing about the matter, the evidence owned the buckle.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. It seems to on this indictment you cannot find at the three prisoners guilty, for Stokes was gone out of the shop as soon as the two others came in; and the shopman says he had his eye upon her the whole time, and he does not think it was possible for her to take any thing without his seeing her; you will therefore direct your attention to the evidence, as it relates to Moore and Partridge.</p>

               <p>The hat and handkerchief deposed to by the prosecutor; one side of the handkerchief was quite hemmed, and the other only half: the batter is here that made the bat.</p>
               <p>A cutlass produced that was taken from Clarke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Clarke. There is no doubt but the officers belonging to Bow-street have told the gentlemen already what they shall say before they come here.</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. Clarke is one of the returned transports, as soon as we went into the room he snapped a pistol at us, which luckily did not go off; the prosecutor desired the handkerchief might be taken off, he said, if it was his handkerchief there was a little bit that was not hemmed, he looked at it, and it was so.</p>

               <p>On the 14th of December last, me and my wife, and Godliffe Hartman went down to Lee Bridge, we came from there about half past four o'clock, we came through Hackney and crossed the fields by the shoulder of Mutton and Cat, coming through the last field, before we came to the turnpike road, which is the last field in Shoreditch parish, we met a man, and I wished him a good night, and he wished me a good night, and in about a minute my wife turned again and said they are coming; there was nobody with him, but another was running by the rails; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140065"/> were then two of them; I stopped and cried halloo! he said, halloo, damn your eyes, stop! one of them came up to me and put the point of his cutlass to my breast.</p>
               <p>Court. Forbear to mention any thing of your own robbery, because we are now on the robbery of that man only? - I saw Clarke take the hat off Hartman's head.</p>
               <p>You are positively sure he is the man? - I am sure he is; and Randall took his two handkerchiefs from his neck.</p>
               <p>Are you equally positive to his person? - I have recollected him since he was examined at the Justice's, and to all the ideas I can form in my remembrance, he certainly is the person.</p>

               <p>Was the pistol charged? - Yes, here is what it was charged with; pieces of lead and a glass of a pair of buttons, something of that sort; we secured him.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say in my defence; I wish to ask Mr. Hatwell another question: Did you say you would do such a thing again any time, as to fell the stock and not know the person you sold it to?</p>
               <p>Court. I do not know that is any way material at all.</p>
               <p>Hatwell. That I should presume, my Lord, is rather irrelative to the matter in question, but as to that, I made no declaration of that kind.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. You see the charge against you, is for personating Mr. Eaton, and selling this stock, and receiving the money, now whether he said he would do it for any other person or not, has nothing to do with the case.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is very strange that the person who transferred the stock cannot remember me as well as the broker.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Can you give any account how you came by this money that was found in your possession, that will be very material for you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had the money of my friends, and a particular person in the town that was left to conduct my cause, has not got my witnesses as he ought; I have witnesses to my character.</p>

               <p>I am a cheesemonger; I have known the prisoner about two years, he was an apprentice to Mr. Furnis, within ten yards of my house; he was a very sober honest man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask Mr. Eaton as to my character.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Eaton. What has been the prisoner's general character? - He was a very good young man, he was very much in my favour, he was very industrious, he attempted to marry a relation of mine, and I said to her, you cannot do better than have him, as you want to have a baker, for he seems a very industrious young man, and not above carrying the basket.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, in the first place there can be little doubt but that the crime has been committed, and that this sum has been transferred by some person personating Mr. Eaton; then it will remain for your consideration only, whether or no there is sufficient evidence to affect the prisoner, and to satisfy you in your minds that he is the person guilty. Mr. Hatwell the broker, swears expressly to him; and it was necessary that he should take particular notice of his person, because he was to witness the transfer himself after it was made, and because in case of a forgery, he was the person to whom the Bank or the party injured were to resort; and you find gentlemen, Mr. Hatwell did not immediately go and make a transfer, but he had a conversation with the prisoner first; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140073"/> asked him, who recommended him, and did not undertake to make the transfer, till he mentioned the names of one or two persons that he knew: now Harvell has been cautioned over and over again, and he swears expressly and positively that the prisoner at the bar was the man; but added to this you find that a five hundred pounds note a few days afterwards, had been changed at the Bank for a three hundred pounds and four fifty pounds, and that

             the person with whom the prisoner lodged, was the depository of those notes for the prisoner, by his desire; that she afterwards returned those notes to the prisoner, and after he was apprehended, this three hundred pounds note, and these four fifty pounds notes were found in his coat pocket, in his trunk in his lodgings, by Mr. Acton, the solicitor to the Bank; they were in his possession, and they perfectly correspond with those notes changed by Field for that five hundred pounds note; now it would be very material for a person in his way of life, who was an apprentice to a baker, and who never appeared to be a master, to shew how he came by the money: but the prisoner has not shewn us that; the prisoner says, by way of observation and defence; that Trotter, the clerk, who attested the transfer did not recollect him again, and he thinks it very strange that Trotter should not recollect him as well as the broker; but you observe these two men were in very different situations indeed; Hatwell was the person to be responsible, it behoved him therefore to know the person again; whereas it was no business of Trotter's at all, he depended, as he tells you, on Hatwell; and it is not wonderful that a man that does not take notice of another should not recollect him again: upon the whole, therefore, gentlemen, if the case be clearly and satisfactorily made out to your judgment, I am afraid good character cannot avail, because it too frequently happens in this place, that men who commit very bad crimes indeed have had a good character; but if you think the case any way doubtful, if the positive testimony of Hatwell, corroborated by the circumstances of these notes being found in the custody and possession of the prisoner, do not carry sufficient conviction to your minds that the prisoner is guilty of this charge, you will in that case acquit him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - I am a coachman's wife.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In St. Giles's; the prisoner came into my house that same night.</p>
               <p>What night? - I am not positive to the night, the next day he was taken up; he used to come down to see us, and he insisted upon sending for two pots of beer, says I, Harry, it is going late, we do not chuse to have any beer; when I sent the girl to order two pots of beer, he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a handful of silver, to the amount of a guinea as I think; I would not tell a lie for the world; says I, in the name of God where had you this money, have you got it honestly; says he, I have, my father is come to town, and has given me a guinea, and says he, tomorrow I shall have twenty guineas; I said, I am very glad you are relieved out of your trouble, and says I, for God's sake go and pay some part of that money to your distressed landlady; in shewing this money he dropped some papers, and I picked them up, and Mrs. Adams swore to them papers.</p>
               <p>Court. What papers were they? - The Justice desired me to take care of them, they are papers belonging to the insuring office where they insure. (The papers produced.) The prisoner said they were his papers when I shewed them before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. What day of the month was this? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How came you to be surprized at his taking out a little silver? - Because he never worked, and was always living on this poor distressed woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You deal a little in insurance now and then? - No, I never did insure.</p>
               <p>You know what insurance papers are? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>You know these are not pawnbroker's duplicates? - Oh! I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>He took out a guinea's worth of silver? - About a guinea's worth.</p>
               <p>Was there eight shillings in his hand? - I will swear there were three half crowns, and the rest all in silver; it was a guinea's worth of silver.</p>
               <p>What sort of business are you in? - In the woman's clothes way.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, were there fifteen shillings worth of silver in his hand? - Upon my oath there was above.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you how much there was? - A guinea's worth, there he is himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140076"/>Did he tell you it was a guinea's worth? - I swear to twenty shillings; I would sooner say less than more.</p>
               <p>Only tell the truth, that is all that is required of you here. - I do tell the truth if possible, I get nothing by it; I would sooner shew him mercy than not.</p>
               <p>I ask no mercy of you Mrs. White, only stand up and be a little decent if you can; seeing this man with twenty shillings in his hand, you advised him to pay something to Mrs. Adams? - I said, take that trifle of money to give the poor distressed woman something, because I thought it right for him so to do; she had been a friend to him, and I thought it was right.</p>
               <p>Never mind what you thought, let us have less of your comments and more of your evidence; did you say that which I have repeated to you? - Repeat what!</p>
               <p>Did you say you were told he was going to have twenty pounds, and you begged to him to give his poor distressed landlady something? - I desired him to give her some of that twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>When did you tell Mrs. Adams he had dropped these papers? - She never knew it till I came before the Justice, I went to give them to him.</p>
               <p>So you went accidentally? - I went to see him; I did not know any thing about the robbery before; I never told Mrs. Adams, only what I spoke before his worship; I told her at the Justice's; I had not told her before I spoke to the Justice; I shewed them to the woman before the magistrate; Mrs. Adams did not know that I had them, till I went to the Justice's with her.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the prisoner taken up for? - I do not know what.</p>
               <p>Had not you told Mrs. Adams before this man was taken up, that he had dropped these papers? - I will take my oath, I never did tell her so, the man was in confinement before I knew he was.</p>
               <p>How long is it ago, since you said you would do him? - Lord! I do him!</p>
               <p>How long ago is it since you said before the Justice, it was I that did him? - I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, you never said so? - I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mrs. Fordham? - She is nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Will you say, upon your oath, that you never said it was you that done him, before the magistrate? - Upon my oath, I never said that I would do him over.</p>
               <p>I do not ask you whether you said you would do him over, I ask you whether you said you did him? - I did not say it was me that did him, I am sure I never did, I never did say so.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell me just now that you did not know whether you had said so or not? - I never did say so.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - I think I am.</p>
               <p>Now you lose sight of it, your recollection fails you now; did you at any time say it was you that did him? - I never said do him over.</p>
               <p>I do not say do him over, I say, did you ever say it was you that did him? - I never said so that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you swear whether you did or did not? - I never did say I did him over in my life.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say that you did him? - I never said such a word in my life, nor any thing like it to any body; God forbid I should.</p>
               <p>Who was it that you told, that you, through the window, saw this man picking the witness's pocket? - I never said so, the woman that said so is out of doors, this woman the witness lodged there as far as I know.</p>
               <p>How many more lodgers has she? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Adams. How came you first to suspect the prisoner? - I had nobody else lived in the house but him and my own husband, he was in the house when my husband and I sat down together.</p>
               <p>Why did not you say so before? - I said he was there.</p>
               <p>Did not you say that the reason you suspected him was because he dropped some of the papers that were in your pocket? - Yes, that made me quite sure.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140077"/>Was that the reason that you had him taken up? - Because I knew nobody else did it but him.</p>

               <p>Then she had no suspicion of Ambrose before you told her what you had seen? - She did not express it to me before I told her.</p>
               <p>How came you did not go before the Justice with her to keep her company as well as Mrs. White? - I did go, but I was not called on, he was fully committed without.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Adams desire you to tell the Justice what you knew? - He was fully committed before I was called.</p>
               <p>Who were you called by? - Nobody called me.</p>
               <p>Then how could it be before you were called? - I was never called.</p>
               <p>What did your mistress take you there for, if you were not to be called? - I went to speak what I saw.</p>
               <p>Your mistress knew all this before she went to the Justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. She knew it too before the man was apprehended; you know you told her in the morning before she went out of the house? - I told her what I saw.</p>
               <p>Consequently she knew it before she went to Hoxton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go with her to Hoxton? - No, not when she went to take him.</p>
               <p>When did you go? - The second day.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. White ever tell you any thing about papers? - Yes, that day she went to the Justice's, the last day she produced them there.</p>
               <p>When did she tell you of them first? - That was the first I heard about them.</p>
               <p>Never knew of them before? - Never.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140079"/>You said just now, Mrs. Adams said she was sorry that he had served her so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing about being sorry that you should see such a thing, or such an indecent thing? - She said she was very sorry that he had done such a thing to her, for any body to see such a thing.</p>
               <p>Now about this loss of money; her husband had given her money to pay the water tax, and she had lost it? - Not by the insurance, she never insured money that I know of.</p>

               <p>Did you pawn the coat to pay for the insurance? - No.</p>
               <p>How many lodging rooms have you? - The house is down, we did not sleep in the house; there was nothing but a few things in the shop.</p>
               <p>You asked him what he was doing, and he said he was waking her, and she refused to go out? - I would not let him wake her enough.</p>
               <p>But he did wake her? - She waked but she fell in sleep again.</p>
               <p>He asked her to go out, and she said she would not, and he said then he would not go out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In two or three minutes after this she fell asleep? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Those are outside shutters I suppose? - Yes, I fetched them from the passage; I saw him with his hand at her pocket, thro' the window as I was putting up the shutters.</p>
               <p>Did she send you after to invite him to supper? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he lodge at the same house with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to your beds? - We were going to bed then.</p>

               <p>Was not your wife and you together? - No.</p>
               <p>When did your wife first tell you of the loss she had met with? - I was obliged to go to my watch; I went that night a quarter before ten o'clock/; and before that I had been taking a bit of a doze in my shop.</p>
               <p>Where was your wife? - By my side, when I went to sleep she was sitting by me.</p>

               <p>Nobody else? - I think not.</p>
               <p>Who was there when you awoke? - When I awoke there was my wife and this woman.</p>
               <p>Nobody else? - Nobody else that I remember.</p>
               <p>How long after you waked was it that you went on the watch? - Directly, my wife was in a great hurry, but she did not tell me any thing; in the morning, about seven, when I came home she desired of me to go and look for Ambrose; she did not tell me the sense of it.</p>
               <p>Did not she tell you what for? - No, she did not.</p>
               <p>How long was it before she told you what you was to look for him for? - I got up about ten o'clock, she then desired me to look for Ambrose.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you why? - No.</p>
               <p>When did she first tell you she had lost any thing? - Not till I got to Hoxton; then when we saw Ambrose, she desired him to give her what he had taken from her; I heard nothing of it before; she had the money to pay the taxes; I gave it her the day it was lost.</p>
               <p>Did not she use to insure a good deal in the lottery? - Only what I knew about a couple that night, I knew of that.</p>
               <p>Did she lose money by it? - Not as I know; she sent me several times to see if the tickets were come up; I went one night with Ambrose.</p>
               <p>Who did you send that night that you fell asleep? - She desired Ambrose to go, and gave him directions on his hat; that was before I fell asleep.</p>
               <p>Did you see Ambrose come back again? - No; she insured that night, but I do not know what she paid that night; she was expecting the tax man.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140080"/>What did Ambrose say to her when she desired him to give her what he took from her? - He took out some halfpence in his hand, and said, that was all he had; he began to swear, and she desired me to get a constable; then she told me what he had taken from her; and he said, he had nothing but halfpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The lottery was pretty near an end? - I believe at that time they were sixteen pence or eighteen pence.</p>
               <p>Do you know of her pawning your coat? - She told me since, she pawned one of my coats.</p>
               <p>You have found that out lately, ha! Now pray who let you into that secret, did Ambrose? - No.</p>
               <p>Who told you? - I found it out myself.</p>
               <p>How did you find it out Master Adams; come, do not be ashamed, it is no disgrace, a better man than you has had his coat pawned? - My wife told me by my orders.</p>
               <p>How did you find it out? - I knew it without her telling me.</p>
               <p>How much was it pawned for? - Not half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it before or after she had lost this money? - I knew of it before four or five days; I consented; I told her she might put out something or other, because she was desirous to keep it up a little; she went a guinea that night.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, if you have any doubt in this case, I will call the witness, and ask her as to these papers; but if you are satisfied, if you see the evidence in the light I do, I think it will be unnecessary.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, we are very well satisfied.</p>

               <p>Court. What did he say? - He shewed me the bill and said it was drawn on the Ordnance Office, he said he would come the next morning and take the note up; he did not come any more, and I never saw him till I saw him before my Lord Mayor, at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>How long after was that? - I had the note till the Monday week following, and I presented it at Mr. Cox's Office, in Craig's Court; I presented it on the 8th of December.</p>

               <p>Did you know Mr. Lee before? - No, he made use of a gentleman's name that used the house, and I thought I had a faint remembrance of his face, he said his name was Lee, and that he knew several gentlemen that used the house.</p>
               <p>Did he say what he was? - No, I looked upon him to be an officer, he had a cockade, he said he was just come from Scotland.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was this? - The twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth of December, I am not sure which.</p>
               <p>The note produced.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you do with the note? - I presented it the 8th of December, at Mr. Cox's Office, I left it there, and it has been in the possession of the clerk ever since; I left it with Mr. Pinder, that was the same note I received of the prisoner.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at that time pay-master to the artillery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Macnally. When you was before Alderman Crosby, at Guildhall, and was asked where that note was, what was your answer? - I was at Guildhall once or twice with the note, and once or twice without it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect that you said that note was either in the possession of the Alderman or the Alderman's clerk? - I cannot say, but it never was left at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Then do you remember saying, if it is not, perhaps it may be in the possession of my cashier? - Having been before the Lord Mayor on the same business, I did not recollect whether I had left the note at Guildhall or with Mr. Pinder, but certain I was, if not at the office at Guildhall, it was with Mr. Pinder.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at that note. - This is the note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Is it drawn in the usual form that the master of the ordnance draws bills on the pay office? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>How are bills generally drawn by the master of the ordnance? - The master of the ordnance seldom draws a bill, but I apprehend if he had occasion to draw a bill, he would address it to the Right Hon. the principal officers of his Majesty's Ordnance.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know my Lord Townsend's hand writing? - Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How is Lord Townsend appointed to this office? - He was master general of the ordnance at that time.</p>
               <p>Is not it a patent office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was he appointed by patent? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, I beg to observe before this witness goes on with his evidence, that the indictment has stated throughout, in every count, that My Lord Townsend is Master General of the Ordnance, therefore it is necessary for them to prove that fact, and also that there was such an office as the Pay-Office in the Ordnance-office, Whitehall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. Suppose there was no such office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashurst. It says, purporting to be drawn by Lord Townsend.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath, It all comes after purporting, it is no averment that it is so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester to Mr. Cox. Is there any such office as the Pay-office in the Ordnance-office, Whitehall? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashurst. If it was intended to make him believe there was such an office.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140085"/>Mr. Sylvester. My objection is that there is no such person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. Will you pretend to say, because a man forges a note on an officer, and he either wilfully or accidentally mistakes the name of the office, that that is not a forgery; how should it be drawn? here is no averment that he is the Master of the Ordnance; or suppose this note bore date the day after Lord Townsend had been dismissed from his office, and he had given it to an ignorant person, and said, this is a note drawn on the Ordnance Office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, the note itself does not import that Lord Townsend is Master General of the ordnance at all.</p>
               <p>Court. The jury must take upon themselves to determine what M. G. means.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. If they take upon themselves to prove that.</p>
               <p>Court. They are to prove that it was intended to mean that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. They say directed to the Pay-Office in the Ordnance-office at Whitehall, that is averring that there is such an office: why should they add the word in, in the office; the note says, Pay-office Ordnance-office Whitehall, the indictment says, the Pay-office in the Ordnance-office Whitehall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. Whatever comes after purporting is no averment that in fact exists, but pretends to exist. If the jury are of opinion that that does not purport to be paid at the Pay-office Whitehall, that is another thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, a man was indicted and tried before Lord Mansfield for forging a note, purporting to be a bank note, he uttered it as such, and he told the man to whom it was offered, that it was a very good note, he told the man it was a bank note; the man knew no difference: instead of the words the Bank of England, it was my Bank of England, and Lord Mansfield said the words purporting to be a bank note meant, that the note appeared upon the face of it to be a bank note, and the want of such appearance cannot be supplied; now here is a place called in the indictment the Pay-office in the ordnance-office Whitehall, and after this it appears that there is no such place.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a matter of evidence to be left to the jury; you see on presenting the bill the prisoner said it was drawn on the Ordnance-office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashurst. This is not governed by the case you have just quoted of purporting to be a bank note, because that is governed by a precise form.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I understand Mr. Cox to say that there is a precise form to these bills.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashurst. That is only in his opinion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester to Mr. Cox. Would you have paid this as an ordnance draft? - It is not drawn upon me.</p>
               <p>Is there such an office as the Pay-office in the Ordnance-office Whitehall? - There used to be I believe, before the new building at Whitehall was erected, formerly.</p>
               <p>Not in your memory and mine I am sure? - I cannot exactly say, but there is such an office in the Tower.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. There is no such place as the Ordnance-office at Whitehall, not ever was.</p>
               <p>Court to Cox. Are you sure there used to be one? - No, I will not say that.</p>
               <p>Do you know that Lord Townsend was then Master of the Ordnance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with his handwriting? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him write? - Several times.</p>
               <p>Is that Lord Townsend's hand-writing? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Are you clear and certain of that? - Perfectly certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Have you frequently seen him write? - Several times.</p>
               <p>Court. You say at present there is no office at Whitehall, that you know of, for the payment of ordnance bills? - No.</p>
               <p>But they are paid in the Tower? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. What, is Lord Townshend an officer? - Yes, he is Colonel of the Queen's regiment of dragoon guards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140086"/>You are sure he is not Master General? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Is there any such person as Mr. Lee in the Ordnance-office? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Does my Lord Townsend draw upon the Pay-office, would he give me a draft or order, or warrant, to pay to my account? No, you would have an imprest.</p>
               <p>Then I should not have a draft to pay me any money on my own account? a draft therefore, even from Lord Townshend, would not be paid, to be placed to my account? - It is a thing that never happens; the bill says, and place it to his account of office, now John Lee has no business in the office of ordnance at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Mr. Macnally. Are there not many contractors belonging to the Ordnance-office? - There may.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to say that there is no

               <p>Have you seen him write? - I have.</p>
               <p>Look at that? - I do not think it Lord Townsend's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, it is my duty standing here as a council for a prisoner to take every objection that lays in my power, for a man standing in his unfortunate situation, therefore I shall make no apology for troubling your lordship with a further objection. By an act of parliament passed in the twenty-third year of his present Majesty's reign; it is enacted, that every piece of paper or parchment, called a note of hand, or sheet or piece of paper, called a bill of exchange, which shall be ingrossed, written, or printed for any sum under the sum of fifty pounds shall have a stamp duty of sixpence thereon; then the act goes on and says, that if any such note of hand, or bill of exchange shall not be marked or stamped with such stamp duty of sixpence thereon, the same shall not be pleaded on given in evidence in any Court. In a case, the King agaisnt Hawkins, which was reserved by Mr. Justice Buller, a person was indicted for forging a bill of exchange, which was not stamped according to the late act. The objection was taken by Mr. Baldwin at Worcester.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. It says, it shall not be given in evidence between the parties, it does not mean in a criminal prosecution; the meaning of the act of Parliament is, that the man who neglects to pay the duties shall derive no benefit from it, but it does not extend to criminal suits.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester to Mr. Cox. Would you pay a draft unstamped that was drawn on sight? - Certainly I would if it was drawn on me.</p>
               <p>Do you know that all notes except those on Bankers are to pay certain duty? - No, Sir, I do not understand so, because we pay twenty every day that are drawn at sight, without stamps; what I understand by a Banker, is a person acting as a Banker, and if a man keeps can with me, I act as his Banker.</p>
               <p>If that bill had been presented to you would you have paid it? - No, I certainly would not, because it was not my Lord Townsend's hand writing, and in the next place it was not adressed to me.</p>
               <p>Do you know any body upon the face of God's earth that would have paid it? - Here is a person that advanced money upon it.</p>
               <p>Now, is that an answer Mr. Cox?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I leave it to my Council, who are sufficiently able to defend my cause.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Sylvester. Have you any witnesses to call? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen: In this case upon one of these objections taken by council it must be left to you, whether, upon the face of this bill it does not purport to be directed to the Pay-office, and to be signed by Lord Townsend, as Master General of the Ordnance, if you think one or the other it not purported, then it would be a ground for an acquittal: If you think it does so purport, then the evidence goes to that part of the indictment. The uttering of this bill is proved by Cresdale, who relates the circumstance of the prisoner's coming to him, and it appears to be a forged bill; it is very difficult indeed to prove the very act of forgery; these matters are your consideration, first, whether you sufficiently give credit to the witnesses, and in the next place, whether you think it purports to be drawn by Lord Townsend, Master General of the Ordnance, and to be paid at the Pay-office, in the Ordnance-office: If you do not believe the evidence, or do not think it so purports, then there will be a ground for acquittal; If you believe the witnesses, and think it does so purport, in that case you will find the prisoner guilty.</p>

               <p>I was coming home on new year's night; between twelve and one o'clock; I met the prisoners opposite St. Margaret's churchyard, Westminster; I went there to a house to ask for a person that would have seen me home, and these women followed me out, and rather decoyed me home with them; and scarce had I got up stairs but they used me very unhandsomely; they threw me down and stripped me of my clothes, and took four shillings and six pence out of my breeches pocket, which was all the money I had in the world.</p>
               <p>How do you know you had the money in your pocket? - I am sensible I had it in my pocket, for I wrapped it up in a piece of paper, I felt it in my pocket, and held my hand upon it during the time they forced it from me; I was not drunk; I do not use myself much to drink; I am but a poor working man, and my abilities will not admit of it, I was not in liquor, I was sober.</p>
               <p>How long had you been drinking? - About an hour and an half.</p>
               <p>No more than that? - No, I do not think I had.</p>
               <p>Where had you been till eleven o'clock? - I had been to the sign of the Star and Garter, in Palace-yard, to see a person.</p>
               <p>Had not you been drinking there? - Yes, part of two or three pints of beer.</p>
               <p>Then you had been drinking more than an hour and an half? - I was sober then.</p>
               <p>You seem to lay a stress on the word then; had you been in liquor before that evening? - No, I had not been in liquor.</p>

               <p>Was he a man that knew his conduct as he should do? - If he had he would not have stole this horse.</p>
               <p>You are very right, because I believe in order to steal the horse from the situation in which you had left it, he must necessarily pass before your own door. - Certainly he did, and saw me through the window, and it is a thousand to one but I had seen him.</p>
               <p>It appeared to you like an act of insanity, and I believe your opinion of him very well warranted it? - I said so at the justice's, he was always an ignorant fellow.</p>

I asked him where he was going with her, I never saw the mare before, he said to Smithfield; I asked him if she would draw, and he said yes; I asked him the price of the mare, and he said seven pounds I said she is in a very bad condition to sell, I think you will not get that money for her; and his answer was, I believe my master must abate something of it: Says I, is your master coming, he said no; then says I, how can he abate anything, he said I must abate it myself, I said where do you bring the mare from: he said, he brought her from one Mr. Goring's; says I, she is in a very bad condition to sell, I said she was in a sweat; says he, I will lead her to Smithfield, and she will get cooler by then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Hall, what are you? - A labouring man.</p>
               <p>Never saw the prisoner before? - Never, I saw him again the other day.</p>

               <p>No concern in the boiling house at all? - No.</p>
               <p>What made you enquire about this mare? - It is a natural case, when any body is going to Smithfield, and one sees a horse in sweat and dirt.</p>
               <p>A natural case. what do you make it your business? - I was going home.</p>
               <p>And do you ask every man you see with a horse in a sweat and dirty, in Kingsland-road, where he is going with him? - I have asked several.</p>
               <p>And I suppose several have asked you what you meant by asking the question; what had you to do with him? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>And yet you say it is a natural case: who are you Mr. Hall? - I live at Winchmore-hill; I split wood and bring it to town.</p>

The man that was about buying her, says to the prisoner, hold out your hand and strike me, and I will have her; with that he bid the prisoner get off the mare and go into the house and take his money, and he said, gentlemen I have bought her; with that I advanced down upon the man and the mare, and said, if you have bought her I think you have bought the property of a man which he had no right to sell; with that I accused the prisoner where he had her from, his reply was from Mr. Goring White Webb's; that is in Enfield parish; I told the man that bought her, says I, I shall keep this man in custody on suspicion, for I think Mr. Goring would not give him toleration to sell her for that price, and I would have taken the mare into custody but the man that bought her denied me; I said I was going down to Enfield where he said he brought the mare from, and I would take the man down to Enfield with me to know the rights of it; with that one of the men asked me if I was an officer, I replied, yes; I took the prisoner to the Basing-house in Kingsland-road, then an officer came to assist me, and the master of the Basing-house said, you may as well come in; and then the prisoner replied, if you will come in I will tell you the truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did the prisoner tell you any thing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then stay a minute before you mention what he told you; had you threatened him to carry him to jail, or did you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then my Lord will tell you that you are not now to tell us what he said.</p>
               <p>Court. No.</p>
               <p>Farrow. Then the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You live at Enfield? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you know this man? - No.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted you know Silly

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 19th of last month I saw this prisoner leading the mare along with a halter over her head, I asked him where he was going with it, he told me to Smithfield,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140095"/> I asked him whether it was to be sold before he got to Smithfield, he told me it was, I asked him who was the master of the horse, he said he brought it from White Webbs, it belonged to one Mr. Goreham, or Roreham, at White Webbs, I cannot tell which; I asked him the reason of his master's selling it, he said his master had got more than he knew what to do with at that time; I asked him how old it was, he told me he could not justly tell the age, I asked him if it would carry safe, and I lifted my leg upon it, he said his master did not tell him whether it was found or not, I asked him how much money, he told me six pounds, I told him I thought it was too much, if it was not found it was not worth near the money, but he said if he could not get that, his master told him to sell it for less; I told him I thought four guineas was the full value of it, but said I, what value does your master set upon it? he said his master told him if he could not get six pounds, to sell it for something less; the agreement was four guineas, but there was no money passed, and one Hall that is here in Court, said, he imagined it was stole.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Never mind what he imagined? - I said, if it was stole, and he knew the man to be the thief, why did not he stop him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This was on the market-day Mr. Stuck? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And so of a market-day you chuse to take your walk into the road to buy horses, instead of buying at Smithfield market? - This is the first time I ever did so.</p>
               <p>I fancy not, however the first question you asked the prisoner, seeing him with this horse was, whether it was to be sold? - No it was not.</p>
               <p>I have it down so my friend, was that the truth or not? - I am as able to tell truth as you are.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not say this moment, that you asked him whether the horse was to be sold at the market, or whether it might be sold before? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. You did say so friend.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, he said so expressly, which he has now twice as expressly denied; now be so good Mr. Stuck as to tell us, whether you said what my Lord has told you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say so? did not you say just now</p>
               <p>"I asked the prisoner whether it was to be sold, and he told me yes?"</p>
               <p>Court. I have told you what you said on your first examination, if you made a mistake you may say so, but you certainly did say that when you saw the prisoner, you asked him whether the horse was to be sold before he got to Smithfield, and he said it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you ask him whether the horse might be sold before he got to Smithfield, or did you not? - I never mentioned that.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - You would not have me swear again.</p>
               <p>Yes, I would have you swear again, and in the most unequivocal manner? - I might forget what I said.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did you ask that question or not? - Ask what question?</p>
               <p>Did not you ask him whether the horse might not be sold before it went to Smithfield market? - Yes, that I will agree to.</p>
               <p>You had forgot that now a minute ago? - I should be very sorry to forget the truth.</p>
               <p>Did you ever buy a horse at Smithfield market? - Many a one.</p>
               <p>But you like them better before; who is your partner in the boiling business? - I have no partner.</p>
               <p>Did you never keep a boiling-house? - No.</p>
               <p>What have you kept? - Why a slaughter-house.</p>
               <p>For horses? - For hogs.</p>
               <p>Did you never kill a horse in this town to boil for meat? - Never in my days.</p>
               <p>What was you to have bought this horse for? - To have sold again.</p>
               <p>You are a dealer in horses? - I deal some little matter.</p>
               <p>O you deal some little matter, but you like an unsound one better than a sound<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140096"/> one? - I am quite a different man, I slaughter nothing for myself, unless it be now and then a hog.</p>
               <p>Is your's a slaughter-house where any thing of beasts are killed, either horses or hogs? - Quite different, it is a slaughter-house which is open day and night.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Allen-street, Clerkenwell, No. 32.</p>
               <p>How many boilers of horse flesh live within a few yards of you? - None for six or seven yards.</p>
               <p>What did you want to buy this horse for? - For my own use, and for no other but for my own use, to sell again.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a cart? - Yes, and it goes to Leaden-hall-market every morning in the week except Sunday.</p>
               <p>How many horses did you buy in the course of the last twelve months? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>But you must? - I cannot guess.</p>
               <p>Aye but you will? - Did you buy so few as seventy? - I never bought so many.</p>
               <p>Fifty? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you buy so many as fifty? - Not so many.</p>
               <p>Forty? - I cannot tell, it is impossible.</p>

               <p>Did not you buy so many as forty? - I do not know that I did or did not; I will swear I did not.</p>
               <p>Thirty, or any given number that you choose to fix upon? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Fix upon any given number? - I do not know, I do not keep such things in my head.</p>
               <p>What do you buy them in so inconsiderable a way; why what must the Jury think of you, friend? - The Jury have a right to think as they please.</p>
               <p>It is very fortunate they have, it is a very fortunate thing in the constitution of this country; and you would have them believe you, when you say you keep no account? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect them with any precision? - I do not imagine they might be so many.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did they not amount to forty? - I cannot swear any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Jury. You must be a very capital dealer? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Cannot you tell within ten or a dozen? - I do not keep any account.</p>
               <p>Do you sell them again? - I do sell them again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I must have an answer to my question; I must ask you upon your oath to say what number you bought in the course of the last year; will you venture to tell the Jury upon your oath, that you did not buy forty? - I will tell the Jury, or any gentleman upon the matter of truth, that I do not know that I bought thirty.</p>
               <p>Only one more question and that you are not interested to tell me a lie about; you know that White Webb's was at Enfield? - I do not know that.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140097"/>That was the family of the late Alderman Bird, Alderman of this city? - Yes, he was <rs id="t17840114-65-deflabel353" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

               <p>What character did he bear for honesty there? - He did not come till the Alderman died, my mistress always had a good opinion of him; I never heard any thing amiss of him before; I have known him for ten years to this present time; he has left the service of Mrs. Bird about twelve months; she at present resides at Coventry.</p>
               <p>I believe you have lived before with a gentleman that was out of his mind? - Yes, three years.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any thing particular happening to the prisoner? - About six years ago, either in January or February; he was taken all of a sudden, and was, as we thought, quite out of his mind; there was a doctor sent for, and he bled him and blistered him, and he was kept quite close up in a chamber, and the windows of the room were fastened down; he was so outrageous at that time, that if he could have got at any of the maids he would have done them a mischief; he said they were washing their hands in his heart's blood; he was kept close for three weeks; I did every thing for him, carried him up his victuals and drink; nobody else could master him; my mistress knew I had lived with a gentleman that was out of his mind.</p>
               <p>And in your judgement during that three weeks he was a mad man? - I think that during that three weeks he was as much out of his mind as any person that was in Bedlam, and we always looked upon him, that very often, at different times, he was not the person he should be; he did many things that we thought he was not right in his head.</p>
               <p>Did he drink? - He was kept as much from it as possible, but if he got a little drop it set him quite bad again, that he hardley knew what he did.</p>
               <p>Was he considered, after this illness in the family, as a man of found understanding? - No, never; I was with him in the family between three and four years.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Mrs. Bird permit him to drive her? - Yes; and after I left her, she tried him as long as she could, and the reason she gave for his going away was, that he was so bad at sometimes, that she was afraid to trust herself with him any longer.</p>
               <p>Jury. When was the last return of the frenzy that you remember? - He had frequent returns; the last I remember is three years ago; she said they could not rule him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. No man can be guilty of a criminal offence unless he is a free agent; if a man is under any habitual insanity, it would be very hard for him to be condemned for committing a crime when he is under the visitation of God; therefore the first question is, whether he was in such a state of mind as that he did not know what he did? for if so, you would not find him guilty if he did steal the mare.</p>

               <p>Burridge. This handkerchief contains buckles which were in my own bed room, and three silver watches which were in my glass-case, they are mine, I am quite sure of them.</p>

               <p>Them watches were in my master's window, and I took them out because they should not be burnt; my mistress often flogged me; and if it had not been for my master my mistress would have been transported. My mistress made me steal six ducks, and she burnt the ducks in the fire afterwards, and fowls and a young pig she made me steal. My mistress has made me steal money from my master.</p>

            , The circumstances of your case are such, that the Court cannot pronounce sentence upon you, without taking some notice of them. Young as you are, you appear to have arrived to a degree of wickedness, that renders you an unworthy member of society, and likely to become very dangerous to it; and notwithstanding your tender years, if you had been capitally convicted, it is hardly probable that your Sovereign would have thought fit to have extended his mercy to you; you were not only guilty of robbing your master and mistress from time to time, aggravated as that crime always is by breach of trust, but of the much more heinous crime of setting fire to their house, and endeavouring not only by that to destroy their property, but their lives. There appears therefore to be no hopes of your ever making a safe or useful member of society, at least in this country, the laws of which you have attrociously violated; but not having been convicted of a capital offence, the Court can only sentence you to be <rs id="t17840114-66-punish361" type="punishmentDescription">

               <p>On the 7th of this month, I refined a boil of spermaceti, and on the evening about eleven I took it out of the pan into smaller pans, I filled those small pans to No. 12; on emptying one of them, I carried one into my front shop and the remainder next day; I piled them in my shop, nine on the table and three in the window; on Tuesday morning following, I missed a spermaceti cake; I enquired of my servants, and found one was stolen; I went as soon as I missed it to different people of the trade, and in a day or two following, I received information of it at Mr. Soames's, in Catwater-street.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you now it was the identical spermaceti? - For several reasons, there are only three refiners of spermaceti in London; Mr. Enderby, Mr. Pugh, and myself: I pack in small pans.</p>
               <p>Court. Are the other refiners here? - No; the pans are all of a size and colour, and it is impossible to refine two boilings of spermaceti of one and the same colour, and I never sold a pan of spermaceti since I have been in business.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know how the others boil? - They make use of square pans, and I make use of round ones.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Did you try this cake at all whether it would suit your pan? - No, but it has other marks that I can identify it by; it was very severe cold at the time this was taken out, and by cooling very suddenly they cracked a little at the top, and this amongst the rest has a kind of a cross or crack.</p>
               <p>Court. Why if any of the other refiners had refined while that severe cold was it must have had the same effect. - It is my property, I swear to it now.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before this? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him near your house or shop? - No.</p>

               <p>Are there any other reasons that you can give for knowing it to be your property? - The cake is here; it is the same boil, the same spermaceti; I have compared a sample.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow Council for the Prisoner. I believe it is impossible to judge about spermaceti by candle light; but pray how long have you been a <rs id="t17840114-70-viclabel376" type="occupation">refiner of spermaceti</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t17840114-70-victim763 t17840114-70-viclabel376"/>? - About four months.</p>
               <p>If you had not some reason from its shape or from some insignificant track at the top you do not otherwise know when it was manufactured; can you, or a more experienced dealer in spermaceti, tell whether it was manufactured this year? - No man can tell that.</p>
               <p>Do you ever keep spermaceti by you? - Yes, large quantities.</p>
               <p>During four months you used round pans? - I have been almost twenty years in the tallow chandlery.</p>
               <p>Court. And has all your skill and experience in spermaceti been collected within these four months? - I have made spermaceti candles since 1759.</p>
               <p>Does that intitle you to swear with accuracy as to the refining of spermaceti? - I was a very good judge of spermaceti before.</p>
               <p>Now the spermaceti comes to you in its refined state? - It used to do.</p>
               <p>I ask you this, answer it like an honest man, whether the spermaceti that you used to make candles of did not come to you just in the shape you produce it? - It did not come in this shape.</p>
               <p>Is it by a crack which is produced by an indiscreet mode of cooling it, is that the way you indentify it? - I cannot say more than I have.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to tell the Court that you will not answer the question; is there any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140105"/> thing that should present a man, who was a tallow chandler, and had a pan of that size, from pouring it into that pan; is there any how against it? - If spermaceti comes to be refined it becomes blacker.</p>
               <p>My question is this, whether if a man had poured his spermaceti into a pan of that size it would not have taken precisely that form? - It would have taken this form if it had been poured into this pan.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing singular, any name, any initial of a name; with respect to round pans and square pans, what are they made of? - Earthen ware.</p>
               <p>Are they made of one peculiar manufactory? - They are made at Lambeth.</p>
               <p>I might buy pots of that size, they are not made for spermaceti alone, you being young in the trade make shift with pots? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now suppose any other little refiner should set up and go to Lambeth to buy pots, could he have there? - There is no other refiner than what I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - Because there is none that have presses but what I mentioned.</p>
               <p>What is a press? - A very large piece of workmanship. It is a large undertaking.</p>
               <p>Can you boldly tell the Jury, that there are no men who use these round pans for putting their spermaceti in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How can you venture to say that? - I have not seen any, and if there was, you cannot bring spermaceti to match this, except at my house.</p>
               <p>That is a pretty bold assertion, that no person uses round pans but you.</p>
               <p>Jury. Will not the air alter it? - It may grow whiter by continuing in open air, but still all the parcel will be the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What is there that is peculiar in this spermaceti? - It is of a particular boil.</p>
               <p>Is it whiter, browner, or more yellow? - This we call exceeding good stuff; and there is no quantity of that sort but this in London, nor no where else.</p>
               <p>Court. Then perhaps it does not agree exactly with your pans? - Exactly in colour and weight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, it is my duty, and it will always be much my disposition to submit my questions to the Court: In this case, your Lordship fees I am combating this peremptory assertion, the grounds of which, he is not able to explain to the Jury, because I submit on the part of the prisoner, that this is a property that cannot be identified.</p>
               <p>Court. Go on.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing extrinsic in the form of that spermaceti by which you can affect to distinguish it? - It is the form of all my pans, and all the rest are alike.</p>
               <p>Then extrinsic of the form and shape there is nothing?</p>
               <p>Jury. If you was to see a piece of spermaceti broke off that cake, should you know it was your own? - I could when compared.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, if Gentlemen of the Jury, without seeing the drift of my question, are to prevent an answer by asking others, and so to decide for themselves, I despair of doing any thing for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. They may ask questions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Certainly, my Lord, and as to the truth of this witness's evidence, that must be considered by the Jury alone; but I submit it is perfectly novel for any body except the Court to break into my examination till I have done with the witness.</p>
               <p>Court. Then go on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You say that by the size, the shape, and the form of that, you believe it to be your's; that is one description: is there any thing else besides the shape and the form of it by which you can distinguish it from any other property? - The quality.</p>
               <p>Now what is it in the quality by which you can distinguish it? - I wish you was a judge of it; I have a sample of the same kind of another pan, and if it was daylight, you would see as well as I that it was the same colour and the same quality; and if you saw this cake and all the rest, you would have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140106"/>Have you compared it with the other eleven? - I have compared this and the other eleven.</p>
               <p>What since you lost the one? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you have not made the comparison you are calling on me to make? - The comparison is in my eye.</p>
               <p>You said that if I was to compare it with the other pans I should have no doubt, why you have not done it yourself. - No.</p>
               <p>If any other spermaceti was in that round shape it would be like your's; suppose any other refiner was to borrow your pan? - I defy all the world for refining a boil of spermaceti to bring it to this colour.</p>
               <p>Would not it exactly correspond if it was that your old? - You can easily tell if it is old.</p>
               <p>You say you never saw any other refiner put them into round pans? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>But that they do not do it you cannot tell us? - They may do it if they chuse.</p>
               <p>Can you say that no other man in the trade uses round pans? - I do not know that they do.</p>
               <p>You do not know that they do not. - Take it so; Mr. Pugh and Mr. Enderby make use of square pans.</p>
               <p>You do not know that they do not use round pans? - I do not know that they do, they generally use square pans.</p>
               <p>How frequently do you see any of Mr. Pugh's pans? - I am at his house every week.</p>
               <p>Suppose one of his lead things was out of repair, might he not put it into a round thing for once in a way? - He might.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Court. What are you? - A tallow-chandler; the prisoner came to my house on Monday morning last; I knew him before.</p>
               <p>What is the prisoner? - He is a housekeeper in the city.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He keeps a tallow-chandler's shop. - No, I believe not; the prisoner came to me on Monday morning last, the 12th of this month, about ten o'clock, and asked me if I knew the value of spermaceti; I told him I did not; he said he had a piece at home, and if; I dealt in it, he would let me have it I told not, but that I was going in the city about four in the afternoon, and I would call at his house and take a sample of it; I called on him.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts does he live? - In Widegate-street, Bishopsgate; I went in, and I saw this piece of spermaceti lay on a basket, open as it is now; the prisoner's wife was behind the counter; I cut off about an ounce, and came into Bishopsgate-street, and just by the corner of Houndsditch I met Mr. Soames, who was my master; I shewed it to him; I went to a wax-chandler who deals in spermaceti, whose name is Thorley.</p>
               <p>Court. His name is not on the back of the indictment, therefore do not mention it. - I returned back, and saw his wife, and I told her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Never mind what you told her. - On Monday this transaction happened about this piece of spermaceti; on Wednesday morning the prisoner brings it to my house, and he said this is the spermaceti; he weighed it, and it weighed forty-four pounds; at the price I dealt for it, it came exactly to four pound and eight-pence, and that I should have paid him, but he required no money; I told him, very well, I should send it immediately to the merchants; I do not make use of it myself. I asked him how he came by it; he said he had it of a gentleman; he did not say how, only that a gentleman brought it into his shop; I should have bought it for myself if I had used it as much as butter or bacon; he left me in the morning, and Mr. Soames's man called at my house, and this spermaceti was sent by him to Mr. Soames's house; there it was apprehended.</p>
               <p>What was you told by Mr. Soames? - He told me the real price was two shillings and sixpence; the prisoner has bought candles of me before; he owed me nothing, but the price of this was to go in account in future candles.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The prisoner did not press you to make an end of the treaty? - Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140107"/> he brought it to my house on the Wednesday, I should not have sent for it.</p>
               <p>He brought it from his shop publickly to your shop publickly without any concealment? - Undoubtedly he did.</p>
               <p>And described to you that he bought it of a Gentleman? - Yes; I believe this is the piece I sent to Soames; there is a cross upon it which often happens on casks of tallow when they stand to cool.</p>
               <p>Is not that the way that every thing cracks that cracks from the centre? - Upon my oath that is the same piece.</p>
               <p>Did you ever deal in it before? - No.</p>
               <p>Is it usual for tallow-candlers to buy, pieces of spermaceti? - Yes, it is, pieces of wax and spermaceti; that is, I then pieces of candles</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then do not tell us at all.</p>
               <p>Court. There was some spermaceti shewn you this last week by Weaver? - I met Weaver in Bishopsgate-street on Monday or Tuesday last, and he shewed me some spermaceti in a sample, and said he had got a cake of spermaceti to sell, and my man called at his house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That you do not know. - He brought me home this cake of spermaceti.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you understand spermaceti? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does the spermaceti of one boiling resemble that of another? - I am not a competent judge of that; this is the same spermaceti that was brought to my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you had it ever since? - Until I delivered it to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Can you distinguish the spermaceti candles of one boiling from those of another? - In general they are pretty much alike.</p>
               <p>There are a good many, of spermaceti I believe? - But very few.</p>
               <p>Court. But supposing a number of candles were delivered to you, taken from different lumps of different boilings, would they be of one colour or of different colours? - I should imagine they would be of different colours.</p>

               <p>I am a tallow-chandler; I work for the prosecutor: last Wednesday was a week we refined some spermaceti; in the evening we took it out of the copper and put it into pans to cool; on the Thursday morning we took one of the cakes out, and carried it forwards into the shop, he thought it was not cold enough; he let it stand till the Friday morning, then he carried the rest there; on the Friday they were all in the shop; on the Tuesday morning my master called me, and asked me how many pans we had filled; I told him twelve; I counted them and there were but eleven</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know who took it? - No.</p>
               <p>How long have you been practised in refining spermaceti? - About three months.</p>
               <p>Is there any difference between the several pots of spermaceti that are refined in the same boiling? - No.</p>
               <p>In what respect do they resemble each other? - In colour.</p>
               <p>In what else? - In shape generally, but the colour is the object.</p>
               <p>How can you safely swear whether this is the same? - To the best of my judgment it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You cannot positively swear that that is one of your master's? - I swear to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>In what does it differ? - they that understand it could tell.</p>
               <p>Do you understand it? - understand it so far as that.</p>
               <p>Then tell me? - Because it is not brought off sometimes properly and it will not be so fair.</p>
               <p>Is that well brought off? - Yes, I look upon it to be a very good piece of sperm.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140108"/>Would not another good piece of sperm be like it? - I cannot tell, this seemingly resembles that boil; but there are so few of the trade that them are none I believe that use pans.</p>
               <p>Aye, I thought you had learned that. - If they came to be clapped together you might see some difference.</p>
               <p>Have you compared that with the spermaceti? - No.</p>
               <p>Not with the other eleven pots? - Yes, by a pattern taken off of the piece.</p>
               <p>Did you compare it? - No.</p>
               <p>You judge of it then by its being a round thing? - If you was to take the cake there, you would think it was the same boil.</p>
               <p>You know as little about it as I do? - Oh, I think were too.</p>
               <p>In what can you say either that it resembles your master's, or differs from the manufacture of another man? - I swear to the best of my knowledge; but as to the differing from any other it is impossible to tell, unless you was to clap them together.</p>
               <p>And you have not clapped them together, therefore you cannot tell; now if any body else had made one in a round pan, the shape of mat would have been like it? - It might.</p>
               <p>Do you think that that piece would go into any other of the pans than that which it was taken out of? - Very likely it might.</p>
               <p>But very li kely it might not; do you think it would? - I really believe it might.</p>
               <p>Your master did not know how many he had poured out it seem! - I dare say he did.</p>
               <p>You know he asked you? - That was to hear what what I had to say.</p>
               <p>You are lately turned refiner too? - That is no odds to any body.</p>
               <p>Did not your master take up this trade because he was indicted for a nuisance? -</p>
               <p>Court. That is nothing to the purpose.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He sells candles, soap, and butter, a fort of chandler; and he has served me for eighteen or nineteen months. I keep a shop; I settle my accounts with him every week; I was there last Monday about nine in the morning; he was weighing out some candles for me; in the mean time, a man came in, and brought in a basket, something I did not know what it was; I thought it was wax; I cannot swear it was this, but it was just the same as this.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it was that? - I believe it was that. A man came in, and put a basket down, and asked Mr. Scott whether he wanted to buy it; I did not understand whether it was spermaceti or wax; he asked him a price however: he called the girl out to attend me, and the girl came out and weighed up some candles for me; I heard him asking a price; I believe he said two shillings or two shillings and two-pence, but I cannot tell rightly; and he told Mr. Scott that he would take it out half in candles; and the prisoner told him he would give him two shillings a pound if he had a mind to take it all out in candles: at last they agreed, and he looked out and told him the sizes, and I saw some money pass from Mr. Scott to the man, some shillings, four, five, or six.</p>
               <p>Did the man leave what he brought in his basket? - Yes, I believe it to be this; he put it upon a basket behind the counter upon a shelf.</p>
               <p>Was this a secret or open transaction in the shop? - It was upon the counter, open; several people came in besides; the servant was there.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - I keep a shop.</p>

               <p>Whereabouts? - In Petticoat Lane.</p>
               <p>How long have you kept it? - About eighteen or nineteen months.</p>
               <p>Have you been in your shop all that time? - Yes, I have been out of my house in the country for a few days.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140109"/>Have you lived no where else in town? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Are you clear in that? Have you laid no where else? - No, Sir, not when I was in town.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner? - Only as long as, I kept shop; I was recommend him, and he sells candles reasonable.</p>
               <p>Was there any other person besides you that overheard this conversation, and saw this man bring in this? - No they did not stop; I was obliged to stop because I had an account to settle.</p>
               <p>What was he to give a pound? - I cannot recollect whether it was two shillings or two shillings and two-pence.</p>
               <p>When you came into the shop who were in the shop? - There was nobody there; Scott was there serving me with some candles.</p>
               <p>Was any of the prisoner's family there? - His wife was in doors.</p>
               <p>Was his servant there? - She was in the room till he called her out.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner first called her, was this strange man in the shop or no? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect how that stranger was dressed? - Yes, he had a dark brown or black coat and waistcoat, I cannot tell which; I believe he had his own hair.</p>
               <p>Was you dressed as you are now, or how otherwise? - I had a brown great coat, a white coat, and a wax leather round hat.</p>
               <p>What hat had the strange man? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>When the servant came in, where was her majesty standing? - Behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Was he standing to the right or left? - He was near to the street, near the scales.</p>
               <p>Where was you standing? - Just by the counter, a little higher up towards the room.</p>
               <p>How far in this conversation about the bargain had they gone when the maid servant came in? - So soon as the man came in and put the basket down he called the maid directly.</p>
               <p>Did you see the cake weighed? - I saw it put in the scale after, I believe, had made the bargain.</p>
               <p>How long did the stranger stay in the shop? - Very hear half an our to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did the maid stay all time? - Yes, she staid to weigh out the candles into pounds, all sorts of candles.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect how she was dressed then? - I really cannot sell rightly.</p>
               <p>Had she a hat or no? - No, she had not to the best of knowledge.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay in the shop? - I was there at eight, and staid near half an hour.</p>
               <p>Which went out first, you or the stranger? - The stranger went out first.</p>

               <p>Do you know a Mr. Norden? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Have you frequently seen Norden there? - I saw him last Monday morning about nine; he came in and asked for some candles, and some other business he said he was about besides; my master was serving the candles, and this man came in with the spermaceti, and he left off serving the candles himself, and called me to serve them; I saw what was in the basket, it was a cake of spermaceti; it was as nigh as I can recollect such a one as this. The man asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140110"/> my master the price of the candles, he told him seven shillings a dozen; there came other customers in, and I kept serving them, so that what the price of the spermaceti was to be I did not hear.</p>
               <p>Did you hear them treating for the sale of it? - I did not understand what the words were, they were talking together, but I did not understand what they said, nor hear what price he was to have; he took away some candles, my master served him, I did not assist in serving him; I did not continue in the shop all the time the man was there, I was in the kitchen two or three times.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Norden there after the stranger was gone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay afterwards? - About half an hour.</p>
               <p>How long was the things in the shop? - I count he might be half an hour, of longer, I was not there all the time he was.</p>
               <p>What became of the spermaceti that he left? - When he was gone the spermaceti lay on a large basket in the shop; it lay there from Monday till Wednesday, I had no directions about concealing it, it lay openly in the shop as the rest of his goods; a great many people came in and out.</p>
               <p>Court. How was this stranger dress? - To the best of my knowledge it was black.</p>
               <p>Did you see Norden come into the shop? - No, I did not see him come in.</p>
               <p>How was Norden dressed? - I cannot properly say.</p>
               <p>Had he a great coat or no great coat? - To the best of my knowledge he had no great coat, but I did not notice.</p>
               <p>What coloured cloaths had he on? - I cannot properly say, I did not take notice.</p>

               <p>When you was called into the shop where was he? - He was standing by the counter.</p>
               <p>Which part? - about the middle, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Where was your master standing? - He was behind it.</p>
               <p>Was he near the street; or near parlour door, or what other door? - He was almost in the middle of the shop.</p>
               <p>Then it was fronting the street, was not it? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Do you remember that there were two pair of scales hanging up in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were Norden or your master standing near the scales? - I did not see either of them standing near the scales.</p>
               <p>Which went out of the shop first, Norden or the stranger? - The stranger.</p>
               <p>Who weighed out the candle to the stranger? - My master to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - No. Sir, I am not properly sure of it, but to the best of my knowledge; I was serving other customers</p>
               <p>Then you did not help at all to weigh out the candles to the stranger? - Not at all to the stranger.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any bargain made by the stranger and your master? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>How long had you lived with your master? - Eight or nine months, I cannot possitively say which.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know your master buy any spermaceti before? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was taken up only late on Thursday evening, and this being Saturday, is such a busy day with trades people that I could not get any body to appear for my character.</p>
               <p>Court. Let Norden and the girl go out of Court: I want to ask a question of Weaver.</p>
               <p>You say that the prisoner came to you last Monday about ten? - I thought it was Monday, but on a second thought I believe it was Tuesday.</p>
               <p>When was it then that you went and cut off a part of it? - On the same day in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Court to Soames. When was it that you met Weaver? - Monday or Tuesday I am sure.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140111"/>I Cannot you tell which? - It was Monday.</p>
         
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes; I am sure I went to the play on Tuesday to the best of my knowledge I think it was Monday, I, went to that Theatre on Tuesday and I am sure it was not Tuesday, I staid at home all the afternoon, and we drank tea remarkably soon, and went there remarkably soon.</p>
               <p>Weaver. It was ten o'clock on Monday or Tuesday, but I rather suppose it was Tuesday.</p>
               <p>(Norden called in.) What time of the day did you say this was? - It was in the morning about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court to the Maid. What time of the day was it that the stranger came in? - About nine in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court to Norden. Did you see how much money the prisoner gave this stranger? - I cannot tell rightly.</p>
               <p>How much was in? - Five or six shillings there was no gold; it was thrown down on the counter.</p>
               <p>What sort of a basket had he? - A square basket.</p>
               <p>What might in contain? - It would hold four or five dozen of candles at the least.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the first question is, whether this piece of spermaceti is properly identified, in order to prove that it is the same, two witnesses have been called, the prosecutor and his servant, and they tell you they can swear positively to the spermaceti; but it is incumbent they should give you such reasons that should induce you to believe they do not swear rashly; they are called upon to assign their reasons for swearing to it: and they are first generally, that the spermaceti lost was of the form and fashion; that is not sufficient of itself: the next circumstance is this, that all the spermaceti of one boiling has a particular cast and colour, and that they can safely swear to it, and that it is always distinguishable from any other boiling: the prosecutor says he can also distinguish it, and there are but three other spermaceti refiners and that they do not refine in round pans as does, but however it is possible they may the learned Council for the prisoner has very much insisted that it is not sufficiently identified, but you must observe that in trades and occupations there are certain things that induce men by habit, and otherwise, to distinguish one thing from another, when it is not in their power to produce the minute mark of discrimination; and I will tell you what I have found on the circuits, that a shepherd shall know the face of every sheep perhaps if there are a thousand and he can swear to every sheep though he cannot point out to you or me the reason why, If you think the witnesses are fully justified in swearing as they have done, from the colour of it, and comparing it by samples to be the same boiling, then the identity will proved to your satisfaction. The next matter for your consideration is this, you see this was in the custody and possession of the prosecutor on Friday last, or Monday I think or Tuesday it was found missing, on Monday it is in the possession of the prisoner, so that very little time clapses indeed from the time that it was lost to its being found in his possession; yet if the prisoner could by facts or circumstances give a reasonable account how he came by it; if this had been a commodity in which he used to deal, that would have been a sufficient reason; but the servant declares she never knew he dealt in it; and Weaver was so much a stranger in it he did not know the price; the prisoner has called two witnesses to prove that a person sold it him, if you believe them it is a good defence; but you must weigh their evidence and compare the circumstances and the testimony of the one witness to the other, and consider what degree of credit they have; the first witness tells you that two shillings and two-pence was asked and two shillings was given for it: What does this man do? He goes immediately, without complaining of any loss, and sells it for two and twenty pence; some money was paid, the rest was in candles; some candles<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140112"/> were weighed, and there must be one hundred and fifty pounds weight of candles, and these are put into a basket that will hold five or six dozen of candles; therefore you will consider what degree of credit this defence is entitled to; I examined the witness separate as to a great variety of minute circumstances, they did dister in some things but not so much I think as to impeach their credit by buy great variance: certain it is that when two witnesses relate a transaction that has passed even a few days before, they may, partly from the infirmity of human recollection, and partly from inattention at the time, very in small circumstances. Norden said the maid assisted, the maid says she did not; that might be a mistake in Norden, but the main leading features are, his selling this for twenty-two pence a pound, for which he gave two shillings; and the other is, his into this basket, which would only hold five and six dozen of candles, one hundred and fifty pounds weight of candles; if you think it is doubtful whether this is the same spermaceti, and that these witness have sworn truly, then in God's name you will acquit the prisoner: however there is no evidence of this being stolen in the dwelling house, therefore you will acquit him of that, whatever your opinion may be as to the other part of the charge.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner called six Witnesses who all gave him a good character, and his master offered to take him again directly if he was at liberty.</p>

               <p>Court. I think the Court ought not to interpose in this business, but leave you to take the usual remedy; and my reason is this, that the ground before the Court for the acquittal of the prisoner, is not the falsity but the incompetency of the witnesses; now we can never presume, that what a witness would say who is rejected for total incompetency, would not have put the prisoner upon his defence; if Boyce had been examined as a competent witness, and you could then have found a want of evidence, I should not have hesitated: but however, the Court is not limited as to the time when they may grant a copy of an indictment.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner came to my house and asked me to buy some goods, about six weeks ago, on a Monday morning; I asked her what goods, she said some goods she had put in pawn through distress; I asked her whether they were her own property, she said, yes; I asked her where they were, at what pawnbroker's; she said, in Drury-lane, and I went with her to the pawnbroker's, and we took them out of pawn; they were two pillows, five blankets, two tea-kettles, a patchwork counterpane, and rugg.</p>
               <p>Any sheets? - No; I bought these things of her; they were afterwards sold, all but the pillows. (The pillows produced.) I delivered them to the constable.</p>
               <p>Were those pillows that you delivered to the constable, the same that you bought of the prisoner? - I cannot positively say, to the best of my knowledge they were.</p>
               <p>Had you any other of the kind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to doubt of their being the same? - I have no reason to doubt it, but I cannot positively swear that they were the same, because there were a great many of the same kind in my house, and they were mixed one among another, they appeared like the same to me, to the best of my knowledge, they are the same.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I am a student, there was a question proposed by the prisoner, whether Mrs. Ward at the time she apprehended her, did not tell her, she would not hurt a hair of her head.</p>

               <p>I went to drink some beer and I missed the pot, I went to the tap-room, and asked if they had taken my beer away, they said, no, I recollected the prisoner came to my box when my back was towards her, she was examined, she had a pair of pockets that hung to her ancles, which I suppose would hold seven or eight pots each, and there was one pint pot in each of them and the quart pot was concealed under her.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 13th of December, I received information of a sack with some things gone into a house in Bell Lane; I ran down and called upon another officer, and went into the house, there were three sitting by the fire, in a back room, Norgate, Cadey, and one Pearce, I told them my business, and the prisoner Cadey told me there was no such thing, I looked about, and saw some lead lay in the floor, and Cadey said a man had just brought it in, and threw it down and run away, I asked Norgate and Pearce what they did there, and they said, they came to see Cadey, and they were weavers; I took hold of the hands of Pearce and Norgate, and they were all mortar, I said, you do not look like weavers, I have a notion you have stolen this lead; they said, they had been up in a pigeon trap at the top of a house, and that made their hands so dirty: we took them into custody; and on Monday before the Justice, Pearce turned evidence: I and another of our officers went up to the top of the house, where the lead was stolen from, and we brought a piece of lead away from the top of the house, to match with that which was stolen; it was taken off the gutter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott, Prisoner's Council. Whereabouts was this lead laying in Cadey's house? - In the back room on the ground.</p>
               <p>But that contained sundry other things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140121"/>Was this lead laying? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the hands of Cadey? I did not, I had no suspicion at that time that he had stolen it.</p>
               <p>- POWELL sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fleming came to Mr. Burner's, where I work, and desired somebody to go to the office to look at some lead which had been laid on the building.</p>
               <p>Who did the building belong to? - I should suppose to Fleming, he paid us, that was in the year 1782.</p>
               <p>Has Mr. Fleming any partners? - I know nothing at all about him; I went to the place where they said the lead was stolen from; this gutter was laid in two lengths; the upper length was gone, and the lower length remained, which corresponded, they had joined; it was cut strait down and not indented.</p>
               <p>Court. In laying the different lengths of a gutter, do not you lay the one over the other? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you nail them down at the joining? - Not at the bottom but against the rafters, on the sides where the lead turns up, and sometimes at the drip.</p>
               <p>You did not sit that piece to the place? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you clearly satisfied as a workman, that that lead was taken away from that place? - I have no reason to doubt it, yet at the same time I cannot swear it, there is a great deal of lead of that length; it was not a very usual length.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any body here belonging to the house it was taken from?</p>
               <p>Shakeshaft. My Lord, I went to Mr. Sykes, one of the executors, and he told me he had had a great deal of trouble with the houses, and would have no more.</p>
               <p>Powell. I believe they were uninhabited houses; I did not think to examine the nail house; I cannot swear with precision.</p>

               <p>I am an accomplice in this business, and have been admitted an evidence; Norgate and I was at the Duke's Head, in Winford Street, drinking a pint or two of beer, and agreed to go to Carey's house to got some chissels to go to this house: Carey had no chissels to lead us and Carey returned back with a bit of iron bar; then we went to the house, and got over a wall and went up two pair of stairs and broke through the ceiling; I went to the top of the house and got the lead off, we brought it down into the yard, and went to Carey's house and told him; then Carey took up a bag, and went with us and put it in, and carried it back to his own house.</p>
               <p>Court. Carey was not with you when you ripped it from the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Was any body with you but Norgate? - No, it was seven weeks last Saturday, about six or seven in the evening, about half an hour before we were found.</p>
               <p>Court to Shakeshaft. Did you perceive how they got up? - Yes, they broke through the cieling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. My Lord, I submit that the felony was compleat before Carey was employed, and therefore he is a receiver.</p>
               <p>Court. I am of the same opinion, because it is not laid generally, but as fixed to the dwelling house, and there is also no other circumstance against him except as a receiver, but the evidence of the accomplice.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner called five witnesses, who all gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Pearce. What were you to have for this lead? - I believe ten shillings and four-pence.</p>
               <p>Court to Powell. What was it worth? - It is worth at the rate of sixteen shillings a hundred.</p>
               <p>Court. Why then ten shillings and four-pence was as much as it was worth? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Silvester.</p>
               <p>Did you go on the 9th of January to the Globe Tavern in Hatton Garden? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who did you meet there? - I met a man.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>How soon did you meet the prisoner himself? - In a quarter of an hour? the man said he would step out and see if his friend was come; he stepped out and introduced the prisoner at the bar to me; the prisoner sat down by the side of me, and he says to his friend, is this your friend; then we began to discourse; says he now I can depend upon you, I said yes, then he pulled out a guinea to shew me, which is this; I praised it exceedingly, I turned it over and said I never saw so good a one in my life, I said it was so good I thought I could vend a great many of them; I asked him the price, he told me it should be thirteen shillings; says I twelve shillings and sixpence will do I suppose; why, says he, if you take a quantity and are likely to be a better customer, I will not stand; accordingly I had the guinea in my hand, and I kept it in my possession till he stept to the door to send for the rest; when he came in, he said have you any call for any whites; says I you may let me look at them; says I they are very good indeed, I think I can be a customer for some of them; says he they are nine and twenty for a guinea; he asked me if I wanted any half bulls, that is half-crowns, then a gentleman came in and interrupted our discourse; my friend said, says he, you will be late out of town, says I, damn it, we never mind, we travel all hours, only give us a bottle; he then said he could not get them that night, and just at that time Mr. Clarke came up, and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>The guinea and the shilling produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood Prisoner's Council. You never saw this prisoner before? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Was any body in company with you? - The man that introduced me.</p>
               <p>Where is he? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Is he a friend of the man's or of your's? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>But you know that person? - I know him by sight if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Do not you know him otherwise? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have not you seen him since? - Not to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Have not you seen him so as to speak if you chose it? - Not to have any connection with him.</p>

               <p>I am employed for the mint, and have been for many years; I had information of the prisoner; I got a captain of our patrol to act as a deception, not to be known, I desired him to act as a smuggler that he might not be known, and I gave him two twenty pounds notes, and desired him to go to the Globe Tavern, and when the money was brought he was to send one of the notes to be changed, and when that note was sent out to be changed I then know that the money was there; I received a message, that he was come they believed, and I took Gilbert in custody and searched him, and I found seventeen shillings and I think ten or twelve sixpences all counterfeits. (The guinea shewn him.) I suppose that is not worth above three-pence or a groat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Twelve shillings and six-pence is a pretty good price for it? - Yes, very good.</p>

               <p>I am a blacksmith; I know Mr. Wright's house; on the 26th of November, I was coming down Fleet Market, on the side leading to his house; I saw a man half way in the window, by the help of a sledge that lays under the window, he stood upon that and he was about half way in the window under the sash, I saw him draw himself out as I was coming down, I thought he was conversing with somebody, and he and another ran by me as hard as ever he could; I had no suspicion of any robbery; I think the man had a cast in his eye, I cannot say, as they went by me they had like to have thrown one another down.</p>
               <p>Court. Should you know him again? - I think I should, but I am not sure; he had then dark, or rather black clothes on.</p>
               <p>Court. Look around the Court and see if you see any body like him. - No, really to be upon my oath, another man may be of the same size.</p>
               <p>Court. The next witness is an accomplice, but here is no ground to identify this.</p>

               <p>COUNCIL FOR THE PROSECUTION,</p>
               <p>Mr. GARROW.</p>
               <p>COUNCIL FOR THE PRISONER,</p>
               <p>Mr. SYLVESTER and Mr. FIELDING.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, of Council for the Prosecution, opened the Case as follows:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury,</p>
               <p>You have collected from the appearance of the Gentleman at the bar, and the combination of ability and experience by which he is defended, that he is not one of those petty offenders whose minute offences occupy much of your time in this place. The delinquency of Mr. Aikles is of a much<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140126"/> greater extent, and wears a bolster aspect, You have learnt, Gentlemen, from the indictment, what is the nature of the charge imputed to the prisoner, but it will be necessary for the better understanding the subject of this enquiry, that I should state to you what the situation of Mr. Aikles has been, and what his connection with the prosecutor. Mr. Aikles is one of those virtuous and benevolent men, who have discovered the secret of acquiring large fortunes, and of supporting elegant houses and superb equipages by acts of the parent philanthropy, and the most disinterested and enlarged benevolence: in a word, he is one of those, who advertise to supply the necessities of young men, whose indiscretions have reduced them to want a temporary supply of money, for the laudable purpose of extricating them from the hands of others, who might impose on them to their ruin, and all this for the fair legal discount on their notes. In this character Mr. Aikles addressed himself to the prosecutor Mr. Edwards, who is a very young man, of some fortune, and who therefore appeared to Mr. Aikles to be a very fit subject for his friendship and protection. The prisoner waited on Mr. Edwards, and told him that if in the present great scarcity of money he should be under any embarrassment, he would relieve him; in consequence of this intimation from the prisoner, the transaction which forms the subject of this enquiry took place. Gentlemen, I shall now proceed to state the facts which I shall submit to you in evidence, which I shall do with some particularity, as it will be necessary for the Court to attend to them. and to determine on the law resulting from those facts. And, Gentlemen, I am very much relieved in stating to you my imperfect notions of the law of the case, by feeling that I do it in the hearing of Judges eminent for their learning and integrity, under whose correction it is impossible that I should lead you into error. Unless my instructions mislead me most grossly as to the facts, and unless my conception of the law is utterly unfounded, I expect with confidence that the learned judges will tell you, that there is a current of decisions, deriving its source at a very early period, and running down uninterruptedly to this day, that will warrant you in point of law to pronounce the prisoner guilty of the felony imputed to him.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in the latter end of the month of December last, about the last day but one of the year, Mr. Edwards, in consequence of the very friendly intimation which he had received from the prisoner, applied to him to discount him a note for one hundred pounds, which Mr. Aikles agreed to do, on being paid the very moderate compensation of two and a half per cent. in consequence of this agreement, Mr. Edwards a bill on his guardian Mr. Wells, payable to his own order; the bill was accepted by Mr. Wells, and indorsed by Mr. Edwards. Mr. Aikles went to Cornhill, and having satisfied himself that the acceptance was genuine, Mr. Edwards expected to be paid the value of his bill, and for that purpose delivered it to the prisoner; but to his surprise he found that Mr. Aikles was not in cash (an accident which very generally attends these sort of transactions) it was therefore necessary for him to go to his apartments in Pulteney Street to get the money, and he proposed that Mr. Edwards or his friend should go with him to receive it; to this proposal Mr. Edwards found himself under the necessity of submitting; but having by this time adopted a suspicion that his bill was in hands not the most secure, he had the precaution to give express directions to Mr. Croxall to go with the prisoner, and by no means to part with him or to lose sight of him till he received the money; Mr. Croxall having received these directions, went with the prisoner to his apartment; here Mr. Aikles told him,</p>
               <p>"I have not the money in the house, I must trouble you to wait ten minutes till I go and fetch it;" this was opposed by Mr. Croxall, who told him he expected the money, and did not chuse to part with him till he received it; the prisoner assured him on his honour, that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140127"/> would not detain him above a quarter of an hour, but on Croxall still resisting his leaving the house, Mr. Aikles assumed all the importance and affected the feelings of a man of fashion and nice honour, complained of being distrusted, and told Mr. Croxall that Mr. Edwards would not have treated him so unworthily: the prisoner left his house, and the witness, Mr. Croxall, having waited there till his patience was exhausted, went out in hopes of finding him, but without success; he met however with Mr. Edwards, who, impatient of so long a delay, was come to enquire for his money, they returned together to the house of the prisoner, where they continued three days and nights, during all which time Mr. Aikles never returned; many other persons indeed came to enquire for him by all the names which he used in his numerous transactions; but Mr. Edwards seeing no probability of recovering his note, or of receiving its value, applied to a magistrate, who very properly sent the prisoner here to abide the event of your investigation of his conduct.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, all that it will be necessary for me to adduce evidence before you to prove in support of this prosecution will be these short facts; first, that Mr. Edwards made the bill in question; that he delivered it to Mr. Aikles for the express purpose of discounting it, and returning him the cash by Mr. Croxall, and then the Court will tell you, that in point of law, if the prisoner afterwards embezzled the note so entrusted to him for his special purpose, or converted it to his own use, he is guilty of the felony, with the commission of which he is charged. You will expect, from the ingenuity of my learned friends who appear as Council for the prisoner, that every objection will be taken that the case will in any degree warrant; but unless I am grossly mistaken, the facts will come out in evidence as I have stated them to you; and I assure myself, that having heard those facts, if the directions of the Court shall warrant you to say, that under the law of the case the prisoner may be guilty of the crime imputed to him by the indictment, you will feel great pleasure that it has become your duty to diminish, by one at least, a nest of vermin, who have but too long infested this metropolis, to the utter ruin of some of the first families in the kingdom.</p>

            , Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, one of the Prisoner's Council. Do you mean to pay this note when it becomes due? - If I am obliged to pay it, not otherwise; if I can possibly avoid the paying it, I shall not think myself bound to pay it; I do not understand law, but if the law tells me I must pay it, I shall.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - When I am in town I lodge with Mr. Wells, on whom this note was drawn, who is my uncle, and was my guardian before I came of age.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Let the witnesses go out of Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What was the way you first became acquainted with the prisoner at the bar? - My first acquaintance with the prisoner at the bar was, he left his address about three weeks ago at my lodgings; his address was,</p>
               <p>"Mr. H. No. 21, Great Pultney-street, from six to seven in the evening, or from eleven till twelve in the morning."</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know him before? - Never; I enquired of the servant with whom he had left it, it was the most mysterious thing I ever met with at that time; in consequence of this address being left, I called the next morning before twelve, at No. 21, in Great Pultney-street, where I saw the prisoner at the bar, and as his face was perfectly strange to me, I asked him if he had left such an address at No. 11, in Cornhill, where I lodge, he said he had, and he supposed my name was Edwards; I said it was; he then said he had heard that I wanted a note discounted; which I was very much astonished at indeed; I could not conceive how he came to know it.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you in fact wanted a note discounted? - I had a few days before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140128"/>Had you sent any message to Mr. Aikles? - I had not; he said if at any time I wanted a note discounted, if it was drawn on a person of credit and responsibility, that he would discount it at any time, on the most eligible terms, which terms he then mentioned to me, which were two and a half per cent. agency, and the legal interest; in consequence of this, on the 30th of December last, I called at his house in the evening, and he was out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When was the first interview? - I suppose it was about a week before that time; on the 31st of December I sent one Mr. Croxall to know if he would discount me a note of one hundred pounds, mentioning the gentleman on whom it was drawn, and if he would do it, if it was convenient for him to come into the city, he might be convinced that it was good, by applying to Mr. Wells the acceptor; the prisoner came with Croxall, in consequence of the message I had sent by Croxall, on Wednesday the 31st; I begged Mr. Wells would step into the room; the prisoner was introduced to me by Mr. Croxall; I then asked him what he would discount my note for, provided he approved of it; he said for twenty-five shillings, which he had reckoned was two and a half per cent. for his agency, it was for two months, and five per cent. legal interest; I referred him to Mr. Wells, to know if it was his acceptance, he said it was, and immediately Mr. Wells left the room; the prisoner then said if I would go up with him to the west end of the town, to Pulteney-street, he would give me the cash; I said that Mr. Croxall would accompany him, and pay him twenty-five shillings on his receiving the one hundred pounds; I had delivered the note to Mr. Aikles on his applying to Mr. Wells to know whether it was a good one; Mr. Croxall left me to go with the prisoner, and as he went out, I whispered him that he would not leave the prisoner without the money, and that he would not lose sight of him.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Croxall return with the money? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You expected him of course? - I was to go to prevent Croxall coming; I was to meet him and receive the money; I went to Pulteney-street, in my way I met Croxall; I afterwards returned to the house of the prisoner, he had been gone out about five minutes, and I waited there for three days and three nights, and the prisoner never returned; I am confident of it for three days.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Whilst you was there the prisoner never returned? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the hand writing of Mr. Aickles? - Yes, I have it now in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you ever whilst you was at his house receive any letter from Mr. Aikles, that you know to be his hand writing?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I object to that; did you ever see him write?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then I will repeat the question; did you ever receive any letter from him that you believe to be his hand writing? - I can only tell by comparison.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you believe it to be his hand writing? - I have reason to believe to the contrary, that it was not his hand writing, that he sent to me by way of letter; I saw him afterwards on the Saturday when I went with the constable to apprehend him, he was at the house of a lady, where he had dined, in Margaret-street.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass between you and the prisoner concerning this note when you apprehended him? - Yes, he said he was very sorry, he made many apologies, and said he would fetch me the note.</p>
               <p>I believe you did not trust him to fetch the note? - No, but I went by his particular desire to Norfolk street, I cannot tell the house; nothing material passed, only that he wished to send for some person; I thought he should go before a justice; he said when I went to the house in Norfolk-street, I should receive my note; it was made payable to my order, indorsed by me; I saw it yesterday; I saw it two days ago in the possession of Smith and Turner; I have subpoened them, they said they should keep it till the matter was settled.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140129"/>Mr. Fielding, another of the Prisoner's Council. Are they here? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is found in the hands of those to whom it has been either delivered by negociation or otherwise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. The Gentleman has seen it in the custody of men free from all suspicion, Smith and Turner live opposite the Pantheon in Oxford-road.</p>
               <p>Edwards. I have demanded my note on Saturday several times, and it has not been delivered to me; he offered it to me on Saturday se'nnight, when I took him, if I would give him twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he know where it was? - Yes, last Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester to Mr. Edwards. This note was a note drawn by you on your uncle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What you call an accommodation note? - It was not.</p>
               <p>There was money due between you? - There was, and is now.</p>
               <p>Was this note ever in the possession of Croxall? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did not you apply to him by advertisement? - No.</p>
               <p>Now on the 30th of December you applied to him to get a note discounted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was to have agency for his trouble, and the usual discount of five per cent.? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If the money had been brought you would have been satisfied? - I should have been well satisfied.</p>
               <p>So much so that you thought it was only a fraud at first, till somebody put it into your head it was a felony? - I beg your pardon, I should have been guilty of a rash act if I had met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>You advertised it as a note that was lost? Yes.</p>
               <p>What was he committed for? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>I will read you the commitment, (reads)</p>
               <p>"Committed on suspicion of having committed divers frauds, and being a common cheat." - That I know nothing of.</p>
               <p>You do not know that? - Indeed I do not.</p>
               <p>Why, was you not examined before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Ever heard, why how long was that before he was committed; what was he committed for? - These are things I cannot answer; I can only say I brought him before Sir Sampson Wright, and he was committed. I offered five guineas reward, and the payment was stopped.</p>
               <p>You did not suppose then that it was a felony, because that would have been compounding felony you know? - I considered that he he had run away w ith my note, but whether that was compounding felony or no I do not know.</p>
               <p>Had Mr. Aikles then, when he came to your house to enquire about the goodness of the note, had he the note delivered to him by you? - He had.</p>
               <p>Then having the note in his hand, and the full possession of the note, he asked your uncle whether it was his acceptance? - He did.</p>
               <p>How came you to whisper Coxall? - I generally speak openly; I speak openly now; I did it out of delicacy.</p>
               <p>You have had a little conversation about this note? - I have had a great deal.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Aikles offer to settle the matter? - He said he had settled it on my first seeing him, on the Saturday evening; when I had him at Bow-street, he then sent a man to me.</p>
               <p>Upon your bath, did not you intrust him with this note for the purpose of getting the money? - Expecting the money immediately back again certainly, I could have no other purpose.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I think you told me that the purpose for which you gave this note to Mr. Aikles was to discount it? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Was it to discount it, or to get it discounted? - To discount it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140130"/>Mr. Garrow. Did you or not understand that he was the monied man that was to discount it? - He told me himself that he belonged to the bank, and that he would immediately give the money on the arrival of Mr. Croxall at his house; he described himself to belong to the bank; he said, that he was to have two and a half per cent. agency for the business, and I conceived him to belong to the bank, he told me, he would give me the money at his own house.</p>

               <p>Did Mr. Aikles explain to you the purpose of his application? - I do not think he did the least in the world, I am sure he did not; he had the note in his hand at my house; Mr. Edwards was present in my parlour, and he asked me if that was my acceptance; I told him it was; I left the room, and left Mr. Edwards, and the prisoner, and Croxall, to transact the business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. When he asked you the question he had the note in his possession? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the prosecutor was satisfied with that? - He seemed to be very well satisfied.</p>
               <p>Court. What age is the prosecutor? - Twenty-seven.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You are acquainted with Mr. Edwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect at any time seeing the prisoner with Mr. Edwards? - Yes, on the 31st of December.</p>
               <p>Where did you see them? - At Mr. Wells's, No. 11, Cornhill; I was with Mr. Edwards when the prisoner came; he said he came there with intent to discount a note of one hundred pounds for Mr. Edwards; I had previously made application to the prisoner in the morning when I called at his lodgings; I applied to the prisoner by desire of Mr. Edwards; it was on the 31st of December, at his lodgings, No. 21, Great Pulteney-street, where I saw him.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you apply to him for? - I told him I came from Mr. Edwards; Mr. Edwards wished to know when he would let him have one hundred pounds at two months.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you go to him to ask if he would let Mr. Edwards have one hundred pounds for his note? - Yes, I told the prisoner I was come from Mr. Edwards, and he would be glad to know what time he would let him have the money that they were talking about for a note; the prisoner said, when I saw Mr. Edwards last, I told him, that if he would let me have his note for half an hour I would get him the money, and he likewise said, that if he would come or send any person with the note, they might wait in the parlour while he fetched the money; I then asked the prisoner what time would be most agreeable to meet Mr. Edwards, he told me twelve o'clock in Cornhill, No. 11, I returned to Cornhill, and was in the room when the prisoner entered; Mr. Edwards then produced the note to the prisoner, and asked him what he was to give for the discounting it; the prisoner said, seven and a half per cent. which was five and twenty shillings, two and a half above the common interest; Mr. Edwards said it was a great deal of money, could not he abate any thing of it; he said, no, not for so trifling a sum as one hundred pounds; after that Mr. Wells came into the room; the prisoner went up to Mr. Wells and said, pray Sir is this your acceptance? Mr. Wells said, yes, it was his acceptance, then the prisoner turned round to Mr. Edwards and me and said, now gentlemen, if you are ready, we will go to my house, or my apartments, and we will get you the money; I said to Mr. Edwards, Sir, you had better go along with us, he said, no, Mr. Croxall, you go along with the gentleman, and I will be there by half an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140131"/> hour after one o'clock; I said, I wish you would be there about one o'clock because I have other business; he said he would; I went with the prisoner immediately, he called a coach to his lodgings, in Great Pulteney-street, No. 21.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, What was the purpose of your going with the prisoner? - To receive the money; in going along, the prisoner told me he had discounted many notes for gentlemen, and had found money for several to a great amount; I said to him, pray Sir, how far have you got to go for this money from the house where you lodge, he said about three streets off; when we came into the prisoner's parlour he asked me to sit down, and he went backwards; he came in directly and said, pray Mr. Croxall be seated; I shall be back in a quarter of an hour; I will laid you the paper to read: I was not satisfy with his going out; I was determined to keep sight of him, and watch his going in and coming out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you object to his going out? - I hesitated rather about it, but he told me, that Mr. Edwards was either to come there or send somebody to stay in the parlour while he went for the money; in turning the corner of Great Pulteney-street, going into Brewer-street, I lost sight of him in a moment; I walked backwards and forwards and Mr. Edwards came up; I afterwards returned to the prisoner's house; I did not find him there; I continued there sometime; I went away; and left Mr. Edwards; while I went away, and when I returned, I found him there, and I staid till half after nine; the prisoner did not return back; I found Mr. Edwards in the parlour where I left him; I was there the next morning before eight o'clock and continued till Mr. Edwards came to me; we breakfasted in the house the next morning; we continued there the whole of the next day; I went out, and Mr. Edwards was there while I went out, the prisoner did not return; I did not continue there long the third day, but I watched for him at a publick house; I did not see him go to his house.</p>
               <p>Did he at any time pay you the money, or any part of it for this one hundred pounds note? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Nor deliver you the note back? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he was apprehended? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. You went to receive the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was to return in a quarter of an hour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never had the note in your possession? - No.</p>
               <p>You only went for the money? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you watch during the night time? - No.</p>
               <p>Whether he came home at night you do not know of your knowledge? - No.</p>
               <p>It was understood by all of you, that he was to return in a quarter of an hour? - Yes.</p>

             called again but did not appear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, it is proved, that these people have been subpoened, and have been again sent to by order of the Court, and do not appear, therefore I submit to your Lordship whether I may not give parol evidence of this note, it being found as every other note is, which is the subject of a prosecution for felony, in some other hands; it is no longer in the hands or power of the prosecutor, therefore submit it is competent to the prosecutor to shew where he saw it last; if notes are lost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140132"/> that are put into the post, and are never found again, there must of necessity be parol evidence given of them or no evidence at all, since, like the present, they are not in the power of the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I submit to your Lordship, that these men ought to come forward; it is proved that this note is in existence, and ought to have been brought here; and it therefore furnishes that leading idea in every case, that the note ought to be produced which is in existence, and is the best degree of evidence; if the note was lost, then indeed it would be a question with the Court, whether you would receive parol evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I take it there is not a clearer principle in law that you cannot give parol evidence of a note that does exist: it was the duty of the prosecutor to apply to the Court, and to see before the Court was called on, whether his witnesses did or did not attend. No application was made till about the middle of the trial, when it is found out that they cannot proceed without the evidence of these people, then an order of Court is applied for; I believe it would be very unprecedented to give evidence of any part of this note, unless the note was here present to be produced to your Lordship, and I am sure your Lordship will not go out of the common road of evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. They might have got the note here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. I do not think it is so universal a principle of law as to have no exception, for where prisoners are indicted for stealing a note, it is not necessary to shew that that note is in existence, or to account for its coming into the hands of the prisoner, in such a case there could have been at doubt at all, but parol evidence could have been given, and the note being in the hands of this Smith and Turner in a state of negotiation; makes no difference; I think they stand in the place of the prisoner, their possession is precisely the possession of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. If it had gone the length that the prisoner had negotiated it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. I shall certainly save the point for the opinion of the Justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. In this case the prisoner was intrusted with this note to get it discounted.</p>
               <p>Court. No not to get it discounted, but to discount it; you assume that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, I contend the prisoner had the free power of this note, the dominion, the possession, to part with to any body whatever that he pleased; If I send my clerk to a banker's with a note, if he goes off with the note it is felony, but if he goes to the banker's and gets the money it is a breach of trust; where there is only a custody of the thing itself, and no power or dominion over it; disposing of it is illegal and felonious; but where there is a power of disposing of it, it is not; here I can see a clear fraud; give me your note and I will get it discounted; this is a common fraud, a common trick, it is too common, but nobody I believe had an idea at this time that it was a felony: my Lord, I do not know where to draw the line; I should be glad to know where the felony begins, because the possession of it is no felony; he is intrusted with it; there is no felony in carrying it home; and he passes it to a person to get it discounted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. You mistake the fact and then you argue upon it; you argue upon wrong facts: Mr. Edwards and Croxall both say, that this man was to discount this note for a price, for Croxall says, that Edwards produced the note to the prisoner and asked him what he was to give him for discounting it, and he said two and a half, and the prisoner said, if Mr. Edwards sent any body to his lodgings they might wait in his parlour till he sent for the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My lord, upon these facts I beg leave to follow my learned friend in this idea as a matter of law growing out of the fact; as to the definition of a larceny, I understand from Lord Coke and others, that the taking must be from the possession of a man, and not of the property when removed from the possession; if possession be obtained by the person without<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140133"/> the ingredients of felony, it then becomes such a subject as cannot support the allegation of larceny; here there is, in my conception, a clear possession, and such a possession as removes the property clearly out of the hands of Edwards, if so then upon that subject, clearly cannot be built the definition of larceny.</p>
               <p>Court. I conceive there is some difference as to the change of property, if this man had kept the note, would it have been a felony in him to have kept possession of the note, certainly not; then he alters this thing and he changes it into money; Edwards expects the money; he does not get the money; he never expects to have the note back again; the matter strikes me as not to be rendered a bit more plain by any thing that can be said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I should leave this case with the utmost pleasure to the Court, but that all arguments of this sort are addressed to the Jury, and are intended to have their operation there, it therefore becomes my duty to trouble your Lordship with a very few words by way of reply. My Lord, I am not at all disposed to controvert the position of my learned friend, Mr. Fielding, as to the definition of larceny, I am ready to admit that there must be a felonious taking from the possession of the proprietor, and on that ground I am perfectly contented to argue this case, for I am warranted by a long uninterrupted series of decisions to say, that this, to the hour of the conversion, was the possession not of the prisoner but of Mr. Edwards. The case which we are now arguing, is precisely like the case of a man who goes to Smithfield Market and cheapens a horse, the owner delivers him the horse for the purpose of trying his paces, and the stranger rides away with the horse; if I was to address myself to the common understanding of any man who hears me, and was to ask in whom the possession in the horse resided, he would answer, that the actual possession of the owner was determined by his delivery to the stranger; but the law has said, that this possession having been acquired with a felonious intent, shall not alter the possession in contemplation of law, but that such a taking is a felony. What was the case of Sharpless at this place about nine years ago? It was the fashionable trick of that day (for every period has its fashions in artifice) to go to a goldsmith's and to order a quantity of his goods to be sent home; and it was the caution of the day for the goldsmith to direct his servant not to leave the goods without the money, but on some pretence Sharpless sent back the servant and kept the goods, and the Judges held that this was felony, though it would be difficult to prove that the goldsmith had any actual possession of his goods after they were delivered by his servant to the stranger. This case seems to me to be perfectly in point, but the same principle is, if possible, more strongly recognized in two cases, decided very recently; first, in the case of the ring dropper, where a man drops a ring or purse, and on pretence of dividing its produce with some bystander; he delivers the thing found, and takes as a security for his proportion a watch or a cloak, which he converts to his own use; here your Lordship sees there is something given for the thing stolen; your Lordships have repeatedly held that this is felony, and yet no man will say, that after the watch or cloak are delivered they remain any longer in the actual possession of the owner. I have had the honour of stating to your Lordships one case of horse-stealing, there is another, which has received a solemn determination of all the Judges of England within a very short time, which is conclusive of this case. A man hires a horse on pretence of taking a journey into Essex, in point of fact, he never takes such a journey but sells the horse; this has been determined to be felony: but, my Lords, I feel that I have troubled your Lordships with more cases than it was necessary to have cited in support of a position so clear, I shall therefore conclude with stating one very recently determined, and which, if it stood alone, might serve as an answer to the objection of my friend Mr. Fielding.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140134"/> A man goes to a publick house and orders a pot of beer and change for a guinea to be sent to the house of Mr. Stiles, and when it is brought, he sends the servant back on some pretence, takes the change and goes off; permit me to ask whether the publican who remained in the bar of his house, had any more control over, or possession of his money, than any man who hears me; and yet your Lordships have held, and held with great wisdom, that this taking is a felony: but Mr. Silvester asks, When did the felony commence? I answer precisely at the same period of time, at which it commenced in the cases which I have had the honor of submitting to the Court; in the case of the horse-stealer, it commenced at the instant in which he put his foot into the stirrup with an intent to steal the horse; so here the felony commenced at the instant in which the prisoner got the note into his hands, with a felonious intent to convert it to his own use. If your Lordships feel yourselves mature by the decision of to-night to batter down the authority of all these cases established on mature consideration by the wisdom of your predecessors, and so often fortified and confirmed by the concurrent wisdom of your Lordships: if you are, prepared to say that the strong principle which so uniformly runs through all these cases is no law then your Lordship must direct the Jury to acquit the prisoner: but if your Lordships feel yourselves bound to act in unison with these determinations, it seems to me that your Lordship has no alternative but to direct the Jury to find the prisoner guilty.</p>
               <p>Court. If by any fraudulent means or contrivance, the party gets the possession of goods into his hands with intention to steal them, and undoubtedly the party whose property they are never meant to part with them in that way, therefore it becomes a felony; I shall therefore sum up to the Jury, and I shall afterwards take the opinion of the Judges upon it.</p>
               <p>The learned Judge then summed up the evidence to the Jury as before recited, and added as follows.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, first as to the law respecting this case, I must tell you that as at present advised, my idea of the law is this that under the authority of the cases which have been so ably cited by the learned council for the prosecution, if the prisoner got this note into his possession with a preconcerted design to steal it, that is a felony, though in fact it was delivered to him, especially if you should be of opinion that it never was the intention of Edwards to part with the possession, but that be or Croxall should be present till the money was actually paid; the possession of the thing in law does not mean the bodily apprehension of the thing, the holding it and taking it: if it was given to him with the special purpose of his discounting it, and that Croxall was sent with the prisoner as an agent of the prosecutor, and that the other ran away with this note in order to defraud him; why then it will amount to a felony, and what is the evidence that he did so? why you will find from Edwards's evidence, that he undertook to give him cash, and then Edwards said Croxall should accompany him and pay the twenty-five shillings; so that you see the first proposal on behalf of the prisoner was, that Croxall should go with him and he would give him the cash, which is contrary to the defence, which is, that Edwards intrusted him with this note to get it discounted, for he was to discount it himself for a stipulated sum, and Croxall tells you, that the prisoner said, when he saw the prosecutor, if he would let him have the note for half an hour he would give him the money; then Croxall is sent with the prison er, and the proposal was, that he is not to go out of his house, but he was to be in the parlour till he sent for the money; therefore it was the idea of Edwards and Croxall, and the prisoner's proposal, that this note should never be out of his possession, and his going away with it, and staying away from his lodgings three days and three nights is a very considerable circumstance; then when they went to the house in Norfolk-street, there were several shuffling excuses; the question<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140135"/> therefore is, whether you think it was ever the intention of the prosecutor to let this note be out of his possession till he got the one hundred pounds; if you think it was not, you will find the prisoner guilty, otherwise you will acquit him.</p>

Sometime after this, this note was put in suit against Wells by Sharp, but it was nonprossed, and he gave him another note, and it was agreed that the balance of sixteen pounds ten shillings should remain in his hands as a counter-security; Mr. George, however, by the advice of I do not know who, whether by the advice of Mr. James, or somebody else, thought proper to bring an action against Mr. Wells for this very sixteen pounds odd; when that cause came to be tried, says Wells, I am not indebted to you in that money, my note is outstanding; that in point of law was looked upon to be no defence; then the question was, whether this had not been agreed by the parties to remain as a security, and, that it was the meaning of the parties was certain, because George having become insolvent, he had omitted this sixteen pounds in the account of his debts, because he knew it was to remain as an indemnity for the note which Wells had given.

               <p>Gentlemen, this is a justice due to the country for you to try and determine on the offence of Mr. James. I need not tell you that the crime of perjury is a very foul and horrid crime, and deserves the most exemplary punishment. If the facts are not proved clearly, I am sure you will rejoice with me, that Mr. James should be acquitted. I am sure I only wish, and the prosecutors only wish to have the matter come fairly before you; if the witnesses prove the fact charged against the defendant, you are bound to find him guilty, and he must abide by the consequences; one thing is admitted by the learned Council who conducts his defence, the record of the proceedings is not here, but it is admitted that there was such a cause, and that the cause was tried before Lord Mansfield. Gentlemen, I shall call the witnesses, and prove the facts, without taking up any more of your time.</p>

               <p>Whether who was? - Mr. George; and whether he had not made a composition with his creditors, and Mr. James said no, he was not, but had paid every body twenty shillings in the pound, or at least Mr. Dublois had paid it for him; the Council then asked Mr. James how he knew that, and he said he had been concerned in the business all through.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Old Lady, you seem to have a pretty accurate memory as to what the Council said to Mr. James, do you remember the manner in which my Lord<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140140"/> Mansfield treated the cause? - I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>You do not remember that? - No.</p>
               <p>You do not remember my Lord Mansfield's saying, pho! pho! there is no defence at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not my Lord Mansfield of opinion that there was not a shadow of defence? - I do not remember.</p>
               <p>Do you remember that it was not at all necessary for Mr. James to go half through the evidences? - I know we were not called any of us.</p>
               <p>And the verdict went against you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Now you affect to recollect very well the question of the Council and the answer of Mr. James? - That is all I remember.</p>
               <p>How often now have you rehearsed this question and answer? - Not very often, because I have something else to do than to think about it.</p>
               <p>Where was it first talked over? - Sometimes I forget things, and sometimes I can remember them.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Mr. James produced and sworn as a witness? - Yes, Sir, they asked him if he was a lawyer, he said no, a lawyer's-clerk, and then he was produced as a with ness.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>Mr. Fielding, Defendant's Council.

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Was he examining then upon oath? - I saw him sworn, but whether he was sworn then or not I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. The words assigned as perjury are,</p>

               <p>Has any composition been made? - There was a composition of eight shillings in the pound, which I paid amongst the principal part of his creditors, but I do not know that any of them were paid their whole debts except one man who arrested him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. In the account did Mr. George include the sixteen pounds due to him from Wells? - I never saw his name in my list.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Have you got the assignment here? - I have not, it is with Mr.

               <p>Court. Was Mr. James privy to this settlement? - He attended several times to get the assignment, and afterwards he attended with me for Mr. Barnard.</p>
               <p>Did he know there was a composition of eight shillings in the pound, or any other composition made with George's creditors? - Mr. James came with George to me, and George told me how his affairs were, that he wished to make an assignment of his effects; James came along with him then.</p>
               <p>Court. Did George say any thing in the presence or hearing of James about making a composition; for an assignment and a composition are two very different things; an assignment of effects may produce twenty shillings in the pound, a composition is an agreement for debts: does it therefore appear from any fact that Mr. James knew that George had made a composition with his creditors, do you know whether Mr. James knew of a composition of eight shillings in the pound? - I have every reason to believe that Mr. James was privy to the composition, because he attended with Mr. George for that purpose.</p>
               <p>For what purpose? - For making the assignment.</p>
               <p>Aye, that is the thing I mention? - The composition was mentioned in the assignment.</p>
               <p>Court. We must see the assignment, you say George paid one creditor twenty shillings in the pound? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. James know it?</p>
               <p>Mr. James. I was concerned in it? - I cannot tell, I only suppose he did by being Mr. George's attorney.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. George looked upon this not to be a debt due to him, and therefore he had no right to say it, there was a note of Wells's to George of twenty pounds, which he had been defrauded of, that was not standing against Wells; George agrees this sixteen pounds, which Wells owed him, should remain in his hands.</p>

               <p>I only wish to inform the Court how the cause stood, this was an action brought by George against Wells, to recover a sum of money due to him for a debt in trade, sometime before this George had applied to Wells, telling him he could get cash on his note, he had indulged him with a note of his, though I believe the debt was not then due; George put this note into the hands of some Jews, he never could get any thing for his note, which Wells had given him; the note got amongst many others into the hands of Sharp, an action was brought against Wells by Sharp, Mr. George took up the defence and said he would defend that suit; this man in defending this action expended about the sum of ninety pounds; Sharp did not succed in his causes, of course Sharp got non-prossed; the note is now in the hands of Mr. Welch, attorney, concerned for Sharp; now George says to Wells, it is time you should pay me your debt; you never will be called upon; Sharp has ran away; I have expended ninety pounds in defending it: now whether George had made a composition or not, it had nothing at all to do with it; this was rather a conversation that passed between Sharp and James, who foolishly enough entered into conversation on the subject.</p>

               <p>Court. I will tell you on each side, how far I conceive it is material in trials of this kind, the ground on which I conceive it to be material and necessary, that the point on which the perjury is assigned, should be material to the point in issue in the cause; for it goes to the question of the perjury being wilful and corrupt, for it is not to be presumed that a man would incur the guilt and penalties of perjury for that which could have no benefit, and for which he could have no motive: it should be in some degree more or less material to the point in question, if I am right in that view of considering it, it is not necessary that the fact given in evidence should be really and truly material to the question, but such a fact as might appear to the witness to be material to the question at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Here they have laid it as an averment, that this is material to that point, therefore the materiality is a fact necessary to be established: the indictment says, it became a material question, whether the said George was ever insolvent or ever made any composition with his creditors, or whether the said creditors had ever been paid their full debts.</p>
               <p>Court. They must support that part, supposing it is considered in this point of view, whether it may not be considered as material to the defence meant to be set up; that he had got a consent and permission to retain that debt as an indemnity for him, against that outstanding note; that was the general short nature of the defence intended to be set up; then was it not material to shew that he was in insolvent circumstances, and that therefore the defendant could have no other indemnity that would be satisfactory to him.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Sylvester. We have at present no evidence of the defence that was opened on the question that was tried, all that is admitted is, that a cause was tried between George and Wells.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. We will now call

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Gentlemen of the Jury, I am to solicit your attention to the case of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140144"/> the defendant, Mr. James, who now stands before you, and I trust you will give me credit when I assert, that if I stood up as the advocate for a man who I thought had been guilty of perjury, I should feel myself extremely awkward, and extremely embarrassed in offering any sort of apology for that crime; but I do promise you, that I feel myself in a very different situation here, I feel myself addressing you on the part of a man who has been extremely improperly indeed brought before you, under the weight of an accusation which reflects as little credit on Mr. Wells as a matter can well do. The parties who were concerned at first, Mr. Wells and Mr. George, they had some transactions together, and Mr. Wells was indebted to Mr. George in a sum of money, and George desired Wells to give him a note which he would get discounted if possible; he parted with it, and he could get no money for it, therefore the note was outstanding; in this situation he applies to Wells, tells him the manner in which this note had been got possession of, and concludes he will hear of it; but says he, do not pay it; I will take upon myself all the expence that shall be incurred, therefore, I will now give you this indemnity against all the eventual expence of that business; he gives him therefore two notes, one of sixteen pounds, to remain in his custody as an indemnification: the note is afterwards put in suit by a Mr. Sharp; the action is defended; Mr. George himself is at the expence of all this; Sharp absconds, a non pross is signed, and there is an end of that action; Mr. Wells during this time had not been a shilling out of pocket, not a sixpence, and therefore the notes ought to have been returned; but after this there was a bill due, for the first note that Wells had given to George being good for nothing, that could not be taken as a payment for the goods; Wells stood indebted to George, therefore George says to him, deliver up my note and pay me; he held him at arms length, which obliged George to bring an action; upon this action Wells pleads a sett-off, and gives in evidence these two notes, given to him merely to answer the purpose of indemnification; but it so happened, that at the very time Mr. George gave these two notes to Wells for an indemnification, Wells gave him a memorandum, and that memorandum we are in possession of; so that the question of composition, of solvency, or insolvency, were perfectly immaterial in that question; and being defeated in this, corrupt as it was in Wells, to think of setting of any thing like these notes, you are not at all surprized at this matter being followed up with all the animosity and vindictiveness that could possibly be ingrafted on such a cause; Mr. James had some solicitude about his client, he had no motive, he had no interest, he merely stood up by way of conversation between him and Mr. Bower; Mr. Bower asserted, that he had made a composition, although that was perfectly immaterial to the business, but Council very frequently state things which are perfectly immaterial; Mr. Bower says, did not he make a composition? No, says he, or if he did, Mr. Dublois made it for him; the very answer goes to this, that he could not say there was no composition, because he acknowledged there had been one, for that Mr. Dublois had made one; Dublois knew nothing of James, therefore, if George had intrusted Mr. James to settle for him to a certain amount, Mr. James might very well say that in Court; Lord Mansfield would not hear James; but the conversation between Mr. James and Mr. Bower was perfectly immaterial: now they have averred that this was a material matter before the Court, and they have not proved it. As for Mr.

               <p>Court. I am sure if you was concerned in it, Mr. Wells, there was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, being of opinion, that in point of law it is material for the prosecutor of this indictment to prove this that was alledged in the indictment, which is, that the facts that were the subject of this indictment were material to the cause upon the trial on which this perjury was supposed to be committed; but the prosecutor, upon whom it is incumbent, not being able to prove in a distinct or clear manner what the question in that cause so tried really was, I am of opinion, that in point of law, they fail in proof of material allegation, which it is necessary for them to prove; therefore I shall abstain from giving any opinion whatever on the merits of the case.</p>

The Judges have considered of your case, and upon these facts they are unanimously of opinion, that <rs id="o17840114-1-verdict439" type="verdictDescription">
