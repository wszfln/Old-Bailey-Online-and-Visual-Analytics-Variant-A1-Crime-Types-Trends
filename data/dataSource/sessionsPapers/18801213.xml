I thought the cheque was all right, or I should not have had anything to do with it; that is what women do for you; I wish I had never seen her.

I am assistant to Mr. Cogswell, of 275, Camber well Road, furniture dealer and pawnbroker—on Friday, 12th November, Henry Simmons called and said, "Do you buy furniture?"—I said, "Yes, what have you to sell?"—he said, "An iron bedstead, mattress, and pillows;" he said he would bring them, that they were</p>

               <p>in Queen's Road, Peckham; he said they were his aunt's, that she had furnished a house and was unsuccessful in letting it, and wanted to dispose of some of the furniture—on Saturday, between 12 and 1, he came with the bedstead, mattress, and palliasse, and I bought them for 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; they were quite new, and had never been used; Mr. Sanford has since seen and identified them—when the goods were delivered I said to Henry, "I shan't pay you, I shall pay your aunt," and about 3 that afternoon an elderly female came, and I gave her the 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and she signed this receipt—Henry said if I gave him a good price for these things he would bring some more, in a day or two he would hare a carpet.</p>

On Monday morning, 15th November, I received the prisoners in custody at Lambeth Police-court on a charge of fraudulently obtaining goods from Messrs. Patterson—I told them that as the offence was committed in the City they would have to go with me to the Mansion House—Frederick said, "It is a shame to detain me in custody, as I have not been seen in the transaction at all"—Henry said, "I have used no false pretence; I shall be able to prove it is a debt."</p>

I live at 172, King's Road, Chelsea—my husband Henry Elder keeps a herbalist's shop; he is paralysed—on 19th November the prisoner and another man came to me; the other man said "I am Mr. Twells, and this man (<hi rend="italic">referring to the prisoner</hi>) is Police Sergeant Von Tornow," and that the medicine I had supplied for a young woman was not any good, and that she was ill—I said "If she is ill I have a medical man here; where does she live?"—he said "That is my business," and if I would give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would settle the matter—I said "I have not got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the prisoner then said "This is not the place to do business, I will go inside"—they then both came into a room at the back of the shop—the prisoner said he was Sergeant Von Tornow; he had a warrant to take me, and unless I would present him with some money he should take me at once—I said "On what grounds"—he said "For supplying medicine and doing no good"—he asked for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first—I eventually gave two half-sovereigns to the man representing Twells—the following day the prisoner called a little before 5 o'clock; I said "Walk inside," and I left him with Mr. Welby, my husband's assistant—after the prisoner had gone the assistant showed me this receipt marked "A"—on the following Monday the prisoner and the man called about 5.40—the man said in the presence of the prisoner "Are you going to satisfy this gentleman?"—I said "What would satisfy him?"—he said "He will want 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "He cannot have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have not got it"—he said "You must give him what you have got"—I gave him a sovereign; I had not any more—on Tuesday, the 23rd, the prisoner came by himself, about 5.30—he said "Could I speak to you?"—I said "No, you cannot, I am now engaged with my husband"—on the 22nd I had seen the other man give Welby the receipt marked "C"—he signed it at my table.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on Mr. Elder's business in consequence of the state of his health—on Saturday, 13th November, I was in the shop; I saw the prisoner with another man, who said his sister had had some medicine which had made her ill, and that the police constable had the matter in hand, but if I could make it up with him</p>

               <p>nothing more would be said about it—I and the prisoner then left the room, leaving the other man and Mr. Elder together—in a few minutes we came back—the man whose name I afterwards heard was Twells asked Mrs. Elder for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make up the matter—she said she would give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that night, and promised to give him the rest the following Monday—she also gave the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then wrote the guarantee marked "C"—on Saturday, the 20th, the prisoner called with a woman, and gave me the paper marked "A" (<hi rend="italic">another receipt</hi>)—I took it down to Mrs. Elder—he signed it "Sergeant Von Turnow" in my presence.</p>

I can bring the bottle, and might be able to bring a few more persons. It would be rather a long case no doubt.

               <p>Road—I formerly kept the Lord Nelson beerhouse, West India Dock Road, for about two years—I gave up possession on 2nd November—on Monday night, 8th November, I went with my brother to the Cambridge Music Hall—we left there, I believe, after 11 o'clock, and went to the Commercial Tavern, Commercial Street, about 11.16 p.m.—we were perfectly sober—we went right through the bar into the private lobby; there were two strangers there—we had some whisky, and as we were about to leave, two women were sitting in the public bar; one of them asked me to treat her; I ordered some drink, and she took it; the other refused—I pulled out 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and put down 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for the drink, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and put the other money back in my pocket—there were a lot of people there; I could not say who they were—I bade the woman good night, and as soon as I had placed the money in my pocket I received a terrific blow on the right side of my head with a short, thick stick; it like stunned me; it went through my hat, and my hat fell on the floor—Barrett was the man that struck me—I did not fall, I merely staggered; the blood ran down my neck—I stooped down to pick up my hat, and I received another blow at the top of my head, which sent me on my knees—I could not see who inflicted that blow; it seemed as if it was from the same stick—the blood flowed from that blow—before I could recover myself I was seized by the throat by Howard—they <hi rend="italic">drifted</hi> me right up in the corner; those throe and several more, and Johnson struck me with something, I don't know whether it was a stick or what it was—they tore all the buttons off my waistcoat and coat, tore my overcoat open, and shamefully beat me—they were saving "Pay him," put I could not say who it was—I was on the ground for three or four minutes—it was impossible for me to see where Johnson struck me, because I had my hands ever my face, and they were kicking me, and very nigh broke the tops of my fingers—I then got from them, and ran back to the private lobby, and said "Now, you stop beat<lb/>ing me, or I will fire," and I called out "Police! Murder!"—the three prisoners followed me, and others besides—I had a revolver in my trousers pocket; I took it out when I went back to the lobby, and told them to stop beating me—I then had four or five wounds on the top of my head, and one on the temple, and you could not discern my features for blood; it was all over me—Howard said "Pay him, it is only loaded with peas"—they were still coming towards me to continue this, with sticks and water-bottles, and one thing or another—Johnson had a broken water-bottle, and the others had sticks—I then fired at Barrett—I only fired one shot—Goodwin, the constable, then came in and took me by the arm—somebody took the revolver from me—the constable pushed me through the passage leading to the bar-parlour—I then heard the report of firearms—the landlady opened tile flap of the counter and took me on the other side of the bar and laid me on the floor—my brother was halloaing out "Police! Murder!"—at that time we were both behind the bar for protection, and these men and others were getting on the counter and trying to jump over, throwing things, and going on like mad people—while the constable had hold of me somebody struck me a most terrific blow on the head—I could not see who did that—I heard three more shots fired, five altogether—I did not see any revolver but my own—I have since learnt that the names of the two women are Smith and Payne—smith was the one I treated—I had seen Barrett once or twice before,</p>

               <p>I never spoke to him—the other two were perfect strangers—I have seen Smith two or three times, and spoken to her—I never passed any tune in her company—I was asked at the station about the revolver—I said it was not mine; that was not true—I had my wounds dressed by a surgeon at the station—I could not say that I lost any money, I lost my hat—I am not in the habit of carrying a revolver in my pocket—I bought it a little after last Christmas of a seaman that used my house, the Lord Nelson—I had three diamond rings on my left hand, and when I was on the floor and they were beating me, there was a man in brown trousers; I could not distinguish his features, and they were trying to take my rings off, and the tips of my fingers are all bruised—they did not take the rings—this is my revolver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has six chambers; all six were loaded—when I saw it at the station four were loaded.</p>

I mentioned before the Magistrate about the man trying to take off my rings, and about Johnson holding the water-bottle in his hand, and I think I heard it read over—I had the revolver in my trousers-pocket behind, in a pockethandkerchief-pocket, where I carry my cigar-case as a rule—I have been in America; I have seen such pockets there—I can't say whether they carry revolvers in them—my trousers were made in London; I bought them ready made—I had no conversation with Barrett before he struck me—I told the inspector that the revolver belonged to Barrett.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, Baltic Street, St. Luke's, and am a beerhouse keeper—on Monday, 8th Nov., I went with my brother James from my house to the Cambridge Music Hall—we left there about 11.10 and went to the Commercial Tavern—we were quite sober—I saw two gentlemen in the private side—we had some whisky—as we were leav<lb/>ing I saw two females sitting by the door, I think one of them pulled my brother's coat, anyhow she asked if he was not going to treat her—he said yes, and she had something at the bar—I went outside—he said he was coming—I returned in about 30 seconds and asked my brother rather sharply, if he was not coming—he said nothing—I saw blood running; from his temple—I asked him who had done it—he said "This vagabond" or "This villain"—the bar seemed tolerably full of people—I said "You are no men, this is cowardism"—Barrett then hit me in the mouth with something very hard—I did not see what it was—it was a very severe blow, it loosened all my teeth and cut my mouth, it bled very much—there was then a general rush of about 10 or 12 men—they held us in the corner by the door—I extricated myself and ran out and called "Police! murder!" about four times; a policeman came, I followed him in, and Howard hit me on the head with a piece of iron, I have the scar now—it sent me staggering back near the door, but I did not fall, and the man himself appeared to go up in the air—I bled very much—that was followed up by sundry blows from behind—there was a general tussle in the passage, and eventually Johnson hit me a violent blow across the nose and said "This is the b—we want to pay"—I heard two reports after the constable came in—I had no idea that my brother had a revolver—I had never seen it before that night—when I went in with the constable, my brother was on the floor—it seemed directly we went in that I heard the reports; there was one report, and as I walked on, another one in just a</p>

               <p>few seconds—after that I saw the constable have hold of my brother's arm—Barrett wrenched a pistol from the constable's hand, at the same time Johnson hit me the severe blow on the nose, I do not know what with, I was rendered almost insensible—some other constables came in and the doors were closed—I saw Barrett in the custody of one of the police—after I had collected myself behind the bar a few seconds, I pointed out Howard and Johnson—while the constable had hold of my brother he was struck and knocked senseless on the floor—we all went across to the police-station, and my head was dressed—the prisoners were charged with assaulting and wounding my brother, and I and my brother were charged with wounding the woman Payne—the girl Smith, when asked to give her version of the matter, said "He fired one shot, and he the other," pointing to me and my brother—while Johnson was in the dock he said "When I get out of this, if I know your whereabouts, I will give you a bit of lead, so help me God"—I never saw either of the prisoners before this night, or the two women; they were all strangers to me—I did not hear any conversation between my brother and any man in the place—it must have been very short if there was any, for it was all done under a minute, that I am sure of, we were not in the house five minutes—I never heard my brother address Barrett as Johnny, or any conversation at all.</p>

I left the house just as my brother was picking up the change that he had paid for Smith's drink with—I did not particularly notice any of the prisoners then—I saw Barrett among a crowd of men at the bar, in the same compartment as my brother, and close to him—I was outside just sufficient time to put on one glove and button it, and then I turned round and opened the swing door, and said "James, are you not coming?"—I did not hear a shot fired while I was outside—directly I went inside I saw my brother stooping down and his forehead bleeding—there was no attack taking place then, not continually, it was so momentarily done—Johnson had not got him by the throat at that time—I never heard my brother mention the purchase of a revolver—we were very intimate—I have seen him four or five times a week for these two and a half years, and I have been at his house three or four times a day—he never told me that he slept with a loaded revolver under his pillow—I did not know that he had such a thing on his person, or I should not have felt inclined to go out with him—I did not know that he had been convicted—I have heard it since, of an assault—at the time Johnson made the remark at the station, I should think there must have been close on 50 police and others there—I did not take the least notice of what the prisoners were saying, I was too much cut up—I heard Johnson nay that his name was <hi rend="italic">Timothy Nevershake</hi>, and that he lived at Boston, Lincolnshire.</p>

               <p>prisoners before—I turned to serve somebody, and shortly afterwards I saw James Gill bleeding from the head—I had not heard or seen any<lb/>thing done before that—the next thing I saw was the three prisoners had him up in a corner beating him with sticks; they were middling blows, I should think as hard as they could; they did not say anything—I jumped over the counter to stop the noise, but I was useless, there were so many—there were only these three beating him, but there were others standing by; they did not interfere; I halloed to them; that was all I could do—I then saw James Gill fire a shot; I did not see where he took the revolver from; I saw it in his right hand—I did not hear him say anything before he fired; he pointed it at Barrett—Gill's face was bleeding very much at the time—I should say he was about three or four feet from Barrett when he fired—he fired two shots to my knowledge; I saw two shots fired by him—I don't know at whom he fired the second; I was behind him—there was a few minutes between the shots, or a few moments—people were rushing to get out of the way—the prisoners stood over him a bit, and then he ran away into the corner and made his way to the lobby door, and stood there, holding the pistol up, and said, "Stand back, or I will fire"—he had only fired one shot then, and a moment after saying that he fired the second—there were cries of "Murder;" the people in the bar were very excited, and made their nearest way out—when he fired the second shot the three prisoners all rushed into the lobby at him, and I heard three shots fired after that; I do not know who fired those; I was then on the stairs—I heard a smashing of glass and cries of "Police;" when I returned to the bar I saw some broken glass and a broken water-bottle; I did not see how it was broken, it was done in the mischief—the prisoners were not sober; I should say Barrett and Howard were half drank; Johnson I never noticed so much; I had spoken to Howard before the Gills came in, and told him to make less noise—after they were all gone to the station I found this small stick on the floor inside the bar; I gave it to one of the constables.</p>

I live at 131, Clifton Street—on 8th November I went to the tavern about 10 o'clock, and remained till the finish of the disturbance—I knew nothing of any of the parties—I saw Barrett and Howard there, and afterwards Johnson—Barrett had a short stick in his hand, with a knob to it—the prisoners were drinking and they had two females with them—Howard seemed to be the worse for liquor—he wanted to fight anybody, bar none—I saw the Gills come in and served with two drops of whisky; they were in a different box to the prisoners—as the Gills turned out at the door, I went into the lavatory; while there I heard a noise, and then as I got to the door I heard two shots—I went into the private bar and saw Gill with a pistol in his hand; he was bleeding all over the head—I looked through into the bar and saw them beating Gill about with sticks; he had the revolver in his hand—I was frightened at the revolver and went to the back again, and while there I heard some more shots; I can't say how many, I can swear to two more; I think there were more—I then went back; I saw the heads of both the Gills covered with blood; they were behind the bar——I called out "Shut all the doors;" the police rushed in and the prisoners were taken to the station—I there heard Howard say that if he had got hold of the pistol, or if he had a pistol, he would have put some lead into the younger Gill—Johnson was asked his name, and he said "Timothy Nevershake," and that he lived at some number in Cheapside, Boston, Lincolnshire; he said "You go there, and very likely you will find some more bullets or cartridges to fit the pistol."</p>

I am the wife of James Blumsen, proprietor of the Commercial Tavern—I was there on the Monday night, the 6th November, and saw the three prisoners there; they were making a noise and knock<lb/>ing on the counter, saying they would fight anybody, and Godfrey told them to be quiet—I saw the Gills come in—they had some drink, and I saw them go out—I was serving at the other side—I heard a noise, and heard the report of a pistol—I heard one or two reports, I am not sure which—I then looked under the screen of the counter and saw James Gill bleeding from the forehead and Barrett hitting him with a stick—I ran to the other bar and saw the prisoners making their way under the counter to the next bar—they were all scrambling through—I saw Howard with a pistol in his hand—I ran into the passage and saw Barrett fire a pistol which he had in his hand, I saw smoke coming from it—he pointed it to Gill—I then saw a constable take hold of Gill and drag him through into the bar—I shut down the flap—William Gill came and asked me to let him in; he said "I shall be killed," and I let him through the same flap—he was bleeding from the forehead at the time—the prisoners got into the next box, and I</p>

On this night I was on reserve duty at the Commercial Street Police-station, which is about 30 yards from the tavern—I heard cries of "Police!" and ran out into the street, and I heard one report of a firearm proceeding from the tavern—I went across to the door, and then heard another report inside—I went inside and then saw James Gill with a revolver in his right hand, pointing in the direction of the door at which I entered; smoke was coming from the revolver—he was bleeding from a wound in the forehead—I caught hold of his right hand with my left—Howard directly came and wrenched the pistol out of my hand—I immediately heard another report of fire-arms behind me, and I was struck on the right hand with something which knocked a piece of skin off the knuckle of the hand with which I had hold of Gill's throat—Howard ran out of the bar into the street—I took Gill along the passage and Johnson came behind and struck him over my shoulder on the head with a short stick, which caused him to fall, and I fell upon him—when I got up I saw Barrett; he said "Where is the b—? I will give him something"—I said "That will do, I have the man in custody"—they were all taken to the station—after the charge was taken Barrett was asked what he had to say, and he made this state<lb/>ment, which I took down: "I went in the public-house, when he (James Gill) came in and asked me to have a drink; I said "No, you and me <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> friendly;' he said 'I will soon show you,' and he put his hand behind and pulled out a revolver and fired at everybody in the house"—Johnson said "I corroborate what my little friend says, and if you go down to my address, Boston, Lincolnshire, you will find some more slugs the same as some more people tried to put into us"—Howard said "I took the revolver from the constable and would have put it into him (referring to James Gill) if I had a chance, for carrying such a weapon, but it might have gone off while I had it in my hand"—Howard made some remark to Gill, and he replied "Yes, you swines, I would have used it more upon you"—the woman Payne came to the station and said she had been</p>

Sir, I enclose entrance fee for another entry for your 100 yards handicap—W. Larner (Middleton Swimming and Atheltic Club). In club races he receives 25 seconds from scratch. I remain, Sir, yours repectfully, H. Green." In consequence of receiving that letter I sent a competitor's ticket to the address it gave—this is one of the tickets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—at the entertainment I was one of the judges—Larner took part in the races—he swam in the fourth heat in the 100 yards handicapthis is the pro<lb/>gramme—he had 20 sevonds start in 100 yards I believe in consequence of the letter from Mr. Green—he won the race easily—the prize was a silver cup, value five guineas—it was presented to him—the prisoner is a first-class swimmer, such a swimmer would only be allowed a nominal start if any—it was the start which enabled him to win the cup.</p>

On 9th November, about 2.55 a.m., I was in Brook Street, Ratcliff, and heard a noise in the Wellington public-house, apparently of the removing of furniture—I knocked at the door and Pether answered from the window—he had his braces and trousers on—I said "What is that noise at the bar?"—he said "It is all right"—I said "It is not all right"—I heard him go downstairs and return again in eight or ten minutes, he then came to the window and said "It is all right"—I again said "It is not all right; I want to come in"—he kept me waiting from 2.55 till 3.15—I got the assistance of another constable, and hearing parties talking and moving about, I told Pether that if he did not open the door I would make a forcible entry—we were then admitted—I went into the bar parlour and found this water-pot lying empty without the rose, and about a square yard and a half of the carpet stained with spirits of wine—a quantity of waste paper was lying about the floor saturated with spirits—I said to Pether "How do you account for this?"—he said "That I leave to your discretion"—in the bagatelle room adjoining I found more paper saturated with spirit in two cupboards, one on each side—the rose of the, can was under the bagatelle board, and was wet with spirit—Carter was standing at the foot of the staircase; he is the landlord, but does not live there—Pether lives there as manager, and Cartsr lives in Westmin-ster Bridge Road—Mrs. Pether was standing at the top of the stairs dressed except her bonnet—I said to Carter "How do you account for this?"—he said "That I leave entirely to you; "and he said to Pether "You remember a strange dog coming in this afternoon and knocking the can over?"—Pether said "No"—Carter said "Do you remember a little girl coming in this afternoon and kicking the can over?"—he said "That I know nothing about"—I said "How many more suggestions are you about to make?"—I sent for the inspector—the can appeared to have contained spirits of wine, about two thimblefuls of which remained in it, which will be produced—I found about eleven barrels in the cellar, but cannot say whether they were full or empty.</p>

I received information, and went to the public-house on 3rd November about 3.15, and found Sergeant Gadd there—I went with him into the bar-parlour, and saw Pether in his shirt and trousers; he was under the influence of drink—at the bottom of an open cupboard near the bar was a quantity of waste paper saturated with spirits of wine—I burnt some of it in food's presence, and it burnt very fast, showing that the spirit was very inflammable—I saw a can which had contained spirits of wine; this is what was in it (<hi rend="italic">a small drain of spirit</hi>)—the carpet in the vicinity of the cupboard was saturated with spirits of wine—I said to Pether, "How do you account for the spirits being strewed about in this manner?"—he said, "It will be duly accounted for"—I said, "You do not appear to have been to bed; the fire has been kept up, and well kept up"—he made no reply—I said, "Are you the landlord?"—he said, "No, there is the landlord," point—I ng to Carter—I said, "How do you account for the spirit being strewed about in this manner?"—he said, "After the house was closed I went to bed, and left Pether alone downstairs"—the cupboards in the bagatelle room on either side of the fireplace were open, and in the bottom of each was a quantity of paper more or less saturated with spirits of wine; it might have been pressed into a half-bushel basket—I called the prisoners to the door, held up some of the paper with the spirit dropping off it, and said, "How do you account for these spirits being here?"—Carter said, "A little child upset a bottle of spirit in the afternoon"—Pether said, "My daughter told me a little child upset a bottle of spirit in the afternoon"—I said, "What child?"—he said, "I cannot Say"—I said, "Cannotyou tell me the name of the child?"—Carter said, "Atten-borough"—they then returned to the bar-parlour, and after speaking to</p>

Hoare's brewery—I saw them after they had seen Messrs. Hoare—they told me that if the reference suited Garter would take the house, and he did take it—Mr. Davis was the former landlord, and 137<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to him for the goodwill and fixtures, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which was for the stock—I provided them with 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as they were short of the amount.</p>

I am a carman of 6, Harrow Road, Leytonstone—in May this year I had a writ for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Imperial Discount Company—I saw the prisoner two days afterwards at the Plough and Harrow public-house or opposite at my stable; he asked me to show him the writ; I did so—he said "This is nothing; I will put in an appearance for you"—I said "How can you put in an appearance? I did not know you were a solicitor"—he said "I act as solicitor for Mr. Best"—I gave him the writ and he took it away—he asked me for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. next morning, which I gave him and got this receipt—I then went with him to his office, 35, Bishopsgate Street, third floor; "C. Villiers George" was on the door—we then went to Temple Bar, near the new Courts of Justice, to put in an appearance, which I believe was done—he said "It has cost more than I expected; give me an extra 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I gave it to him, and he gave me this receipt on a card—I saw him again next morning or the morning after, and he wanted a further sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the action, which I gave him, and he gave me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">The receipts were for</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">on account of costs, and signed</hi>"<hi rend="italic">C.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have never had transactions with solicitors before, and I am rather afraid of them; I have only had one transaction with the prisoner before—I did not know that he was not a solicitor, nor did I know that he was an accountant—he arranged three commitments for me at Bow County Court—I believed he was a solicitor or a solicitor's clerk—he said at the Bow County Court that he was a solicitor, or acting solicitor for Mr. Best; I no not know the difference—I went to his house then; the first time I went to his offioe was on the settlement of this action—I gave him a bill of sale to advise upon—I have never been in a Court of Justice before; I swear that—I was never convicted of felony; I never got 18 months—I do not know what you mean by being convicted; I was accused at Worship Street, and it went to Clerkenwell Green; it is 10 years ago—the charge against me was by the Great Eastern Railway for unlawful possession of things on my premises—I was not convicted of stealing, on my oath, or of receiving stolen goods; it was for the goods being on my premises; I was sentenced to 18 months; no, nine months—I will not swear that it was not in 1876; it was 8 or 10 years ago—I have not seen a brass plate "C. Villiers George, Accountant," on the prisoner's house—I have not known him five or six years as an accountant, or two years—he has not done all my business for me as an accountant; he did not say when I gave him the writ "I can put the name of a solicitor on the appearance, Mr. Best"—he did not say "I can use the name of Mr. Best as a solicitor, and so carry on the business for you more economically "—he said "I act as solicitor for Mr. Best"—I asked to see Mr. Best on</p>

Brook came out and struck me with a hammer. We closed; I hit him on the head with my hand; I deny hitting him with a stick at all. I bit him on the cheek to turn him over. Then he begged for mercy, and I went indoors and washed the blood from my face. The constable came and said I had better go to the station, and I went.</p>
