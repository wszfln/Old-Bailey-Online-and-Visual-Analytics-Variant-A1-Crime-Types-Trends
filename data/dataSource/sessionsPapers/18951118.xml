I am one of the firm of Zulueta and Co., merchants and bankers, 41, Moorgate Street—it is part of our duty to collect coupons for customers here and abroad—it was part of the prisoner's duty to assist us in the general business—the coupons are obtained and sent in due time by cheque, or if small they are sold to a</p>

               <p>dealer—on September 24th we had to collect Australian 5 per cent, coupons value £35 11s. 6d.—I left at four o'clock that day, leaving Coben there; the had been engaged after mid-day in cutting and listing coupons; that would require care—he was there when I got there—about twelve o'clock on, the 25th, and I saw him off and on during the day performing his duties—on the 26th Wyatt made a communication to me with reference to the prisoner, and a telegram had been received before I got to the office and a clerk had been sent to the prisoner's house—on the 27th I got there about 12.30 and Mr. Wyatt and the prisoner were there—he was called into my room and I said, "How is it you did not come yesterday? Mr. Wyatt saw you in Finsbury about 10.30 a.m."—he said that he had been working all the previous night in a stock broker's office, which had brought on a return of the gout which he suffered from and he was then going home—on being told that the clerk had been told that he was not at home, he said that that was a mistake of the servant—I said that if he made himself unfit for our work by working elsewhere we could not allow it—he sometimes said that he sent the telegram before he went to Finsbury and sometimes after—I dis<lb/>missed him summarily, paying him to the end of the month—my brother was abroad—I spoke to him when he came back and wrote a letter to the prisoner after I found the coupons had been cashed, and sent it by the same clerk Stolger to Englefield Road—I then wrote him another letter to the same address and posted it—he came on the 14th and repeated what he had written in his letter that he had received the money at Mr. Ironmonger's office, and put it into his hip pocket, and forgot all about it till next evening, when he felt for it, and found it was not there—I asked if he did not search his pocket when he went to bed—he said he never did—I asked him if all the coupons had been eat—he said "Yes" but that did not recall it to his mind—I asked him why he did not say anything about it when he came to the office—he said he was afraid—I asked what he was afraid of—he said he did not know—I wrote to him on the 19th, and said that the matter was in the hands of our solicitor, and on the 21st a warrant was applied for—his wife and mother came and saw me after he was arrested—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in pencil; just the top of the "C" is left, and the "le" in Englefield Road—that is in his writing, I know it well.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should not be surprised if one slipped from the top of the van, but this was packed on the footboard—a porter packed them—I went round the van to see they were loaded in a proper manner, and then left to pay the porter—I have to see these things are properly packed, or I should lose them.</p>

They are pawned with the clock at the shop opposite where I live. He pawned them; I mean he pawned the clock for 30s., and I think he gave the name of Fairfield, but he has destroyed the tickets. I pawned the linen, and I think I gave the name of Fairfield, while he waited outside. I saw a detective last night. I told him I would tell him all that I knew.

I again say I will help you all I can. I never stole anything in my life."

I saw the two prisoners with another man, not in custody, in Orchard Street. They were standing about. We concealed ourselves in a dark doorway. We had scarcely been there a minute, when I heard shouts of 'Murder!' and 'Police!' coming from Orchard Street, about sixty yards from where we were. We ran out from our hiding-place, and I saw the figure of a person lying in the gutter. The two prisoners and the other man bolted off. We gave chase. I caught Harris, after a run of about three hundred yards. He slipped my hands twice, and I had to throw him to the ground. He looked up and said, 'What are you going to charge me with?' I replied, 'I do not know yet; you come back with me to Orchard Street, where I saw a man lying down, and we'll see what you'll be charged with.' Just then the prosecutor met us, and, pointing to Harris, said, 'Ah, that's the man that tried to rob me just now; that's one of them.' I said, 'Are you the man that was lying in the roadway just now?' He said 'Yes, and that man tried to rob me; there's some more of them.' Harris then said, 'Be careful, now, you'll have to prove that.' I said to the prisoner, 'You'll likely be charged with attempted highway robbery with violence.' He replied, 'That will have to be proved.' Just then the constable Holton came up with Jackson in custody. They were taken to the station, and the prosecutor charged them both. The prisoners denied all knowledge of each other."</p>

I am a house agent of Leicester—I was staying in London and went into 164, Strand, to be shaved—the prisoner Browett attended to me—he asked me what sort of weather we were having in my part of the country, I said, "About the same as you are having here"—he could only have known that I came from the country by seeing "Leicester" in my hat—this was before breakfast—he said, "Your teeth are very bad, sir; I could put them right in a very short time"—I said, "I can't stop now, I have ordered my breakfast"; he said "It will only take a very few minutes"; and that he had scaled the teeth of titled people; and people drove up there in their car<lb/>riages—while he was scaling my teeth, he said that Lord Portland had paid him £10, and it was nothing to receive £5—he said, "You see we are qualified dentists," and pointed to the diploma of Dr. Baron, and said that if I had not come just in time it would have cost me £20—when he had finished the front I began to get a little nervous and I got up and told him I thought I had better come in after dinner—he said, "It will not take much longer, you will have to pay now for what you have had done; "I said, "What charge?" he said, "Four guineas"—I said, "What do you do in a barber's shop if you can earn money like this, you have not been at it a quarter of an hour?" He asked me into a back room—I said I should not pay, and offered him ray card—he said, "That is no good"—I said, "I have only a few shillings on me;"—he said, "I will go round to the hotel with you"—I had said that I was staying at the Norfolk Hotel—a lady came in and two assistants; they stood at the door—he came down to £3, and I gave a cheque for £3 to Baron—the assistants then went away—I went to the hotel, got some information, and telegraphed and stopped the cheque—next morning, soon after eight o'clock, I went to the shop; Browett came about 8.45, and I said, "I have come to demand my cheque back which I gave you yesterday"—he said, "Why?"—I said, "Because I have discovered that you are the biggest frauds in London"—he said, "Somebody has been setting you against us; your cheque is cashed by now"—I said, "You will be rather surprised to find I have stopped it"—he said, "I shall consult my solicitor"—I said, "I shall have a solicitor too"—on 14th August I received this letter from a solicitor, endorsed P. Baron (<hi rend="italic">Demanding payment of the cheque which had been dishonoured.</hi>)—my solicitor answered that (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the cheque had been obtained by threats, and that as his name did not appear in the register of dentists it would be laid before the Society of Dentists, but offering him</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.)—I then received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the witness said that he was satisfied, and took a bottle of dentifrice away with him.</hi>)—that is not true.</p>

I have a list here of over 100, with many from Ireland—eventually there was an arrest, and I charged Browett with attempting to obtain money from Mr. Prince by a trick, and a warrant was obtained, on which I arrested Baron; I told him the matter had became so serious that the Magistrate had issued a warrant for his arrest—I read it to him, and charged him; he still pretended that he did not know what was going on, and put it on his assistants—I reminded him of having cautioned him on May 30th, and said, "You have no dental qualification, nor have your assistants;" he said, "No, I admit that"—Goldberg gave evidence before the Magistrate, after which he ab<lb/>sconded, and Rosenberg absconded—subsequently Cline was called as a witness—at the time of the arrest this notice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was up in the shop, but it was not visible—it was behind the door in one shop, and at 164 it was stuck right up at the ceiling, and you could only see the large letters—you could see "tooth scaling," but you could not see the word "from."</p>

                  </hi>. I reside with my sister Lady Dorothea Hope, at Longcross House, Chertsey—I have a private account at Glynn's—this was the cheque-book I had in use in April; on the cover is "Estella Hope" in my writing; but I sign all my cheques "Estella M. Hope"—my sister has a private account at the same bank for which she has her cheque book; and we have also a joint account for house-keeping purposes, and we have a third cheque-book for that—cheques on the joint account we sign "E. and D. Hope"—the three cheque-books are kept in a drawer of a bureau in our bedroom—that drawer is always-kept locked—the counterfoils of cheques 96 and 97 have been torn out from my cheque-book—this cheque for £11 8s. has been written on the form 96, and this other cheque is written on 97—they are not in my writing, nor written by my authority—only those two were torn from my book—from our joint account cheque-book counterfoil 79 is missing—I have dated counterfoil 80 April 8th—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cheque form 79 torn from the book—it is not signed by me nor my sister—it is a forgery—it is dated April 8th—either my sister or I sign "E. and D. Hope" for that account—my sister filled up cheque form 80—she does not appear to have noticed the absence of the counterfoil 79—some time in the spring we were away from Longcross House; only for the day, I think—the prisoner was in our service at that time as parlourmaid—when we came back she said to my sister "You left your keys in the cellarette in the dining-room," and she took them out of the sideboard drawer and put them into my sister's hand—among the keys of that bunch was the key of the drawer of the bureau; it is an outside drawer, you do not have to unlock the bureau to get to the drawer—our lady's maid is named Deuchar she was in our service in April, and is with us still—the prisoner left our service on April 26th—she wrote and signed this receipt for her wages and her week's washing upon leaving—Mrs. Hawkins, a friend who lives with us, paid her; she pays all the indoor servants with the exception of Deuchar,</p>

I live at 53, Talbot Road, Bayswater; I let apartments—in March last Mrs. Mayston, the deceased, came alone and took an apartment on the second floor, which she occupied for two or three weeks, after which the prisoner joined her, and they lived there together up to August 21st—on Tuesday, the 20th, I saw the prisoner there about nine in the evening; his wife was then out; she had gone out about two that afternoon—the prisoner asked if his wife was in; I said, "No"—he said he was very worried about her; he asked me if it was true that she stayed out till two o'clock in the morning—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Where can she get to?"—I said, "That is what I can t</p>

               <p>make out"—he said something about where she could or could not have gone to, that the public-houses were not open till that time in the morning—he then went upstairs to his room—as far as I know, he did not go out again that evening—about eleven his wife came home—I saw she was drunk—she was not able to walk properly—I saw her going upstairs, and followed her up, owing to her condition—she got up without my assistance, and went into her room—I heard the prisoner say, "Oh, Gerty, where have you been?"—she replied, "I will go where I like, and do what I like"—she said that in a command<lb/>ing voice—the door was then closed, and I went later that night I was in the yard behind the house, and I he is going on from their room—I could not hear the prisoner's voice only the deceased's—that went on up till two in the morning—I then went to bed and heard no more—in the morning the postman brought a letter for Mrs. Mayston—I took it up, and put it in the slop basin outside the door—I noticed the handwriting of the letter—I had seen letters in that hand<lb/>writing delivered before at the house—I first saw the prisoner that morning about eleven, on the top of the kitchen stairs—he looked very worried—I said, "Is that you, Mr. Mayston?"—he said he was very worried about a letter that his wife had received that morning from her mother—he did not say what it was about—he then went out into the street—I heard him return in about half-an-hour and go upstairs—I did not hear where he went—the next thing I heard was a bang—I heard one bang first, and then two more, I think—the first bang seemed almost directly after he went up; the other two bangs were quickly one after the other—I afterwards heard another bang—I was in the kitchen, in the same place as where I heard the other three—as to the interval between that and the others, I can only compare it to just walking across the room, and then coming back again—Miss Magorrery was with me, and she went upstairs—I did not hear any other bang after she had gone up; I only heard four altogether, I am quite sure about that—I then went up, and I saw smoke coming from under their door—I tried the door, but could not open it—I called, "Mrs. Mayston, open the door," more than once; I heard no answer, only a groan—I then burst the door open and looked into the room—I first saw the prisoner lying on his back; his feet were nearest to me, they did not touch the door, or nearly so—a cabman's badge was near his shoulder, not flat on the floor—I saw a pistol on the floor, near the calf of his leg, not quite close to it, on his right as I entered the room, his leg was nearest the window—I law Mrs. Mayston lying on the floor, near the window—her feet were towards the dressing-table, and her head towards the bed—I went into the room; I did not touch the bodies—I kicked the pistol near to his feet; I nearly fell over it—shortly after the doctor came, and the police afterwards—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter I took in that morning.</p>

               <p>tmes—I knew by the handwriting that the letter was from her mother—Mrs. Mayston first came to me in March—she remained entirely with me for a considerable time—the prisoner only came at intervals to see her—at the time of this affair he had been living there a little over three weeks—she had been living there without him from March—when she came in that night he said to her, "Oh, Gerty, where have you been?"—he said it in a tone of sorrow—I never saw him beat her, or saw any symptoms of anger towards her—she answered him in a commanding tone—it was her habit to lock her door when Mr. Mayston came there to reside—she seemed ashamed of having married him; she said so—the nagging went on up to two in the morning; the whole of the nagging proceeded from the female voice—I did not hear his voice much—she was a much heavier body than he; she was very tall, and a very fine-looking person—I have heard that she was by profession an actress—I did not know that she had been on tour with a company in America—she was drunk when she came home on that night—I went upstairs with her, lest she might fall down; I was aware that she was pregnant—she has made the observation to me, "I wish I was dead; I have done all I can to get rid of it;" referring to her condition—the prisoner used to shave; there were two razors in the room; they were kept in a washstand drawer; they were not locked up—the deceased was a very heavy sleeper—she used to have desperate drinking bouts—after those bouts she manifested very violent conduct, hysterical to a degree—she said she had disgraced herself by marrying Mr. Mayston—during the whole of this time he was never violent to her—after the violent bouts she was very sick—the prisoner waited upon her, hand and foot—he cleaned up the mess she used to make—she was violent; he did not hold her down—I did; I had to hold her down and restrain her—he got her the best of everything he could, and denied himself—on one occasion, three weeks before this, I had some conversation with her about suicides—there was a report about a person cutting her throat, and she said it would be much easier to pick up a revolver and do it—on the Tuesday before this the prisoner said to me that the best thing for him to do would be to clear out of it, and the best place to go to would be South America—I was in the yard at the time, listening; the window of their room was open, and I heard him say that—I stopped up till two in the morning, as I felt a little apprehensive till they went to rest; I did not know to what length she might go.</p>

               <p>of his father, and he did his best to make the man hear—all the answer obtained was a groan—some of the stains and marks about the room, I think, were caused by persons walking or moving about the room—the knife is a small table-knife; it belonged to Mrs. Mayston—I have seen her using it—there is a notch in it; that was caused by a spring on her back—she was doing something to get the spring out on the Monday morning before the Wednesday—it laid on the washstand—as far as I could see, the prisoner was in a state of collapse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I spoke to him, I should say, more than a dozen times before the police and the doctor came—I kept on speaking to him—at times he gave a faint groan; that was all he uttered, no word—the first stain I saw when I went in was at the prisoner's feet; it was not a large stain; it was very near to his feet—the next stain was at his head—his head laid in one stain—I did not notice any other stain between those two—there was another stain where Mrs. Mayston laid, near her head—I did not notice any other stain of blood in the room—I can't say whether there were any other stains that I may not have seen, other stains that I may not have noticed—the stains about the room were caused by persons walking into the blood, and then walking or moving about the room—the blood where the prisoner lay, lay by his head, and it was smeared by somebody having trodden on it—I cannot mention any other stains that were made by persons moving about—while the nagging was going on, the only words I could hear from the prisoner were about going to South America—I could not hear what words Mrs. Mayston used—it was when she had been with me three weeks that I noticed her getting drink, falling about, and being violent and sick; that would be as long back as the beginning of April; for a few days she would be all right, but, at intervals, it continued throughout the whole time—it was about a week before this happened that I gave her notice to quit—I had never spoken to the prisoner about her conduct—she was taller than the prisoner; I should say he was up to her shoulder, not more.</p>

I am a governess, and live at 53, Talbot Road—I had a room on the second floor, on the same landing as the prisoner and his wife—on Tuesday night, August 20th, about eleven, I was in my room, and heard voices, just a buzz; I could not tell whether there was more than one voice—it went on till nearly two—I could not distinguish the voices at all—on the following morning (<hi rend="italic">the 21st</hi>) I saw the prisoner go out—I heard him come back in about half-an-hour—he went upstairs—I did not see where he went—a few minutes after he had gone up I heard four bangs—first I heard two, then, quickly after, another, then, after a short interval, two more—after hearing those four I went up to my room, and while there I heard another—that might have been nearly a quarter of an hour after I had got into my room—it was the noise of a pistol shot—after that I heard a fall, as of a heavy body going over—I then went for Mrs. Wills—I saw her try the door—I afterwards went for a doctor and a policeman—I did not go into the room before going.</p>

                  </hi> (205 <hi rend="italic">F</hi>). On August 21st, towards midday, I was called to 53, Talbot Road—in the back room, second floor, I saw the prisoner lying in a direct line with the door, his feet towards the door, and his Lead towards a recess on the opposite side; he was bleeding from the head, which was lying in a pool of blood—Dr. Waite was there—I sent for another constable and an ambulance—the prisoner's hands were covered with blood; near his right elbow I found this carpet bag, and this revolver against his feet, saturated with blood—I saw the body of the woman, lying in an oblique direction from the window and door, her feet under the dressing-table, in front of the window, her elbows resting on the floor, the hands half closed and perfectly clean, the head lying in a pool of blood, a blackened wound on the right temple, and a portion of brain appearing, a small stream of blood running from the corner of the mouth—she was fully dressed, loosened at the neck, otherwise not disarranged—there was no evidence of any struggle having taken place; she had a pair of boots on—I said to the prisoner, "What is your wife's name?"—he said, "Gertrude"—I said, "What is her age?"—he said, "Thirty"—I said, "Is your age thirty?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Will you give me the name and address of any friends?"—he said, "My father, William Mayston, resides at Horn Terrace, White Hart Lane, Barnes"—that was all that was said—I had not to speak above my ordinary tone—he was then taken on the ambulance to the hospital—I then made a search of the room—behind the door was a washstand; upon</p>

               <p>that I found a cardboard box containing forty-two ball cartridges, and at the side of the box I found this knife; the box was full of blood; there was blood on the washstand—it stood in a pool of blood six or seven inches in diameter—about three feet from where the man's head had lain I found this bullet, and there was a corresponding mark on the wall, three feet four inches in height—at the corner of the mantelpiece I found this picture, with a spent bullet embedded in it, and a dent in the wall behind it—I found this letter on the dressing-table, signed "M."; it was in an open envelope—I examined the revolver; it had been loaded in four chambers, which had been recently discharged; I extracted the four empty cartridges; they were the same size as the forty-two in the box; I noticed that one of the chambers of the revolver was defective; there was a catch in it, and you would have to move it with your finger before it would go off—on the 26th I made a further search of the room, and at the foot of a towel-horse, behind the dressing-table, I found an empty cartridge case; it had been exploded, and round the rim I found a notch, as if it had been scraped with a knife; and under a chest of drawers I found two ball cartridges and a lady's shoe; I also found a marriage certificate of August 1st, 1893, and a deed of separation of 1894, signed by Frank and Gertrude Mayston.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner and divisional surgeon, of 11, Portland Road, Notting Hill. On August 21st, about one, I was called to 53, Talbot Road—on going into the room on the second floor, I saw the body of a woman lying on the floor by the window—I did not see the prisoner, he had been taken away—I examined the woman—I found a bullet wound on the right side of the head, large enough for the top of the finger to be put in, there was a charred mark round it about two inches in diameter, black as if from the powder—I could not say positively at what distance the shot had been fired, but I should say from two to three feet from the head—I should think the pistol had not been held by her hand at the time—I was not present at the post-mortem.</p>

I am house surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital—on August 21st, about a quarter to one, the prisoner was under my charge, and remained so until October 5th—when I first attended to him he was lying on a stretcher, and when I began to examine him he began to cry out, and was violently delirious—I first noticed a punctured wound on the right side of the head, about an inch behind the right eye; it passed through the skull about four inches, the bullet remaining in the head—there was another wound right in the middle of the forehead about an inch and a-half, travelling in a backward and downward direction, the bullet being in it—there was a third wound just above the middle of the left eyebrow, that penetrated in a downward direction to the left, it glanced round the bone and came out, and the exit caused the fourth wound—the wound in the temple was the most serious—that might have caused unconsciousness; I don't say that it did, but it was sufficient to do so—I could not say which was the first wound, or the second, but I think, in point of time, the one on the left, the slightest one—from, the appearance of the wounds themselves I could not say in what sequence they occurred.</p>

I am undergoing sentence at Wormwood Scrubs—I have known the prisoner between ten and eleven years—I took some stables for Kunold at Murray Mews, Finsbury Park, in the name of Frank Bowles—I paid the landlord and the prisoner paid me—I also took a stable at Park Yard, Kensal Green for Kunold, in the name of Frank Bowles at the end of May; he paid me and I paid the landlord—I had two cobs and a van at Park Yard, one was a dun and one black—there was a double set of harness on the cob—I got those from the prisoner in June in the City Road, in the open" street—there was a name on the van, but I cannot remember it—he told me to sell the black cob, if possible, and get £12 for it—I took it to a baker at Hendon; another man not at all like Kunold went with me; he was darkish and clean-shaved, he could not be mistaken for Kunold—I saw the baker at his bakehouse, and had the cob with me—I went to a public-house that night with the other man, not Kunold—Mr. Martin is the landlord—at the public-house the baker asked me to leave the cob for a day on trial, and I did so—I went there with the young man the next evening, and got this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced, dated June</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi>)—this is my endorsement on it—Kunold cashed it at the Hendon Bank—he had £7 10s. of it, and I had 30s., and I gave 10s. to the man who went with me—about three or four weeks afterwards Kunold drove me to the baker's house with a big bay horse—Kunold was then living in White Lion Street, Islington—I went and showed him the cheque on the evening I got it, and he told me</p>

               <p>to meet him next morning—the baker said that his brother wanted to purchase a horse—Kunold had no beard then, only a moustache—he is a German and speaks with a foreign accent—I do not remember seeing the baker again until I saw him in Court—I was arrested on July 27th—the van and some of the harness were then still at Park Yard, but nothing at Murray Mews—I got this horse-rug (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Park Yard stable—I was tried on August 18th—between July 16th and August 18th I was in Holloway Prison, and on August 15th I saw the prisoner there—he said, "Halloa, Frank, how are you getting on?"—I am known as Frank Bowles—I said, "As well as can be expected," and asked him how I was going to do without a Counsel—he said, "I will find you a Counsel and see you righted," and shouted out so that the warder could hear, "I believe you are perfectly innocent"; and then, so that the warder could not hear, "For God's sake don't say anything about me, or I shall get into serious trouble; my place has been searched"—he then had to go—while I was in Holloway Hopkins came to see me; he is no relation, but we are known as cousins—he provided me with food, and told me where some of the money came from to provide it—I knew that the prisoner had been convicted of horse stealing; he had just started a business when I first knew him as a job-master at North Street, Poplar—he hired a yard there—I next knew him in York Road, at the mews close to the Copenhagen in Camden Town, till April or May last, when he removed to a yard in White Lion Street, Islington—I was only there once for a very few minutes—I had been to his house in York Road; the front door faces the road, and the back gate opens into the mews, and inside the yard as you enter there is a small shed and a dog in the corner, and you turn round from the kitchen to the washhouse, which is an ordinary washhouse—the kitchen is in the basement—his house is on the left side, entering the Mews—I have been in the house twice, I went in from the back yard—there is a bell on the gate; if anyone touched the gate the bell will sound—I went into the kitchen, but did not pass through the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not been four times convicted, only three—the first was three months, I cannot tell you the date; the second was for being concerned in stealing two horses, and I had twenty months—I have never been a witness before—I got the horses from Kunold, and yet I was convicted—I am now undergoing eight years' penal servitude, and Kunold has had all the advantage, but I did not speak put because he looked after me and promised to find me employment when I was released—he only called to see me once at Holloway; we were together about ten minutes—he has called on me in gaol before more than once; he came twice a week, and I was there about four weeks—he called on me at Holloway about August 15th; a warder was sitting between us, and another was not far off—I was examined at the Police-court on August 30th and 31st—when I underwent five years' penal servitude that was owing to the prisoner—he provided me with food, but not with Counsel—he got employment for me when I came out; the present case is through my being employed by him—he went with me to Hendon, and got part of the plunder; the man who drew the cheque saw him—he and the other man were together about a quarter of an hour; the other man was known to Kunold—when Kunold's house was searched he forbade me to go there; he knew where Kunold lived—he was living</p>

               <p>at White Lion Street when we went to Hendon; since the police searched the premises he has forbidden my going there, because his wife had not been told about it—a good many people have seen us together—the other man who went to Hendon I had seen twice—we did not have a conversa<lb/>tion; I drove in front, and he behind—I do not know his name, but he told me he was ostler in a cab yard—there is two or three inches difference in his height and the prisoner's; nobody could mistake him.</p>

I am a metal dealer of 37, Harris Street, Camberwell, and have a yard and stable in South Street—on June 11th I had four cobs, a cart, and harness, whips, and horse-cloths there—a carman aroused me at 6 a.m.; I went to the stable and found the gates unlocked; I missed a van with my name on it, two cobs, four sets of harness, three pair of lamps, six nosebags, and other articles—I have since identified them—I went to the station at once—on September 2nd I saw my black cob in the possession of Mr. Hockey; its tail had been cut, and its mane cut and pulled to make it look thinner—on September 1st or 2nd I met the prisoner in a public-house in White Lion Street, and asked him if he had got such a thing as a cob for sale—he asked what sort of a cob I wanted—I said, "One about 13 or 13 1/2 hands, to match another"—he said that he sold one a fortnight or three weeks ago which would have suited me—he took me into his stable in White Lion Street, and showed me what cattle he had got—we went back to the public-house, and he had two or three different drinks with me, and I asked him whether there was any truth in what was in the papers that Roberts was an enemy of his—he said, "Yes, he knows as much about it as I do"—I asked him to give me information about the two cobs which I had lost—he said he knew nothing whatever about them, and that Roberts had been trying to <hi rend="italic">put him away</hi>, for stealing my cobs, and had got him into trouble, and that he had been taken like a dog, and that Roberts had accused him of stealing horses—I said, "Are those two cobs he has stolen mine, do you think?"—he said, "I don't know, but he is trying to do me an injury.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker of Church Lane, Hendon—I first saw the prisoner in June, at the Green Man, Edgware, about a week before the cheque was given—he asked for the next train for London; a man in the bar said, "There is not one for two hours"—I was delivering bread, and offered to give him a ride—he had two or three horse halters in his hand—I gave him a lift to Hendon; he made a remark about the horse I was driving, and said that he was in the line, and if he came across a pony and brought it to me, would I look at it—he had a moustache then, but not a beard like he has now—about a week after<lb/>wards he brought a pony and cart to my shop—that was the day before the cheque was given—Roberts was with him—they had two traps, a horse and van, and a cob and cart—I believe the prisoner had a mous<lb/>tache then—he told me he had a horse for me to look at; I asked him to come up and see a friend of mine, and we went to the Midland Arms; Martin saw the horse, but he did</p>

               <p>not see much of it, as it was getting dark—I arranged to have it left overnight on trial, but he did not have it on that occasion; we made an appointment to meet him at Kendal Roy but did not, and they came down next evening—Roberts did most of the talking—I agreed to buy the horse, and on the 14th the same two men came again and the cheque was given to Mr. Martin in Roberts' presence—that was the horse which Mr. Gray has identified—I next saw the prisoner one morning when I was going to the bakehouse; he had got a big red roan horse, and asked me the way to my brother's place—I told him it was no use taking the horse there as my brother would not buy such a valuable one—he went away and I never saw him again till he was at the North London Police Court on the Tuesday—there were several persons there—the detective said, "This is Kunold"—he had a different appearance—he was dressed better; he had still a moustache and no beard—I spoke to the man who came down with Roberts, several times; I did not notice any accent, he spoke to me at the Police-court, but I cannot say for certain whether it was the same voice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman in the drug department of the Stores, in room C—that department is divided into three rooms—Cornell was an assistant in the C room, which is the smaller of the two sale rooms—only lie, myself, Morgan Lloyd, and another assistant who occasionally relieved me were engaged there—every assistant has a bill book similar to this—the bills are numbered in triplicate, each three have the same number—sometimes a customer takes goods and sometimes they are sent to the door, where there is a parcels' office—if the customer takes them, the assistant writes "Taken" at the head of the bill after the customer's name to indicate the mode of delivery, but if the parcel is to go to the parcels' office at the door, the assistant writes "Door"—if the goods are to be sent by carman the address would be put after the customer's name—sometimes the customer after determining to take the goods changes his mind and wants them sent down to the door, and in that case the "Taken" would be altered to "Door"—the assistant makes the three copies of the bill at the same time by means of carbon paper—when the customer has given particulars of his order the assistant should call a foreman to check the items of the order, and the foreman should see that the customer's name and number appear there, and the mode of delivery and amount of the order, and initial the bill, and tear out the first two duplicate bills, leaving the triplicate bill in the assistant's book—the fore<lb/>man files the original and hands the duplicate to the customer—that takes place if the customer has a deposit account, which is indicated by</p>

               <p>"Deposit" being written on the bill; if no such word appears the trans<lb/>action is a cash one—if the customer changes his mind after "Taken" has been initialled by the foreman, and altered by the assistant to "Door" that alteration should be made on the original and the duplicate by the foreman; they should be all replaced, and the alteration made on all three copies—in the case of a "Door" transaction the assistant has to make out a "tally," a slip of paper like this to be tied to the parcel which is to be sent to the door—the tally bears the date, the number of the depart<lb/>ment, the assistant's name, the name of the customer, and the value of the parcel—the Drug Department is known as No. 6—the assistant would also make out a door-ticket, and give it to the customer; by means of that the customer can obtain the parcel from the parcels' office—the ticket corresponds with the tally and bears the assistant's initials—the assistant should call the foreman to check the tally at the time that he signs the duplicate and the triplicate bills, when the parcel is ready to go to the door—the bills are dealt with in the same way, whether it a "taken" or a "door" transaction—when the parcel is to go to the door, the customer gives up his bill to the assistant—Cornell had this counter-book in use on October 10th; Cornell's number was 19—these are the original, the duplicate and the triplicate of order No. 230,979—the original has been taken from the file—my initial "A. H." is on all three—I was the fore<lb/>man on that day—this is the duplicate produced by Mrs. Sutton—when I initialled them "Door" was not written here, only "Taken" appeared—on the original and duplicate now only "Taken" appears, on the triplicate the "Taken" written in carbon has been crossed out by "Door" written in pencil—"Door" was not there when I initialled it; on that triplicate there are the initials of Morgan Lloyd in blue; he is another foreman—I recognise these initials as his; they also appear on the tally; my initials are not on that—on the next day, 11th, Cornell left the employment at one o'clock; his usual time for dinner is two—he did not tell me where he was going—he never returned—between ten and twelve on that 11th I saw the prisoner in C room—he was stand<lb/>ing there; I only saw him for a moment—I believe he was just going to go out; he was not speaking to anyone—I knew him well by sight; I have frequently seen him in the same room talking to Cornell—he has never, to my knowledge, purchased anything there.</p>

I heard the whole of the conversa<lb/>tion before the prisoner went to the drug department and after he came back—I heard Keate's evidence as to the conversation after the prisoner came back; it is substantially correct—before he went to the drug department he handed in the door ticket for the parcel, and Head said the parcel was not there, and referred him to the drug department—I heard the prisoner say, "The parcel has been sent here from the depart<lb/>ment"—Head said, "I gave it this morning to a lady and her groom," or words to that effect—the prisoner said, "You should not give up a parcel without a door ticket"—and Head said, "As long as I see a paid bill that is sufficient for me"—the prisoner said, "I don't want other members of my family to know what I am purchasing"—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man that had that conversation with Head.</p>

I received information on October 10th, in consequence of which I went with Mr. Levey to East Road, City Road—I saw Evans with five or six other young fellows, outside the Three Crowns—I seized him, and said, "I am a police officer"—I was immediately surrounded by his companions, he struggled to get away, but, with the assistance of three Metropolitan Police officers, we secured him, and held him in a cab which was fetched, and con<lb/>veyed him to the station—he so persisted in protesting his innocence, and knowing nothing about the matter at all, that I made further inquiries—he said, "I know nothing whatever about it, I never saw him (Levey) before in my life—he had a hat, a shirt, a collar, and a tie, with boots and socks, all apparently new clothes—I said to the prosecutor, in Evan's presence, "Is there any doubt about this being the man"—Levey said, "No"—I said, "He does not answer the description of the man you gave me"—"No," he said, "he is dressed differently; but I should know the man, however he was dressed"—Evan's new hat had a Shoreditch maker's name—the morning after I had arrested him, I said, "Where did you take this cloth to?"—he said, "As I was going along Moorgate Street I stopped at Lockhart's coffee shop"—I have made inquiries, there is no such shop—he said, "When I went in two men drove up in a van, and moved the cloth off the barrow into the van, and drove away—I said, "Who are these two men?" he said, "I don't know, I think the van comes from over the water"—I said, "What steps did you take to prevent the men doing this?"—he made no reply—I have no special in<lb/>structions as to cautioning people against saying anything when arrested—about seven days afterwards I went with Sergeant Wise to Silver</p>

               <p>Street where I saw the prisoner Lemaistre and Mr. Hankey—I followed them; they entered the Wool Exchange where they parted—I then, with Wise, had a conversation with Mr. Hankey—on putting questions Mr. Hankey handed Wise this receipted invoice, and we all three went to No. 6, Falcon Square, the premises of Messrs. Diamant and Co.—we had a con<lb/>versation with Mr. Diamant, and saw four rolls of cloth on the first floor; I then went up to the third floor with Mr. Hall, Mr. Diamant's foreman, where I saw one black and one brown roll of cloth—in consequence of something I said to Mr. Hall he handed me this ticket (<hi rend="italic">referring to a roll of cloth numbered</hi> 85091)—we all went to the station where, before Hankey or Diamant were charged, in consequence of something Mr. Hankey said we sent two officers to look after Lemaistre, who was subse<lb/>quently brought to the station.</p>

I went with Murphy to Silver Street, and saw Lemaistre in conversation with Hankey, and followed them to the Wool Exchange—I had a conversation with Hankey, and he handed me this receipted invoice—we all three went to Diamant's and conversed with Mr. Diamant in the first floor front room—I saw four rolls of cloth—I said, "Those are four of the rolls"—the numbers corresponded with the numbers of stolen property—Murphy went upstairs and brought down three rolls—we all went to Cloak Lane Police Station—later on Lemaistre was brought in—on his entering I said, "Mr. Lemaistre, you know me, how about this cloth?"—the whole of the cloth was in the station close to where he was standing—he said he bought it off a man named Robertson, whom he did not know—they were all then called into the room together and charged. I told Lemaistre he would have to consider himself in custody—he said it was a false charge—Hankey said in Lemaistre's presence, "I bought the cloth off Franks and Co. through their traveller Lemaistre"—I said "I know Lemaistre as Franks and Co."—Lemaistre said, "I am Franks and Co"—I asked for an invoice; Lemaistre said he had not any, and then he said that he bought anything and sold on commission—Diamant said in Lemaistre's presence that he bought the goods off Hankey for 1s. a yard, and if he had bought it in the ordinary way of business he should have got it for 1s. 4 1/2 d.—I do not know Evans.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission agent—on October 18th, Sergeant Wise and Murphy had a conversation with me near the Wool Exchange, during which I handed them this receipted invoice—I was then taken to Diamant and Co., and from there to Cloak Lane Police-station—while there Lemaistre was brought in, and I was charged with him and Diamant with having stolen the six rolls of cloth—I bought the cloth from Franks and Co.—Lemaistre offered it to me at 1s. 2d. or 1s. 1d. I cannot remember which—I never answered that offer—I offered it Mr. Diamant for 1s.—I paid Lemaistre 1s. less 2 1/2 per cent, commission for it—he said nothing about its belonging to Robertson—I never heard of Robertson till I got to the station—I paid Lemaistre three £5 notes, two sovereigns and 1s.—I have heard Lemaistre paid the money over, but it was not in my presence; I handed him the money and went upstairs—that was in the entrance door of the premises of Diamant and Co.</p>

I have known Lemaistre eight or nine years as a commission agent—sometimes I do not see the goods I sell on commission—I have not sold for Lemaistre—I understood he was the agent of Franks and Co.—sometimes the custom is to invoice the goods in the name of the agent—Lemaistre has sold goods for me—he brought the money—he sold by sample and I took the money—he received commission whether the goods were mine or not—I have not seen my goods invoiced as his—he acted as my agent in selling canvases for £50—I have not seen the invoices—he sold them, brought me the money, and I gave him the commission—he met me at an appointed place—these goods are a job lot—I cannot estimate cloth—one shilling was a fair price because the goods were out of season—I would be astonished to hear that a man in the business paid 1s. 8d. trade price—I have not said that in the usual way they can be bought at 1s. 4 1/2 d., Mr. Diamant said it—I do not remember my goods being invoiced in the name of Lemaistre—I should not say it is the custom—it may happen if the agent sells at his own risk—I have invoiced goods in the agent's name.</p>

I will give you what you want"—she put her jacket on the area railings, and struck him I think in the face, and knocked him down in the road—he got up and she knocked him down a second time, he got up and she struck him a third time, and they fell together—he was evidently the worse for drink, but I cannot say about the prisoner—I went to Mrs. Hoffman's and came back with her—I knew her—the police were then taking Hoffman away—he was turned 51.</p>

I am one of the managers of the Electric Company, Limited, 2A, Victoria Street—on October 23rd, in consequence of information, I went to Farringdon Road, and saw a barrow in Fowler's possession on which were three electric lamps bearing our trade mark, "Robertson," which anybody could read—I told Fowler I wanted to pur<lb/>chase some and asked the price; he said 9d. each, and he could get some more—I said that I could do with a gross, and offered him 7d. each; we agreed for 7s. 6d. a dozen, and he took me to his store in Saffron Hill, which was up a gateway, and was like a shed built in the wall; it was packed with odds and ends, magic lanterns and electric ap<lb/>paratus—I saw about a hundred lamps there—he said he had not enough to make up the groan, but would let me have them—I said I would call the next morning, which I did, and while I was there the police came in—the cost price of those which he" was going to sell me at 7s. 6d. a dozen is entered in our catalogue at 3s. 9d. each, but the wholesale dealer would have a discount off—all people who supply lamps do not get them from the same factory, a great many come from the continent—I went next morning, and he had got 169 lamps—Murray was my warehouseman—I have taken stock, and am 168 or 169 short, almost the identical quantity—at present there are no lamps of ours in stock except very old-fashioned ones; we had sold ninety-four since October 5th—there is no truth in our selling dead stock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been manager close upon two years—I was moved from Stone Street to Hammersmith—there is no one more con<lb/>versant with the lamps than I am—they were stolen from Upper Thames Street; there is also an office at 69, Victoria Street—these lamps have Woodhouse and Rawson's mark on them; they went into bankruptcy three years ago; 200 of the lamps are theirs; we purchased the bankrupt stock; this is their mark, not ours—a quantity of lamps, with their mark on, have been sold recently—lamps which have been used are sold cheap, but the whole of these 365 are new—it is difficult to see whether a lamp is good till it is tried—a defective lamp is one from which the air is not completely exhausted—we generally break up defective lamps, and take the platinum out of them—it is conceivable that persons buy them cheap,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189511180067"/>
               <p>and break them up to get the platinum—I think there were a few odd lamps of Woodhouse and Rawson's on the stall—there were other articles at his shed, a galvanometer and some magic lanterns—he told me that he had been in the habit of buying electric material largely we do not manufacture Woodhouse and Rawson's lamps—the discount is 33 1/2 off to the trade, and sometimes we do it retail—these lamps might find themselves sold at 2s, 6d. instead of 3s. 6d.—we should not sell them if they were defective—33 1/2 may have been given without the knowledge of the firm if it was a small quantity—I am afraid tere is reason to believe that some servant was dishonest and sold lamps at Is. 8d.—I told Fowler before Ibought them that I should have to see them—these lamps might be sold at public auction—I did not hear Fowler say, "I should like you to go home with me and see what I have got," but we went to his house, before we went to the station—there is no test to the public to tell whether a lamp is good—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mr. Bowne's receipt for Robertson lamps at 3s. 9d. each, we are selling them at Is. 1 1/2 d. each—that is not the only instance, when there are large quantities—we have sold some lamps of this description at 8s. 6d., and some bankrupt's stock we have sold at 6d. each—I value this galvanometer at 30s. or 40s., but galva<lb/>nometers similar to this are bought for 6d. from the Post-office, to all appearance quite new—I saw several of them at Fowler's, and remarked to Sergeant Murphy that they were new instruments—I saw "P.O." on it; I did not think it was stolen—it was taken to the station, and it was found that he came by it perfectly honestly—these lamps are not per<lb/>fectly unsalable, they are being sold, but cheap—the Woodhouse and Raw<lb/>son are sold cheap, because they are a bankrupt stocks—in twelve months the number we sold has approximated 700—Murray was in our service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Fowler did not say in my presence that he purchased this galvanometer for 6d.—they have altered their type, and that is why they are sold—the 169 lamps I saw in the prisoner's possession were actually in use at the time; they are the best in the market, and are sold 9d.—lamps which have not been used may yet be defective in the manu<lb/>facture, but if they have been used and thrown into disuse, they are not useless for the purpose of lighting—I have never seen them for sale in the street before—I have never seen lamps sold at 2s. a dozen.</p>

I arrested Fowler on the 24th in a shed built into the wall at the rear of 72, Saffron Hill—Mr. Wilson was with him—I said, "I am a police-officer; I am making inquiries after some lamps which have been stolen from the warehouse of the General Electric Company, 66, Upper Thames Street; where did you get these lamps from?"—he said, "I bought them in Farringdon Road, from a man whose name I do not know"—I said, "How many have you bought from him?"—he said, "About six dozen"—I said, "How much did you pay him?"—he said, "3s. a dozen"—I said, "How many times have you seen him?"—he said, "About three times"—I said, "I am told they are worth 1s. 3d. in the trade;" lie said, "I know the value of them, I used to be in the trade"—I said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189511180068"/>
               <p>"Have you bought anything else of the man?" he said, "No"—he was then taken to the station and charged—I brought away 163 lamps marked Robertson and Co., and 198 of the others—the Robertson's were quite visible, carefully packed in boxes similar to this—I next saw Fowler on the 28th at Cloak Lane Station, and said, "The thief is in custody, you had better come and see if he is the man who stole the lamps—he went to the cell, saw Murray, and said, "That is the man"—on the further charge, I said, "Murray says he stole these things from his master, and sold them to you"—he said, "That is right"—I said You told me you bought these lamps under the hammer at Theobald's sale"—he said, "I must have misunderstood you"—he had told me that the first day, when I brought them away, but afterwards he said that he had made a mistake, he bought them of Murray—all sorts of persons keep barrows in Farringdon Street, they sell birds and sweets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He did not give me a description of Murray or of a man who answered Murray's description—he did not give me every assist<lb/>ance—the prosecutor was with me—there were some good magic lanterns there, but I was not looking towards them when he said that he bought them at Theobald's auction—there was not about £200 worth of other goods there—when Murray confessed he said that he bought them of him—they were goods which would cost a good deal more than he said he had given—when he was charged he did not offer me the key of his warehouse—I believe his man had it—he has occupied the shed about fifteen months, and pays 3s. 9d. for it—Murray lives in Arbour Square—I found these cheques which are drawn by the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in electrical and scientific instruments at 7, Marlborough Street, Grove Road—this lamp is useless, it requires three of them to go together before it is any use, and if one breaks the other two break as well, and therefore people cannot use them, there have not been 500 lamps used because of that defect—you cannot use one lamp alone, because the current would be too strong—the price of these is 3s. 9d.—I have bought lamps at Stephens's sale at 7s. a dozen; not similar to Robertson's, I do not use any of his, but I bought some of them at the gale at Olympia at 1d. each, a large number of which had never been used—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the signature of Mr. Stephens, the auctioneer's clerk, to the receipts—I have known the prisoner seven years, and have had dealings with him—I always found him honest—I bought some of these galvanometers at a sale for 6s. a dozen—they are obsolete—they have "P. O." on them.</p>

They are out of date, because they are too large—they would answer the purpose as well as smaller ones, it is wasting the public money; that is always the way with these new things—they are a little larger than those now used, they are too large, the men won't carry them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The Robertson lamp will soon be obsolete; they will not pay full price for it now—I would pay 7d.—I heard Mr. Wilson say that he had sold 700 of them this year, and ninety-four since this ease came on; he might have sold 94,000 instead of ninety-four—700 is a very small quantity—supposing Mr. Wilson is right that 3s. 9d. a lamp is the price for the most recent invention the proper price to sell at would be about Is. 3d.</p>

I am an auctioneer, and am conver<lb/>sant with electric lamps—the Robertson lamp is looked upon as not very reliable—if two or three are put in series, and one explodes, the others go out because the pressure is too great—the electric current is stronger than it used to be—the other lamp is the Brighton; there are a large number of them in the market sold at a very low figure—I have known Fowler several years, and believe him to be honest and quite incapable of doing this if he knew it—he buys largely at auctions.</p>

I live at 53, Pawson's Road, Croydon, next door to Mr. and Mrs. Wright, for seven years—I have known the family well; they have been a happy family—there have been no quarrels of any sort, and no question of straitened means—the husband was in receipt of good wages, and the woman helped besides—she seemed a very kind mother to all her children—she has complained of illness every time I spoke to her; she complained of pains in her side and pains in her head—she also complained of sleeplessness; she has appeared very ill indeed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sister of Mr. Wright, the prisoner's husband; they have been a happy family—I have seen the prisoner with her children—they were in very good circumstances—I know of no reason for this act—the boy Bertie was a favourite child, more so than the others, being the youngest—I have recently heard the prisoner complaining of pains in her head, and that she could not sleep—she did not know what she has done at times.</p>

I am a Bachelor of Medicine; I practice at South Norwood—the prisoner has been a patient of mine from August 7th till October 4th—I was treating her for troubles which occur at change of life—she suffered from excessive loss of blood at intervals and from sleep<lb/>lessness, loss of memory, and from anemia, due to excessive loss of blood—I thought she might become unaccountable for her actions—there is a distinct form of insanity arising from these circumstances, and floodings; it usually passes off in a year or so; about half the cases that go to asylums recover—it is a distinct form of insanity, rendering a person un<lb/>accountable for their actions.</p>

I live at 20, Creedon Road, Rotherhithe, and am secretary to the Rotherhithe New Road Baptist Chapel—on the early morning of November 7th I was aroused by a constable and went with him to the Grange Road Police Station and from there to the chapel, where I found a shutter had been pushed back into the chapel further than usual, and some panes of glass lying below the window inside—the window was broken—I was last in the chapel before that about ten the previous evening; the shutter was then in its proper place—I cannot swear whether the window was then broken or not.</p>

I live at 21, Streatham Hill—on August 9th I desired to engage a cook—I saw the prisoner at the registry office, she gave her name Emma Morrison—I sent her home to see my mother—she came to our house about 4.30 I fancy; when I got home she was there—my mother told her to go downstairs and ask our cook to let her have a wash and some tea, and she left the drawing room—she was in the house till eight o'clock; she came in while we were having dinner and then left—after she had gone I missed my watch and chain, value £7, which I had last seen on my bedroom table before four o'clock—on October 11th I was in a train at Croydon, when the prisoner got into the same carriage and sat opposite to me—I recognised her, and she recognised me when I stared hard at her, and she got out and ran up to the top of the train and got into another carriage—I went after her, and said, "I see you recognise me"—she said, "I never saw you before"—I said, "You must come to Streatham Hill with me, and I shall give you into the charge of the first policeman I see for having stolen my watch"—she said she could not; she had got to go to Balham—I said, "You must," and that if she did not get out I should call the guard and make her get out—when we got to Streatham Hill I said, "You can come to the house with me"—when we got to the gate she walked on and then began to run—I sent a workman for a policeman and charged her—I am certain the prisoner is the woman; I should know her anywhere—she gave me as a reference, Colonel Taylor, 109, Cromwell Gardens—there is no such name or house there—she gave a private address at Telfourd Road, Hendon, as the place where she was supposed to be staying, but there is no Telfourd Road, at Hendon—she was upstairs in our house alone that afternoon—mine is the only room on the same floor as the servants', and I had told her that when I told her the work she would have to do.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Anthony Ernest Henley. We live at 12, Park Village West, Regent's Park—on November 2nd, 1894, prisoner came between 9 and 10 a.m. to look after our little girl—we were then in apartments, while removing into a new house, and the prisoner had come for a few days until a German nurse came over from Germany—the prisoner was shown into my bedroom, and was there about ten minutes before I interviewed her—she said her mother lived at Potter's Bar, and she wanted more clothes, and I gave her a post-card, and said she could write to her mother and post it, and then</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I instructed a detective to find my ring, and gave a description of the prisoner—I had no photograph of her—I had not the slightest doubt when I saw her at Clapham; the policeman in charge said, "Look down the line;" I said, "It is quite unnecessary; that is the woman."</p>

I am a clerk in the office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies at Somerset House—I produce the file of the Alliance Financial Corporation, which was registered on March 29th, 1887, with a share capital of £100,000, in £1 shares, and £10,000 in £10 founders' shares—the statutory return for 1893 is signed by Hugh Owen, Secretary, and presented for filing by A. Roberts, 21, Queen Victoria Street, Assistant Secretary; it shows that John Grunell is a shareholder of 1,120 ordinary shares, Samuel John Capon of 250, and Henry Stewart Cooke, of 5, Bow Lane, of 1,000—the return for 1894, made by J. H. Smyth, secretary, shows that the same three persons hold the same number of shares—on September 3rd, 1895, an order was made to wind up that company—I produce a file of the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi>, Limited, which was registered on April 18th, 1886, with a capital of £2,000 in £1 shares; on August 10th, 1886, a return was made, signed by Henry Stewart Cooke, Manager, 120, Salisbury Square, E.C., which shows that 137 shares were taken up at that date, distributed among seven shareholders, who are the same persons as the seven signatories—130 of the 137 shares are share<lb/>warrants to bearer—there has been no annual return since August, 1886—on May 10th, 1890, an order was made to wind up the Company on a creditor's petition, and on March 15th, 1893, an order was made by Mr. Justice Kekewich dissolving the company, and that order directed that the books and papers of the company should be destroyed within a month—since the date of that order no such company as the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi> paper or the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi>, Limited has been registered, and no such company appears on the file of Somerset House.</p>

I am a chartered accountant, of 4, King Street—I was the official liquidator appointed in July, 1890, to wind-up the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi>, Limited—I carried on the paper for about three months, and then I sold it to Mr. Harry Seymour Foster, of 4, Coleman Street, for £250, on October 7th, 1890—while I was there I employed Cooke; I had to produce the paper weekly, I got permission of the Court to do so—there was a loss during all the three months, about £100, roughly, in that time—we only produced a small number, to keep the thing alive—it was a bad time—I paid Cooke £3 a week—he was part editor, and he used to attend company meetings, to report them for the paper, and try to obtain advertisements.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KERSHAW</hi>. That particular time was a very bad time for a financial paper—a financial paper would depend a great deal on the amount of advertisements it had in it, and on the number of public meetings reported in it, which would be paid for by the companies whose meetings were reported—in times of great financial activity, a financial paper would pay from money derived from reports and advertisements, apart from its circulation, and those are the great things it would rely on—Cooke had been connected with the paper since 1886, I believe; I cannot say in what capacity—I found him perfectly honest and straightforward, and a hardworking man—I think he did his best to keep the paper going—he got no commission—I left the paper when it was sold to Mr. Foster—I probably saw Cooke about March, 1893; I saw him from time to time—he asked me whether he could get a sanction from me to use the same name—I understood he was making arrangements to bring out a company to carry on the paper—a large sum would be required for the printing each week—I knew nothing of Cooke's position—I only know by report that he has carried on the newspaper ever since—I understood that he was desirous of having it carried on by means of a company.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant at 5, Coleman Street—I was secretary of the Caxton Printing and Publishing Company from about March, 1893, till its liquidation in June—there was a voluntary winding up, after the winding-up I was liquidator—I had known Cooke for some time, as connected with the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi>—I knew that the Caxton Company was the proprietor, of that paper, and that Cooke was general manager; Mr. Charles E.

               <p>dated March 27th, and is between the Caxton Company and Henry Stewart Cooke—it stated that the purchase shall be completed, and the Purchase-money paid on May 19th, when the paper shall be transferred to, and vested in, him, and time was of the essence of the contract—on April 27th there was another meeting, when further time was given Cooke to complete—a balance of £250 was to be secured on mortgage of the paper; the book debts were agreed later—on May 19th. 1893, there was a meeting of the Caxton Company at 4, Coleman Street, when H.S. Foster, G. D. Ingall, Cooke and other were present—Cooke paid a sum of money over in notes and gold—the Caxton Company had carried on this paper from November, 1890, to May, 1893; it was not a profitable undertaking, money was lost on it in the end—it contained reports of shareholders' meetings—after May 19th I saw Cooke from time to time about the balance of £250 due from him; the matter was put off, as Cooke was endeavouring to find someone to help him to pay it—afterwards he made an offer to pay £50 out-and-out for the paper, and my solicitor advised me not to accept that—afterwards a different offer was accepted by which he paid £50 in bills; I said I would take the bills provided a substantial person would sign them jointly and severally with him; that was about June 26th, 1894—I received this letter from Cooke (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Mr. John Grunell, the managing Director of the Alliance Financial Corporation, Limited</hi>, 19 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 21, <hi rend="italic">Queen Victoria Street, would be the co-signatory with him in the proposed promissory notes.</hi>) The Caxton Company had another paper for a considerable time, <hi rend="italic">Fashion and sport</hi>, which it afterwards sold—towards the end of its existence it did printing, and it undertook the publishing for a Dalziel's Breweries Company when it, came out—the Caxton made efforts to buy other papers but unsuccess<lb/>fully, and then it went into liquidation—I received this letter of July 6th, 1894. (<hi rend="italic">This accepted the conditions in Mr. Davies's letter of</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th inst., But said that he could not send the bills before Monday, as his co-signatory Was away.</hi>) I stamped that as an agreement—on July 10th I received these two promissory notes for £25 each, at three and six months respectively, signed by Cooke and Grunell—I did not understand what capital there was to carry on the paper—I made no inquiries of Cooke—neither of the notes was met—I have frequently told Cooke that I should take action against him and claim the whole amount of the mortgage and enforce it; and he said he would make endeavours with other parties to obtain the money and pay the bills off—I never understood him to be a man of paper, because I was merely the vendor—my inquiries to carry on the were going on up to just previous to his arrest.</p>

               <p>it could make its way—it has always been conducted by a company since I remember—when the Caxton Company purchased it they raised the price from 1d. to 6d. per week, and they spent a great deal of money in cartoons—Cooke, the manager, and Pearce, the editor, protested against the price and the cartoons—Cooke alleged and seemed sanguine that he could make it pay at Id, and without the cartoons—just previous to his buying it the price was reduced to 1d.—I did not expect that Cooke was going to produce the money to pay for and carry on the paper; he told me he was going to endeavour to get financial assistance; I did not know whether he was going to raise a company or obtain a partner, or what—it cost the Caxtoa Company, from October to December, £3,527 to carry it on—the advertisements brought in £2,842 17s. 3d.—Cooke was manager and advertisement can<lb/>vasser, in conjunction with two other gentlemen—he was reputed to be an excellent advertisement canvasser—that had been his trade, and that would help him in conducting a newspaper, if it were his own—the cartoons, if done away with, would lessen the printing expenses—for the half year his total expenses were £2,983 10s. 9d; during part of that time the sale price was 6d., and the expenses then would be greater than when it was 1d.—it could be produced very much more cheaply if pub<lb/>lished at Id. and without cartoons—the general circulation of a financial paper would not show what the financial state of the paper was; it might be making a good income though the circulation Was small—a good number would be ordered by the companies that had meetings reported in them, and so a good deal depended on Cooke himself—he Was sanguine of success—he did not disguise the fact that he would have to raise money to carry it on—I knew he had been working for weekly wages, and was a steady man, well-conducted and honest, so far as I knew and that he would have, to depend on his personal efforts to bring the paper out—from the time of the agreement to purchase it from the Caxton Company he carried on the paper, making payments out of his own pocket so far as I knew—between March and May 1893 his printing bills would amount to about £25 a week—he paid his printing and other bills by cheques on the London Trading Bank—he must have paid for printing and other expenses during that time ever £200—times did not mend; the successful days did not come back; if they had there was no reason why the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi> should not have gone back to its prosperity—it was held to be generally a honest and out-spoken paper; cleverly conducted editorially by Pearce—it exposed the <hi rend="italic">Bread Union</hi>—among its advertisers were Gregory and many good substantial advertisers—Grunell had suggested that he could finance the paper for Cooke, so Cooke intimated to me—I did not know till I received the bills that Grunell was managing director to the Alliance Company—I turned to the Stock Exchange Year Book (a well recognised book in London) to see what the Alliance Company was, and I found it entered there, and then I thought I was justified in taking Grunell's name as a joint signatory to the promissory notes—I do not always believe what I read in that book, but I made inquiries, and as Grunell was put forward as a person who who could pay £50, and he said he could pay £100, I thought it was good enough—the agreement of March 27th with Cooke only differed from the last agree<lb/>ment as to a certain sum for book debts, besides a certain sum down in</p>

               <p>cash—prior to that he had paid £52 and £23, by cheque I think; those were for two accounts Cooke had collected, and which he paid back to us—a solicitor attended on May 19th, 1893, on behalf of Cooke, and some one else who was going to finance the paper, I under<lb/>stood—sometimes a company is not registered till after allotment, and then if the shares do not go to allotment there is no registration, and the application money ought to be returned.</p>

               <p>to quote the shares—an honest paper would not put down "closing prices on Friday" when there had not been a quotation for years, or there never had been a quotation—I know a quotation has been kept in a financial paper for a month—I only made application to Grunell for the money on the two dates on which the bills fell due—I did not go personally, I sent in the ordinary way of business—when the bills matured I learnt from friends and from inquiries that the Alliance Company was not any great thing, and that Grunell's name was not worth much, and then I applied to Cooke and made no further application to Grunell—I have never been to the Alliance—I never read any of the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi> leaderettes on the Alliance Corporation.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Barking—I have known Grunell since 1889—I worked for him at 19 and 21, Queen Victoria Street—in 1893 I was there—those were the offices of the Alliance Financial Corpo<lb/>ration, Limited; that name was painted on the door—my name is printed on this prospectus as the secretary of that Company—the fact of my name being there was not hidden from me, but I was not consulted before it was put there—I knew that Grunell was a director of the Company—I knew Capon, as being at the office—I have seen the name of Odam Bell as a director, but I never saw him—I left Grunell for a time—then I met him about the middle of 1893 and asked him for a berth as I was out of employment, and he said, "Come round to me to the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi> office and I think I can start you—I went with him to Bow Lane, where I saw Cooke—I was employed there but I cannot say whether Grunell or Cooke started me—Cooke paid my wages at the first going off—Grunell said in Cooke's presence, I was to be a clerk at 30s. per week—either Grunell or Cooke said it, I cannot remember which—I accepted the offer—Cooke paid me 30s. a week for several weeks—I saw at the Bow Lane office a prospectus like this of the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi> Company printed on the back of the newspaper, and I saw my name put down as Mr. Arthur Peters, secretary—I had not been spoken to about it—I said either to Grunell or Cooke (I am very much inclined to think it is Cooke), that I had given no permission for my name to be there and I thought I ought to have been asked before it was first put there—I have no recollection of receiving any explana<lb/>tions about it—I saw two large piles of newspapers that appeared to have this prospectus on them—I sent some of them round by the office boy to the Alliance Financial Corporation—Cooke spoke to me about the number I had sent, as he seemed to think I had overloaded the boy—I have been to an office at 37, Walbrook, with the name of Bouverie and Co. on the door—I don't know who composed that firm—I have only seen Grunell and Capon there, but no one named Bouverie that I know of—the office there was a small room in the basement—I saw no clerks—I saw no business carried on there—I saw Grunell and Capon at the Alliance Financial Corporation in Queen Victoria Street—I never attended any meeting of Directors of the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi>; there was no meeting to my know<lb/>ledge—I did nothing in connection with the Company except some matters with regard to letters, and I carried on the ordinary bookkeeping of the newspaper and distribution of the accounts—on the prospectus I saw on the buck of the paper there was the name of Bouverie &amp; Co. as brokers, and amongst the directors was H.

(<hi rend="italic">This letter informed Mr. Sutherland that Messrs. Bouverie had lodged the transfer vesting</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">shares in his name</hi>).

(<hi rend="italic">This stated that the scrip for</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">shares in the "Financial World" Limited, would be issued at the next board meeting, which would be held early in November.</hi>) There was never a board meeting to my knowledge—I wrote this letter of December 1st by Cooke's instructions—he gave me this pencil draft, which is in his writing, and I copied it. (<hi rend="italic">This draft was written on the back of Mr. Sutherlands letter of 30th November, asking If the shares had, been issued, and when the yearly dividend would be paid.

Bouverie and Co., Walbrook House, London."—that is Cooke's writing—we printed 994—the delivery note for them is, signed by Capon—on July 8th we delivered 312 copies of the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi>, 1,000 of these pink slips, 984 subscribers' forms, and 194 envelopes—on July 15th we printed about 1,000 copies with the, advertisements, and pink slips—the pink slips were packed separately, but delivered with, the newspapers—on July 22nd, there was an issue of about 1,000 copies with the advertisements, and on July 24th we had an order from Cooke to repaint the issue without the advertisement—those were all de<lb/>livered at the address supplied by Cooke—we continued to print the paper week by week up to about the middle of August when £58 18s.11d. was owing—previous to the middle of August I had received a cheque, which was not honoured—that occurred more than once; the last time, we refused to print the paper—£55 3s. 5d. is owing.</p>

We always acted as printers of the paper since 1886, up to when the last bill was not paid, except a short period when we lost the order—it was afterwards given back to us without applica<lb/>tion, we were ready to take it—off and on since 1886, a good deal of money has been paid to us for printing the paper—I think we lost money before from former proprietors of the paper; I cannot say how much without referring—we were paid large sums—we were quite willing to take the printing again—Cooke paid us about £200 after he tock it over—I under<lb/>stood afterwards that he was attempting to carry on this newspaper by himself—I sued him for the £58, and I believe he paid £25 on account—our practice was to send the newspaper to subscribers in wrappers, which Cooke supplied—those did not contain the prospectus—the balance of the ordinary issue of the paper without the wrapper was delivered at Bow Lane—those with the prospectuses were all sent to. Grunell—we carried out Cooke's instructions.</p>

I am a journalist, living at Mecklenberg Square—I have been connected with Cooke for about eight years—I was editor of the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi> for some time, Cooke then being the busi<lb/>ness manager and advertisement canvasser—he managed all the business of the paper, and I did the literary part—I knew of Sir. Foster buying it, and bringing out the Caxton Company—after that the Caxton Company was in liquidation, and the paper was sold—I ceased to be editor of the paper at the end of 1893—I knew nothing about the Alliance Corporation, and I did not write about it—I attended one annual general meeting of the Alliance Corporation at the end of December, 1893, as a reporter—I was there within a few minutes of Cooke I should think—I went to report the proceedings, for the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi> but I took the report from the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi>, and incorporated, it with, the report in the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi>—I cannot say if any other journalists besides myself were there; there might have been twenty people there—Cooke took the chair, and read the directors' report from a paper; he made no speech himself, so far as I recollect—a solicitor on behalf of a shareholder</p>

               <p>made several objections—I cannot say that he said the debts were treated as assets—I adopted the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi>' report—I attended no other meetings of the company—I had my name on the prospectus of the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi>, Limited, as a director, with my consent—I was then living at 39, Lauriston Gardens, South Hackney, and was late editor of the <hi rend="italic">South London Press</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Funny Folks</hi>—no qualification was necessary to be a director; nothing was said about qualification—I, was never, introduced to my brother directors; I never met Norman Wilson, or the brokers, Bouverie and Co.—I have some know<lb/>ledge of the City—I read the prospectus—I never attended a, meeting of the company—I did nothing in regard to it—I did not know Arthur Peters was secretary—I knew him as a useful, man, the publisher of the, <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi>—I was aware that Cooke wanted, capital to carry on the paper, and that a company was in process of forma<lb/>tion, and Cooke showed me the prospectus, and I read it, and he suggested it would be a good thing for me if I were a director, because it would strengthen my position on the paper; it seemed to me reasonable, as I had been connected with the paper almost from its start—I have been; connected with journalism—directors names should be inserted to inspire confidence, that the public should be impressed by the names of men who have come forward to-be directors, and have put money into the concern—I was not asked to put money into the, concern, on I should have done so—I knew the history of this paper from the first, and that it was possible to do great things—I did not know how much Cooke had paid the Caxton Company for the paper, I knew it was not very much—I knew nothing about the financial arrangements of the paper—I knew nothing about the auditors—at times a list of share quotation was published in the paper—it was a list of market prices of the day—I read it—the prices; were got from Wetenhall's List or the latest edition of the <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard</hi>, which is generally very correct—I had never seen the the Alliance Corporation quoted in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>, but in the Stock Exchange Year Book I had; if there is no mention of a price, probably no business is done; that might go of for two or three years, and there would be no means of getting the information—the price of the Alliance Corporation shares did not attract my attention—I never saw this leaderette about the Alliance Corporation before; I did not write it, and I do not think it appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi>—I saw this prospectus, which is on the back of the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi>, in a proof—I read there "Guaranteed Dividends of not less, than 10 per cent per annum"—that bears my name—1891 and, 1892 had been exceedingly, bad years in financial circles, and there was every reason to believe that 1893 and 1894 would be good years, and the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi> had paid very large dividends in former years—I cannot explain who was to guarantee the 10 per cent.; it did not occur to me at the time, and I did not enquire whether there was any such guarantee; I assumed the thing was <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>; I had no reason to doubt it—I had seen what the paper had made, and it seemed reasonable that whatever was promised would be performed—after 1893 I believe Cooke did the work along; I was not there—I visited the office occasionally; I did not know much about t the paper in 1894—I was subpoenaed in this case; I did not go to see Cooke as soon as I was subpoenaed—after the prospectus was issued I asked Cooke</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KERSHAW</hi>. I asked him how the company was going on, about the summer—he said there had been no application for shares—this cutting is not in the same type as the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi>, and is on different paper—like many other papers, I took clippings from other papers, and introduced them into my paper—clippings are taken which are never used—this may have been a clipping taken from another paper and never used—I do not recollect anything like it appearing in the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi> and I have a very good memory for what has appeared in the paper—I was editor from about 1888—the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi> Company, Limited, was then carrying it on—towards its close that company also carried on <hi rend="italic">City Life</hi>, an expensive paper—during 1887, 1888, and 1889 the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi> paid very well—<hi rend="italic">City Life</hi> was a dead weight to it; there was no profit to it—the next Company, the Caxton, that took the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi> did not go about things in an economical way—they published car<lb/>toons which I and Cooke objected to because we thought they would not make it pay—it was carried on at 6d.—there were reasonable grounds to believe that, with good times, abolishing the cartoons, and selling at 1d. the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi> would become a paying paper—there was no reason why it should not have paid at 1d. when Mr. Foster had it—Cooke said there were no applications for shares at 5, Bow Lane—I left towards the end of 1893; Cooke was then disappointed in what Grunell had done—he told me that the company was dead, and Grunell was supposed to finance the paper from his private resources, but he failed to do so; and Cooke told me he was very annoyed when he found out by accident that Grunell had been receiving money for shares—I understood him to say that he was not aware that any money had been sent for shares, but by accident he discovered that Grunell had received money from the country for shares—that was about September or October, 1893—he said he had written an indignant letter to Grunell, complaining about it—I wept to the meeting of the Alliance Corporation after Cooke, to take a note of the meeting—we used to go to meetings, he to get orders for reports, I to take notes—at this meeting I met Cooke outside, and he said, "Grunnell wants me to take the chair"—I said, "Why, you are not a shareholder"—he said, "There may be a little disturbance," and Grunell said, "You are accustomed to the procedure of company meetings, to regulate them, and I know no one who would do so well as you, and will you take the chair?"—he only read the report, and when questions were asked him he bent down to Grunell, who told him what to say—he made no statement as coming from himself about the Alliance Corporation—I believe the paper would have paid in 1895—Cooke, in spite of difficulties, made it pay in 1895—the last issue of September 28th, 1895, would have brought in a large profit, if the advertisements were <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> and the reports were paid for.</p>

               <p>how much of this report of his statement is accurate.

Capon</hi>,"<hi rend="italic">on paper headed "The Alliance Financial Corporation," and stated that a batch of</hi>£10<hi rend="italic">fully-paid shares in the "Financial World" newspaper had been put on the market, and nearly all taken up by the directors of the Alliance, and that he, Capon, had the option of ten at a lower price than they had purchased; that he sent Mr. Sutherland his option, and would take back five of them in June, that the shares had paid fifteen per cent for several years past, were strongly held, and very valuable property.</hi>) Believing that letter to be true, I took the shares, and sent a cheque for £125 15s., which came back through my bank paid—I received this letter of May 12th. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed by Capon, acknowledging letter and cheque for</hi>£125 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and stating that the transfer would be sent next day or Monday.</hi>) I received this letter of May 17th. (<hi rend="italic">This, sighed Capon, enclosed transfer for ten shares, and stated that the shares were well worth holding as an investment, and that he believed he could get five more through Messrs. Bouverie at</hi>£13 10s,.<hi rend="italic">and that if Mr. Sutherland bought them he, Capon, would take them from him at the same price.</hi>) I would not have any more—the ten shares were not forwarded to me—I wrote asking for them—I received this letter of September 1st. (<hi rend="italic">This, signed H. Owen, stated that Capon was away for a holiday</hi>). I wrote again, but got no reply, then I received this letter of October 12th from the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi>, 5, Bow Lane. (<hi rend="italic">This, signed Peters</hi>, <hi rend="italic">stated that Messrs. Bouverie had lodged the transfer of ten shares; that the scrip had not been yet issued, but would be forwarded in ordinary course.</hi>) In answer to another letter of mine I got this letter of October 20th from Peters. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the scrip would be issued at their next Board Meeting in November.</hi>) I wrote again as I did not receive the scrip, and received this letter of December 1st from Peters. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the scrip had been prepared and would be sealed in due course.</hi>) I wrote and received this letter of January 24th, signed by Cooke. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the Secretary was away on private business; that unavoidable delay had arisen over the scrip, which was otherwise prepared, but that certain indispensable legal formalities that were not anticipated had to be complied with.</hi>) After further letters I received this document of February 1st. (<hi rend="italic">This was headed "The Financial World and signed by Peters, and certified that John W. Sutherland was the proprietor of ten fully paid shares of</hi>£10 <hi rend="italic">each in the Financial World and that the numbers were</hi> 251 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 260.) I wrote on February 2nd. (<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that he wished to sell his shares, and asked whether he could do so.</hi>) I received this reply. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that there was nothing to prevent his transferring them.</hi>) I wrote this letter on July 24th, 1894. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that as he had not received the, scrip nor any report or dividend, he should put the matter into his agents hands</hi>

I heard about Peters in a letter of October 12th; until then my correspondence was entirely with the Alliance Company and through Capon—I did not receive a prospectus at that time, and, therefore, did not know that the office for applications for shares was 5, Bow Lane, and I never came in contact with Cooke till the following year—I brought an action here against the Alliance Company for the money I had paid for the shares; it was against Grunell personally—Mr. Carritt was my solicitor, and I know he called on Mr. Cooke after Cooke's letters of January 24th and 30th to make inquiries about the shares—he did not tell me at Mr. Cooke's that he had never received the money—he had gone there repeatedly to see if he could get any satisfaction, and found the place at how Lane closed—he said that Mr. Cooke said that the money had been paid through the corpora<lb/>tion—I issued some interrogatories in that action.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Signed S. J.

(<hi rend="italic">Asking for</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for the transfer stamps.</hi>) I forwarded the 15s.—this is the transfer; it has not been stamped or registered—Capon said in his letter that he would get it stamped—later on I desired to realise the shares, and received this letter from Capon. (<hi rend="italic">Dated November</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1893, <hi rend="italic">stating in reply to his letter that there were not many shares changing hands, that it was too late for the meeting, and that the next meeting would be in three weeks, when balance-sheets would be sent in.</hi>) I did not attend the general meeting, I placed it in the hands of my solicitor—I never had any dividend or shares; I have not even seen the certificate.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SERGEANT WILLIAMSON</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I have had charge of the police enquiries in this case from the commencement. I arrested Cook on a warrant, at 2 p.m. on September 30th—I told him we were police officers, and held a warrant for his arrest for conspiring to obtain £125 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Gardner—he said, "I know nothing about it; the money was paid without my knowledge; why have you taken this step at this late date?—when was the warrant granted?—I have had a solicitor watching the case for me at the Police-court, and I have also engaged a barrister to do the same at the Old Bailey"—I made no reply—he said at the station, "Mind you make a report of what I have said; I want it to be understood that I know nothing of these frauds, I am innocent"—On October 11th I charged the three prisoners together at the Police-court with stealing Mr. Suther<lb/>land's cheque and Mr. Gardner's cheque, and money from a person unknown—Capon and Cooke made no reply—At the office in Victoria Street I saw a large number of documents and the paying-in book and pass-book of the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi>—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the minute-book of the Alliance Corporation (<hi rend="italic">several extracts from this book were put in showing a transfer of</hi> 1,000 <hi rend="italic">shares to Cooke and his election as a director and taking his seat on the Board; also of a transfer of ten shares to James Collendar when Grunell was in the chair, and</hi> Cooke was present, Grunell being generally in the chair, but sometimes Cooke.) This is the share register of the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi>—the name of Henry Wilson appears in it—there is no such person—the water mark of the paper is 1893, and it begins at No. 101—in the share register of the <hi rend="italic">Alliance Financial Times</hi>, at page 203, I find Henry Cooke, of 5, Bow Lane, entered as the holder of 1,000 shares for which £500 appears to have been paid—I find a note of the appointment of Peters as secretary, and of Peters and Co. as auditors of the Alliance Corporation—among the papers found at the Alliance was a prospectus of the Commercial Discount Company, Limited, Grunell being one the directors—I arrested him at the company's office—there was an old man named Litchfield there, and a young fellow named Smith—Owen was not there—I arrested Capon at 70, the Grove, South Lambeth—he lodged there—that was some time after I arrested Grunell—these are some of the letters I found on him; one is a draft letter from Capon with instructions to write to some of the Scotch gentlemen, also this letter, "Dear Capon, please pay into our account, by ten to-morrow morning, enclosed cheque; see Miss Peters does her 18, or I shall <hi rend="italic">stop her rise</hi>"—nearly all the letters are from Grunell—this is the call-book of the Alliance, in 1893; I find Cooke's name mentioned continually, he was an almost daily caller—I found a large number of copies of the <hi rend="italic">Financial World</hi> and some slips of copy, and among the things found at the Alliance was about 1 cwt. of these</p>

O. Bell" is Grunell—I have not been able to discover any documents at the Alliance or elsewhere to show that Cooke applied for any shares, only by the minute-book, which is not in his writing—I have no evidence that he was a director except these minutes—one document found at Capon's is a draft in Grunell's writing—the first letter to Mr. Gardner, of August 14th, is in Grunell's writing, and the next is in Capon's writing; I have found the drafts of those letters—this letter, "Pay enclosed into my bank to-morrow morning," etc., is in Grunell's writing—I think Hayter found these two agreements at Grunell's office; one is between Cooke and Grunell.
