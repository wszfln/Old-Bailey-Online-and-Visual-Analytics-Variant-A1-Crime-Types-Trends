Were you here on Monday?"—he said "No, sir; I have only come up from Yorkshire"—I said "Are you aware that you have given my daughter a base coin, a half-crown?"—he said "Have I; I will give you another one; I am very sorry," and gave me a good one—I gave him in charge; he then pulled out two good half-crowns, a florin, and four pennies—I saw no other copper—he said "Do not give me in charge: don't lock me up; I will give you my name and address"—I said that if he was an honest man he would give his name and address at the station-house—he gave his name Charles Griffiths at the station, but said "I shall give no address"—he had a muffler round his neck on the Monday, and on the Wednesday also, but folded in a different shape.</p>

I am a manufacturer of soap—on 25th August my traveller brought me this card, an ordinary business card; I after<lb/>wards got an order from the prisoner for 2 cwt. of soap, coming to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I afterwards called; he said, "I do a very large trade, I have agents all over the world;" he asked for special terms for shipment; I gave him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton less 5 per cent.—I afterwards got this order of 25th Sep<lb/>tember, 1880, and this memorandum of 30th September or 1st October—I said, "Who are the customers?"—he refused to name them—I delivered 50 casks and afterwards 30; I got this acceptance for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which has been dishonoured—the prisoner showed me a letter from, Buenos Ayres—afterwards, in November, I saw him and said, "I find the goods are not shipped; they are sold to Herndall"—he said, "They are not sold; Herndall will ship them, and I must wait three months for my money"—I went back to Herndall and to the prisoner again, and said, "Herndall says he paid cash"—he said, "Let it stand over a few days"—on 6th November the prisoner made an appointment for the 8th, but I never saw him till he was in custody—he told me he had put 12 of the sample tins, and that no one would see them; I told him it was a long firm transaction—I believed the goods had been really shipped till I found out the contrary—he mentioned that he had a customer for 7,000 casks of soap, but would not give me the name, and he gave me an order for 50 casks as a sample for that firm; he said he had not sufficient capital to buy the material; he said he would meet the bill first, his brother-in-law would let him have the money, that he was in Frederick Huth's, that he was dining with him that night, and I should have it in the morning—he then said his brother-in-law was out of town for a few days, but he must have the order for Buenos Ayres—he said, "Why not get the material on credit? If they will take bills I will</p>

Speller, Preston, and Henry—I have not got my diary here—I had no notice that I should be required to give evidence—you called at my office and sent in your card—I cannot say the date—I did not see you—I advised Mr. Preston generally on this matter—he took out the warrant under my advice, I believe on 6th November—I don't think he showed me the bill that had been dishnoured; I am not sure—he informed me that he had called upon you that morning and presented it, and that you had not honoured it—I am not aware that it is necessary to present a bill more than once—I stated that I believed you would not appear to a summons—I stated that from my previous knowledge of you—I knew that the police had been looking for you, and that you were keeping out of the way—I informed Mr. Speller that as there were a large number of persons defrauded, amongst others persons abroad, I thought it was a case the Public Prosecutor might take up—the Alderman, agreed with me, and I represented the case to the Public Prosecutor, but he refused, and the Alderman said as the Public Prosecutor did not interfere, we could not call on the City Solicitor to do so—after that I forwarded the depositions to the Public Prosecutor, but he again refused, and said he thought the parties quite competent to prosecute for themselves; it was not on the ground that the case was a City case, in fact it was not a City case, all the persons lived out of the City, only your offices were in the City—I know nothing of your affairs since you were prosecuted here in January, 1878—other cases against you have not been brought for<lb/>ward because the various persons defrauded expressed their intention of not wasting their time and further money; they were willing to come forward if the public authorities prosecuted, but they were not willing to spend more money over you.</p>

I am assistant to Charles Orblath, of 2, Weston Terrace, Stoke Newington—on 28th December, about 4.30, I served the prisoner with half an ounce of tobacco; he gave me a florin; I put it in the till without examining it—I do not know what was there—the prisoner came again about 6 o'clock for half an ounce of shag; I re<lb/>cognised him; he gave me a florin; I examined it, found it was bad, and handed it to Mr. Orblath, who said "Where did you get this?"—he said "I have just had it in change," and ran out of the shop.</p>

               <p>Hall on that day—on the 14th I met the prisoner in Upper Street, Islington, close to where he resided—he accosted me, and asked me if I was prepared to buy anything—I asked him what he had about him—he said he had two keeper rings already gilded, two not being gilded, and in order to make up the half-dozen he would get the other two ready in a short space of time—I said I could do with half a dozen—he proceeded to work—he took some tools out of a small mahogany tool-box and punched what appeared to me to be a Hall mark on two strips of metal—these are similar tools produced and these are the rings—he took a pair of pliers, bent the metal round in the form of a ring, soldered, filed, engraved, and finished them all except the gilding—we both went to the gilder's, Mr. William Pigeon, of Jerusalem Passage, Clerkenwell, who came out and said it would take half an hour—I and the prisoner adjourned to the Crown for half an hour; we returned punctually and found them finished—I paid him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. outside Mr. "William Pigeon's shop and left him—I took them to the Goldsmiths' Hall—I saw the prisoner again on the 20th—I asked him what he had to sell—he said some keeper rings—I said "We will go into a public-house in John Street," and we went in front of the bar—he there pulled out half a dozen keeper rings—I saw the mark inside them—I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there and then—he then laid "I have several signet rings already finished"—I said "I do not want them"—he said "I have a gentleman's mourning ring being enamelled in Percival Street"—I went to Percival Street, and the prisoner brought out the ring and I accompanied him home, where he torched it up—immediately he had finished it he called my attention to the stamp in the inside of the ring—he said "You see the mark has come out all right"—I suggested we should go at once to Clerkenwell to get them gilded, and we went to Goswell Road—I said to him in the Goswell Road "I will turn in here" (that was into Mr. Lane's coffee-shop)—he said "Very well, I will be back in half an hour with the ring"—it was 7.30—precisely at 8 o'clock he entered the place—I said "Have you got it?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I must go for change"—he said "he, I will go for change," and he brought back 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. screwed in a piece of tissue paper—he put the ring on the table and said "Is not that a beauty? feel the weight of it!"—I picked it up and immediately placed it on the table—he said "That is all right, isn't it?"—I said "Yes, it appears to me to be all right"—he was pointing to the mark inside the ring—I said "I have examined the three keepers and found the marks inside them"—a relative of mine was sitting at the same table, and heard and saw all that transpired—on the 21st I called at his premises in the afternoon—I pulled out a common silver Geneva watch and placed it before him—I said "I should like it gilded, and that he might otherwise do as he liked with it"—he endeavoured to pull the works out and failed—he instantly took the tools and punched the watch on the inside of the case, and also on the bowl in my presence with tools similar to those produced—this is the watch with the marks upon it—he complained of the thinness of the metal—I said I had not sufficient change, his charge being 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for stamping, and I suggested it should remain on the premises till the following day—he rather reluctantly consented—about 3 o'clock on the 22nd I entered his premises, accompanied by two officers; one was Greet—the watch was on the work-bench—the prisoner was told he</p>

                  </hi>. I am deputy warden of the Goldsmiths' Company—I have the charge of the Assay Department—I received from Davis this ring on the 11th January; on the 14th I received six keepers; on the 21st, three keepers and a mourning ring—the marks on them are identical with ours—there are four of each—the first is a shapeless mark in imitation of a crown; the second is "18;" the third the letter "C;" the fourth a leopard's head—the Goldsmiths' mark of "18" denotes that it is 18 carat gold—the letter "C" is the mark of the year from 29th May, 1878, to 29th May, 1879; the mark of the present year being "E"—the genuine mark of the Goldsmith's Company on n ring should be a crown. 18, a leopard's head, and a letter—the special mark of the Gold<lb/>smiths' Company of London is the leopard's head—on 22nd January I accompanied a policeman to the prisoner's premises—I received from the police these four mourning rings, bearing the same marks, also the seven punches produced—one punch marks "C," and all the punches match the impressions on the rings; another punch bears the mark of a leopard's head; one of the punches contains the whole of the four marks, and there is one blank punch ready for engraving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The letters in the Goldsmiths' mark are arranged in a cycle of 26 years, agreeing with 26 Roman letters—the mark is done before the enamelling—the mark is usually made on the metal when it is flat; it is possible to mark the ring as it is, but it is contrary to the usual practice—it would be extremely difficult to make such a mark on any of these rings—it would be impossible to do so with this punch—this spoon produced is brass or a base metal of some kind—I have seen similar marks; they are commonly used in the trade on plated spoons—I t is not a mark of the Goldsmiths' Company—the marks are so im<lb/>perfect on the spoon that I should not like to express an opinion—I cannot decipher it—I have seen rings marked indistinctly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The mark on the spoon is a mark frequently put on electro-plate—the first is a kind of star; I cannot describe the second; the third is like a sun, the fourth is a crown—the crown is the local mark of the Sheffield Hall in the same way as the special London Hall mark is a leopard's head—I produce a specimen of the die of the Goldsmiths' Company for marking rings—I have also an impression of the punch taken from the prisoner—the mark is frequently injured in the finishing, but it is never tampered with; it is somewhat obscured.</p>

I said "Yes"—he took the movements out and. punched on the bowl and then on the oases—I did not see what he punched—he then sent it out to be gilded—I called two hours after<lb/>wards; I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took up the imitation turquoise ring—I went again to his place on the 19th; I gave him another silver watch to gild—I saw him punch the cases and the bowl—we took it together to the shop of Frederick Warren, of 15, John Street, and we called again when the watch was gilded—on the 21st I handed him another watch; he made some marks on it—I ordered two mourning rings to be gilded—I went the following Saturday with the police and found the watch in his hand.</p>

I regret to inform you that from inquiries he has made, Mr. Bott (though innocent of any misconduct himself) has great reason to fear that Mr. Brown has misappropriated moneys or securities entrusted to the firm by you, and I write to you that you may take such steps as you may think proper for the arrest of Mr. Brown. My client and I will of course be ready to give you any information or assistance you may wish for from us, as he most deeply regrets what has occurred, and is most anxious to show that he has in no way participated in or been a party to Mr. Brown's defalcations. Yours obediently, R. S. Gregson.") I wrote to my solicitor, Mr. Lovett—I did not see Bott.</p>

I consulted Mr. Lovett upon that, and left him to inquire into the matter, and he attended on my behalf in November a liquidation meeting which Mr. Bott called—Mr. Lovett may have shown me this circular.

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Lovett and Co., solicitors for the prosecution—on or before 16th October, 1879, we had instructions from Mr. Collins in reference to this, matter, and on that day I saw Bott in his office and inquired about Mr. Collins's bonds—he said that his partner, Brown, had gone to America; I asked him when he last saw the bonds, he said "Last month," and then he contradicted that and said "I last saw them when I went to the Stock Exchange after my return from illness; I was ill throughout July, and returned to business the day after Bank holiday"—I asked for the books of the firm, as I wanted to trace the numbers if I could; he said "My partner destroyed the books"—I asked how many books there were; he said "About 18"—next day, at the meeting of creditors, I asked Bott again about the bonds; he said that he saw them last when he went to the safe at the Stock Exchange—I asked him if anybody was present; he said "Mr. Butler"—I asked when he saw his partner last; he said "The Monday before Bank holiday"—Bank holiday was August 4—he said that he had been absent through illness about a fortnight before Bank holiday, but the day previous he had said "all through July"—the meeting was adjourned in consequence of his not producing any books—I produced this cheque of August, 1879, at the second meeting, and asked him whose writing it was; he admitted that it was his—I then pointed out that he was wrong in saying that he was absent for a fort<lb/>night before Bank holiday; he said "Mr. Brown brought the cheque up to my house when I was ill"—I asked him who attended at his house, and he could not tell me the servant's name who opened the door or anybody's name at his house—the cheque is for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this cheque of 5th August, for 978<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., signed Bott and Brown, is in Bott's writing, and so is this of 5th August, for 572<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and so are these others.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. The only interview I had with Bott was on 16th October—we had been acting for Mr. Collins, and the circulars were addressed to our office—the 27th August passed, and the whole of September, and I only saw Bott in October—I made a memorandum of the conversation the same day or the next morning—my word is against his word, but I have my diary here—next day</p>

               <p>at the meeting of creditors a number of professional men represented them—Mr. Smart was there and a shorthand writer—I have given them notice to produce the shorthand notes, and they said that they could not be found, but I do not believe that is true; I do not desire to attack Mr. Smart, or any one, but I do suggest falsehood, because first they told me that they had got them, and afterwards that they could not find them—I believe they have found them, and that they had them—if the shorthand writer and Mr. Smart deny the truth of my statement that Bott said that he had seen his partner on the Monday, it is untrue—Bott did say that he saw the bonds in the safe on the Monday when he returned from business—Mr. Day will recollect it, and Mr. Lovett, jun.; it is in the proofs—Bott gave me a list of the missing books on the second day, not on the first day—he did say at the first meeting that there were a number more books, and all the dates could be given, but that the books relating to the numbers of the bonds were missing, and I think he said they were destroyed—I think Mr. Gregson and Mr. Smart said that Brown had destroyed the books containing the numbers, and I took a list of them—I wanted to trace them, and to ear-mark the bonds—not a book was exhibited to me referring to these transactions—I have a list of 104 books shown to me; they were not the books I wanted; the meeting was adjourned for me to inspect the books, and I went on 30th October and picked out what I wanted to see—if I had heard Mr. M. Williams state last night that the books were all destroyed I should have interfered—I did not hear him make that assertion; I may have been otherwise engaged.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FILLAN</hi>. Bott told me on 16th October as a fact that Brown had gone to America, and had destroyed all the books of the firm, thirteen in number—he said that he saw Mr. Collins's bonds when he went last to the safe; that would be 15th August, and I found out that Brown went away on 1st August—I do not know that at the time Bott told me that Brown was in America, he was rusticating at Cromer, or that he went away with a woman on a drunken spree—350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn out on 1st August, but I do not know that it was by Brown—I find on 28th July 368<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the executors of T.

On the day the money was paid in, there was over 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the account of Else and Bott at the London and County Bank, and since that a small cheque to Jolly—the account is closed by a cheque of Bott and Else to Miss Bott, which was afterwards deposited by her in her own name—I have not had time to search for the will, and find out that they were entitled to it—I think the 978<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. went out honestly to Mr. Weedon for Consols sold—I have not taken the pains to ascertain whether 272<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. also went out for stock sold—I asked Mr. Trice about the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will try and recollect what he said if I can.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). On 15th December I took Bott as he was leaving Guildhall Police-court, on a warrant referring to Mr. Collins's case, which I read to him; he made no reply—I went down to the cells and saw Brown, who had been committed on another charge, and read the warrant to him—he asked how it would affect</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I attended at Guildhall on 16th August, 1879, with Mr. Gregson and Mr. Bott, and Bott made a state<lb/>ment that Brown had changed a cheque in the name of Simmonds, into gold, and that there was no such customer—I got a warrant against Brown, and Mr. Gregson has defrayed the expense of going about to find him, but that was very limited—I attempted to find out where Brown had gone—I got the information from Liverpool about the two ships; that was in answer to a letter and two telegrams which we had sent describing Brown and the woman with whom he had been cohabiting—I sent her photograph down there—I found that some one answering Brown's description did sail for Quebec under the name of Welch—there was also a description of Miss Emily New, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Williams, and her photograph was sent—Mr. Gregson made every effort to arrest Brown—I occasionally saw Bott in the street and said good morning after Brown's flight—I did not go to his lodgings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FILLAN</hi>. It was to get the change that the cheque was drawn in the name of Simmonds—the charge simply was that he stole 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it came out in evidence that he had used the name of Simmonds—it is my suspicion that Brown never went to America—I believe he was at Dunmow and Cambridge with this woman—he dis<lb/>appeared about August 1, and I believe she was with him—I only heard from Mr. Gregson how Bott was deceived about Brown going to America.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I believe now that Brown did not go to America, but was in the country all the time—he gave himself up in London on 25th November, 1880, voluntarily, and the witnesses describe him as being drunk at the time—I know that his habits were inclined to drink, and that that has been a great part of the trouble of his later life.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been an accountant 23 years—Mr. Gregson introduced this matter to me in the middle of August—the petition was filed and I saw the books before 19th August—my clerk made the inventory; all the books were under my supervision—this book is a record of the things we received and the dates on which we received them—the journal commences January, 1877, and here are the day-books, bankers' pass-book, cash-book, jobbers' ledger, and name-books; the cheque-books and counterfoils were found afterwards at the office—a few books were said to be missing—I think Bott said that he could not find the name-book; I think Mr. Jacobs said that he wanted some other books; I asked Mr. Bott to let me have them all, and Mr. Jacobs had every opportunity of seeing them—I did not thwart his seeing them; the instructions were to give the creditors every information that was possible from the books, and I gave information to several creditors—when the petition was filed the list of creditors was supplied—whatever the amount of the debts was I think it was exclusive of the action of the Stock Ex<lb/>change with regard to time bargains, but I have no knowledge of any time bargains; they settle them on the Exchange themselves—with regard to any moneys owing to the firm for differences, I cannot touch them—Mr. Joel was present at the first meeting of creditors and asked questions—I did not notice that his questions were written down, but he</p>

               <p>took notes of what the debtor said—the debtor said that he had not seen the Queensland Bonds since Mr. Brown absconded—I was present at the second meeting of creditors on 31st October—the proposal of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound was refused, being unsecured—I believe something was said at the second meeting about the time when Mr. Bott had last seen the bonds; he never varied his statement time or in my hearing.</p>

I think he said that he went to the Stock Exchange safe, and found they had all gone; I cannot fix the date, but I think he said when he came back to business—by investigating a few of the books I could gather what the system was—I could not dis<lb/>cover Whether any books were missing—I have not been told to prepare a balance-sheet or to search the books for any record of the pledging of Queensland Bonds—the clerk who can tell that is not here—if goods were deposited as security for loans I should expect all parties to keep a proper record.</p>

I am proprietor of the Angel public-house, King Street, Hammersmith—on 27th of February, 1880, I saw an advertisment in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi> (<hi rend="italic">for a barman</hi>)—I wrote to the applicant—the letter was brought to me by Emma Simpson on the 1st of March—she told me she had lived with Mr. Prosser at the Globe, Hatton Garden, for eight months; and that after leaving there she had been in the service of Mr. Hinchley, who had sold his house, and that the cause of her leaving was that the business had changed hands—she then handed me these testi<lb/>monials of her character, signed J. Hinchley—she said that Hinchley was staying at the Henry the Eighth public-house, Union Street, Borough—I said I would like to see him with reference to her character—she said "He is seldom at home, being out looking for a business; I will arrange for him to call on you"—on 2nd of March I received this letter, signed J. Hinchley (<hi rend="italic">Stating that hi had seen Miss Simpson, and making an appointment between 2 und 3 p.m. to see the witness</hi>)—the appointment was not kept—next day I received a post-card appointing between 2 and 3 o'clock, and signed J. Hinchley—the prisoner called on me that day—he said his name was Hinchley—I showed him the certificate of character—he said "It is perfectly correct, this is the certificate I gave Miss Simpson; she is a very steady, trustworthy young lady; you need have no fear of leaving her should you be absent at any time; she has been employed by me, but my wife knows more about her than I do"—he remained with me a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes in the bar-parlour—in consequence of the character he gave me I engaged Emma Simpson, and she came into</p>

                  </hi>. I am a public accountant, of 7, Queen Street, Cheapside—I have for some time been acquainted with the tally<lb/>man drapers' trade—I represent the majority of the defendant's creditors, all except Mrs. McGuffie for 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two small creditors—the bulk of the debts, amounting to 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., are entered from July, 1879—the purchases from 1st July from the invoices in the defendant's possession show a total of 698<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I sold the stock for about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it had been twice dis<lb/>trained on for rent, and I am out of pocket—practically I have not had one penny for the estate—the amount of stock was not so large as I expected from the purchases—the sales for six months amount to 321<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—one round is deficient of four months, for which I make an estimate, and the total disclosure is about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the average profit in a retail tallyman's trade is at least 50 per cent.—these goods, got from whole<lb/>sale houses, ought in six months to have produced about 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he has never disclosed the deficiency of 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I can find no means of account<lb/>ing for it except from the books with the absence of names—this is my appointment as receiver on 3rd February, eight or nine gentlemen have signed it—I went to the prisoner's house at Twickenham on 3rd February—it is a private house, with the front kitchen fitted up as a shop, with a counter and shelves, and large pigeon-holes where goods can be stacked—I saw the defendant and David Mattheson, a lad of 19, who, I believe, is his nephew, and two women—I produced my appointment, and asked him for his books—he said that they were all with his solicitor—I saw two books on the counter, and picked up one, a regular tallyman's ledger—I have recognised them since, and the Magistrate marked them AC 1 and AC 2—the 3rd February was Tuesday, and they are the Tuesday morning book and the Tuesday afternoon book—this was Tuesday evening after the ordinary time of going the rounds—the one I picked up contained the defendant's writing, which I knew well—I said "Is not this one of your books?"—he said "No, that is not; it does not belong to me at all"—I said "It contains your writing, "pointing it out to him—he said "Oh yes, it is one of the books; I must have had it from my solicitor"—he then told me it was the Tuesday book—I picked up the second book, and seeing his writing in it said "Is not this also one of your books?"—he admitted that it was, and said that he must have had that from his solicitor, who he thought had them all—I took up a little black memorandum book, which he said contained the amounts calculated to Mr. Booty on which he paid his commission—Mr. Booty was called on his behalf before the Magistrate—I marked the books, and laid "I will take these two books with me," and asked him to get the others and let me have them next day; he said that he would get the others, but he would not allow me to take those with me—I said "I certainly must take these two"—he said that I should not, and told Mattheson, who was on my side of the counter, to take them from me; I held them up, and the defendant seized my arm and took them out of my hand—I asked to go through the house to see what furniture it contained—he said that it belonged to his mother, and he would go and ask her permission—he left the shop and came back and said that she would not allow me to do so—he knew me perfectly well, and knew where my place of business was; I had been concerned in his previous composition in 1871—I was then a clerk—I left, and saw him next at the first meeting, on 6th</p>

               <p>February, at Mr. Lay's office—he was asked for his books, and said that he had not brought them—Mr. Lay, the solicitor, said that he had told him to bring them—he simply replied that he had not—Mr. Haigh, the creditors' solicitor, put questions to him about the deficiency, and he said that a large portion of it was caused through a loss he had made through Turner, his brother-in-law, about 630<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it—that he put Turner into business, and he had failed, and made a composition of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—his solicitor asked him whether he did not take the chair at the meeting, and whether he was not the principal creditor by whose vote the composition was carried—he said that he was, and the reason he voted for it was that he did not believe the estate was worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I wrote him this letter on 6th February. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he was appointed Trustee at the meeting that day, and would wait upon the defendant on Saturday afternoon and take possession of his books.</hi>) I went there on Saturday, the 7th, and found the house apparently deserted, the blinds drawn down, and the door closed—I knocked well at the door and rang well, but could not get admission or any answer—he had brought his books to me on 18th February, eight ledgers—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two of them; they are marked A. C. 3 to A. C. 8, and refer to particular rounds—he also brought me a London book and a barter book—I found no addresses in the eight ledgers, and I then wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Requesting the defendant to attend on March 1st and give such information as might be required about his estate, and to bring all the books from which the others were posted.</hi>) In those eight ledgers many accounts begin "To balance," showing that they were brought forward from other books—they do not appear to be genuine books; great portions of them appear to have been written up at one time. (<hi rend="italic">Pointing them out.</hi>) He came to my office on March 1st, and I took down his answers. (<hi rend="italic">Producing a written examination.</hi>) The book containing his mother's account he said he copied from slips—that account appears to have been written at the same time—here is "Mrs. McGuffie, creditor, cash May 9th, 1876, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; October 31st, cash 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; May 9th, 1877, cash 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; September 4th, cash 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; March 4th, 1878, cash 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that is money which he is supposed to have borrowed from his mother—he was asked at the first meeting how the money was advanced to him by his mother—he said "In gold and silver"—on 22nd April I wrote him this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Requesting him to show his rounds to the bearer, Mr. W. E. James, introduce him to the customers, and offering to pay </hi>7<hi rend="italic">s. a day for the defendant's services.</hi>) I wrote again on 23rd April, saying "I also require to be informed whether or not you are now prepared to show your rounds as required by me yesterday"—on 12th May I sent a formal requisition. (<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi>: "You are hereby required to furnish me with the addresses of the customers.") I enclosed ill that the names of a great many persons who I found in the Friday book without addresses—I never got their addresses or the information I required—I should say that every street in the Wands<lb/>worth and Battersea district is numbered, and it would be easy for a tallyman to go through the streets, taking his customers in the order in which he calls—on 18th October he was taken before the Justices at Brentford—after November other books were brought to me—those found at Turner's house did not refer to any of these rounds; some of them were for the same districts, but not for the same names—I attended at the South-Western Railway with a booking-office ticket, which was</p>

               <p>found at Turner's, and got a parcel with it which contained a number of papers, and two other ledgers containing names and addresses in the defendant's writing—they have the names of some people who are in the other books, but not those in the books given up by the defendant—one is a Hounslow book, containing names which had been originally in the other book; in it is "Good debts, 258<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and on the other side is the prisoner's address—A. C. 13 is marked "Staines Book, August 9, 1878"—the account in the first portion of that book is the defendant's writing; it contains addresses—A. C. 14 begins "To balance, "but A. C, 13 does not—I have taken out the money value of the accounts in the different books—with regard to the books found at Turner's, they represent 965<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in 69 accounts without amounts; taking them slightly under the average, they would amount to 1,051<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I think three. of the books found at Turner's have the defendant's writing in them, and two have not; I think those are in Turner's writing, but I am not very well acquainted with it—the first book commences with 6th October, 1879, and the Staines book on 8th October, 1879—the 965<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is the amount of the balances at the commencement of each book—the figures are slightly different—the defendant's solicitor produced a book after Booty's evidence, which was sent up to the Court by the Magistrate direct, and I saw it next here—I have looked through it and believe the whole of it to be Turner's writing—it refers to some accounts at to which witnesses will be called—it is impossible for me to get at the amount of debts on the books when Turner became bankrupt; a large portion is subsequent to his actual bankruptcy, but over 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of 960<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in January, 1880.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Agreement of partnership of</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st June</hi>, 1879.) The partnership continued about a year—I assigned my interest to him that he might assign the whole to a limited company—the company sold the gas carburetters to a very limited extent—it was wound up eight or nine months afterwards—I entered into a verbal agreement with symes on the 4th of February, 1879, that we should work a certain portion of the patent and divide the profits equally—the circulars and cards and billheads were afterwards printed—these are copies produced. (<hi rend="italic">Announcing Symes, Mellish, and Co.'s patent carburetter.</hi>) This is a receipted bill of Mr. Adams Spencer for two guineas paid to Symes, Mellish, and Co., on the 17th February, 1879, for No. 2 carburetter—it is my writing; that bill is the billhead of the firm—I was present at the Whitechapel County Court on the 30th of August when the action between George Symes and John Russell was tried, to recover 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for goods supplied—the summons was dismissed—on the same day a summons was taken against me—I appeared on the 7th September.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Spencer Arms, Dean Street, St. George's—In-the-East—I was canvassed about February, 1879, by Mr. Mellish to have a carburetter fixed in my house—I also received circulars similar to these produced—this is the account signed "Mellish and Co."—Mr. Mellish signed it—the date "17th February, 1879," I think is correct.</p>

At 8 a.m. on 8th January I went with Lucas to Great College Street—I saw Ramsey in a public-house; I called him out—I said "I shall take you into custody, and you will be charged with two others in custody with burglary at the Camden Arms on the morning of the 7th, and stealing four bottles of liquor, some cigars, some bronze money, and some farthings"—he said "I do not understand you"—we took him to his lodgings at 10, Prebend street, which is about 100 yards from the prosecutor's house—I found in a cupboard in Ramsey's house this whisky bottle with some liquid in it—which was not whisky—in another part of the room I found 22 farthings and nine cigars in a bat-box on the table—these produced are similar—I asked him to account for the possession of these things—he said "My wife saved the farthings before she went into the infirmary; a friend at Plaistow gave me the cigars; I do not know his name nor address"—as, to the whisky bottle he said "My wife used it for medicine previous to going into the infirmary"—he afterwards said "I received most of those farthings in change for shillings"—I asked him where, and he said he did not know; he also said a sculptor in Bolsover Street gave</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 10, Prebend Street, Camden Town—Ramsey lodged with me three weeks before the 6th January—on that evening I went to bed about 10.15 p.m.—Ramsey's bedroom is on the second floor back; I sleep in the first-floor front; it is about 12 feet from door to door, and my feet are within 18 inches of my bedroom door—I was awoke by hearing strange men's voices in Ramsey's room—about 2 a.m. I listened; I heard three persons go out—I heard them say something, I could not understand what it was, but the third person slammed the street door, the two having gone out first—about 4 a.m. I heard those persons return to Ramsey's room—at 5 a.m. I heard a great disturbance, quarrelling and swearing—at 5.15 I got out of bed, opened the door, and listened—one man said "Lord blame you, what have you done with my hat, where is my hat?" then another said "Where is the other bottle, there is more bottles than those; what have you done with the other bottle?"—I found it rather chilly, and went back to bed—at 6 o'clock I was obliged to get up on account of the swearing and noise—I went to Ramsey's room and knocked at the door—he came out holding the door in his hand—I said Mr. Ramsey, I cannot have such a disturbance in my house; I have had the house for 28 years, and never had such a noise in my life"—he said they were only three friends that he had known when a soldier, and he had a right to bring in whomsoever he thought proper—I could not see in the room—at 7.20 I saw two men leave the house—I cannot recognise them, but the rear-rank one had a drabbish coat on—they were under the influence of drink—one of them said "He is a b—messer; we won't have anything to do with a b—messer like him any more; he is welcome to what he has got"—I only saw the behind of the rear man's coat—about 8.10 I received a post letter, and I went into Ramsey's room—I thought I heard female voices, and the letter was a decent excuse—I saw a similar whisky bottle to this standing on the table; the room smelt like a little hell full of brimstone—it smelt of spirits.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer of 14, James Street, Kensington—on January 20th, about 1.30, I met the prisoner, who I had known five or six years by sight—he went home to repair my boots, and had dinner with me; after which we had a pot of ale about 2.30, and about 4 o'clock he had done my boots—he is a boot-closer—I did not notice anything peculiar about him—my wife came in about 6.30, and about 6.40 the prisoner made a peculiar motion with his mouth, and his hands trembled, and then he fell on the floor apparently helpless, and I thought in a sort of fit—I had never had any disturbance or quarrel with him—I lifted him up and he seemed rather angry, and took up the chair which he had fallen off, and struck me across the head with it, and broke the back from the seat—he lifted it with two hands and brought it down on my head—I then knocked him down with my fist—he fumbled in his breast pocket while he was on the floor, took out a sheath, got up, and pulled this shoe maker's knife out of it, with which he had been repairing my boots—my little boy cried oat, "Oh, mother, he has got a knife," and he made a sort of spring from me to the boy—my wife came between us to separate us, and he stabbed her in her right arm, and then tried to cat my neck, and slightly wounded it—he got near the door of the room, where there is no hand-rail, and gave me and my wife a push, and we both went down the stairs, which are rather steep—as he was shutting the door I pot my hand out, and he nearly cut off one of my fingers with the knife—he then shut himself into the room with two of my children—my wife called for help—in two or three minutes I went up again, burst the door open, knocked the prisoner down on the floor, and took away the knife—a young man and the landlord came to my assistance, and he was secured till the police came.</p>

I said "Yes, if I can get the materials." I borrowed the materials and went to his house and did the work, and his wife gave him some money to go out, and he went out and spent the money. They quarrelled because he did not give me the money, and I remember no more. I leave it between you and Almighty God.</p>

Swindell's house nearly three years, and could furnish references for twenty years</hi>)—on receiving that.

               <p>with difficulty—she fainted shortly after she came in—both her eyes were swollen and puffy; her body was all covered with lumps, as if from blows with a fist—the left eye was much bruised, and there was a cut over the eyebrow, and a large scratch about four inches long on the cheek—that was a wound—the skin was severed—there was a number of scratches; they might have been done with a nail or a knife—there was a large lump just underneath the chin, about as big as a walnut; that might have been done either by a blow or by a squeezing of the throat—the front of the chest and neck were covered with scratches—I. should think there were 30 or 40 different scratches, all apparently done with the finger nail—the right arm had a dark bruise at the upper part, and on the right side of the elbow; those two were probably caused by a fall—there was another large bruise outside the right arm, as if she had put it up to shield herself from a blow, and had received the blow there—on the left side, just out<lb/>side the navel, there was a very painful swollen bruise three inches in diameter; that was such an injury as might be caused by a kick from a person having a boot on—on the inner part of the right thigh, just out<lb/>side the pelvis, there was a very severe bruise, about three inches in diameter; that might also be done by a kick—there were several bruises all over the legs and ankles, quite recent—I examined the woman naked in bed; the wound spoken of was not on the perineum; it was in the upper part of the thigh; that and the wound on the belly were the more serious injuries—considerable violence must have been used to have occasioned the injuries—her life was in danger; she is just able to be discharged now—she had to be taken in a cab to the police-court to give evidence.</p>

On the 2nd January about 4 o'clock in the afternoon I went with Moller to 42, Whitechapel, a common lodging-house—I went into the back-room ground-floor and saw the landlord, and asked if a man of the name of Meyer was there; he said "No, he has been, but he has gone"—there were seven or eight persons present—we were then leaving the room to search other parts of the house when my attention was attracted to the corner of the room, and I went back; a man was standing in the corner with a long coat on, and a pair of boots were protruding underneath it—I looked behind the man, and there I found the prisoner in his shirtsleeves with a coat over his head, holding it up—I took off the coat and lifted him up; he was in a stooping position—Moller pointed to him, and said "That is him"—I told him in English that I should take him in custody for having committed an assault on Mr. Orb, of 68, York Road, Battersea, on the night of the 28th—he said in English "I don't understand English"—I then asked Moller to explain to him in German what I had said, and the prisoner replied in English "I have not been in Battersea for six weeks"—I took him into the street, and handed him over to two uniform constables—he suddenly became very violent, and tried to get away, but we handcuffed him and took him to the station—the inspector said to him "Do you understand</p>

I live at 6, Sussex Street, Poplar—I let lodgings—about six weeks before the beginning of the year the prisoner came to lodge at my house—on Christmas Eve, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I saw him in the kitchen with a knife similar to this; it was a new knife, with a brown handle, and it had not been sharpened—he brought it in and put it on the table; I told him to put it away, I didn't like the look of it, and he put it on the mantelshelf—I did not see it after that day—he left the house on 30th December, and called again on the 1st January between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon—he was then wearing a hat similar to this—he left a box at the lodging—I saw the police search it afterwards; no knife was found there.</p>

On the 1st January, from 8 till 11 p.m., I was at 42, Lombard Street, Whitechapel. The landlord saw me, and I spoke to him; others whose names I do not know saw me. The landlord spoke to the inspector when I was taken, saying he saw me in his house at 11 o'clock. I then went to a coffee-shop, where I slept. I did not ask the landlord's name, nor the number of the shop; I shall have that man as a witness. I did not have this knife in my possession. I had one which I keep in a secret part of my box, a sort of second shelf, which slides like a drawer. No one who did not know the box would find it. It was a new knife; I had had it a long time. On the Thursday before this is said to have happened I took this knife and a smock to an English-man who was to engage me, at Bethnal Green. I forget his name. I remained one day and a half, but as I could not speak English well, nor he German, I left him, taking my knife and smock to a coffee-house, where I breakfasted. I laid them by me on the bench, and forgot to take them when I left. When I returned they had gone. Mrs. Kent saw me take away the smock, the knife was wrapped in it. There must be a knife in my box which has an iron knob at the end. I bought the hat one day before Christmas, in Jew Lane, Whitechapel, in the street, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. In it is an inscription, 'London manufacture,' with a trade mark. My old hat I lost going to St. Katherine's Dock. The wind blew it off. So I had to buy a new one. I never saw Moller except when I fetched my box. He came when I was taken with the police. He had a stick. They found me without my coat, as I was sleeping. Several stood before me, but I did not notice what they said, my coat being; up. I took it when I heard the police were there. It fell, I picked it up, and Sergeant O'Dea said 'I have you,' and the others rushed on me. I asked what it all meant. O'Dea said, "You know, about Battersea." I did not understand what he meant. Moller was asked to explain, but he flourished his stick and said excitedly, 'We have you now on a good charge,' and did not explain. Outside I refused to go farther till I was told what for. Then Moller said I was in custody, and I went quietly.</p>

               <p>At the station the inspector asked where I was the night before, and the landlord of 42, Lombard Street, said, 'In my house till 11 o'clock.' I shall reserve the rest of my defence till my trial, and call my witnesses then."</p>

At 3 a.m. on 30th January my attention was called by Barker to 38, Gray Street, <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the first-floor window—I watched that window with him for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I heard a noise in the room like the breaking up of wood—I heard that going on most of the time I was watching—I saw the prisoner pull down the blinds and curtains and throw them on the floor—a few minutes afterwards I saw smoke coming from the open window, likewise a flame in the room—I crossed the road with the last witness and entered the house with him—we rushed upstairs—he forced the door; I followed him in and I saw a fire on the hearth, consisting of broken furniture and portions of the blinds and curtains in flames—the mantelshelf was also partly burnt, and in the grate there were two cabbages and a piece of meat—there were no coals or coke or any fire in the grate—I assisted in rousing the inmates of the next apartment—the landlord and several children were sleeping there—I then went downstairs for water; I found some in a bucket handy and I extinguished the fire—I did not say anything to the prisoner; he appeared to be per<lb/>fectly sober—he said nothing in my presence about the fire—he gave no explanation—the other constable took him to the station—I was left in charge of the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I watched the house very carefully with the last witness, and saw the prisoner tear the blinds down and throw them on the hearth; I saw other movements in the room, but I could not say exactly what he was doing; he was stooping down—I was about 15 yards off—there was an oil lamp on the mantelshelf, a very good light—I saw him open the window—it was about half a minute from the time I saw the curtains torn down till I saw the smoke and flames issuing from the room, and it was a minute and a half or two minutes from the time I first entered the house till I got into the room—the furniture was partly burnt and there were small portions of the curtains left—I saw the trousers afterwards—there was no fire in the grate—there might have been sparks from the fire on the hearth, but no coal fire at all—the piece of meat was raw, but scorched and partly cooked by the fire on the hearth—the prisoner was standing near the centre of the room with only his drawers and shirt on—there was a fender—the things were outside the fender, about 18 inches from the grate—the burning things were on the hearthstone, and some of the fragments of the furniture on the boards—the fire was flaring up very nearly to the ceiling, so that the mantelshelf caught—I found half a box of matches scattered on the mantelshelf, not in a box—they were not in the fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of 38, Gray Street—about 3 o'clock on Sunday morning last I was called up by two police-constables—the floor was running with water and the house full of smoke; the front room door was open—the prisoner was a tenant of mine, the only lodger—when I went into his room I saw a black muss, a few sparks, and water running out of the room—there were sparks on the floor near the fireplace; I could not see the mantelpiece for smoke—the two constables were dousing the fire with water—I did not hear the prisoner come home that night—I did not see him till I went to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to bed between 12 and 1 o'clock; I believe the prisoner had not come home then—I did not hear him; he had been with me three months this last time, and previous to this about nine months—I</p>

               <p>bad him back, because I found he was a man of good principle and payment—I never had a quarrel with him; I am in the house still, and occupy his room—the side of the fireplace is very much charred—I never used to lock the door; it was dangerous—I do not believe the lock is broken, but you cannot get it undone again; I undid it with the poker one morning—my room was close to the prisoner's; there is only the plaster partition.</p>

I thought I would keep my own company; I took a walk, and met two or three friends, and hid a drop to drink. I stopped over the water till 1 o'clock, and come home between 1.30 and 2 o'clock in a cab, and went upstairs; my wife was in the room. We quarrelled, and I started breaking the things there. I tore the blinds down, and broke a chair. There was not such a thing as a poker in the room. My trouser legs being very wet with snow, I hung them on the back of the chair in front of the fire and went to bed. I cannot say how long I was there, but woke up with smoke, and ran to the window. The constable said, 'What is that smoke up there?' I said, 'The place is on fire,' and I did my best to put it out."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, having offices at No. 3, Renfield Road, Lower Kennington Lane—last year I engaged the prisoner as clerk at 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; he had a bedroom in the house where the office is—he received money on my account; it was his duty to enter the sums in a book, and also on the opposite side to enter money paid on my account—he had no authority to sign my name to cheques or post-office orders—Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GOW</hi>, of Turnham Green, is my client; he owed me money in November—this post-office order for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is not signed by me; it is the prisoner's writing; it appears have to been cashed on the following day—the first time I knew of this order was on 4th December, when the house<lb/>keeper at my office handed me the two documents produced (<hi rend="italic">A letter and envelope</hi>)—in consequence of what I saw in that letter I made inquiries of the Post-office authorities, and found the prisoner had received the amount of this post-office order—on the 6th I discharged him—I found no entry of the post-office order in this book—I asked the prisoner whether he had any papers of mine; he said he had not; I said I should look—I went upstairs; I opened a drawer; I found an envelope which had been shown me by the housekeeper—I found this letter in the enve<lb/>lope: "26, Glebe Street, Turnham Green, W. Dear Sir,—I am unable to send more than 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. this week, having been out of a situation so long, and my father having to pay some money away. Yours, &amp;c., G.
