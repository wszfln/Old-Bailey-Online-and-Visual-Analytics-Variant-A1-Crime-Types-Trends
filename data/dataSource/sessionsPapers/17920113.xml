               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. Where is your shop situated? - In Bishopsgate-street Without.</p>
               <p>Have you any partner? - No.</p>
               <p>How many persons might there be in the shop? - None, except myself.</p>
               <p>Is it a large shop? - No.</p>
               <p>You have shopmen, I presume? - I have a man and a boy; but at this time the man was getting his hair dressed, and the boy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179201130006"/>was doing his ordinary work, cleaning knives and shoes.</p>
               <p>Had not the man or boy been in the shop before you that morning? - No, I was the first in the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing when you turned your head? - The first thing I observed was the prisoner at the threshold of the door.</p>
               <p>You said you heard something drawing across the counter, I want to know whether you saw any thing? - I saw nothing but the prisoner on the threshold of the door.</p>
               <p>I think, if you heard somebody drawing something off the counter, you would naturally look round? - That caused me to look round.</p>
               <p>And what did you see? - I saw the prisoner at the threshold of the door.</p>
               <p>At the same instant you saw the prisoner at the door you saw linen on the threshold? - No, I did not see the linen till I came out.</p>
               <p>Had there been any body in the shop in the course of the morning before? - No one, because I had opened every door myself.</p>
               <p>Had you opened any Irish? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Then it was packed up? - It was; it was not left open, it was bound up with paper on the outside of it.</p>
               <p>Probably you bought a greater quantity than that? - The day before I bought two pieces.</p>
               <p>Had it been opened at all since it was bought? - It was opened the day before, to see what it contained.</p>
               <p>It had not been opened that morning? - No.</p>
               <p>Then what it might contain in the morning you only suppose from measuring the night before; was there any mark on it how many yards it contained? - There is the mark on it now.</p>
               <p>And you put the mark there? - I marked my own private mark on it.</p>
               <p>Did you mark how many yards it contained? - This piece of Irish, which was stolen, is one that had been dyed, and afterwards calendered, and it is the business of the calenderer to mark the quantity of the yards on it which it contains.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not mean to say that you yourself the night before had observed any mark upon it; you cannot swear to it? - Yes, there is my own private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The first that you saw of it, after you came out of the shop, was on the pavement? - It was.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you know the prisoner before? - No, never saw him before, as I know of.</p>

               <p>I remember being on the river the 2d of January last, about half after seven or eight; we went out, and in rowing up the river, one of my men said, master, here is a towing match; I turned, and saw a boat at a distance, and there were the two prisoners drawing a ship's boat; I am sure of the prisoners, I knew them before; I went close to them; we secured the boat, and pursued them, and never lost sight of them; Willis had the rope over his left arm, Bailey was pulling the sculls; when I saw him come so close, I saw him chuck the rope from his arm, and away they rowed; I pursued them as soon as I could wind the boat round; I never lost sight of them till they shot round the tier; then I saw Willis jump out of the boat, and I lost sight of him all at once; I then pursued Bailey, and there was a boat stopped; I am conscious he is the person; one of the other witnesses brought Willis all over wet; there were sixty odd heads of hemp, that is, six hundred and a half in all; the boat had the name of Eliza on the stern.</p>
               <p>Court. Has Comyn seen that boat since? - He saw it the next morning.</p>
               <p>Court to Comyn. Was the boat you saw the next morning the boat you lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner Willis's Counsel. Have you been long used to the river? - Yes, ever since I was nine years old.</p>
               <p>Sometimes you pick up a boat on drift? - Yes; then we take her and secure her to the nearest place.</p>

               <p>Court to Vannest. I understood you to say that there was nobody dined with you on Saturday but yourself and your brother, but I find I was mistaken, there was another man? - Yes, there was that man, and my brother, and myself: this man came up to my room about one or two o'clock, and I asked him to have a bit of dinner with me, as he was not well.</p>
               <p>I understand you wash for him? - I do.</p>
               <p>When had you seen him before? - I see him every day when he is not at work; he often calls up to my apartment.</p>
               <p>Did he dine with you the day before? - He came up stairs, and I asked him if he had had any victuals; he said no, and I told him to go to the cupboard and get some.</p>
               <p>Does he frequently dine with you? - Not always, only sometimes.</p>
               <p>Does he pay you for his dinners? - He does not pay me, because I looked upon him as a man that pays me for my washing, and I give him victuals when he is out of work.</p>
               <p>When did he dine with you since? - He has had victuals up in my room several times.</p>
               <p>Has he dined with you since that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When? - Last Saturday, for the last time.</p>
               <p>When was the next time, after that Saturday, that your brother dined with you? - On Monday, please you, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Did he dine with you on Christmas-day? - He did not; he dined with me on Monday following.</p>
               <p>Did your brother dine with you on Christmas-day? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did any body else besides? - No.</p>
               <p>Did your brother dine with you on Monday? - He did.</p>
               <p>What had you for dinner on Saturday? - To tell the truth, my Lord, we had an Irish stew, made of mutton and potatoes.</p>
               <p>That was your Saturday's dinner, on Christmas-eve? - It was, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What had you on Sunday? - A bit of roast beef and a plumb-pudding.</p>
               <p>That was the day that this Stack did not dine with you? - It was.</p>

               <p>Court to Palmer. You never gave him leave to carry any of your pots away? - No, my Lord, except when he was to work at a building near, and then I expected them back again.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman in Cornhill ward: on the morning of the 31st of December I observed something at the warehouse of Messrs. Fenn and Rothwell; as I came to Newman's-court, I looked down the place, and saw three men at the pannel of the door, at the window, very busy; I saw one of them stretch his arms up, and take the pannel of the door, and lay it on one side of him; the glass of the door was covered with this pannel; I saw another man stoop his back, and stretch his arms in, and take something, the glass having been cut; I did not see it cut; I saw a hackney-coach on the rank, in Cornhill, fronting the place that was broke; I saw a man go to the coach immediately; I did not see him open the coach, but he went and immediately returned to the house again; I made up as fast as I could, and when I was within a few yards of them they made off, and I close to them; I was about as near as I am to you, about five yards distance, going cross Cornhill; two of them slipt on one side, on my left-hand side; I kept my eye on the one, I did not offer to turn after these two, but kept my eye on the third, and kept pursuing, and struck my rattle, and laid hold of him, and brought him to the watch-house; that is the man, in the blue coat, the prisoner; he was never more than five yards distance; he got on the flag-stones before I did, and then he walked.</p>
               <p>Was the man you took by the collar ever out of your sight from the time those three ran from the house? - No: I have not the least doubt but he is one that ran from the house; I took him to the watch-house, and told them to take care of him; Mr. Williams is the constable; I told one of the watchmen to give the alarm to the house, and went and rung.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him, or do you only believe? - I only suppose he did: I have got the crow; Rhodes gave it to me. (Produced.) It has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was you the same side of the way, or the opposite? - On the same side.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179201130020"/>You saw nothing taken away? - I saw something in a man's hand, but could not tell what it was.</p>
               <p>The coach was not open, nor you did not see any body open the coach? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you search this man? - I did not, nor was I present when he was searched.</p>
               <p>You paid no attention to the persons who went down to the left side? - No, none at all, I only minded the person that was before me.</p>
               <p>How far was you from your watch-box? - There are no boxes in the ward.</p>
               <p>Court. Which side of Cornhill was this warehouse? - On the North side, opposite the stand of coaches.</p>
               <p>Did you try the fastenings that night? - It was not my beat; there are twelve watchmen, and they all go round the ward.</p>
               <p>I think you said this was not your beat; what brought you to this spot? - I did not try the pins in that part, but it is all my beat, I go all round the whole ward; there are twelve watchmen, and they go round five minutes after each other, but I have but one part of the ward to try the fastenings, and where I try them I call my own beat; this part happens not to be in my beat, therefore I do not try the fastenings.</p>

Mr. Williams and another came and searched me; accordingly, after that, they took me to the Compter; that evening they asked me how I came to be out so late; I related the story as before;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179201130022"/>I told you he asked me what trade I was; I told him I was brought up a cabinet-maker, but having an asthma I was obliged to leave off business, and I took a chandler's shop in the Borough, and from that I took this public-house in Half-moon alley, always endeavouring to maintain the character of an honest man; and even since I have been in this calamitous affair, I have reduced myself to the last shilling to pay every thing that I owed. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am entirely innocent of the thing laid to my charge: I will call a few friends, who will speak what they know in my behalf; and I leave myself at your mercy.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. How long had the persons that you supposed to be the prisoners been about your shop? - They had been an hour or an hour and quarter.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you spoke to them during that time? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You went out, perhaps, to tell them to get away? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Then you put out lights in expectation that a felony might be committed, and you would observe them? - I did.</p>
               <p>Pray has it ever happened to you to be in a Court of Justice on such an occasion as this? - No, I never was.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you do not know that there is a reward on the conviction of the offenders? - I do not know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether there is any reward on conviction of either or both of these persons? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that it has not been represented to you, that there is a reward, by the officers? - They did not; I will swear it.</p>
               <p>You mean to swear that you never heard of any such thing? - I may have heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that you never heard that there was a reward on conviction of persons who are charged with the crime of burglary? - I never had occasion to inquire into such a thing.</p>
               <p>Who gave you the instructions for the indictment to be for a burglary? - I gave only instructions according to the truth that I know.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long have you lived with Jacobs? - Above a month.</p>
               <p>Do you live with him now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say that you stood at the end of the counter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far is the end of the counter from the window? - About a yard, or rather better.</p>
               <p>You never saw them before? - Not till they stood about the window.</p>

               <p>What business is it your master carries on? - He keeps a chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived with him? - Off and on, I believe, two years.</p>
               <p>How many houses does he keep to let out in lodgings? - Seven up the court, and eight more, fifteen in all.</p>
               <p>What is the price of a bed? - Sixpence, and sometimes a shilling.</p>
               <p>How near was you to the prisoner when you first saw him? - I was eight yards from him.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - I am eighteen.</p>
               <p>Is there any lamp near where you first saw him? - There is one up the court, and one at the bottom of the court.</p>
               <p>How was it you could see this man's face so as to know him? - I had a light, and they had a light, I saw him by their light; these two men came up the court, and passed e.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to him? - I did not, but I know him very well; they used to call him Dan the Barber.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not you witness against two people last sessions? - Yes, I was.</p>

             robbed me of my buckles; I had put my buckles into my pocket again, but he made me let go my hold, and pulled out a knife, and cut me in both my hands, and cut me up here in the jaw, and gave me several stabs on both sides my head; they left me in a poor condition; I halloo'd out to the watchmen several times; at last they came, and I gave him up to them: here is some of your handy works coming out now (turning to the prisoner), here is my shirt I had on that day, all bloody; the watchman took charge of him, and brought him to St. Giles's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Did he offer to run away? - He did not offer to run away; the two others made off, but he could not go, he was kept; I held him; he could not cut me out of him.</p>
               <p>Then the only person you got hold of was the prisoner? - Yes, and he was carried to the watch-house, St. Giles's; I went to the watch-house with him; I never found a pennyworth again; nothing at all was found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>When had you looked at your watch before you came into this fray? - I cannot safely say; I had my watch and money, and buckles, and all, in my pocket, a minute before this happened.</p>
               <p>How came you to be in this Parker's-lane this time of night? - I was coming from Drury-lane, and I was going into this house to get a pint of beer to nourish me, as I was passing by; I had no companion with me.</p>
               <p>Was this house a house that you had used to frequent? - No, never was in the house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179201130031"/>before, nor in the street, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How came you to have these buckles in your pocket? - When I was coming to London, I had my buckles in my shoes the Sunday before that, and I never thought of it till I had come to London; I live at East-Ham.</p>
               <p>Where was you going in Parker's-street? - I was coming up to Gunpowder-alley, No. 5, to see an acquaintance of mine.</p>
               <p>Had you no buckles in your shoes then? - Yes, I had what I wear every day; but in the morning I did not know that my silver buckles were in my pocket till I came out part of the way; when I came to the watch-house, the watchmen carried me to the hospital; I had never seen the man before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did he appear, when he spoke to you, to be drunk or sober? - He seemed to be sober; and I was quite sober, no way in liquor at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have several questions to ask him: pray, Sir, did not you come into this house with a disorderly woman? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to my taking the buckles out of your hand? - I can.</p>
               <p>Did not you swear that you offered the buckles to several people in the house, before the justice? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Now mind what you are at: Did not you say first to the landlord, will you take these buckles into pawn for the reckoning for me and my wife? - I did not say such a word.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Would you ask him any thing else? - Prisoner. Ask him! it is of no use to ask him, he had his tale all ready before he came. Pray did not you say, when you catcht me hold by the collar, d - n your eyes, I will have satisfaction of you for the money? - I did not.</p>

               <p>What was this cry in Parker's-street, Drury-lane? - It was; I was in Cross-lane; I went as fast as I could to them, and the prisoner gave the first charge; and I saw this man all over bloody: I took them both to the watch-house, and the prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoner; the prisoner only gave charge, but did not say for what; the prosecutor charged him with robbing him of a pair of buckles, some silver, a watch, and a hat; he had no hat on; I only took them both to the watch-house, and took the prosecutor to the Middlesex hospital by order of the watch-house-keeper; I went for him next day to the hospital, to take him to the office.</p>
               <p>Did you, on the prisoner being charged by the prosecutor, search him? - We did, but found nothing on him but some silver in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I tell you that I gave charge of this man when you came first up? - Yes, you did.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to Prosecutor. Which way did I take your buckles and watch? - I cannot swear you took the watch, but I can the buckles.</p>

               <p>Was you with Mrs. Whitney? - I was; I drove the cart: as I was driving off the stones, my mother said, there are some boys behind the cart; I looked round, and saw this man get off the tail-board of the cart; I had a full view of his face; then he stood about three minutes, looking at us; I looked at him all the while the cart was standing, and my mother called out she was robbed, and a little boy came up and told her there had been two people behind the cart; this was directly as the man was run off; I had seen one on the tail-board before the little boy came up; then they told me to turn the horse round, and stop at the Rotation-office, where she gave information, and we came home; and she went again back that night, and I went with her.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had your cart a tilt upon it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see any body that night? Yes, I saw him at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Now be cautious, and speak not rashly; did you, when you saw him at the watch-house, was you sure it was the same man, or did you believe it because other people said so? - I know him from his own person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Before you went, a gentleman came to tell you the man was taken? - Yes, we went to him into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>And the man was brought to you; and the man you expected to see was brought to you?</p>
               <p>Jury. We consider it only as the evidence of a child, Mr. Garrow, and you should not try to draw things from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There was no intention to draw any thing from him but what is the truth; you do me great injustice to suppose me capable of doing any such thing; but it is my duty, and the duty of every one else, to get at the fact: however, gentlemen, it is in your hands, and much good may come of it.</p>
               <p>Court. When you went into the watch-house where he was, was any body else in the watch-house? - Yes, I picked him out; he was not shewn to me.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; Thompson called me out of my house to come and assist him in securing the prisoner; directly after, there was a whistle given; I run round, and sees the prisoner run very hastily along the bottom of the yard, and went out through the posts towards the Lower-street, and about ten yards from the posts Thompson struck the prisoner on the head, but not so hard as to hurt him much; I did not lose him; I followed him; and directly as I came up, Mr. Manton had got him; Mr. Manton was standing just at the corner of a field, going down to Cannonbury-fields; from the time I first saw him it was not above two minutes before he was taken, for he ran very violent and fast, and I ran up to Manton immediately.</p>
               <p>Had you observed his face? - I had not seen his face till the time I came up to the corner; he had a white jacket on, with sleeves; I did not see any person there, except the prisoner; I did not see him throw any thing down, I only saw this man running hastily out of the church-yard, and the watchman after him; and when I came up to him, he appeared almost so out of breath, he could hardly speak; the last witness followed him as fast as he could, but by calling out stop thief he was winded.</p>
               <p>Did you pursue the same man as Thompson did? - I did, and the same man is the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court to Thompson. Were there any blows passed between you and the man? - Only I struck him once; the prisoner was the foremost man, and the man that threw the things down, and the man that I struck; when I pursued, Tramble pursued too, and ran quicker than I did; I was quite spent by running and hallooing.</p>

               <p>I am the beadle; about six o'clock I heard the cry of stop thief! and I saw the prisoner running, and I ran about thirty yards, and caught him, from where I first saw him; he appeared to have ran as far as he could run; he was very much agitated; I delivered him to

             spoke something to Mr. Sadgrove, that was the man that came to fetch me, while I was searching the manservant, and he followed her out; and soon after they came in, and brought me in this little book (a book produced), and the note was tied up in it; I have kept it ever since.</p>

               <p>On the 7th of January Mr. Chadwick came to me, and desired me to step with him, for he was ruined; immediately I went with him, and Mr. Chadwick took me to Mr. Bond, and he granted a search-warrant; Mr. Bond said to me, run and see if you can find a constable; I immediately ran to Chelsea, Sloane-street, Sloane-square; I found Mr. Burridge, and begged of him to come up with me to Justice Bond; Mr. Bond produced the warrant, and he says to me, Sadgrove, I advise you to go with the constable, and see it served; and so I went with the constable to Mr. Chadwick's house, and Mr. Chadwick was in the garden when I came; and he came, and we went into the fore-parlour together; and then the constable came, and knocked at the door afterwards; and then Mr. Chadwick had his servants into the room; and after the maid had come up, he said he had missed, or lost, I cannot tell which, a Bank-note of 50 l. and he had a search-warrant, and there was the constable, and that they must both he searched; the constable began on the man-servant first; he pulled off his coat, he searched it all over, and then his waistcoat, I believe, and then his stockings, and he was searching them; and by this time the maid-servant was disposed, as I understood her, either to speak to me, or her master; I immediately took more notice of her, and comprehended that she wanted to speak with Mr. Chadwick; I turned about to the prisoner, and said, what, do you know any thing of this? she said faintly, yes, I have got it; Mr. Chadwick and I and she went into the passage; she immediately fell on her knees when Mr. Chadwick came out, and gave me a little book; and Mr. Chadwick went and told the constable, to prevent his searching any further, and he came out, and I delivered this book with the note.</p>
               <p>Did you open the book before you gave it to Mr. Chadwick? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you see it opened? - Yes.</p>

               <p>When was it opened? - Immediately, in the parlour; the 50 l. Bank-

               <p>I live in Cartwright-square, East Smithfield, a woolcomber; I know one of the prisoners perfectly well, Larter, these seven years. Larter called at my house the 2d of October, and he asked me if I would go to his house with him; I went, and when I came there I saw Matthews, and they shewed me a piece of printed callico; and I asked Larter, in the presence of Matthews, who it belonged to? Larter said, it belonged to that person. I asked who Matthews was, and whether I could purchase it safe? Larter told me, I could; and that he was a very honest man. I gave Matthews the money myself, 40 s. for twenty yards in one piece; I paid to Matthews 40 s. and took it away with me. I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179201130047"/>Larter in the course of the week; he called with the fellow-piece to that I purchased; he left it on the Sunday morning following, they both came to my house together, that was twenty-one yards; they called to be paid for the piece left in the week; I paid them two guineas for it; I believe Matthews took the money. In the course of five or six weeks, from the 2d of October, I purchased nineteen fine pieces of printed callico, containing twenty-one yards each, and three coarse ones, containing about twenty-eight yards; they laid by me for a month. I also in the course of the same time purchased twenty pieces of nankeen, all brought in the course of that time; Larter, on the week I bought the twenty pieces of nankeen, brought eighteen of them on a week day, and on the next Sunday Matthews himself called at my house, and he asked me if I had had any nankeens brought me by Larter? I told him, I had eighteen; and he took two out of his pocket, for which I paid 7 s. for the two pieces. I paid for the eighteen after the same manner, and he told me I might call at Larter's house, and pay him for the eighteen; I called on the same Sunday in the afternoon, and paid at the same rate, 3 s. 6 d. a piece; likewise for a handkerchief Larter left at our house, containing a piece of bed tick, a bit of plain callico, and two striped pieces of cotton, red and white small stripe. I did not settle for them four little articles. I had all the nankeens by me that I bought, except two pieces, that were pawned; the nankeens ran about six yards a piece; the twenty pieces were all separate pieces; part were pledged to Mr.

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoners Counsel. Mr. Sims, while I ask you a few questions, instead of looking down at your hat, look at the Jury. You are a wool-comber? - I am.</p>
               <p>A master or journeyman? - A journeyman.</p>
               <p>You wanted to sit up a journeyman's room elegantly? - It was not like that.</p>
               <p>You had very good goods to fit it up with? - They are good.</p>
               <p>The first thing you knew of this was on the 2d of October? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was a large parcel, Mr. Sims, was not it? - It was not such a great quantity.</p>
               <p>Not such a great quantity for a poor journeyman woolcomber to lay hold of! Had you been much in the habit of purchasing these sort of goods? - Not in the bed furniture; nevertheless I have bought several articles belonging to women's furniture; and my wife goes into the country every Spring to sell them.</p>
               <p>You hold with doing this of a Sunday? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was not you a little surprized that you should have so good a bargain on Sunday? the better day, perhaps, the better deed! Don't you know that you are liable to be tried for having these goods in your possession? - It is very possible it may be so.</p>
               <p>Do you not know that you might have stood in the very same situation as those two prisoners do now? - I do not understand that; I was never taken out of my house.</p>
               <p>You do not know that you might have stood there, it was a trying time, it was necessary to squeak, so you continued buying on; you knew that the people were not in trade? - I did.</p>
               <p>That is another secret? - If I had chose to have bought, I might of the same person.</p>
               <p>When did you stop your hand? - I forbid Matthews the last time he came to my house; and I met Larter in the street, and told him never to come to my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was any thing found on you? - No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Any thing found in your house? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Any prosecution instituted against you? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Is it true what you have been telling them? - It is true.</p>
               <p>Court. You said just now, you had not been taken out of your house, were you taken any where? - I was not.</p>

            ; I know the two prisoners at the bar. Larter came to my husband to go to his house; my husband went; and when he came home, he brought home with him a piece of printed callico, and told me, he gave 2 s. a yard for it, and brought me twenty yards. In the course of the week Larter brought another piece. The first time he came was on a Sunday; the piece he brought after was the fellow-piece to the first. Both the prisoners came frequently backwards and forwards to my house, and my husband bought goods of them. He bought printed callicoes, and he bought some nankeens.</p>
               <p>What became of those two pieces of nankeens which were bought in the manner you have described? - They are sold.</p>
               <p>Did you carry any to Arthur's? - I pledged two pieces, and after that they were got back again; then all the callicoes were sold to

               <p>Why, this was not made of wool? - But I go into the country sometimes.</p>

               <p>If you have goods in your possession that are a little suspicious, would not you try to get rid of them as soon as you could? - I don't know; I have nothing to say in the matter.</p>

               <p>So you knew at the time you was offending him that ordered the Sunday to be kept holy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You knew you was liable to answer it, if you was found out; now, by giving your evidence, you are sheltered and protected? You know no harm will be done to you now, now you have given your evidence? - We only speak the truth.</p>

               <p>I am in the dry saltering line; I am acquainted with the witness Sims. About three months ago Mr. Sims came to me one morning for some money that was due to him, and told me that he had some pieces of printed furniture, that he had sold.</p>
               <p>What did you receive from Sims? - I received two double pieces, and after that four or five, and a piece of blue damask, and some inferior printed callicoes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoners at the bar, or either of them? - I believe I have seen Larter at Sims's house. I sold the articles I bought.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long have you known Mr. Sims and his wife? - About four years.</p>


               <p>Four years you have had dealing with them? - No, not above two years.</p>
               <p>What business are you? - I am a dry salter.</p>
               <p>What articles in the dry saltering are these printed cottons? - None at all; but if you will give me leave I will explain myself. Sims came and told me, he had some very excellent bed furniture, that he could pawn for six guineas, and I gave him six guineas for them.</p>
               <p>Perhaps if any body had brought you a little silver, you would have bought it, perhaps a few diamonds, you would have considered it all in the dry saltering business? - Quite out of my line.</p>
               <p>A little gold plate, that would have been in the dry saltering line? - If I had understood them, I should. I think a man of dealing has a right to buy any thing he can get any thing by.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to East-Smithfield: on the 17th of December, I, in company with Mr. Oakley, apprehended Matthews; on Monday I went to the house of Sims; I found nothing there; I secured Sims; I was coming away after we had made the compleat search, and he desired me to step up stairs with him; Mr. Sims lives close by me, and I have known him for some years; the first question he asked me was, if that was the gentleman that had been robbed; I told him yes; he told me that he thought it some of the property he had imprudently purchased, and that what he could recover back, he would do; I advised him so to do; and then his wife came up stairs: afterwards we went that evening to the house of Larter, with Mr. Oakley; we searched his house, but found nothing there, nor him; at length we took Larter in Fenchurch-street, and secured him, and took him in a coach; and he said, what is all this about? if I tell all I know of this, when they get hold of Matthews, they will hang me with him.</p>
               <p>Did he tell him it would be better for him so to do? - He did not: I then told him, that, as he had mentioned the name of Matthews, Matthews was already in custody; he seemed to disbelieve that, and said, that if he could be convinced of that, and be secured, that then he would give evidence; I told him it did not become me to make any promises of that sort, Mr. Oakley had better talk about that; by this time we came to the bottom of the court, where Mr. Oakley was waiting for us; then, when we came to the end of the court, we took Mr. Oakley up, and a friend of his, and went to the King's-arms, in East-Smithfield; when we arrived there, the magistrate was gone, and the prisoner Matthews was committed for re-examination on Thursday: I put Larter into the parlour; Mr. Oakley, Mr. Rooke, and myself, with him; and there the prisoner Larter (Sims was not with us then) said to Mr. Oakley, if he would give him a general release, he could give sufficient evidence against Matthews, which would convict him: I put Larter in the watch-house that night, and the next day I had him before the magistrate, and he was remanded for re-examination with Matthews: on Thursday, Matthews and Larter were examined again at the office; the things were produced from Sims, the nankeens, and one piece, when it was shewn to Mr. Oakley; then the prisoner Matthews said, yes, but they are not Mr. Oakley's nankeens.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have been acquainted with Mr. Sims for some time? - I don't know that ever I spoke to the man in my life, except How do you do? when I pass.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Sims's house before you saw Mr. Oakley? - I did not; and, in fact, I went with some degree of reluctance; for I had that opinion of Sims, that he would not receive such an article; I know Mr. Rooke very well, and, having seen them together, I thought he was a very creditable man; and I understood of Rooke, that this man Sims worked for him.</p>

               <p>I was in the shop; it was near six; there were two young men came into the shop, to cheapen some powder-puffs, and he did not agree about the price, and they went out of doors; and as they were going out of the door, I saw the prisoner with the muff in his hand; it had been in the window; he was just out of the door; he had it under an handkerchief; he was not the man that cheapened the puffs; I watched them both all the time, and yet I did not see him take up the muff; I never was more surprized in my life; I cried stop thief! and stood at the door till he was brought back again. (The muff deposed to.) I am sure the prisoner is one of the men that was in the shop.</p>

I persuaded him to go home where I live, in East Smithfield; and I unbuttoned his jacket, and the blood flew out all over me entirely, as there was no vent for it before; I scraped some flue off his hat, and got some cobweb to stop the blood till morning; and then I sent for a Doctor, and he said, he was a dead man, and advised me to send him to the London Infirmary. I saw him several times at the Infirmary; he lived till the 17th of December, about three weeks ago, and then died. He never was like the same man afterwards.</p>

With that, the watchman was called, and I was given charge of, and I gave charge of them, and we went to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>I am surgeon to the London hospital. I saw the deceased in the hospital; I found him with a wound on the left side between the second and third ribs; it penetrated into the cavity of the breast about three quarters of an inch wide; appeared to have been made with a cutting instrument. I judged it to be highly dangerous. I believe, after he had been two or three months in the hospital, he went into the country for better air, at his poor mother's, by Stamford-hill. He became somewhat better, then he relapsed again, and was re-admitted into the hospital. He went out again, and I think this was the case three times. The last return might be about a month before he died; but he never in my judgment recovered from the injury he received; and I am obliged to say, that I have no doubt but he died of the wound he first received.</p>
