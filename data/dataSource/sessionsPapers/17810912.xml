I felt a person about my pocket; I immediately put my hand down towards my pocket, and felt that person's hand: I struck the hand, which was close by my pocket. I immediately turned round, and saw the prisoner standing close to me: she was the only person that was very near me. I immediately charged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120003"/> her with having stolen my handkerchief, which she denied. Upon putting my hand into my pocket, I found my handkerchief, but missed my snuff-box; this is it (producing it). I then told her she had not got my handkerchief, but had stolen my snuff-box. I seized her left-hand immediately, which I had before seized; she had drawn it from mine, and had put it behind her, under her cloak; she put her other hand behind her, and seemed to be shifting something. I laid hold of her right-hand, keeping the other fast in my hand, upon which I heard something drop on the pavement; I looked down, and saw it was my snuff-box: I kept fast hold of her. I called a hackney-coach, and get another person to go in the coach with me, and we carried her to St. Martin's watch-house. There was a croud immediately after I secured her, but there was no other person but the prisoner near me at the time it was taken out of my pocket.</p>

            , the footman, gave me information that the lady had been robbed by a man in a brown coat with a flapped hat, riding a bay horse with a cropped tail, and that he was gone through Hampton-gate. Upon this information, I pursued the man: at Hampton-bridge, he seemed to make an attempt to go over the bridge, but he rode back. I heard of him at Hampton. He had put his house into a shed of a public-house: I saw him on foot, about fifty yards from that house, in Smokey-lane: as he was going towards the public-house where he had put his house, I secured him. The people at the public-house said there was a horse in the shed, but they did not know whose horse it was; I saw the horse; it answered the description the footman had given me. I took the prisoner to a public-house, and sent for a constable who searched him in my presence; I saw the headborough take from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120004"/> him a gold watch in a black shagreen case, and four guineas and a half in a purse.</p>

One of them said, D - n your eyes! what have you got there? I thought it more prudent to make no answer, but to endeavour to get off. I began to run, keeping my eye upon them; and they, seeing me watchful, with the pistol in my hand, were fearful to come up to me; in a few yards two more men started up; upon that I thought it better to stop: I stopped, and then they surrounded me; they pulled my hat over my eyes, and threatened me if I looked up; then they took from me a pistol, a swordstick, and some money; I don't exactly remember how much, but I am positive there were four shillings. They were with me, while they were robbing me, for about three or four minutes. After they had quitted me, one returned to me, and asked me how much money I had: I told them I had a guinea and a few shillings. I had a new shilling in my fob. Then they went away. I believe the prisoner to be one of the first three that I saw; I had a full view of those three, during the time I presented the pistol at them, before they robbed me: they were then about the distance from me that I am now from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What sort of night was it? - It was rather dark.</p>
               <p>I understand you don't mean to swear positively to the prisoner? - I will not be positive to him; but I believe him to be one of the first three: he was dressed much as he is now; his hair was curled round: I believe him to be the man, from his dress, and by his size. I had a strong suspicion of him when I heard him speak, when before the justice; I told the justice, I thought from his voice he was one of the three that spoke to me.</p>

I was alarmed between nine and ten o'clock at night; it was not dark, but light enough to see a man's face: I heard a noise up stairs; the maid and my sister went up, and found that some thieves had got into the house.</p>
               <p>ARAMINTHA HOW sworn.</p>
               <p>I am sister to Mrs. Webb; I live with her. Upon the 22d of July, a little before ten, I heard a noise in the dining-room; afterwards I heard a still greater noise, upon which the maid and I went up into the dining-room, and then into the two pair of stairs room; there I missed a gown and some foul linen: the maid then went up into the garret; she said somebody had been there: I ran down stairs, and sent out for the neighbours. There was an uproar in the street. Some people came in soon afterwards, and said a bundle of linen had fell from the house, and had hit a woman on the shoulder; and that two men were taken up. I lost the things laid in the indictment to be my property.</p>

               <p>Upon the 22d of July, at about a quarter before ten o'clock, coming along Rathbone-place, a bundle fell from a house upon me; I don't know whether it was from No. 1, or No. 2. I knocked at Capt. Fremantle's door, and told them somebody was a-top of the house: they went up, and found the top of the cieling in the garret broke away, so that a man could come into the house, but there was nobody there. The servant looked at the things, and said they were not his master's property; I left my name and place of abode with the servant, and I took the bundle away with me. Mrs. Webb sent to me, and owned the things.</p>

               <p>Upon the 22d of July, we were alarmed in Oxford-road, between ten and eleven o'clock, with the cry of Thieves! we got the watchman, and went up stairs. We found some tiles had been taken off the corner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120006"/> near a trap-door, of the next house to my master's, so that a man might put in his arm and unbolt the door; upon touching the trap-door, it fell down. The watchman went in, and said he saw two men: I went in and seized one of the prisoners, and the watchman the other; they were under the stairs. I saw this silver spoon sticking out of Bland's breeches-pocket (producing it). I asked him, how he came by it: he said, a man gave it him. Afterwards he said, If you will not hurt me, I will tell the whole truth. They were both without their hats and shoes.</p>

I went to go up upon the tiles, but it was so slippery that I could not get up. They told me to take my shoes off: I did so, and laid them down, and my hat; the man said he would take care of them. Coming by some of the stacks of chimnies, I saw some things lying; I stooped to pick them up; some men came up and laid hold of me, and said I was one of the thieves.</p>

               <p>I live at Canterbury. Upon Wednesday the 22d of August, I went to the races. I had a pocket-book, in which was a draught of Mr. Whitebread's on Messrs. Carey and Co. for. 20. In the afternoon I was upon the stand in the race-ground, and put my hand to my pocket and missed my book: I sent an express to the banker's to stop payment of the draught. I came up to London, after the prisoner had been taken up, and I was present when he was examined before the Lord Mayor on the Tuesday following. Upon that examination, he acknowledged having the draught in his possession, but said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120007"/> he had received it of a person who had found it, and had given it to him to bring to London to receive the money: being asked, if he knew who the person was that he had it of; he said, he knew the person, but did not know his name.</p>

The street door was open. When I saw him take them up, and go out at the door with them, (my fellow-servant was behind me) I said, Do you see that? he answered, Yes, let us follow him. I followed him, and never lost sight of him till I took him, which was in about thirty or forty yards from the door. He had it under his arm; when I laid hold of him, he dropped it; at first he said he never saw them: my fellow-servant coming up, assisted me in taking him and bringing him back, and got a constable to take him into custody.</p>

               <p>I was an apprentice at that time to Mr. Wilford. On the 14th of July, about six in the evening, I left the shop for a few minutes to seek for the errand-boy. There are two doors to the shop. When I came back to the glass door, I saw the other door open. I saw through the window somebody in the parlour that I did not know. I opened the door and went in, and saw the prisoner come out of the parlour. I saw one hat. I asked him some questions. I turned him about, and saw the other hat, and the shoes. I called the maid and Mr. Wilford, and secured the prisoner.</p>

               <p>On the 27th of July, about three in the afternoon, I was at my lodgings, <placeName id="t17810912-10-crimeloc52">the Ship, in Shadwell</placeName>

The prisoners sat on the next seat; between sleeping and waking, Williams threw his hat down over me; he took it up again, and swore why did he throw the hat over me? I then went to sleep: when I waked, Mills was gone, and Williams sat on the bench. I missed my watch; there was a noise about it. Mrs. Mordant went out, and brought back Mills, and a constable was sent for. Mills, Mr. Mordant, and Forrester, went out together. When they came back, Mills had the watch in his hand: he gave it me, and said, There is the watch; take it. Nobody else was in the room when I went to sleep.</p>
               <p>- MORDANT sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in the house when the prosecutor complained of losing his watch, and charged Williams with stealing it; he denied it: I went out and got a constable, and my wife brought Mills back: they both denied it. Mills brought me out, and said he knew where the watch was; and, if he was not to be prosecuted, he would tell where it was. I promised he should not be prosecuted, and then he discovered it.</p>

               <p>I was sent for, and came down to the house; and, after a great deal of enquiry about the watch, Williams said to Mills, Bugger the watch! let him have the watch. The prosecutor was present. This was before Mills went out with the landlord; the landlord was in the back-room. When he came in, I said he might make himself easy; I could find the watch; and then I went out with Mills for it.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Did you hear this expression by Williams to Mills? - There was not any time after Mills was brought back that the constable, the two prisoners, and I, were left together. I did not hear Williams say any thing about the watch to any body, except denying he knew any thing of it.</p>

While Thompson held me by the right arm, Spriggs pulled the watch out of my pocket: I laid hold of the watch, and got it back again. Thompson denied having any knowledge of Spriggs, or his intention of taking the watch. (The Constable produces the watch.)</p>

               <p>On the 3d of August, Friday morning, there was a good many officers in Smithfield. Coming by the Rose and Crown, a man came up to me, and said, A young fellow has been offering a horse to me; I believe it is stolen: and he asked me to go to the stable and see it. I went and saw the prisoner, and asked him if he had any horse to sell: he said he had, and shewed me the horse: the prisoner was in the stable at the Rose and Crown in Smithfield, close behind the horse: it was a bay horse. I then asked him how he came by it: he said it was his own; his father gave it to him; that he lived at Honiton in Lincolnshire. I then searched him, and found this pistol upon him, loaded; my partner took another out of his other pocket.</p>
               <p>What did he say that his name was? - I can't recollect now; but he gave a wrong name. We took him to the office, and he was committed: the same afternoon, Mr. Lowe came up, and owned his horse, which I had taken to the George, in Long-acre; I was present.</p>
               <p>What time in the afternoon did he go there? - About five or six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was the horse led out and shewn him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came Lowe to come there? - He went and enquired after the horse in Smithfield, and was told the man was taken up for horse-stealing; and he came to the office. I am positive the horse the prosecutor saw at the George was the horse found with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>To Lowe. When you went to the George, in Long-acre, the horse was brought out to you? - Yes. I am sure it was mine: he had a black mane and tail, and a blaze in his forehead; he had black legs, with two white heels behind: I bred him from a colt.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the prisoner? did you ever see him? - I never saw him before that day.</p>
               <p>Was the field shut or open? - It was an inclosed field; there were other horses with it.</p>

            . On the 27th of July, the day of the execution of De la Motte, about one in the afternoon, when I came home, my shopman was shewing some lace to the prisoner. She bought some. Several other people were in the shop at the same time. As she was going out, the shopman came and told me he suspected her. I desired the shopman to follow her, and I ran to the door. I saw her a few yards off, looking over her shoulder. My shopman took hold of both her arms, and turned her round suddenly: then I saw her open her cloak, and take a card of lace from under her arm, and offer to give it to the shopman. She held me round the waist, and would not let me go, for five minutes, declaring it was her first offence, and she would pay me any amount for the lace. I had her searched, and there was nothing else found upon her. As she was carrying away in a coach, some persons rescued her. She was afterwards retaken. After she was retaken, I told her, if she cried out again, so as to have assistance to rescue her, I would prosecute her with the utmost rigour, and hang her. I know the lace to be my property.</p>

He came out and scandalized me, and said I took the lace. I had a bill of parcels of the next shop, where I laid out 12 l.</p>

             was by the side of him. I saw Waters; but he ran to the gentleman that was with me. I saw him plainly, at the same time when Mouldy Cloak stopped me. He said, Blast your bloody eyes, you bloody thief! your watch, your money! your money, your watch! I said, I should not be robbed, and I laid hold of him: I wanted to push him down, but could not. I wanted to get one of his buttons off, but could not. White said, D - n your eyes and limbs, let his guts out; for I know him. He had a rusty cutlass, with a brass guard.

             all my fingers so, that I dropped my stick. They thought it was a tuck stick, and bid me drop it; but it was only a fishing-rod. Then they took my money out of my pocket, and were about my watch. My friend called to me; and then this man left me, and ran to my friend. He was engaged with Waters. I went back to my friend. Cloak told me not to look back; if I did, he would blow my brains out. I kept looking at him, and he drawed his hat over his eyes; but I kept stedfastly looking at him. I am sorry to say that I went to school with White. I begged them not to murder my friend, but consider his family. They were blasting and swearing, What do you hesitate for? Blast him, cut his throat; blast him, cut his head off.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120015"/>How long is it ago since you went to school with White? - About twenty four years ago; but I have seen him since; and he knows me well. I begged of them to let me have my fishing rod; for they saw it lie upon the ground with my friend's hat. Waters picked it up, and brought it to me. I looked at him again, that I might be sure of the man. He said, Blast your bloody eyes, if you look back, I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>You said they had a cutlass? - I think they had one, and a pistol too. The cutlass I am clear in. They then ran away, blasting their eyes and limbs, and said, Why did they not rip my guts out?</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - Nine o'clock, I suppose; not three minutes under or over.</p>
               <p>Was there light enough to distinguish them? - Plenty of light to distinguish them very well; I was very particular in making my remarks on them.</p>
               <p>White. My Lord, it was a very dark night.</p>
               <p>How long might they stay with you? - I believe near three minutes.</p>
               <p>The others you never knew before? - No; but I was very particular in observing them. We went to the Thatched-House, got pistols and cutlasses, and went back to take them; but could not find them. Then we carried back the arms, and went to Bridewell, and gave information of them. We searched till three in the morning, but could not find them: I went home at three. I got up at six, and went to the bottom of Chick-Lane: the constable and I waited there till ten o'clock, but saw nothing of them. They told me there was to be a sight at Mile-End, and I should be sure to find them there. I repaired there, and sat in the lobby of the Turnpike for some hours, till I saw them all come by. I saw them coming a good way before the turnpike, which was in the afternoon of the next day, at White-Chapel Turnpike. Cloak and White were in a little chaise-cart, and I saw Phillips and Waters. Waters was in a chaise along with two women. I know them to be the people, except Phillips: I could not swear to him; but he was very like the person that accosted us at the Turnpike; therefore we took him up upon suspicion. When I saw them there, I was sure they were the people who met with me, that they were the men. I took a coach, and told the coachman to follow that chaise-cart till we ordered him to stop. They went through White Chapel, down Houndsditch, into Long-Lane: there was a little stoppage there. We got out of the coach, and took them out of the chaise and the cart.</p>
               <p>Are you now positive to the other prisoners? - I am, and do think Phillips was the other; but cannot swear to him. When they were taken into the public-house, before I went to the justice, Phillips said, If he was hanged for that robbery, somebody else should suffer. He was the only man that I could not swear to.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You are a glazier? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A master or journeyman? - I have been in business eleven years, and have served all Ward and Parish Offices.</p>
               <p>When was this man taken up? - The next day.</p>
               <p>Committed for further examination? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They were examined and sent afterwards to Bow-Street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And then, the day they were fully committed, you swore to them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had not positively sworn to them before? - No; I told the justice I would swear to them, but I wished rather that they should be prosecuted by somebody else.</p>
               <p>You never told any body that either of them was your school-fellow before that? - Yes, from the first minute; that made me tender. I told the Justice at first I knew them, and would swear to them; but that one having been my school-fellow, I wished to have them examined again; and in the mean time advert sed, that some other persons might appear against them rather than I should.</p>

             we came through the Turnpike, therestood a very tall, strait, decent young fellow: he said, Gentlemen, I wish you may not be robbed, or you will be robbed, I am not confident which. I immediately smiled to my companion, and said, I have nothing to lose; are you afraid? He said, No. The man said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120016"/> But we will give them the double. I had not the presence of mind to ask him which way he was going, or to ask him for his company; but he went towards Kingstand. I saw no more; but when we had got about an hundred yards, a man caught me by the collar and wrist, and swore, D - n your bloody eyes, I have you now. I said, Have what? He said, Your money directly, or I will blow your brains out. I told him, That he might easily have, for I had none, or very little, besides some change from what I had paid my reckoning with.</p>
               <p>Had he any weapon? - I cannot tell what he had in his hand; I was too much terrified. He said, Give it me directly. I did not give it him immediately. He said, D - n your eyes, if you hesitate another minute, I will cut your head off. I called out Whiskin two or three times; he strived to stop my mouth.</p>
               <p>Who was it that laid hold of you? - I am not positive. I turned my head round to resist as well as I could; and the little chap, which I verily believe to be that Waters, came and stooped under me, and said, D - n you, what do you hesitate about? cut his guts out; and immediately pulled his hat so, that I could see no more of his face. I believe that to be Waters from his stature; it was a little black fellow, but I cannot be positive to him. He immediately turned my breeches pocket inside out; there was nothing but half-pence in it. He pulled my watch out likewise. I held my watch with my left hand, and tried to get it into my pocket; but they got it away from me. Then they said, Go along. When they had got my watch, and had joined company, one of the three villains, I do not know which, said, They had done him. Said one, You should have cut his guts out; for I know him well. I had known White well for years.</p>
               <p>You don't speak positive to either of them? - No.</p>
               <p>But rather believe it was Waters that came to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night? - I observed it was a very pleasant fine evening as we walked from Enfield together.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to distinguish people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>How came it they were not fully committed the first time they went before the justice? - I believe it was a good deal owing to my timorousness: I said, if I should hear them speak some words, I should know them; but their voices differed a little.</p>
               <p>Was it owing to the timorousness of the last witness? - No; he was positive at the first time. He swore positively to them at Justice Blackborow's. He said, the first time to the Justice, that he was positive they were the party.</p>
               <p>When was the first time you heard Vezey say he knew one of them? - On the Monday they were all taken: he said, on Sunday night, before we came into Islington town, that he knew one perfectly well, but could not recollect his name, and that he could pick him out of two hundred persons.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On the 26th of last month, at about half past ten in the evening, the prisoner and Mr. Rimmington came to me, and gave information that they had been robbed, and desired to know whether we could get somebody else to assist to go in search of the parties. I went to Kipping and Redgrave, and we went in search after them that night, according to the descriptions that he gave of them. We could not find any thing of them. We went the next morning to the sign of the Castle in Field-Lane: there we staid watching and looking to see somebody come from Chick-Lane, from the habitation where some of them lodge; but not seeing them there, we heard there was to be a sight at Mile-End: we proceeded from thence in the afternoon to this sight: we went to Mile-End. Mr. Kipping, Mr. Redgrave, and I, went into the Gun, and the prisoner went to the Turnpike-gate, and he said he should be certain he should know the men in case he saw them We never were with him from the time he went to the gate till he came and told us, that those men that were in that chaise and in that cart were the people who had robbed him. We immediately took a coach, and pursued them from thence to Long-Lane: there we took them. He said, from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120017"/> the first, that they were the men that robbed him.</p>
               <p>Did he describe the men to you? - Yes, as near as possible.</p>
               <p>And when you took these people, did they answer that description? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he describe their dress? - He said they were dressed in brown cloaths, as he thought. W hite had a brown coat on; Mouldy Cloak has now the same coat on he had then; and Waters likewise, the shortest, he said, particularly, had a mark upon his buttons.</p>
               <p>Had he that mark on his buttons? - I believe the mark is now upon his buttons; that is Waters; it is something like a stag, or a bird, I will not be positive which. He told me this before they were taken.</p>

I locked the door; and the windows were shut down. I came back about six, unlocked the door, and went in. There was a large box in the corner of the house, which I had left a candle upon; but it was taken off. I was told by some children, that a woman had been in at the window, and come out again. It was a sash-window; any person may get in by lifting it up. The window-sash was shut when I returned. I looked at the box, and found it broke open: I missed 8 l. 14 s. which was in a green silk purse in the box; the gold was in that purse, and the silver in a leather purse, in which the silk purse was likewise put. I was told which way the woman went, and supposed she would go to Monmouth-street, to buy cloaths; as she was almost naked. I went to enquire. I heard a woman in a red cloak had been to bargain for cloaths at several shops. At last I found her at a pawnbroker's door, in Russel-court, all in new cloaths. A woman, who saw her come out of the window, and knew her, had told me who she was. I laid hold of her, and brought her to my own door. That neighbour came to my assistance, and laid hold of her. The prisoner d - ned me and the money too, and said she did not think she should ever go to gaol for my money. I asked her where the purses were? She said, I might go seek, if I was cunning enough to find them. She said, If I would let her alone, she would give me the money back; that she did not mean to keep it, but return it. When the justice asked her what became of the red gown she had on when she came out of the window, she said she had thrown it away in Drury-lane.</p>

The carriage door was opened, and there were two fellows, with cutlasses and pistols, demanded my money. I believe that man in green (Stewart) to be one of them. He had on, at the time he stopped me, a Bath great coat, and looked stouter than he does now; but I believe him to be the man, though I cannot positively swear to him: he came to me afterwards. The man who has been convicted I conceive to be the other man. They demanded my money; I gave it: they then demanded my watch; I said I had none. They called out to search me, and threatened to cut me in pieces, if I would not give them my watch; I said I had none. His comrade (the man who was convicted) put his hand into the carriage to search me. I very imprudently caught at his arm; and, in that struggle, the chain of my watch dropped from under my arm; upon which this man, Stewart, as I take it to be, took my watch. Upon that, the other door of the carriage was opened; and there were two other men, with cutlasses and pistols, threatened my life, for having refused to give them my watch. I took very little notice of the two that opened the other door; for I began to be much alarmed, when in that situation. They threatened much they would have me out, and cut me to pieces. It struck me that my best way was to keep my attention to the two men that first attacked me. I said, I beg you will not use me ill. They uttered horrid imprecations: They would cut me to pieces; and should not mind killing me more than a dog. That little man (

            ) appears, from the faint remembrance I have, to be much resembling the man: his voice struck me at the justice's to be something like his; but, to speak at all to him, I cannot. The comrade of that little man, that was the second man that opened the carriage door, begged his fellow robbers would not hurt me; he said, D - n you, as you have got all the gentleman's money, and every thing, do not hurt thim: he was a tall man, much taller than either of these men: they then desired the coachman to drive on. I went immediately to Mr. Sherwood's office; I could find nobody there: I then returned to the watch-house in Shadwell, and got one of Mr. Sherwood's runners, and the constable of the night, and went directly, with my carriage, back again; and went about Whitechapel, and Rosemary-lane, and all the houses I could think of. As the men were strong in my eye, I thought I might have an opportunity of meeting them; and it was much better to lay hold of them then, than trust it to my mind afterwards; but could not meet with them. A few days after, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120019"/> other men were taken up; and the other day they came to let me know that this man was taken up; and though I think I could speak positively to Stewart, I will not say it, because I will not say but that I was something alarmed.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was servant to Mr. Shakespear when he was robbed. At the bottom of Rosemary-lane, beyond the Toll-bar, between that and the sail-cloth manufactory, my master was stopped by four footpads. The first I saw was a flash from the pan of a pistol, which pistol did not go off. I was behind the carriage. As soon as I saw the flash, the carriage stopped; two men came to the off side, and opened the door. I am sure Stewart was the man who was on the off side of the carriage. The watchman was crying past one o'clock, as we came down Rosemary-lane. It was so light I could distinguish the colour of the clothes, and the men; the pistols, and hangers, and every thing of that kind. The off side of the carriage door was opened first; in a little time, the near side of the carriage door was opened. They demanded my master's watch and money. One man that was with him on the same side of the carriage, was tried last sessions, and he was found guilty. This Stewart is the man who took the watch and money, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Could you see from behind? - I was behind the chariot. I was as near almost as possibly I could be to them, at the time; and my attention was wholly upon this man; I could not tell so much about those on the near side of the carriage. I believe Atkins to be the last that run from the near side of the carriage; but I cannot tell so much of him, as to be so positive to him as to the other. Stewart shut the carriage door; he was the last that went from the off side of the carriage. As soon as he had shut the carriage door, a man on the near side of the carriage said, D - n you, drive on, coachman! as soon as he said that, Stewart said to me, D - n your blood, you bugger, I would have your watch and money, if you had got any! The coachman drove on; and he cut at me with a hanger, but did not hit me.</p>
               <p>Do you undertake to say there was light enough to enable you to distinguish the counnance of Stewart? - Yes; I am clear of it.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In a rough Bath coat, of a dark colour, and a round hat: the other I can't be positive to.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you know Stewart before? - No.</p>
               <p>But his appearance was such as it is now? - No; his hair was not powdered or curled, but his hair is black or dark: he had a round hat on, and had a loose coat, which buttoned round him.</p>
               <p>He did not look then a bit stouter than he does now? - He is the same man he was then: I know the man, I am very clear.</p>
               <p>You did not know him before? - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>You could not see the watch and money given to this man? - I did not see it given.</p>
               <p>How much reward had you last sessions? - None.</p>
               <p>How much do you expect? - What is my share: I was at the taking him, and ought to have a share as well as other people.</p>
               <p>If this man is convicted, you will expect some share of it? - I don't expect a farthing.</p>
               <p>What makes you so generous in one instance, and not in the other? - Because I was at the taking of the last man, and had a right to it.</p>
               <p>So you have a right to this: did not Jellous tell you this? - No.</p>
               <p>What is the blood-money you set this man down at? How much do you reckon you shall have upon his life? - I wish there had been no occasion for it; I do it fairly and honestly.</p>
               <p>How came you to expect it from Gough more than for this man? - Because I was at the taking of him. I speak truth.</p>
               <p>This man you never saw in your life before: he had a loose great coat, a round hat, and his hair hanging about his head? - I know him by his dress, his voice, and person: he came up to me to the hind-wheel of the carriage,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120020"/> as close as he could; when he found he could not rob me, he cut at me with a hanger.</p>
               <p>Why could not he rob you? - Because a man on the other side the carriage told the coachman to drive on.</p>
               <p>If they could stop the coach to rob the master, they could certainly stop the coach to rob the man. - They did not rob me.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you see this man? - I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>How long after the robbery? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>I believe it was the latter end of August? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Who told you about these men? - I was sent for, to appear at Bow-street, to see if I knew the man. As soon as I saw him, I knew him.</p>
               <p>They gave you a little hint? - They gave me no hint.</p>
               <p>You had been drinking there a little with the servants? - Drinking you need not say any thing to me about: I speak the truth.</p>
               <p>You understand drinking, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had been drinking? - I suppose few servants go to Ranelagh without drinking.</p>
               <p>That was your case; you was drunk? - No; I was not.</p>

They attempted to fire two pistols, just before the horses; but the pistols flashed in the pan. I believe Stewart was the man who put his hand on the foot-board, with a hanger, and said to me, If you do not stand still, I will cut your throat.

I took a coach from the stand in Whitechapel, to evade being robbed: I got upon the coach-box myself, and drove the horses. When I got about 150 yards beyond a house, the sign of which is the Black Horse, on Kingsland-road, a little man ran across the road, and laid hold of the horse by the bridle: I stood up on the foot-board of the box, and said, I will not be robbed: upon which I received several blows upon my right arm, and while they were hitting me -</p>
               <p>Was there more than one? - There were four in all. One swore, called me by an opprobrious name, and said, We will make you stop when you are bid. I still made some resistance, till one, who was taller than the prisoner, came with a kind of a weapon, and levelled at my head. I held up my arm, and received the blow upon it; upon which my arm dropped, and the man who cut me came upon the splinter-bar, and laid himself across me to rifle my pockets. I begged him not to kill me; that he should have all I had. Then I put my hand in my right pocket, and took out very near twenty shillings in silver. Then he took my gold watch. He felt outside my left-hand breeches pocket, and felt something: he swore, and said, Come, Sir, make baste. He took a pocketbook out of that pocket, and a purse containing eleven guineas, a shirt buckle, and two medals of the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester; they were all in that purse. I said, I hoped he would be satisfied; for now he had got all: he replied, Very well, go on.</p>
               <p>What have you to say against the prisoner? - He is the man that ran across the road, and laid hold of one of the horses.</p>
               <p>Are you certain of that? - I am certain.</p>
               <p>What sort of light was it? - It was not quite dark, it was dusk; but one might perceive<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120023"/> and know any face: he stood quite fronting me, at the horses' heads, and looked up; his face was directed towards me: I am perfectly sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Did you observe his dress? - Yes, a brown coat; I described him exactly before I saw him. I whipped one of the horses, and dragged him I suppose fifteen or twenty yards. When I said I would not be robbed, I kept whipping the horses; but he would not quit his hold. The prisoner was taken the next day. I refused seeing him that evening; it was then pretty near dusk, and the man who took him brought him to me at Kingsland, and wanted me to look at him then; he was brought to a house, the sign of the Fox, near where I lodge: I told the man that had taken him to keep him; for the next day I would attend Mr. Wilmot's office; I chose to see him at the justice's: I saw him there the next day; there were several people in the room with him; I pointed him out the moment I saw him. I said, That is the little man that laid hold of the horses' heads.</p>
               <p>Have you found your money or watch since? - No; and what they ha d got they should have been welcome to: I should not have prosecuted them, but only for their cruelty to me: I had a cut an inch deep in my arm; but this is not the man that cut me.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. What marks he swears to me by? - By his face.</p>
               <p>Which horse did I lay hold of first? - You came on the right-hand side, and laid hold of the off horse first, and then to the other, and then never quitted your station till I was robbed, and the man left the coach-box.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a hackney-coachman. My coach was taken by Mr. Leoni in Whitechapel; he got upon the box before I came to the coach, and asked for the coachman: Mr. Leoni drove himself; I sat upon the box with him. Mr. Leoni set off along Houndsditch, Shoreditch, and Kingsland-road. Just as we came on this side the Fox, a little man catched hold of the horse's head, on the near side, and swore, D - n your eyes, stop! or I will blow your brains out. I did not see him lay hold of the horse on the off-side. He had a bludgeon, or pistol, or something in his hand; but I can't tell what. Mr. Leoni said, D - n your eyes! I will not be stopped by any body. He kept whipping the horses, and dragged the man twenty yards, I dare say: then a tall man got upon the splinter-bar on the off-side, and said, D - n your eyes! I will learn you to drive on when you are ordered to stop! The coach was stopped; then he began beating Mr. Leoni a-cross his thighs with a hanger, I believe it was, it looked like one; he hit him across his arm, and cut his arm very bad: then he laid across him, and began rifling his pockets; he pulled his watch out, as if he would pull his breeches all to pieces; I saw the watch, just as they drew it out: they made me look the other way, only I just cast my eyes a little that way.</p>
               <p>How long did this continue? - About ten minutes: they went towards London from the coach; we set off the other way to Mr. Leoni's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Can you speak to the prisoner? - I can't swear to never a one of them; it was pretty dark.</p>
               <p>What was it o'clock? - About ten.</p>
               <p>Why do you think so? - What makes me so positive in the time was, I was going to draw the horses into the yard.</p>
               <p>You could not see the prisoner's face then? - I could discern what size he was, but not to swear to him: he seemed to be a shortish thick-set man. I was at Justice Wilmot's next day, and saw the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Was you there when Mr. Leoni came in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did or did not Mr. Leoni fix upon the prisoner as soon as he came in? - I don't know; he was there before I was.</p>
               <p>What did you say before the justice about the prisoner? - I said, I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>What time do you usually put up your horses? - Just as it happens.</p>
               <p>Do you ever put up before ten o'clock? - Yes; I have put up at seven and eight several times.</p>

               <p>This witness swore before the justice that Mr. Leoni was very drunk. I am innocent of the affair. At the time the robbery was done, I was at Clapton with this gentleman that is here; I slept there till five next morning; then he gave me a shilling, and I came away.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner; he lived fellow-servant with me about nineteen months, at Mrs. Horton's, at Brook-house, Clapton; he was a very honest lad, and very willing to do his work: he left his place about two years ago. On the 25th of August, he came to me at Brooke-house, where I live, about ten minutes before ten, and slept with me till five next morning, when he departed: he had laid with me several times since he left his mistress's service; I cannot say how many times.</p>
               <p>How came you to be so certain to Saturday the 25th of August? - Because he was taken up the next day, and I was told of it on Monday.</p>
               <p>How came you to know the time to be ten minutes before ten so exactly? - Because he and I were talking at the gate some time, and then the clock struck ten. The place where this robbery is said to have been committed, is about two miles from Brooke-house.</p>

               <p>Jury. Is there not a nearer way across the fields to come to it? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you drink? - Small beer. He appeared tight and clean; he had the same coat on he has now, and he had no money in his pocket that I know of. I should have thought, if he had been guilty, he would have been in a terror; but he seemed the same as usual. He has drove for a livery-stable at London-Wall.</p>
               <p>Jury to Ray. Whether Mr. Leoni was sober at the time he was robbed? - He seemed to be about half-and-half.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Leoni. Was you affected with liquor? - I was not affected; I was sufficiently capable of knowing his face. The moment I was attacked, I had a diamond-ring upon my finger; I turned it back, and brought it home with me. I had been dining with some friends; and, to the best of my recollection, had not drank a bottle of Port wine; something better than a pint.</p>
               <p>Court. Some people's heads can't carry much. - My Lord, I am sorry to say that I can bear a bottle of wine.</p>

On the 12th of August, between five and six in the morning, my wife and I heard a noise; and, getting up in bed, saw a man in the room: he had gathered the things mentioned in the indictment together, and put them on a chair close by the window: when he heard me stir, he looked round, and catched up the things in his arms, and jumped out of the window, which is thirteen feet from the ground. I got up, and looked out of the window, and saw the prisoner drop the things in the court, and take up some of them again, and run away; he knocked off his hat, and left it behind him in the court. I called out, Stop thief! and a Jew going past pursued him, and in about seven minutes brought him back, and some of the things with him; I am sure the man brought back is the same person that jumped out of the window: he had a brown coat and a blue apron: when he jumped out of the window, he looked up, and I saw his face.</p>

The prisoner, seeing me in liquor, followed me, and asked me to give her something to drink. I said, I was going home, and could not stop: I had just treated her before. She came before me, asking me to give her something to drink, and took my watch and handkerchief out of my pocket. I missed them both in less than a minute afterwards. I did not see her doing it, nor feel her doing it, but missed them directly. Then I went home. I felt it in my pocket, after I left the others, when I came out of the public-house, before the prisoner overtook me. It was a silver watch. I heard of it next morning.</p>

               <p>I am watch-house-keeper of Covent-garden. On the 30th of July, about one in the morning, the watchmen going their rounds, met with this woman making a noise. They brought her to the watch-house as disorderly. Endeavouring to get away, she fell; and this watch fell from her bosom.</p>
               <p>Did you see it fall? - No: it was given to me. The inside case was brought in first: I said, Where is the outside case? They said, they could not tell. I desired them to look for the other case about the place where she was. They did; and found it in an area.</p>
               <p>NORTHEN BOBBETT sworn.</p>
               <p>About a quarter after one o'clock, this woman and two more were making a noise and disturbance in Tavistock-street. I said, if they did not make less noise, I would take them to the watch-house. Going to take hold of the prisoner, she fell down, and the watch fell out of her bosom. I went to take her up, and found the watch on the pavement. I took it up, and delivered it to the last witness, in the watch-house. There was nobody within twenty or thirty yards of her, when the watch dropped.</p>
               <p>Was the whole watch there, or the outside case wanting? - The body of the watch only: we found the outside case in an area in York-street, about ten yards from the place where she fell.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Had she seen your money in the house? - I had the change of a guinea in my pocket. The guineas were in a purse: the silver was loose. I believe I hauled the silver out, to pay for the liquor, in the house.</p>

I went to her at the lock-up house, and told her, if she had eight or ten guineas left, if she would give them me, I would send her about her business; for I had not a farthing left to take me home to Liverpool. I am sure I had the money when I came out of the house. I have found none of it since. As soon as she was gone, I put my hand to my pocket, and missed the money. I did not know where to follow her. I abused her, being a little in liquor; and some men came about me (of her consorts, I suppose), and asked me what I abused her for. I heard a watchman coming: I called Watch! Robbery! and then they all flew from me. I told the watchman I had been robbed of 20 l. and went with him to the watch-house.</p>

I got into bed; and he pulled off his things, to get into bed: but he said he had to speak to some of the rest of the lodgers in another room, and so he put on some of his cloaths again, and took the candle, and went into the other room; and I never saw him after till the Monday following. I fell asleep soon after he went out. When I waked, I missed a coat and waistcoat, and two pair of Nankeen breeches; and two guineas and an half in gold, and some silver, and a silver watch, which were in my breeches pocket. My breeches lay in a chair, by the bedside.</p>
               <p>Were your breeches gone? - Yes; but they were found in the dust-hole the next day. I lost a silk handkerchief, and a white dimity waistcoat. I got up, and went in search of the prisoner, with another young man, who found him the next day, which was Monday, between seven and eight o'clock. I understood he found him somewhere near Drury-lane; but the place I can't tell; I am quite a stranger in the town. We found the watch in his pocket: he had the white dimity waistcoat and Nankeen breeches of mine on, and a silk handkerchief of mine in his pocket, and two guineas and one shilling; but I can't swear that the money was mine.</p>

               <p>I was coming from the Maze-Pond, on the 27th of August: I came over <placeName id="t17810912-28-crimeloc143">London bridge</placeName>

Coming by Mr. Gill's, which is the first house on this side London bridge, at about eight in the evening, I saw the prisoner stoop down, and take the carpet off the window of Mr. Gill's house, and conceal it under her cloak, and go away with it. I was about three yards from her. I instantly laid hold of her. She threw it down upon the very place she took it from. When I stopped her, I saw her throw it down.</p>
               <p>How many steps did she go befor e you stopped her? - Three or four. She went off the curb stone. I laid hold of her, and took her into the shop. She first said she did not do it: afterwards she said to the constable, that it was her first offence.</p>

               <p>Upon the 17th of July, between twelve and one, the prisoner and another boy were calling Dust! in the street. My wife was in the shop, and I was busy. She called out to the maid, to bring the dust up. We have a back-door goes into <placeName id="t17810912-29-crimeloc147">St. Martin's lane</placeName>

The dustman took the dust, and returned and carried the box down stairs. Just after, my wife went, and saw the mark of the dustman's feet on the stairs. She had some suspicion the dustman had been down stairs. The watch was always somewhere in the kitchen, for them to cook by: I had seen it on the shelf that morning. In less than two minutes after they had taken away the dust, the watch was missed. I went to the door. The dust-cart stood about fifteen yards off, on the other side of the street. I went to the prisoner, and said, Give me the watch you have taken out of our kitchen. He said, What watch? I said, Did not you take the dust from the back-door, out of that alley? He said, Yes. I said, Did not you carry the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120029"/> box back? He said, No; the other boy did. I asked the other, if he carried it down? He said, No; the prisoner carried it down himself. I asked him then, again, if he carried the box back? He said, he did. I brought him back to the shop, and charged him with it. My wife said, If he produced the watch, she would send him about his business; but I said, if I found that watch upon him, I would prosecute him. I sent for a constable; and in the interim I shook his coat, and felt the watch between the linings. I held it till the constable came: he put his hand into the lining, and pulled out my watch.</p>

To the best of my knowledge, he had 1000: I do not know how many more. He did not tell me where he was going to. Mr. Clarkson, the clerk of the field, gave him a ticket.</p>
               <p>Do you always send 1000? - No; sometimes 750, and sometimes 500. If the cart is very full, it carries above 1000. He told me he was wanting in his number in the last cart, and he must have some over then.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Scott. I was at the taking-up of the prisoner. I charged him with selling 200 bricks, and asked him how he could be guilty of such a thing; as he was in constant work, and earned 17 or 18 s. a week, and had that week earned 24 s. He said, Burland had before seen him put down some bricks in Tabernacle-walk, and asked him, if he could not bring him some bricks, and he would give him something to drink; and accordingly, the first opportunity, he carried him some. He said Burland first gave him a shilling, and afterwards 5 d. He confessed that as soon as he was charged with it.</p>
               <p>Did you make any allowance to Haggard afterwards? - Yes; he was charged 850 only.</p>

Two persons had been looking at some thread edging, which was in a box then upon the counter. The prisoner came behind the two people who were looking at it, and stood there a considerable time. I suspected her. I was at a distance, and could not perceive what she was about. She bought a yard of edging, of another person in the shop. She seemed confused, and went out of the shop. I suspected her, and followed her out. When she got about ten yards from the door, I laid hold of her, and felt the lace under her cloak. I brought her back to the shop, and charged her with taking a piece of lace. She then dropped it from under her arm. She was taken to the Office in Bow-street, and committed by Justice Addington. The edging cost 26 s.</p>

I shewed him a box of figured ribband. He asked for two yards three quarters, and wanted me to abate him a halfpenny a yard. I told him I could not. He looked over the box a few minutes: he then went out of the shop; but returned again, and asked me if I had got any plain ribbands. I shewed him some. He asked the price, and wanted an abatement of a halfpenny a yard in them; and he looked over them a few minutes. I told him I could not abate; and shut up the box. He asked if I had any black ribbands. I shewed him some, and he wanted me to abate him something in them. I said I could not. While he was looking over that, the servant-maid came out of the parlour, and bid me put the box away, saying that he was a thief, and did not want ribbands. He said, he was no thief, and went out of the shop. I then looked in the box, and missed a piece of black ribband. There was a person sweeping the shop: I bid her go after him, and bring him back. The piece I missed was the only piece of the sort that was in the box. He had been looking at it. The young woman brought him back, and an opposite neighbour came over to her assistance. He came back close to the counter: he opened his clothes, his coat, waistcoat, and breeches, and the ribbands all rolled out from him into the black ribband box; but where they came from I cannot tell: I am sure they were not there before. He then said, he had not got any thing. I asked how the the ribbands came into the box; he said, he could not tell, and then attempted to go out. I stopped him; and he offered me a guinea, which he had in his hand: he did not say what he offered it for. There were four half pieces of coloured ribband returned into the black ribband box.</p>

I then told the journey woman to take the ribband away, that he was a thief. He directly went out of the shop. The apprentice went out after him, and fetched him in again. He went up to the counter. His coat, waistcoat, and breeches, were loose. I saw him bring up the four pieces of ribband with his hand, within his cloaths, and put them into the box. Whether they came from his breeches, or coat and waistcoat, I cannot tell. He wanted to get away: we were hardly able to hold him.</p>

These two men ran up Hart-street. Upon that, the prisoner went out of the passage, and I came out after her. She walked on in Bow-street. My friend told me to search my pockets. When I came down Bow-street, he stood on the outside of the passage. I searched my pockets, and I missed my purse, containing a bank-note for 10 l. five guineas, and some silver. It was taken from my right-hand breeches pocket. I had felt it on coming out of the White-hart tavern. I had been at a feast at the White-hart the day before: I went and spent the evening at Sadler's-Wells, and then returned to the White-hart, and staid till two o'clock. The waiter asked me for my money when I went in, and gave it me when I came out again.</p>
               <p>Why did he ask your money of you? - Because it is a house bad women frequent.</p>
               <p>Did you look to see what was in the purse when he gave it you back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you quite sober? - I was really sensible, but not quite sober. I followed the prisoner, and demanded my purse. She denied it. The watchman happening to come by, I charged the watch with her. She was carried to the watch-house, and searched. The purse was not found upon her: it was found in the watch-house by the beadle. There was not any thing found upon her. When I charged her with robbing me, in the watch-house, I told the number of the note, the sum of money in the purse, and described it particularly.</p>
               <p>Was it found in your presence? - No; there was nothing found while I staid.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay with her in the passage? - To the best of my knowledge, not above ten minutes.</p>
               <p>During the time you were with her, might not your purse have dropped out of your pocket? - No; it did not.</p>
               <p>Was not you in such a situation that it might? - No; I had no connection with her whatever.</p>
               <p>Was your breeches unbuttoned? - No; they were not.</p>

               <p>I was beadle of the night; and being in the watch-house, when the charge came in, she was searched. Nothing was found upon her: but the purse was found in the watch-house, about two or three hours after. There is a back-room we were in: it was found dropped down in a corner. There was another person brought in with her, and searched likewise. The prosecutor and the other man said they knew nothing of the other woman, only that she met them as they were coming to the watch-house; and she was examined, because she was in company, left the prisoner should have given it to her.</p>
               <p>The young man did not give charge of her? - No; they said they did not think she had it.</p>
               <p>What did the prosecutor say when he came to the watch-house? - He charged the prisoner with robbing him of a purse, containing a 10 l. note, five guineas, and some silver; that the purse had but one tassel.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be sober, or in liquor, when he came in? - I can't take upon me to say he was sober, nor that he was much in liquor. The purse contained what he had spoken of.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner been near where the purse was found? - I don't know: the room is very little. When I found the purse, I charged her with it again, and she declared she had not got it, but the other woman had it; and so she declared before the justice.</p>

               <p>To the Prosecutor. Is there any truth in this story about a quarrel in the night-house? - None. I went to Clerkenwell, to see a friend of mine, who was there for debt. I asked for this woman. When I saw her, I asked her if she knew me? She said, No. I asked her how she would stand trial? She said, I should have my property again; she had given it up to the beadle. I said, Why did not you tell me, when you gave it to the beadle; and I might have made you an acknowledgement? I thought, if they had told me they had got the property, and given it me, there was no occasion to go before the justice at all.</p>

He was brought back by him, with a piece of linen handkerchiefs, containing ten in number, which had my own private mark upon them. About a fortnight after, I had reason to believe he had conveyed goods down to his father.</p>
               <p>Upon these being brought back, had you him committed? - No; being a young man, and knowing his friends, I was willing to shew him all the lenity I could. I let him go down to his friends at Horsham. By the return of the post, I acquainted his friends with what had happened; I likewise acquainted several of my friends with what had happened. In consequence of some letters from friends of mine, I went down to Horsham. I applied to a magistrate: he granted me a warrant to search his father's house. Upon searching it, I found concealed on the bed-teaster, a callico gown, four yards of sprig muslin, and six yards of Scotch Lino, all of them with my private mark upon them. The offenders were carried before the magistrate, and all committed to Horsham gaol.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, in Prince's street, Leicester-fields. On the 4th of August, the prisoner brought a piece of handkerchiefs, in the morning, to my shop: he wanted half-a-guinea on them. I asked him who he brought them from? He mentioned a person's name I don't recollect now; but he said a draper's, in Holborn. I stopped him, and sent to know the truth of it: I could not find any such person. I told him there was no such person, and desired he would inform me where he got them. He made some frivolous excuses: he first said he got them from one person, then from another. I said I could not give credit to that, and if he did not tell me, I would take him before a magistrate. Upon this, he confessed he had them from Mr. Stamford's; that he lived with him. I thought it was his first offence, and took some pity on him. I carried him to Mr. Stamford: I said I would leave it to him to do as he pleased about prosecuting. Mr. Stamford said he would consider of it, and consult some of his friends. I delivered the handkerchiefs to Mr. Percival.</p>

On the 17th of August, as I was going to Pancras with some butter, I was detained at Mother Redcap's by a shower of rain for about three quarters of an hour. I got there about seven o'clock: then I came back by the George, where I staid about ten minutes. As I was coming home, in company with Mr. Andrews, within two fields of the new road that is by the gate-house of Lord Baltimore, we were met by two men; they attacked us both: the man who attacked me I have never seen since. He clapped a bayonet to my breast, and said, with an oath, Your money, or your life! He had on a soldier's waistcoat and breeches. I put the bayonet aside, and gave him my silver, about three or four shillings. He then wished me a good night; but just as he went off, I thought I had an opportunity of seizing him, which accordingly I did, and immediately called out to my friend Mr. Andrews, that I had got my man, and would keep him. In less than a minute after that, while we were struggling, the prisoner Shenton, and two others, came up; they rushed to me immediately, and ran a drawn bayonet smartish against my breast, and swore, that if I did not loose the man immediately, he would run me through directly! I was alarmed at this; I loosed the man, and ran away; they followed me; they soon came up with me, and knocked me down. When I was down upon my back, one of them set his foot upon my breast, and held his bayonet to my belly, and swore a bitter oath, and said he would do for me: I believe that to be Shenton: it was the same man that came to me, and ran the bayonet up to my breast. I begged for mercy: I told them I had a wife and a large family. Buckley, at this time, stood at my feet. He said several times, D - n him, run him through! I saw three or four bayonets drawn; but I don't know whether Buckley had one in his hand. They asked me for more money: I said I had two pockets of halfpence: they then asked me what my buckles were? I said silver; they took them: then they asked what my stock-buckle was? I said that was silver too; upon which they took them. I begged for my stock-buckle, as it had been given me by a relation; but they took it away with the stock. Then one came up, I believe it was the person I had originally taken, and asked them if they had got all? They said, Yes, they believed they had: then, said he, let him go for a fool. At<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120035"/> this time my friend Mr. Andrews came up to beg also for my life; they then gave me a kick or two on my side, and went away. This was as near as could be about nine o'clock: it was duskish; but there was light enough to see them; and I lay upon my back while they were doing all this perhaps for about six or eight minutes, while they were rifling me, and had a full opportunity of seeing them. I did not see any body else in the fields, nor indeed till I came to Tottenham Court turnpike. I am positive the prisoners are two of the men who robbed me.</p>

               <p>When we came into the second field the prisoner, Buckley, came up to me from a high bank that goes along the field: he caught hold of my breast, and pointed a bayonet at my breast, and said D - n your eyes, your life or your money! Mr. Mawson and I were walking by the side of each other: I saw Mr. Mawson seized by another of the men, not one of the prisoners; the same expressions were used to him. While Buckley was holding his bayonet to me, I struck him with my stick on the head; I then caught hold of him; I threw my arm round his neck, and hugg'd him close to me, and there kept him: I got the point of his bayonet in the hook of my stick, and kept it off; but he continued pushing at me, and pricked me several times in the side. The moment almost that the struggling was over, three other men came up; one came to me with a cutlass, and said, D - n your eyes, I will cut your head from your shoulders, if you don't let him go! Mr. Mawson at this had gone off: one of those three men struck me on the shoulder, and then shook hands with me, and bid me good night; and, upon seeing Mr. Mawson go off, they left me, and ran after Mr. Mawson, upon quitting me. Then I met two more people that I took to be of the same gang, in about twenty yards after: they asked the men that robbed me, whether I had been robbed, or no. I begged of them for my friend's life; they said he should not be hurt; I then deliberated for a moment what I should do, and I resolved to go back; I thought in my mind that if he was killed in the field, I would be killed also: I went back to Mr. Mawson; I found him lying flat upon his back, with three or four people pointing their bayonets to his belly, and swearing they would run him through. Buckley, who was one of them, said, upon my coming up, D - n him, is he come back again? One of them said, Yes; then he said, Search for his buckles; I told them they were not silver, but plated; they said, They would do for them. I am positive Buckley was one of the persons that were there; I am also certain that I saw Shenton with his bayonet pointing to Mr. Mawson's breast. When I came up, it was about nine o'clock, and there was light enough to distinguish their persons. Shenton had on a black coat, with a white waistcoat and breeches; Buckley was dressed as he is now.</p>

               <p>On the 8th of this month, myself, and some more officers from Bow-street, went to a broker's shop in <placeName id="t17810912-38-crimeloc190">Crown-court, Knaves Acre</placeName>

                        targets="t17810912-38-off188 t17810912-38-crimeloc190"/>. We got there about eight, or a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning. The broker was taking down the shutters of the shop. We asked if Mr. Burrows lodged there: he said, he had no lodgers in the house. I was not satisfied with that, but ran up stairs immediately. In the two-pair-of-stairs back room, the wife, I believe it is of the prisoner, was in bed: I did not say any thing to her; but she immediately jumped out of bed in her shift, and said, the man you want is in that room; that was the room opposite: she directly ran up the garret stairs. I thought what she was about, and ran by her upon the stairs. I went into the sore garret; there were there three, four, or five of the prisoner's children. Out of the garret on the left hand, there was a further room: there was a door-place, but no door. In that room, I saw the prisoner sitting at work, at a table at the further end of the room, with his back towards me; I could see him as soon as I got to the top of the stairs: he was in his waistcoat, without sleeves, and had a handkerchief tied over his head, and a green apron, or cloth, before him. I immediately ran towards him; he turned his head round: he had some scowering paper and a pair of knippers in his hand, which had either a counterfeit shilling or sixpence in it. I saw him fling it down, and there were three pieces lay together: I immediately catched hold of him as he was rising out of his chair, and then Prothero and Phillips came in. I held the prisoner's hands, and Phillips searched his pockets; he took some silver out of his left-hand pocket, and some colouring along with it.</p>
               <p>(A great quantity of blanks and counterfeit shillings produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. These were all upon the table he was at work at. They are all base-metal counterfeits of shillings and sixpences in different stages of the process: here are some that were rubbed with scowering paper.</p>
               <p>(A quantity of utensils and materials produced.)</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. Here are some of the filings of the base metal; here are cocks and sticks, which they smooth them with the last time before they put them into the liquor. We found some aqua fortis in the other garret, a pot with pickle in it, that is a composition made with aqua fortis; it makes a dampness upon the metal, and makes them have an old look.</p>
               <p>Who was with you besides Phillips and Prothero? - Jealous and Macmanus. There was a neighbouring gentleman, Mr. Poole, came up into the room.</p>

               <p>I went with the other officers from Bow-street. Mr. Carpmeal and I went up stairs: Mrs. Burrows was in bed in the two-pair-of-stairs room: we went into the room: said she, the man you want is in the room opposite. We were going to look through the key-hole of the door: she ran by, and ran up towards the garret; Carpmeal and I followed her, and got before her. In the back garret I saw Mr. Burrows, just as he had got up from the chair. Mr. Carpmeal went first into the room: he took hold of him, and I searched his pocket; he was in his waistcoat, and had a handkerchief tied about his head; I searched him; and in his left-hand waistcoat pocket I found these five counterfeit sixpences<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120037"/> loose, and some stuff for pickling: and I found a half-guinea and a half-crown in his breeches-pocket, good money, which I returned him. In the same room I found this pipkin, with the stuff that is now in it: in the fore room I found two phials of aqua fortis.</p>

When I first went into the shop, I asked the landlord of the house if he had any lodgers; he told me no; I said I was very sure he had: I desired Carpmeal to go up stairs; he went up, and in half a minute I followed him. When I got up stairs, they had got the prisoner in custody; he was close to the table. I saw all these implements there.</p>

               <p>Look at these blanks, and the implements produced, and give the Court an account of what they are. - These blanks are cast in flasks, upon a spray; then they are separated, and filed on the edges; then with scowering paper they take off the roughness the sand occasions; after that, they are put into aqua fortis, which forces the silver to the surface of the copper, and turns them white: then they are thrown into water; that mollifies the strength of the aqua fortis: then they are rubbed with sand and water, which takes off the stain left by the aqua fortis. Here is one sixpence in the rough; that is a blank: here is another finished, which is cast from the same pattern. These things produced are a complete apparatus for the colouring the metal. It is the custom now to cast them in the country, and send them up to London to be finished. Here is one sixpence found upon the table in the room, which is perfected; it is exactly the same impression of those found in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>How much silver is there in one of these counterfeit sixpences? - To the value of 2 d 1/2 or 2 d 3/4 in a shilling.</p>

The dies were fixed upon two large presses; one in the first cellar, the other in the cellar on the left-hand.

The reason of seizing her was, there were some counterfeit halfpence taken out of her pocket by Senhouse. The pieces produced are in three states; some are the blanks, some have the impression on them, and the others appear to have been shook in a bag, to rub off the roughness. Lees came out of the cellar, and slipped under my arm. The presses were very large, and calculated for men to work; but the women may be useful, to put the blanks between the dies. These presses could not be worked with a less number of people than were in the cellar.</p>

I saw Shrode looking out at the parlour window; she asked me What I wanted? I desired she would let me in; she said She would not open the door; upon which I went backwards, and was helped over a back wall by Grubb, who followed me, and he helped me into the back parlour window. I then went into the passage, to let Grubb in at the door; but, just as I got to the door, I saw the two men, and the other woman, coming up stairs, out of the kitchen. Marshall was without his coat and waistcoat; he had a leather apron and a night-cap on, and his sleeves tucked up. Stead was without his coat, and his sleeves were tucked up, but he had his waistcoat on.

               <p>I heard somebody run up stairs before we got into the house. When we got in, I bid Young go up and secure them, and I myself went down into the kitchen. In the back kitchen I found the windows all blinded up; so was the chimney-piece: and in that kitchen I saw the stamping-press, and a candle alight, and a halfpenny just struck, which was between the dies. In the fore kitchen I found a great quantity of dies. The window of that kitchen was so blinded, that people could not see into it from the street.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120040"/> We attempted to see, but could not. In the passage, under the stairs, there was a great quantity of blanks and copper, and a cutting-out press, and a candle also, lighted, by it. The men were stripped, and their hands were dirty.

Shrode, the old woman, ran to a chamber-pot, and wanted to wash her hands; but I would not let her, for her hands had the appearance of having been at work. There was a great sack of halfpence hanging up on one side of the stamping-press. There were twenty-six dies (producing them, and two that were in the press.)</p>

Marshall, when he was taken, begged for his clothes. I went down, and found his waistcoat below stairs, by the cutting press; and his hat and wig, and coat, in the front cellar, where the halfpence were found. When he was taken to the office, he owned that the hat, wig, and waistcoat, were his; and he put them on. There was a candle lighted at both presses. Moore's hands were dirty: whether the others were or not, I don't know; but I saw her run to the water to wash them. There were twelve pair of dies, besides those now produced.</p>

On Monday following, the 9th of July, in the morning, I got up a little before seven o'clock, and went into the stable. I perceived that my brown gelding was gone. I came from the stable into the garden. I saw the gardener, and asked him if he had seen William. The gardener told me he had not seen him that morning; that he had seen the key in the stable; and, missing the horse, he thought he was gone to take a ride. As he had no orders from me to take the horse, I thought it extremely odd he should take that liberty. I walked about the garden, thinking he might return about the time he expected I should rise. I waited till nine o'clock. He did not return. Then I suspected something had happened. I was determined to come to town. I called for my boots: they were missing. I enquired after the prisoner's clothes: I found they were gone. I came to town, and immediately went to the office in Bow-street; and, pursuing such methods as they thought proper, to apprehend him, I advertised the horse several days. Some time after, the horse was found at the Queen's-head, in Gray's-inn-lane.</p>
               <p>How long had the prisoner lived with you? - Five weeks. I had an exceeding good character with him, from a gentleman who knew his family. The horse was a brown gelding, with a star in his forehead, seven years old, fourteen hands and one inch high.</p>
               <p>Did you see the horse in the stable overnight? - I did.</p>

               <p>To Nowle. What did he say to you? - He desired me to give him a seed of corn, and he would come by-and-by for it. He had boots on: as for spurs, I cannot tell. The horse was there eight or nine days, before the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

On the 8th of last month, at about five in the afternoon, the three prisoners came into my master's shop, Davis asked to look at some silk and cotton handkerchiefs. I shewed them some. They turned them about a great while. At last, while she was looking at them, a gentleman came in for some thread. I turned about, to get him some thread; and while my back was turned, the two little girls, Crispin and Jones, went out. Davis bid me something for the handkerchiefs, which I could not take; and then she went out. Before the gentleman was gone, a young man, who was at the door, came in, and said, he believed some of the people who were gone out had taken some goods out of the shop. I followed them down Ship-alley, and overtook them. I desired them to come back. One of them refused. A constable came up to them, and

On Tuesday, the 14th of August, I was at an annual meeting in the neighbourhood. At near eleven o'clock at night, a person came in, and told my nephew he was wanted at home; then I was desired to step home. I went home, and found this woman (who was my house-keeper) in great distress. She said, two men had come, under a pretence of bringing a hare from my house at Snow-hill, the one a short man, the other a tall one; that they rushed in, seized her, and put a pistol to her head, while another tied her hands behind her with a garter; that then they went up stairs, and had stolen she did not know what. I ran up stairs, and missed many things. I did not at all like her account; she seemed flurried; and I thought she was a party concerned. There was a constable in the croud; I charged him with her, and sent her to the watch-house: I desired him to sit up with her, and to take particular care of her. I desired her to confess if she was a party concerned; but she denied every thing. The next morning the constable came to me, and told me he had tried if he could make any thing of her -</p>
               <p>Court. You must not tell what the constable said. Tell me what you lost? - I don't know that I can: I have not found the things she pretends I was robbed of. She told the constable, if he would go to such a place in my house, he would find some pawnbroker's duplicates; and, if he would get them out of my house, and bring them to her, he would be the best friend she ever had in her life. He came, and told me this; and we searched, and found the duplicates. We found, at different pawnbrokers, six shirts, two pair of everlasting bree ches; there were I don't know how many pair of silk stockings lost; two pair were found, four harrateen bed-curtains, the curtains of her own bed, two dimity waistcoats, a silk waistcoat, a blue coat and waistcoat, one table spoon, and a pair of tea spoons. After finding these duplicates, I found two nasty dirty rags upon the mantle-piece in the kitchen, behind the tinder-box; and they were as full of pawnbrokers duplicates as they could hold, by means of which I got a great number more of my things.</p>

I went up and down stairs, and found no person in the house but the prisoner, with her hands tied behind her with this garter. Mr. Crockett's nephew untied her. Mr. Crockett gave me charge of the prisoner. I searched her, and found this garter in her pocket, which she denied having got. I searched her pocket, and found a tin box, with a medal of Mr. Beckford gilt, and some duplicates. I went with her to the watch-house, and remained with her all night. She told me, in the course of the night, that when I went to Mr. Crockett's, I should find some things rolled up on the mantle-piece, by the side of the tinder-box; and if I would conceal them, and bring them to her, she would esteem me as a great friend. I told her I would. She said, Under the bason, on the shelf, I should find five or six sixpences, and desired me to bring them. In the morning, Mr. Crockett desired me to take up Taylor. In the night, the prisoner asked me, when I searched her room, if I found a gown. I said, No. She said, How could Mr. Crockett think she had planned the robbery, when she was robbed herself? When I took Taylor, she told me she had pawned the gown the week before: I believe it was pawned the 8th of August.</p>

               <p>To Taylor. Did you pawn a gown of her own the week before? - Yes; she sent me the week before with it.</p>

A little girl came in, and asked me if I had sold some shoes to the boy that went out? I said, No; and went to the door, and saw the prisoner with a pile of shoes under her arm. I cried out, Stop! and I saw him catched, with the shoes under his arm, about twenty yards from our door. He was brought back to our shop. There were only three pair of shoes found. They were my father's property.</p>

He begged I would let him go. I said, I was afraid he had stole something. When the people came up, they said he had stole some shoes from Mr. Bendick. Another lad got over into the ditch, and found three pair of shoes.

               <p>The prisoner came in about ten o'clock at night, on the 21st of July. He had the key of the outer door; for we kept the room he went through locked always. I thought he was going to bed; but he came down again in about ten minutes, gave me the key, and said he was going out again. He did not return<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120048"/> again. I went up between eleven and twelve o'clock, and missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) out of my drawers. I had seen every thing in the drawers, in the afternoon, between four and five o'clock. I locked the room-door then, and kept the key. The next morning, my husband had intelligence where the prisoner was. He got a constable, and took him. I went to him: he said, he was very sorry for what he had done, and hoped I would excuse him. I asked him where my aprons and handkerchiefs were. He said, he could not tell me where they were; they might be shook out of the bundle, for what he knew: he did not know what he took. There are two aprons and two handkerchiefs missed, that are not found.</p>

Upon the 15th of August, the two prisoners met me at Kensington, and asked me to give them a lift to Brentford. I took them up. When we came to the Pack-horse, on Turnham-green, they gave me part of two pots of beer. Soon after I went from that house, about 300 yards, I fell off the shafts, and fell under the wheel. I was very badly bruised, and insensible for two or three days after. When I was in St. George's fields, I saw the skins in the hamper, on the top of the waggon, and twenty-five shillings worth of halfpence. The skins and the halfpence were lost out of the hamper. After the accident, I was put on the top of the waggon, and carried home.</p>

               <p>I am a broker, at No. 17, in Long-lane, West-Smithfield. On the 15th of August,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120049"/> I was at the Red-lion, in Piccadilly, between two and three o'clock. I saw the man in green (Jones) there. A countryman came in with three skins, which he said he had to sell. The prisoner asked him the price. He said he had them from his father, in the country: he said the price was 9 s. The prisoner said he would give him 7 s. if the breeches-maker would say they would make him a pair of breeches; and they went out together.</p>
               <p>To Bocock. What is the value of the skins? - About twenty shillings, or a guinea.</p>
               <p>Court to Morgan. What was you doing at the Red-lion? - Drinking a pint of beer. I had been at a bull-baiting at Putney. The prisoner was there before me.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - I had seen him before.</p>
               <p>Were you drinking together? - No; he sat in another box.</p>
               <p>How long before the countryman came in? - Not long; for I was not there above a quarter of an hour myself.</p>
               <p>Was any other person present? - I saw nobody else present, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>You were alone? - Yes; I was alone, and the prisoner was alone.</p>
               <p>And the countryman came in alone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you three the only persons in the tap-room? - No; there were more people in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Did you see the skins? - I saw skins; I did not take notice of them.</p>
               <p>How did the conversation begin? - He said he had some skins sent him out of the country, which he must sell, because he wanted money.</p>
               <p>Who did he say that to? - To the company, not to any body in particular. The prisoner asked the price of them.</p>
               <p>From the Jury. How came you to be found out, to become a witness? - The prisoner know'd something of me, and desired me to come.</p>
               <p>Did he know your name? - I gave him my name. He pretended he had some stockings. I wanted some stockings. He had none with him that suited me. I told him I lived at No. 17, in Long-lane.</p>
               <p>Did he give you his name? - No; I did not ask him his name.</p>
               <p>To Green. Did the two prisoners come to you both together, or first one, and then the other? - Jones asked me first; then they both came together in company. Jones came first round the waggon. I did not see Rigby till they asked me to let them get up.</p>

               <p>My husband keeps the Roebuck, in Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner Rigby? - Yes. Upon the 15th of August, between the hours of nine and twelve, he came with two young men - at about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>How long did he remain in your house? - Very few minutes; while they drank half a pint of gin, and called for another half pint, and I draw'd it.</p>
               <p>Did he come in at any other time after that? - I did not observe any thing that passed after that.</p>
               <p>Was he there at twelve o'clock? - I can't say: I should not have observed it then, had not these young men been with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Who came in company with him? - Two young fellows that had been fixed, and imprisoned twelve months, and were that day released.</p>
               <p>Were any others in company with them? - A young woman that has been examined,

            ; she came in with Rigby and those young fellows.</p>
               <p>Do you know her very well? - Yes; they came with these two young fellows, and another young woman with them.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether they all five came in together, or came separately? - I could not say positively: I asked them to eat a crust of bread and cheese; she was then with them: I brought out the bread and cheese; they said they did not chuse any.</p>
               <p>Was there any more in company than those five? - I believe there was a gentlewoman in a black cloak, and laced bonnet; I did not take particular notice of her: there were three men, and three women.</p>
               <p>How came you not to mention the second woman, if she was in the company that came with Sharpe? - I did not know her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120051"/>Did you know the other young woman? - Her name was Strickling.</p>
               <p>Did they come in with the young men, or did the young men come in before them? - I can't say: they drank the gin together; the two young men came together with Rigby, as near as I can say, between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Did the three young women come in with them, or come in afterwards? - I could not recollect whether the young men came in first, or the young women, or whether they came in together.</p>
               <p>How long did they all stay? - Not more, I believe, than five minutes; no longer than while I served them; the young men and young women went away together.</p>
               <p>And that was in a few minutes, and you saw nothing of them afterwards? - I could not positively say: I have a young family: I was backwards in my own kitchen; afterwards in the bar at times.</p>
               <p>Did they come back and dine at your house? - That I could not positively say, for I am never present at dinner; my husband is generally in the way; I could not see what passed.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect their ordering dinner? - The young fellows had a leg of mutton, or leg of lamb, roasted at my house, but they did not dine at my house; it was carried home to their place of abode; I suppose, about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Where was it sent to? - One of the young women fetched it.</p>
               <p>What young woman? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What time was it ready? - A few minutes, I believe, past two o'clock.</p>
               <p>You don't know the young woman that fetched it? - Not particularly; I have a young family to attend.</p>
               <p>Were there any potatoes to it? - There was no garden-stuff of any kind dressed at my house.</p>
               <p>Were there no potatoes? - No: they said they had French beans, as far as I can remember, at home.</p>
               <p>Where was that home, where they had the French beans? - I forget the name of the court.</p>
               <p>At whose lodgings? - The young woman, Strickling's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Recollect, if you can, the name of the court? - I could not recollect the court.</p>
               <p>Do you know Strickling very well? - I know her by sight.</p>
               <p>At her lodgings they dined? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They had French beans there? - They said they had French beans there, in the morning, when they brought the lamb.</p>
               <p>Who paid you for this meat? - Nobody. They brought it to be roasted; they said the French beans they would do themselves.</p>
               <p>Who brought it? - The young woman I mentioned.</p>

               <p>Was you paid any thing for the dressing of it? - No.</p>
               <p>Had they their beer from your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And their punch? - They had no punch from our house.</p>
               <p>Who paid for what they had from your house? - This young woman, called Strickling.</p>
               <p>On what occasion was it they dined at Strickling's lodgings? - I can't tell: I asked them no questions.</p>

               <p>Did they help you up again? - No. It was at my own apartment, three doors from the Roebuck.</p>

               <p>How long was it before you lost him, so as to see him no more? - About twelve o'clock: I had a bit of a luncheon; I went into the Roebuck, and he and his wife were at dinner together, and two more men; but I can't say who they were.</p>

On the 13th of September, I went to Deptford, to receive six months pay, due to me from the Greenwich man of war; after that, I returned between eleven and twelve at night; going along the Strand, I met the prisoner, near the New-Church; I returned back with her to Mr. Davis's, the One-Bell Inn; we went up into a room together; I called for some rum, which I paid for; she then asked me for a present; I gave her half a crown; we went to bed together; the candle was almost out; the prisoner bid me not put it out; I fell asleep in three minutes: I had put my breeches under my head.</p>
               <p>Were you sober? - Yes: I had drank nothing but sixpennyworth of rum and water, and a pint of beer, when I went to bed: I had seven guineas in my pocket; I had counted it in my pocket, just before I met the prisoner. No person was near me, so as to have taken this money, nor was I in any situation afterwards, so that it could have fallen out of my pocket, between the time I counted it, and my going to bed. I was waked by the waiter, about two in the morning; he asked me if I had lost any thing, and he brought the prisoner into the room. I then examined my breeches pockets, which were still under my head, where I put them, and found that out of seven guineas, five were gone: I examined all round the bed, to see if any had dropped, but I found none. I told the waiter I had lost five guineas: the prisoner strongly denied the charge; the watchman was sent for, and she was carried to the watch-house, and there searched; and the five guineas were found concealed in her shoes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you took up your breeches, whether the money did not fly about the room? - It did not. No money flew out of my pocket.</p>

On my offering to search the prisoner, she gave me the pocket-book: the bank-note was not in it; but I took two guineas out of her pocket, and they had bought clothes with the rest of the money: she said this was the book she took from Mr. Strachan; afterwards she said it was the book the note was in.

At twelve o'clock at night, on the 17th of July, when my lodgers came home, I fastened all the doors of my house, and also fastened my own room door, and went to bed. I waked at four o'clock in the morning; it was then day-light. I found my room door open, and the door into the road open. My breeches were pulled from under my pillow, and lay in the middle of the floor. The key of the bureau was taken out of my pocket. I missed a purse from my bureau, with nineteen or twenty guineas in it; and from another drawer I lost about 8 l. By the advice of my neighbours, I lay still, and did not stir in it for a week. Janes and his wife continued still to lodge with me. They had gone out that morning before I waked; but that was not usual. They came home that night, and continued to lodge with me. Mason had been on liking to me, as my servant, about a week, and went away about a fortnight after the robbery. About ten days after, on the information of a person not present, I had Mason taken up. There was a petticoat and handkerchief found upon her, belonging to my sister. Upon her information, I had the two other prisoners taken up, but nothing was found upon them.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Eaton. On Saturday, the 21st of July, between seven and eight in the evening, the prisoner came into our shop. I was serving a lady with some boy's brown thread stockings. The prisoner said he was in no hurry, and wanted to see a pair of silk stockings which were in the window, which he shewed me. I took them out, and told him they were fine silk. He said, he thought they were silk and worsted. I then told him we had some spun silk that would look well, and come cheaper. I turned my back, to get the bundle down. As I was coming down, I saw the prisoner shuffle with his hand in his pocket. I went to reach down some more; and, turning round, I saw him shuffle with his hand again. I came round, and missed the stockings off the counter. I looked very stedfast at the prisoner, and then at the stockings. He ran out of the shop. I jumped over the counter, and ran after him. He was pushed down by a man coming along: I then came up to him, and took three pair of stockings out of his pocket (producing them); they have my master's mark on them.</p>

I gave him sixpence in part, out of a box in which I kept the silver. I then went round to an adjoining room, to strike a light. Turning suddenly round, I saw the prisoner leaning over the counter. He ran out of the shop directly; and I saw him go into a publick-house opposite. I missed the box: there might be 20 s. in it; but I can swear I put in 6 s. I went over to the public-house. The prisoner was gone. Soon after, I was informed that Carpmeal had taken him. He brought him into the shop. 14 s. 4 d. and a pair of new pumps, were found upon him.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120057"/> When he first came into the shop, he had a blue jacket on; when he was taken up, he had a brown great coat over that jacket. He afterwards escaped out of the cage, and was retaken. I had seen him before frequently, and knew him well. I had light enough to discern him. When he was taken, he denied having been in the shop at all.</p>

               <p>(Inspects the several articles produced)</p>
               <p>Here are counterfeit pieces of money, finished in all the process, from the casting to the finishing.</p>
               <p>Are they finished shillings, in a state fit for circulation? - After being scowered, they are thrown into aqua fortis; the water is to mollify the aqua-fortis; and then they use sand and water to take off the stain the aqua-fortis has left.</p>
               <p>Prothero. The door went at once, but only it catched the sleeve of my coat; and Morant pushed against it to lessen it, and tore the sleeve of my coat.</p>
               <p>To Clark. Whether those finished, and those rough, are the same cast? - There is not the least doubt of it: those who cast the pieces, that are finished, cast those that are in the rough.</p>
               <p>Court. They immerse the piece in aqua-fortis, and afterwards in water? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There must be a vessel to hold the aqua-fortis, and another to hold the water? - Yes. If ever we find pickle that has been made use of, we produce it. After the metal has been put into pickle, it loses the strength and turns green: that we have produced when we have found it, but we never produced the water.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. The water, and stuff to blacken it, is only to lessen the colour of the silver, which the aqua-fortis gives it? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. From the things found in the room, which have been produced, the prisoner could not then be employed in the act of colouring, without the vessel of the pickle had been removed. Certainly.</p>

            ? - Yes. He lived in Crown-court, in the Old Change, near Doctors Commons.</p>
               <p>Have you been at his house? - I was there with him from the Sunday till he was taken up; he lived in the two pair of stairs room: it looked out forward: there is no back-room.</p>
               <p>What was he employed in? - He scowered some half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences. After they were scowered, he put them into a bason, and put some aqua fortis over them. When they had been there some little time, he took them out, and put them into cold water, and then scowered them again with some house-sand. Then he rubbed them with a greasy cloth, and said then they were fit to lay out.</p>
               <p>Had they that appearance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at that (shewing her a finished counterfeit shilling). - I have seen him do a great many like this.</p>
               <p>When he first began them, were they like that? (shewing her a piece as it came from the casting) - Yes; he brought them to me several times as he had them from the casters.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Are you the wife of the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>You passed as his wife? - Yes, during the time I was there.</p>
               <p>Was what you are talking of done in the day or night time? - Mornings and evenings, from six o'clock to nine or ten. Sometimes he would come home to tea, and go to work. I was not there all day.</p>
               <p>I believe you are very well known in this court? - I never was here but upon a just cause.</p>
               <p>You have been at this bar, I believe? - Not for coining.</p>
               <p>But for several other offences? - No; not several other offences.</p>
               <p>Court. You lived with this man as his wife? - Yes; he took the lodgings: I was with him.</p>
               <p>Who did you give the information to? - To a relation of mine. I fell ill, and I was terrified at the thoughts of this employment, and I divulged it to my relations.</p>
               <p>You were at the door, taking in milk, when the officers came? - I was not: I was up stairs in the room.</p>
               <p>How long had you lived with him? - Five days.</p>
               <p>You know him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And lived with him before? - Only three days, at Battle-bridge. Then I sent to my relations, to fetch me away.</p>
               <p>It was when you fell ill, you began to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120060"/> terrified at this employment? - Yes; I was only three days.</p>
               <p>How long was that before the time he was taken up? - About three weeks.</p>
               <p>If you were terrified with his conduct before, when you fell ill, how came you to go on that Sunday, and live with him five days after? - Because he was not to do any thing more of the sort, only a few he had then he was to finish.</p>
               <p>Though he was to do no more of that business, to induce you to live with him, yet he continued to do it the whole time you lived with him? - Yes; night and morning.</p>
               <p>Did you reproach him with his breach of promise? - He said, Nothing should happen to me: if he was taken, he could always clear me.</p>
               <p>If you was terrified with his employment, what induced you to return to him again? - I really don't know what induced me: I was very ill, and really don't know. I happened to meet with him, and did not know how to get from him.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you go back with him to have an opportunity of giving information against him, that he might be taken at work? - I did not.</p>
               <p>How long before he was taken did you determine to give information against him? - Three days.</p>

He chose a pair which came to four guineas. Then he asked to see some paste knee buckles. I shewed him some. He chose a pair which came to 38 s. and he had a little gold shirt-pin, for his shirt, at 4 s. Then pulling out his purse, as if he was going to pay for them, he said, I believe I have not cash enough about me; but here is a draught on a banker, which is the same thing as money; it will be paid when presented. I looked at the draught. I took it; the sum being so small, and knowing the house. He asked for a pair of silver spurs. I shewed him some. He said they were not the sort he wanted. I told him I had some in hand, which would be ready in a few days. He said, You must send me a pair. I took a little memorandum book, to take his directions. The draught lay upon the counter. I supposed his to be the same name as the signature to the draught, H. Turner. I wrote in the book, H. Turner, Esq. He looked over me at the same time. He desired me to add, jun. Noah's-row, Hampton-court. This was the direction where I was to have sent the spurs. He made some words about the price of the knee-buckles: I agreed to give him 2 s. out of it. He did not take the 2 s. He said, he would settle that when the spurs were sent to him. He went away. The next day, I sent the draught to the banker's, for the money. It was not paid, but was returned. I went to enquire at Green-street, from whence the bill was dated; but I could find no such name as H. Turner, in Green-street. The next day, I sent to Hampton-court; but there was no such name to be found there, nor such place as Noah's-row. Then I advertised the things, with a description of the person.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he was taken? - No.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner. Is that the young man? - Yes; he was taken the next day<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120063"/> after it was inserted in the paper. I saw him at the Office in Bow-street. He said very little there.</p>
               <p>You are sure he is the same person? - Yes, I am.</p>

               <p>About six weeks before I went to Mr. Elliot's house, I went to Barnfield, for the recovery of my health, and boarded with one West, at the Salutation tavern. We used often to go to Kew-green, to a reputable house there, where was a billiard-table. I used frequently to play there. One morning a gentleman addressed me, and asked me to play a game at billiards for a gill of wine. I said I had no objection. When we were in the room, he proposed to play for half-a-crown. We played till I won 9 l. of him. He said, he supposed I should have no objection to take a draught on his banker. I looked at it, and saw it was on Brown and Collinson. I made no scruple to take it. I afterwards tendered it to Mr. Elliott, and he readily accepted it. I saw the advertisement tended to my person. I was at the Salutation. I said to a person, here is a note seems to tend to my person. I was invited to go down and see a gentleman, who said his name was Turner, at Noah's-row, Hampton-court; that he had a brother just come from Cambridge; that I must enquire for Mr. Turner, jun. I had a pair of spurs on, which he admired, and desired me to bring them with me when I came down to him. There was a marker present, at the time we played together. I have made enquiry after the marker, but could not discover any such person.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday, the 13th of June, I had been to Deptford, to receive some money. In coming home again; I crossed the water. I came up Gravel-lane, to Ratcliff-highway. There I took a coach. Going up Cannon-street road, I thought it was a dangerous place. I put my money under the coach seat.

Stewart got in at the coach-door, on the off side: the other, I think, was Vandersall; but I cannot be positive to him, though I am to Stewart. Stewart said, D - n your eyes, your watch and money, or I'll blow your brains out! I said, I had neither watch nor money; I had been upon a party of pleasure, and had spent all. He said, D - n your eyes, that shan't serve your turn; I will search. I had in my left-hand pocket a cork-screw, and some halfpence: the cork-screw was taken, whether any of the halfpence were or not; I do not know the number of them. Stewart then lifted up the cushion of the fore seat, and searched under it. He said to me, D - n you, sit back, or I'll blow your brains out. I said, You have searched me; I have neither watch nor money; what money I had I spent upon a party of pleasure. They said they would search me, and bid me get up. I then took the money up in my left-hand. Stewart said, D - n you, you have bid it in your hand. Then I dropped it into my pocket, and with my left hand got hold of Stewart's right hand, in which he held his pistol. I struck him over the head, and threw myself down out of the coach upon him. I said,

             a great while. Upon my saying that, Stewart turned his pistol round, and shot at me. The ball just grazed my head, and took the skin and some of my hair off. Then the other came to the coach, and cried out, D - n you, now blow his brains out. He shot at me, but missed me. The third man then left the horse's head, and came and cut me with a hanger. These are the clothes (producing a coat with eight or ten cuts in the shoulders); I had wounds in my shoulders corresponding with these cuts. Stewart desired me to loose him; but I kept my hold. Upon this, I called to the coachman to come down, and said, I would take them. Upon that, they ran away. Stewart, I believe it was, left his hat behind him.</p>

I saw Stewart at Gosport coming a-shore one day upon the beach. I happened to meet him. He asked me what ship I belonged to: I said, I had been lately discharged from on board the Diligent. I asked him, before we parted, to have a glass of liquor. There were two horses standing at the door, one of the men booted and spurred, to go to the fair. It was at a house kept by Wall, this man's father. Afterwards I met him, and asked him what sort of pleasure he had at the fair. He said, very good. I saw him likewise on Tuesday, and on the Wednesday. I never saw him from that time till I saw him here.</p>

Upon seeing them go towards her, I drank my beer, and then went after them. I went round another field, and laid myself down behind the hedge facing her: there I saw one of the prisoners hold her hands fast, and the other taking things out of her pocket. Hatchett said, Now, d - n your eyes, you bitch, if you do not give me your stays, I will cut your throat. Upon that the prosecutrix called out, For the Lord's sake, leave me my stays; but they repeated that again; upon which she called out, Murder. Hatchett answered, If you squall out murder, d - n your eyes, you bitch, I'll cut your throat. Upon this, I jumped over the hedge to them, and said, You have been robbing the poor girl: upon that Hatchett came up with a pen-knife, and said, You Jew bugger, what is that to you?

               <p>I was coming home from Hampstead. I sat down in a field to rest me, and the two women at the bar, came up and beat me, and robbed me. One snatched my cap off; then they took the things out of my bundle, and a note of hand for 2 l. 10 s. which has never been found since: they d - n'd me, and said they would cut my throat, if I did not give them my stays. They cut the string of my stays. I called out, Murder! upon which, the Jew came over, and spoke to them: then he went to the alehouse, and brought the other man, and they took them to the

               <p>When I met the prosecutrix, we had been to Battle-bridge, to get eight-pennyworth of meat: the other woman stopped her, and said, Here is a new whore; she shall give us some gin. We returned back to her: she said she had but 6 d. that she picked up a gentleman; that he took her to the George, and he had given her something to drink; and that it had made her head bad: that two girls had taken the gentleman from her: I said I would go, and get them to give her something: I went to them, and asked them, how they came to take the gentleman from her: and one said, that the gentleman had kept her: she reached, and was very ill, and this cap dropped out of her pocket, and they picked up this necklace and things in the house. The Jew said, if it was possible, for the sake of the reward, he would have our lives.</p>

When I came into the one-pair-of stairs room, she asked me for some money to drink: I gave her sixpence; when she threw me on the bed, having previously called out for another woman, by the name of Nancy Green, to come into the room. She then clapped her knee upon my belly: and then Green took hold of the handkerchief about my neck, and held me by that; then the prisoner took a handkerchief out of my waistcoat pocket, and threw it to Green: then they attempted to take out another handkerchief, which had ten guineas in it: I struggled for that: then she d - n'd my eyes, and said she would run me through with a knife, if I did not let go the handkerchief. Upon which I let it go, money and all, for I was in bodily fear: then they ran down stairs: I followed them, and went to a neighbour's I knew, and they were taken up that night.</p>

            . She directed me to his mother's house: she said her name was Donne. I went to the house she had directed me to. Mrs. Donne came to the door. I asked her some questions. She said she did not live there, but lived two doors farther. I went there, and asked whether Mrs. Donne lived there. A woman came out, and said, No; she lived up those steps; directing me to the place I had seen her at before. I went back, and found the door was fast. I knocked, and told them, if they did not open the door, I would break it open. She made a very impudent answer. The prisoner hearing me so positive, got up, and opened the door. I said, I think you are the lad I want. He said, I heard of this last night: by which I suppose he meant the business I came upon. The prisoner desired me to stop till his mother fetched something to drink. I did so. I then sent for the prosecutrix. She came up into the room, and identified the person of the prisoner. I took him to the watch-house, and put him into the cage. The prisoner's father-in-law, who was in the watch-house, went up to the cage. I bid him come down. Then I shut the door, and took the prisoner out of the cage, and brought him into the watch-house. He put his hand in his fob, and pulled out two sixpences, a farthing, and three halfpence. I asked, Is this all? He said, Yes. I said, I shall search you farther. I put my hand into his fob, and pulled out a bit of a ring, and said, How came you by this? He said, at first, I do not know: at last, he said, she (meaning Mrs. Bockey) gave it me last night. I searched farther. I could not find any thing. At last, I searched his shirt-collar, and behind I thought I felt some money. The prisoner then offered to fight. I desired my partner to take the thing off his neck. He did. It was a handkerchief. He took it off, and took out two half-crowns and 5 s. 6 d. and gave it into my hand. I went to the prosecutrix, and asked what she had lost. She said, 29 or 30 s. in silver and halfpence, and a bit of a broken gold ring; that she could swear to a bad shilling and a bad sixpence. I asked what sort of a ring it was: she said it had a large red stone, and two small ones. She picked a bad shilling and sixpence out of the other money. I went up to see if her room-door was broke open: I found the bolt and the lock bent double.</p>

I asked him to drink with me. He came and sat down with me, and I called for a pint of beer. I had often seen him in that house. We sat together about three quarters of an hour. I called the mistress of the house, and gave her a shilling to change; and took my watch out, and laid it down on the table. I looked over my right shoulder at the dial, and felt the watch go from under my left hand. I saw the prisoner take it up, and go out of the door with it. It being dark, we could not apprehend him: there were only women in the house, except another man, as infirm as myself. Three weeks after, he was taken, and I saw him before Justice Sherwood. I never recovered my watch. He said, before the justice, that he had it in his hand, and laid it down again. I saw the watch as he was going out at the door: the key was sticking out between his finger and thumb.</p>

               <p>I went out for snuff for him. The watch lay on the table. When I came back again, there was a sailor and he together: he was in liquor, half asleep and half awake. I shook hands with him, and wished him good night. I never heard it was lost till the next morning. I went to the prosecutor's house, to see about it. He was out: he had been out with his Moll all night.</p>
               <p>Was you in liquor? - No. I paid two guineas and a half for the watch about a fortnight before.</p>

She came out of the box, and I went to the other end of the shop, and she came into the shop. She opened the door, behind which hung six or seven gowns; and about ten minutes after, my master, coming down from breakfast, missed the gown, and asked me where it was. The prisoner came back, and seemed much confused, and said she wanted a pair of wires, which is a pair of ear-rings. I served her, and then followed her to her lodgings. Between our house and the lodgings I took her, with the gown in her lap. She came back, and my master charged a constable with her.</p>

I gave her a pattern. She asked for a pair of stockings and a pair of pockets. She bought a pair of stockings and a pair of pockets. She bought the pockets first: she gave me a shilling, which I put in the till, where there was no other silver. Then she gave me 2 s. 6 d. The price of the stockings was 2 s. 3 d. I was to give her 3 d. in change. There was one sixpence I rather suspected, which I shewed to Mr. Steel, the shopman. He said, he must cut it. The girl said, she did not know it was bad, but she would fetch 3 d. and went away with the stockings and pockets.</p>
               <p>Did she come back to the shop? - No: the next evening Mr. Steel saw her go into the next haberdasher's, and he brought her into our shop.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to Messrs. Sleath and Thurpp. The prisoner came into the shop. She asked the last witness to let her see some pockets. She paid for the stockings. The money was put into the till. When she paid the other money, a sixpence was brought to me: it was a bad one. I said to the girl, Do you know what you are liable to? She said, Lord! Sir, is it a bad one? I said, Yes: I must cut it. She said, she would bring 3 d. and leave the sixpence as security. When she was gone, I thought the shilling in the till might be bad. I took it out, and looked at it, and the rest of the money; and found it was all bad, except one sixpence. The next evening, I saw her in the next shop. I said, You did not bring me the 3 d. She said, You owe me 3 d. I brought her into the shop. I asked her if she had a father. She said, yes; but he was drowned at sea. I charged a constable with her, and we took her to the compter. There she was searched. A guinea, and about 2 s. and something that made near half-a-crown, was found upon her. That was all good. We asked her how she came by the guinea. She said her mistress gave it her, to buy some things, or fetch some things out of pawn: the other money was her own. She would not tell where her mistress lived. There was a key: I asked her how she came by the key. She said she found it in Moorfields. We asked her what it was the key of. She said, any door. A man came in, and asked her something: she said, there was no occasion to answer their questions, and she would not answer them. On Monday, she was taken to the magistrate. Her mistress came to see her in the compter: she proved to be a Mrs. Lyney, in Hope-street, Spitalfields. The Lord-Mayor asked the mistress if she gave her any money. She said she gave her a guinea, to fetch things out of pawn, and gave her three shillings and two sixpences. I went to Hope-street, to enquire if Mrs. Lyney lived there. I found she did. The girl was committed for further examination. I gave the money this afternoon to the moneyer of the Mint.</p>
               <p>That was the money you saw given? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alderman WOOLDRIDGE sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - I do. On Sunday, the 5th of August, I dined at Mr. Alder's, at Finchley. As I was coming to town, at about nine o'clock in the evening, when I had got to about fifty yards from what is called the Half-way-house between <placeName id="t17810912-77-crimeloc383">London</placeName>

The man on my right hand had a pistol, and the man on the left hand had a cutlass in his hand. I said I would not be robbed. One of them said, We will cut you down; blast you, we will cut you down. They took hold of my bridle; upon which my horse reared. My saddle was covered with a goat's skin, which had the appearance of holsters. I had no weapon but a small whip, which my wife rides with, covered with silver for about four inches. I shortened it in this manner (describing it) under my arm; and it being bright, they took it, I presume, for a pistol. I presented it at the man's head who was on my left hand, and swore I would blow his brains out. The two men then ran. The roads divide, one to Gray's-inn-lane, the other to Tottenham-court-road: the two men took the left hand, and the third man the right hand road.</p>
               <p>Was you coming along the Tottenham-court road? - I was on the Kentish-town road, beyond where it divides; beyond the house situated at the end of what they call Fig-lane. I thought it safest to pursue the one man. I called out, Robbers! and trotted briskly after that man, which was the prisoner; and I took him. While the two men were with me, he stood at a distance; he never spoke, nor made use of any threat whatever. When I charged him with being one of the men, he denied it. Upon taking him to the public-house, he was searched, and in his pocket was found this cat (producing it.) I sent for a constable, and delivered him in charge.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be in company with the other two men? - Most certainly.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be in conversation with them, or speak to them? - What he said to them before, I do not know: he never spoke or acted while they were with me. I am reluctantly the prosecutor; but the justice forced me to prosecute, against my will. The prisoner was examined the next morning before Justice Girdler. He was there asked to confess, and told that it should be better for him.</p>
               <p>Court. We must not hear any thing that he said after that.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120073"/>Mr. Wooldridge. In consequence of that promise, and in consequence of his information, the other parties were taken, who had robbed Mr. Rainsforth five minutes before. I wished very much, before the justice, not to have been bound over; but the justice let the man who was at my horse's head escape, against my will, and bound me over to prosecute the prisoner, who was not acting, and who did not put me in fear. The person who was at my horse's head, and who actually robbed Mr. Rainsforth, was permitted to escape. The prisoner is a lighter-man: he offered to go into the King's service; and he is very fit, and able.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am a freeman and a liveryman of the city of London, and have a boat of my own: I should not chuse to go to sea.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

Coming away, the prisoner, Atkins, came up to me, and pressed me to give him one pot of beer. I said, I did not mind one pot; he should have it. I ordered the beer at the tap. They delayed bringing it ten or fifteen minutes: during which time Atkins and I continued together, were talking together; and Atkins took hold of my handkerchief, and was playing with it. As I got up to go away, he laid hold of the silk handkerchief he had been playing with, which was about my neck, and dragged me across the yard, into a shed, where the prisoners eat and drink. The second person who laid hold of me was Trenter, who was shot afterwards. He laid hold of me immediately after Atkins. The other pushed me behind, and dragged me into the shed. When they got me to the shed, they pulled my hat over my eyes, so as entirely to prevent my seeing, and took my handkerchief off my neck. I kept one hand in my breeches-pocket. They cut my breeches across my thigh, and cut through: they cut my hand in my pocket, and cut my thigh an inch and an half long. They took out of my shoes a pair of silver buckles. One took out of my pocket four pods of carnation seeds, and then said, Let him go; we have pretty well sifted him. I put up one of my hands, to move my hat off my eyes, and they scratched the skin off the back of that hand. Then they let me go, and flung my hat over the gates after me. This was at the time of the riots in the prison. When they let me go, I saw a great many, but not so as to discern any of them in particular.</p>

               <p>I was committed for a rescue. The prosecutor and prisoner were together, by the hole of the tap-room. When the prosecutor was taken to the shed, I and Atkins staid at the hole; and Atkins was there when the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120074"/> prosecutor came out of the shed. I saw him at the hole when the prosecutor was dragged away. He was left there. He was in company with the prosecutor before he was dragged away. When they dragged Mr. Lawrence away, he was left at the hole; he was not in the shed at all.</p>

               <p>I remember seeing the prosecutor at the prison. I saw him dragged from the hole where they serve the beer. Atkins was with some of the prisoners at the hole: I do not think he was near Lawrence. Lawrence was with one set of people, Atkins with another: I do not think Atkins was near Lawrence: quite different sets, and not in company at all, and not together at all. I was with Atkins close to the hole, but Lawrence was about five yards off. When he was dragged away, Atkins and the people with him staid still in their places; and I was never off the bench. The prisoner never moved from that place; he was there when Lawrence was dragged away. I had no conversation with Lawrence before he was dragged away. I am sure Atkins had not left his station when Lawrence came from the shed, and did not carry the beer to the shed at all.</p>

               <p>I am committed for an assault. I saw the prosecutor dragged to the shed. He was standing very near the hole, within a yard or two, about half a minute before that. Atkins came to me with half-a-crown to change, for some beer. When Lawrence was dragged away, Atkins still continued to wait for his change, and waited three or four minutes. When he got the change, he went into the shed. It was just the time Lawrence came from it into the yard.</p>
               <p>To Lawrence. Did you know the prisoner before that day? - No: what makes me so sensible of him, was, I talked with him for, I believe, fifteen minutes. I afterwards picked out the two men. As soon as Atkins came up to the place, I said, That is the man; then the two came out with the cutlass, and rushed at the turnkey.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor was himself a runner at Justice Welch's.</p>

I went to the window immediately. I saw the pointing of the tiles disturbed. I had a suspicion of the prisoner. I went round to his master's, which was the next door, and found him there. I looked out of the window there, and saw another tile disturbed, which I could not see out of my own window. I told Mr. Wright, his master, that I had been robbed, and suspected<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120075"/> the prisoner. He was by. I pointed out the tiles to him and his master.

The window of the shop where he works was shut when he came; but just before seven o'clock I missed him out of the room. I suspected he was in the necessary: but as I was going up, I pushed the door open; and he was then in the room, putting his coat on. He wanted to play with me all the afternoon, to drive me out of the room up one pair of stairs, where he was at work. I came down stairs again; and the prisoner came down and asked my mistress for 1 s. and went out. Then, when he was gone, I went in, and found the window was wide open.</p>

               <p>Where was you when you saw him? - In the yard where I live, three doors from Mr. Wright's.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This shed, that belongs to Mr. Wright, is situated near the window I generally used to work at. It is hardly to be thought a person, such as I, who have but one leg, should get out on the tiles.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Could a man get from Mr. Wright's to your window without danger of falling? - Yes; there are but seven tiles from one to the other.</p>
               <p>Do you know where the last witness lives; could he in the yard see a person go from one window to the other? - Yes, very plain; he could see a cat.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called a witness, who said it was dangerous going from one window to the other.)</p>

When I set them down, I went into the house to get my money, as I was to be paid separately. I got the money of two of them. I heard the coach move, and I ran out of doors.

I then heard the sound of horses and persons. I called out, A highwayman! Upon which the prisoner went off. I presently met two men: I told them the story; and after some persuasions, telling them he was badly mounted, they pursued him, and took him. I saw him at a public-house.
