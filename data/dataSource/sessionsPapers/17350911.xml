Then we agreed to take Coach and go to Hornsey, and Nell and I and Freeman and one Allington got in; but Freeman bid the Coachman drive to the Two Sawyers and Hand-and-pen in Fleet-lane.

            . When we came back to the Three Daggers Alehouse I laid my self on a Box to sleep, and while I was dozing, Nell Byrom snatched the Watch out of my Pocket; I asked her what she meant by that; Why, says she, This is mine as well as the Ring; but I will give it you again if you will go with me to see my Husband in Newgate. So in hopes of getting my Watch, I went with her; but when we came there, her Husband Will Byrom was in bed, and she said to him, Billy, I am married to this Man, but not for Love or Goodwill, but only to get what I can from him and bring it to you; and here is his Watch; it will serve you to see what's a-Clock in Newgate; but if he wants to know how the time goes, he can look at the Clocks in the Street. So she gave him the Watch. I desired him to return it to me, but he said he knew better, for he should have occasion for it himself.</p>
               <p>Eleanor Byrom. The Prosecutor courted me seven Years ago, and meeting me that Sunday Morning, he asked me to drink; We went to the Three Daggers and staid till six in the Morning, and then he asked me to go and be married. I told him I did not much care if I did; so we went to the Fleet and were married, and here is the Doctor to prove it.</p>
               <p>Wyat. Between seven and eight on Sunday Morning, I married this Couple.</p>
               <p>Court. Was not the Man drunk?</p>
               <p>Wyat. He was neither drunk nor sober, but they brought two sober Men with them.</p>
               <p>Court. Sober! They had been drinking all Night - Did you perform the whole Ceremony according to the Rites of the Church of England?</p>
               <p>Wyat. I cannot say that I repeated all of it.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you mean?</p>
               <p>Wyat. I did not give them St. Paul's Advice, but left them to take it or let it alone as they might think proper. I always omit that, and I know it is omitted in several Churches.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the Man capable of knowing what he was doing?</p>
               <p>Wyat. Yes; for he gave half a Guinea to change; I returned him a Crown, and he insisted upon having the odd Six pence. And next Day he came to me in a Coach for a Certificate, and told me that he very well approved of his Choice, and would take care of her.</p>
               <p>Court. Then he ought to be indicted for having two Wives - Officer, take him into Custody - The Woman too may be prosecuted for having two Husbands.</p>

My Wife and I went out in the Afternoon; I returned first about six in the Evening, and the Girl was gone.

               <p>Mrs. Easton. There was twenty nine Pounds in a Spice Box in my Drawers in Mr. Foxley's House. I went out and left only the Girl in my Room, when I returned the Girl was gone, my Drawers broke open, and the Money taken away. She was found in Rag-Fair, she owned she took the Money, and said at first, that she put it in her Bosom, and sat all Night in Moor-lane, and there a Man came and took it from her - Then she said a Woman took it out of her Apron, and at another time she told me that she gave it to a Girl who was to go out of Town with her.</p>

Then Ann Maund came up to take the Reckoning; I gave her half a Guinea, but went away and forgot my Change, and so I went back again about twelve o'Clock and asked for it, and called for another Quartern. Then she returned me eight Shillings, and they all three went out with me, and hussel'd me in a Corner and there they left me. But I having a thought, felt in my Pocket and mist a Guinea and some Silver; so I run after them, took Needham and carried her to the Compter. The other two were taken the same Night; and

My right Arm was held up so that I could not get it down. The Prisoner was close behind me with his left Hand on my Shoulder pushing me along. I felt my Watch pulled out of my Fobb, for my Breeches were prodigious tight. At the same time I saw the Prisoner's right Hand in between the Skirts of my Coat, but before I could get my Arm down he had got his Hand out and turned it behind him. In that posture I seized his Hand, G - D - ye, says I, You have got my Watch. I your Watch? says he, You are a Scoundrel, I have none of your Watch. Then says I, You have handed it to some of your Companions. Sir, says he, I am a Man of as good a Character as your self - but do not raise a Mob, and I will go with ye to the Tavern. So we went into the Tavern Kitchen, and there he readily pulled off his Coat, and I searched him, but to no purpose, upon which, he began to taunt, and threatned to make me suffer for scandalizing him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. By the vertue of your Oath, Did you see me hand the Watch, or so much as speak to any body?</p>

               <p>Mr. Shirly.

He had frequented that House, and had often seen the Tankard there, and afterwards knew that I bought it: Besides, I advertised it, with a Description of the Mark and the Weight which was set at the bottom, and one of these Advertisements was left at his House (as will be proved by the Man who left it) but a few Hours before he bought it.</p>

They came home together on Sunday Night, the twenty ninth or thirtieth of June, and brought two Silver Tankards which they said me they had got from the Hoop Tavern. Next Day about three in the Afternoon, I went to Barthelemi's House with the small Tankard. He was not at home, but his Wife desired me to stay, which I did. And soon after he came in, he lighted Candles, and shut up the Shop. He asked me no Questions how I came by it, but I told him without asking, that I came from Mr. Ratcliff.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173509110008"/> Then he weighed the Tankard in a Room behind the Shop, and cast it up on a Piece of Paper, and told me how many Ounces it weighed, and how much it was an Ounce, but I have forgot both, only I remember he said it came to six Pound three Shillings, or wanting three Shillings, I do not know which. Then he asked me where I lived, I told him in Holborn - I then lived in Gray's Inn-lane - He said he was going that way to meet some Company, and he would see me so far homeward. So he went with me to the upper end of St. Martin's Lane in Long Acre, and would have gone farther but I refused, and so we parted, and I carried the Money to Ratcliff, who gave half of it to Gaffney.</p>

               <p>Barthelemi. Did not you pass for the Wife of one Johnson, and bring a Note?</p>
               <p>Charnock. No.</p>
               <p>Barthelemi. You did, and you said your Husband had had a Suit of Law in the Country, and on that account you was forced to sell the Tankard - What Letters was it marked with?</p>
               <p>Charnock. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Barthelemi. It was not on Monday that you brought it, but on Thursday.</p>

               <p>Barthelemi. I keep no Books - I cannot write -</p>
               <p>[As this was hardly spoke loud enough for the Court to hear him distinctly, he dropt this Pretence and said] - I set it down so in my Book, and that I gave her six Pound nineteen Shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Deveil. After I had brought him to own that he bought the Tankards, he took me aside into another Room, and told me this matter might prove very troublesome to him, but it was in my power to make it more agreeable, and if I would go to his Shop he would make it easy to me, or Words to that effect: When I came back with him into the other Room, I asked him before twenty or thirty People, if he was not ashamed to offer to bribe me? He answered, that what he intended to give me - was only his Prayers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shirley. He sent for me into the same Room, and offered me twenty, twenty five, and then thirty Guineas if I would be easy - Will your Lordship please to ask Charnock about her selling him a Silver Pint Mug that was stolen from the Crown Tavern by GuildHall.</p>
               <p>Court. No, I cannot enquire into particular Facts for which he is not indicted.</p>
               <p>Barthelemi. I gave her five Shillings an Ounce for a Silver Mug.</p>

               <p>Gaffney. The unfortunate Dr. Dunn was tried here last Sessions for stealing these Tankards; and did not you and your Servants swear positively that he was one of the two Men?</p>

               <p>Gaffney. It would be but Justice to bring your Servants here, to see if any of them know me.</p>
               <p>Shirley. I did send two of them to the Gate-house, and they said they did not know the Prisoner.</p>

            , Silversmith. I offered to sell Mr. Barthelemi a Tankard at a Crown an Ounce, but it was Old Sterling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pattison, a Turner. I live opposite to Barthelemi; he works hard in his Shop from Morning to Night - I have seen him buy Goods publickly, and never thought that he would buy any thing in a private clandestine way; for I took him to be as honest a Man as lived.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you never heard of his absconding on some account?</p>
               <p>Pattison. I have heard that an Action at Common Law was brought against him for a Watch; and that thereupon he went abroad because he had not Money to pay for the Watch and Charges.</p>
               <p>Barthelemi I stopt a Maid for offering to sell me a Tea-pot, till she sent for her Mistress.</p>
               <p>German Bonette. I was not present when the Maid came by her self, but I saw the Maid and her Mistress together in his Shop; and he told me that he had obliged the Maid to send for her Mistress.</p>
               <p>Several others deposed that they believed him to be a fair Dealer, and that he would not knowingly buy Plate that he suspected to be stolen.</p>

He pulled up one of the Bars with his Hand, and with that Bar he wrenched up the others; and then I standing to watch, he went in and brought out the Tankards. We went with them first to Mrs. Pritchard's at the Brill, but it being so soon in the Morning, she would not let us in, and so we carried them to Mrs. Morris, in Eagle Court in the Strand, and knocked her up about two in the Morning. Her Husband let us in. At first she seem'd scrupulous of dealing with us, for she said she had been in trouble on the like Account. * Lewis had been recommended to her, but she said she did not know that I went abroad (that is a Thieving.) though she knew something of me when I was Apprentice to a Glass Blower in the Strand. We told her she need fear no harm from us, for no body was concerned in it but our selves. About eight the same (Saturday) Morning, her Son fetched some Charcoal to melt the Plate. We melted it below Stairs while she was above, and then we carried it up to her. She weighed it with old Leaden Weights, and said there was forty six Ounces in all, and reckoning it at four Shillings an Ounce it came to nine Pound odd. She gave us five Guineas then, and the Remainder on the Thursday following - I made my Information seven or eight Weeks ago before Justice Deveil.</p>

            . In July 1734. the Prisoner told me that he could counterfeit the Stamps on Paper so exactly, as not to be distinguished from the true Stamps; and if I would be concerned with him I should have half the Profits. He sent me to the Stamp Office for two treble six Penny Stamps, which I fetched to him. By these he made counterfeit Stamps, and thinking his House in St. George's Fields not convenient, I took an empty House by his Order in New-street, to which place we carried the Press and Fly and Crucibles and Metals and other Materials for coining Guineas and stamping Paper. We stamped several Reams of Paper which I distributed, some to

I was present and saw the Prisoner put the Stamps on these five blank Sheets in March last, but these were not done in New-Street, but at Mrs. Petty's in Paul's Alley in Aldersgate Street, where we hired a Garret, about the end of February last: Nothing of the old Press was moved thither from New Street except the Fly, but we had a new Press made by one Boddington.

             the Stationer was apprehended for selling counterfeit Stamp Paper, the Prisoner removed all the things from Paul's Alley to his House in St. George's Fields, except this Fly of the old Press, which was afterwards found in Paul's Alley by Mr. Lunnies. The new Press was first put together at Bowtell's, and the Prisoner sent me to bring it from thence to Paul's Alley: I went, and Bowtell pulled it from under the Bed, and said there is your Tackle. The Paper we stampt for Whitworth, Heatly, and Parsons, was doue with the old Press. Hearing that Bowtell was taken, I went to his House and found things in confusion: On Saturday the twenty ninth or thirtieth of May, his Wife told me that her Husband was arrested for Debt, and asked me where the Prisoner was, for her Husband wanted to speak with him; I went to the Prisoner over the Water and he told me that Bowtell was taken for selling Stamps though but few had been found at his House, but if search was made they might find more, for he had sent to Bowtell two Quire of two Shilling and three Penny Stamps, and six Quire of double Penny but the Day before. I told him Bowtell wanted to speak to him; the Prisoner answered, As he is in Custody, the Key may be turned upon me, and that may be as much as my Life is worth; but do you go to him and desire him for God's sake to hold his Tongue, for my Life depends upon his Taciturnity.</p>

               <p>Several Witnesses deposed, that in searching the House in St. George's Fields, they found two Presses, several Stamps, Dies and Punches, and other Materials for Coining and Stamping.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rollos, the King's Engraver, deposed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173509110012"/> that those Punches were proper for repairing Stamps after they were cast; and that the Stamp Paper produced in Court was counterfeit.</p>

This Place was hired by one Watts, an elderly Man, and I have seen him and the Prisoner go in there two or three times in the Day time, but I never saw the Prisoner go in alone.

               <p>Mrs. Petty. Bridoak a Month before Lady Day, hired my Garret in Paul's Alley, and the Prisoner used to come there and lye with him for about two Months, but Bridoak staid longer - I once heard a thumping.</p>
               <p>Mr. Page. On January 29, 1733, I let an empty House in New-street to Bridoak for a Year.

            . I live in New-street. The Prisoner and Bridoak have often been at our House, which is an Ale-house. I have seen them go together to the White House.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It has been represented, as if there was no Furniture in that House. Did not Bridoak lodge there?</p>
               <p>S. Fell. I think he did, but am not sure. I have carried Drink to the House, but I never went but just within the Door - I have seen a Bedstead there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Bridoak owns himself to be an Accomplice. He owns he was concerned in the whole Affair, and he has made himself rich by that means. But I was so poor that I was not able to carry on a little Law Suit. He pretended to be a Sollicitor. I employed him to recover a Debt, and so our Acquaintance begun. He brought me some little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173509110013"/> printed Marks to copy for him, and among them there was one for Daffy's Elixir, and as I had not Money, I was satisfying him this way for managing my Law Suit; but when I observed that most of these Marks had Crowns upon them, I suspected they might be put to an ill use, and therefore I would meddle with none but Daffy. In short I was forced to sell my Wig to carry on this Suit, and yet when he had got the Money, he put it in his own Pocket. If I had been concerned in a Practice by which he has got so much, it is reasonable to think that I might have got something too. His own Terror has brought him to a Confession: He knew that I was acquainted with some of his Secrets, and for fear I should discover them; he charges me with what he himself is guilty of, and would take away my Life to save his own. Has he not been tryed in this Place, * and convicted at Kingston? - I had taken a House at Liverpool, and put all my Tools and Cloaths on board the Ship Suttle on the ninth of May, to send thither. And when I was taken, I directed Mr. Lunnies at what House he might find them; I have since been informed that he has been there, and if he had found any thing that related to Coining or Stamping, I should have heard of it before now.</p>

When Dean and I removed to Paul's Alley, he sent me to fetch this Press thither. I went and asked the Prisoner for the Press that was left by Mr. Dean. The Prisoner drew it from under the Bed, and said, There is your Tackle. I carried it to Paul's Alley, and there we stamped this Paper - One Evening, Dean, Bacon, the Prisoner, and my self were drinking together, when the Prisoner said to Mr. Bacon, If you or your Friends can take off Stamps, I will use you well, and give you two or three Months Credit. The Prisoner being committed to Wood-Street Compter, I asked Dean to go and see him. Dean said it was not so proper for him to go, for if the Key was turned upon him, it might be as much as his Life was worth, but do you go, says he, and tell him, that his own Safety as well as mine lies on his being secret. So I went, and the Prisoner told me that he had then in the House two Quire of Two and Three-penny Stamps, and six Quire of Double-penny, which he had received from Dean the Day before; but the main Bulk of Stamps was in a Box at a Coffee-house, where he and Dean had lodged, and he was afraid it was seized; but if it was not he would give Orders to remove it. He added that he had confest nothing, and that he would say he had bought the Stamps of one of the same Trade who had newly left off the Business, and was a Holland Trader - Dean dealt with the Prisoner for Paper. The Prisoner once sent some Paper by me to Dean, and told me that Dean knew what to do with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever see Dean deliver a Sheet to me, or see me sell a Sheet?</p>
               <p>Bridoak. No, but Dean told me so.</p>

            , Attorney. In April or May last, the Prisoner told me that one Mr. Dean had some Business to do in my way. We all met. This Business was about a Suit to compel one Wigley to specify performance of an Agreement that had been made betwixt him and Dean. I told the Prisoner that the Suit would be very expensive, and he said he would be my Paymaster. Sometime after, he asked me if Stamps would not do as well as Money. I answered, yes, and took Stamps of him to the value of seven or eight Pound; the chief part of which I sold to Mr. Smith, a Stationer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. These are the same, I delivered them to the Commissioners.</p>

            , was a second time indicted for High Treason in making four Pieces of Counterfeit Money, with Brass, Copper, and other Base Metals in the likeness of Guineas, May 27, in the seventh Year of his Majesty's Reign, in the Parish of St. Brides in London.</p>
               <p>Elihu Bridoak. In December, 1733. the Prisoner began to make Dies for counterfeiting the present Coin. He finished them in January. I took Mr. Page's House in New Street, in order to Coin there. We carried thither the Bellows, and other Materials. He built the Furnace himself, and set up the Press, and provided Gold, Silver, and Copper. We made a great many Guineas, of which I distributed some hundreds. There was as much Gold in each as was worth fifteen Shillings We continued Coining till we went to stamping Paper. I know that these two Guineas were of his making, and I can pick them out from a Number of others, by a particular Mark. The Difference is in the Mouth and Lips, tho' it is not easily distinguished by a cursory View.</p>
               <p>Mr. North. When Bridoak gave me Information of these Guineas, I asked him if he had got any of them. He said, No, but he knew them by the Lips, and could pick them out from good ones. I desired Mr. Maddoches of the Bank, to procure me three or four. Their Out tellers got four, which were mixt in a Bag with one hundred and ninety six good ones. Bridoak turned them over and picked out four, and I found them to be all Counterfeit. I gave two of them to an Officer of the Tower to make an Assay of their real value.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Gilpin, a Goldsmith by Lincoln's Inn Back Gate. On the nineteenth of August, the Prisoner came to our Shop, and said, he had a little piece of Plate to dispose of, and then he produced this Escallop'd Silver Salver. Seeing a Crest on it, I asked him whose it was. He said he did not know, for it was left him by his first Wife. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173509110017"/> told him I must stop the Plate till he could satisfy me how he came by it. He asked me what I meant by that, and said, he could soon fetch one that knew him; and so he went and fetched Mr. Stafford from the Stamp Office. Mr. Stafford told me who the Prisoner was, and said that he believed him to be an honest Man - I looked into a Book of Arms, and thought the Crest was like the Duke of Chandos's. But on my going thither, I was told it was Sir Robert Walpole's. I went to Sir Robert's, and there the Plate was owned.</p>

On the twenty ninth of July, 1 heard that a Man was stopt with some of my Master's Goods. I went and found the Prisoner, and these Skins, which I believe to be my Master's.

            . On Tuesday, July 29, between four and five in the Afternoon, the Prisoner came to my House with two Bundles, and called for a Pint of Beer. He desired me to let him leave those Bundles. I put them behind the Bar. Then he said, he wished I could let him lye there if it was but for one Night, for he wanted a Lodging, and there were so many wicked Houses about Town, that a sober Man could hardly find a Place to lay his Head in - At Night my Maid lighted him up Stairs, and when she came down she said she wondered I would let that strange Man lay there, for though he pretended so much Godliness, he had been very rude to her, and forced his Hand up her Coars. Upon this, we examined his Bundles, and found they were wet Skins, and suspecting he did not come honestly by them, we got a Constable, and made the Prisoner get up. And then he denied that ever he delivered the Skins to me.</p>

            , Beadle. When I saw the Skins were wet, and had no Stamps on them, I sent for a Constable. The Prisoner at first refused to rise, and denied that he brought the Bundles. He told us however that he worked for Mr. Bullock, at Colebrook. Upon which, one who was present, said, that Mr. Bullock had a Ware-house in Town, and so sent for King who belongs to the Ware-house.</p>
               <p>J. Robinson. I know these are my Master Bullock's Skins by the Marks, for each of his Men marks his own Work, that if there is any Fault we may know who to blame.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would not have left my Master but for the Wickedness of his Workmen, for they were so given to drink Gin, that I who had always behaved my self with Sobriety, could not bear to see them go on in that pernicious Practice. As for the Skins, I found them on this side Colebrook, and considering with my self that they might belong to my Master, I resolved as I was going to London, that I would deliver them to his Ware-house-keeper there. And this was my Design, on my Word and Truth, and as I hope for Mercy in the Kingdom of Heaven. But for Christ's Sake! for the Lord Jesus Sake! let me have my Punishment in my own Country.</p>

             deposed, that on the twenty eighth of June, he went to the Hounslow Races between one and two in the Afternoon, and returned about seven in the Evening, when he found his Wife crying, and asking her the reason, she said she would not be left alone any more: That next Morning she said she was very bad, and shewed him her Water, which war bloody; but he thought it no more than usual, she having been troubled with the Stone and Gravel, but he had heard no Complaint of that nature for a Month before, and that he left her well when he went from Home. That nine or ten Days afterwards, she told him that Pickup the Brewer had been there, and finding her alone, went into the back Parlour, and called for a Pint of Wine: And when she carried it to him, he locked the Door, threw his Arms round her Waste, and threw her down, and put his Hands up her Coats, and attempted to ravish her, that she got up again, and threw up the Sash, and got half out, but he pulled her back, and offered her a Cellar full of Beer to lye with her. That he went to the Prisoner's House, to know why he had abused his Wife, but he was not in Town. That a Week after this, the Prisoner sent him some Two-penny, which the Evidence returned, whereupon the Prisoner came with Mr. Mosely, and huffed the Evidence, and asked why he sent back the Drink, to which he answered: You Villain how dare you come to my House, and abuse my Wife. That his Wife hearing the Prisoner's Voice, called out and said, That Villain at the Door has been the Death of me.</p>
               <p>Being asked if his Wife might not have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173509110019"/> been heard, if she had cryed out when the Prisoner assaulted her; he answered, that she did not cry out, for he struggled with her half an Hour, and she was out of breath: He added that she was attended in her Ilness by Dr. Beaufort, Dr. Bloxham and others, and being cross-examined, he said he believed his Wife did not tell the Doctors how her Disorder began; that he did not ask them what they thought was the cause of it, nor did they tell him.</p>

            , deposed, that the Deceased sent for her seventeen Days before her Death, she complained of a violent Fit of the Cholick, and said she had been ill two Days before, and believed she had got it by eating Beans and Bacon, but this Evidence thought it was the Gravel.</p>
               <p>Dr. Beaufort About the nineteenth of July, the Deceased sent for me, and said she had been ill three or four Days, was in great Pain, and under a total suppression of Urine. I believe it proceeded from the Stone, and directed as for a suppression of Urine. I visited her three or four times, but she would take nothing, and so I went no more. She never complained of receiving any Bruises, or any Disorder about her Kidneys.</p>
               <p>Being asked if taking a Woman round the Waste, and struggling with her, could bruise her Kidneys, so as to be felt. He said he did not think that so doing could have such an Effect. Being farther asked, if a Stone in the Kidneys might not by Violence be removed, and so cause that suppression of Urine, he replied that it was not to be done by any Violence that could be used in hugging and squeezing.</p>
               <p>Dr. Bloxham deposed, that he attended the Deceased in March or April, she had severe Vomiting, and all the Symptoms of the Stone, for which he directed. That he saw her three Days after his Direction, and she had voided a little Stone. That about the end of July she told him she had had a suppression of Urine for seven Days, which he took to be the Stone, and ordered a Warm Bath. That neither she nor her Husband ever told him that she received any Bruise. Being asked, if Squeezing and Struggling could bruise her Kidneys, so as to be immediately felt. He answered he did not apprehend any such thing could happen; but perhaps it was possible that a violent Wrench or sudden Distortion of the Body might dislodge a Stone and throw it into the Ureter.</p>

             deposed, that on the thirtieth of July, he was sent for to meet Dr. Burton, at the Plough at Kensington, from whence they went to the Deceas'd's House. The Deceased said she had been abused, and had not made Water for a Fortnight. He told her that was a long time indeed, and (letting her know his Profession) he laid his Hand on her Belly, and found a Tension. He pulled out his Catherer, but a Woman who was present cried out, No, We will have no Experiments - she has been prob'd already. He then let them know he had no farther business there. The Woman told him he had frighted the Deceas'd to death, and she might lay her Death to him. He said, they might do as they would, provided they did not swear he had ravished her. And so he stept down to Dr. Burton, and told him it was well if there was no Trick - They both went up, and were met by one who said they might search now - He did examine, and found no Water in the Bladder. They pretended she was bruised, and that the Child was killed within her. He offered to take the Child away, but upon searching, there was neither Child nor Bruise to be found.</p>
               <p>That he saw the Deceased in half a quarter of an Hour after she was dissected, and could perceive no sign of any Bruises, or of her being with Child; that her Kidneys were emaciated by a settling of Gravel. That the Surgeon shewed him two Stones, and told him that the biggest had been fixt in the ureter going out of the kidney, and the other at the insertion of the ureter into the Bladder, and that he believed her Death was owing to those Stones only.</p>
               <p>Being asked if he thought those Stones had been there for some time, or had been removed thither by some sudden Violence. He answered, the Kidneys were so well guarded that no Struggle could remove those Stones.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173509110020"/>Mr. Chovet, a Surgeon, deposed. that he opened the Body and found a large Stone in the right Kidney at the Exit of the Pelvis, that he found no inward or outward Bruises; that from the Conformation of the Parts, the Water arising like the Swan-neck of an Alembic, or the Letter S, he thought it evident that the Stones could not fall into the places where they were found by means of any struggling.</p>

About ten of the Clock on Monday Night, the seventh of July, the Prisoner came in, and went up Stairs, and being at the Head of the one pair of Stairs, he called to the Deceased's Daughter, who was below, and asked her about a Cane: she telling him that she knew nothing of it, he threatned to knock her Brains out: Upon which I heard the Deceased, who was a lame old Man, come down from the two pair of Stairs Floor. I was desired to go up, which I did, and somebody followed me with a Light: I saw the Prisoner standing with a Cane in one Hand, and a Broomstick in the other, and the Deceased leaning on his Crutch, with nothing upon him but his Shirt, and night Cap. I advised the Deceased to go up to Bed again; I had hardly spoke, when the Prisoner put out the Candle, and immediately I heard a violent Blow struck, and felt the Blood run down my Arm. Another Candle was presently brought, and the Prisoner then had the Broomstick in his Hand, and it was bloody at the biggest end. I heard no provoking Words from the Deceased, and it was impossible that he should give any Blows, because he could not stand without his Crutch.</p>

            . I live below Stairs in the same House; about three Months before this Misfortune, the Prisoner had like to have killed the Deceased, by striking him with his Cane, for which Reason the Deceased's Daughter took that Cane and hid it - So on the seventh of July, about ten at Night the Prisoner came in, and went up one pair of Stairs, and then called to Sally, (the Deceased's Daughter) and told her he would have this Cane: She said it had done Mischief enough already, and therefore it was put out of the way. Ye little Bitch, says he, I will knock your Brains out if you speak another Word. Thereupon the Deceased got out of Bed and went down and I went with a Candle, but my Candle was knocked out, and a Blow was given. And just as the Deceased's Wife came with another Candle, the Prisoner, lifted up this Broomstick, which he held in both his Hands thus, and was going to strike the Deceased another Blow. Ye Villain, said I, will you strike the poor old Man again, and with that I went to catch hold of the Broomstick, and received such a Blow on my Arm, that I carried the Mark of it for two Weeks. Here is the Broomstick, and here you may see the Blood upon it still.</p>

I will knock your Brains out. I heard my Husband get out of Bed, and open his Chamber Door. I went up soon after, and found him all in a gore of Blood, upon which I struck the Prisoner with a fire Shovel, and then I got my Husband to bed. He was lame, and sixty three Years of Age. Next Morning, which was Tuesday, he went before Justice Chamberlain, who bound the Prisoner over for an Assault, we not then thinking the Wound was mortal. On Wednesday, about five in the Morning, my Husband went to his Work, (he was a <rs id="t17350911-70-viclabel311" type="occupation">Weaver</rs>

I asked the Prisoner what he meant by abusing the old Man. Damn him an old son of a Bitch, says he, I will murder him.</p>

Your insolent Daughter's, says I, and with that he up with his Crutch and broke my Head - He had served me so twice before - I did not strike him with the Broom Stick, but with my Cane, and then his Daughter fell on me with a Candle-stick, and his Wife with a Fire-shovel.</p>

I told him I only wanted a Note of sixty five Pounds to be discounted. O says he, I will do that for you in five Minutes. So he took me to the Door, and called a Coach, and he and I and the Prisoner went in, and Mac Cray bid the Coachman drive to Mr. Heath's, a Tavern in Spring Garden. When we came there, he asked who was in the Parlor. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173509110029"/> was answered, Mr. Heath with some Company. Then we went up Stairs, where they shewed me some Pictures to amuse me, and said, why do you keep Company with such low lifed Fellows? See what a House we bring ye to ! In a little time the Drawer came and said there was now Room in the Back Parlor. So we went in there, and they told me Heath should discount the Note. Heath came in and talked of Horse Races and went out again. We knocked, and

             the Drawer came. I gave the Note to Mac Cray, who gave it to Senhouse. They brought Pen and Ink and bid me indorse it, which I did. Mac Cray asked me if any body thereabouts knew the Hands of the other Indorsers. I said, yes, a Gentleman in the Neighbourhood. Mac Cray took the Note, and said he would go and enquire. He went out, and coming back he told the Prisoner that the Gentleman's Footmen were sawcy Fellows. Upon which the Prisoner pretended to be in a violent Passion, snatched the Note out of my Hand in a hurry, and said, D - the insolent Rascals! I will have them turned out of their Places. And then he went out, and returning to me he said the Note was very good and I should have my Mony in two or three Days. I insisted upon having my Note again, but the Prisoner went away. Mac Cray turned me out at the Back Door, and carried me to the George Tavern in Spring Gardens, and from thence he took me in a Coach a second time to

               <p>Boyle. I knew not what to do, nor how to get my Note again, and then I had been drinking. We had Punch at Heath's, where Mac Cray filled me brimming Glasses, and swore by G - I should drink them off. And at the George Tavern we had a Pint of Wine. So that I was drunk when I came the second time to the Hound and Hare. And besides, Mac Cray all along amused me with one pretence or other, and told me if I would but be easy and meet him the next Morning, I should certainly have the Mony. But instead of that, I have been sued for this Note; I have had thirty seven Actions brought against me on account of this Note, and another which was forged for forty eight Pound. It has cost me above two hundred Pound, and has been the ruin of me.</p>

            . On the twenty eighth of November last, between nine and ten at Night, the Prosecutor and Mac Cray came to my House by Clare Market in a Coach. The Prosecutor was drunk, and Mac Cray would have some Punch. I refused to let him, but he would have an eighteen-penny Tiff, and so at last I made it. When that was out he would have had another, but I was resolved to make no more. They staid about two Hours, and at going away, I advised Mac Cray to take care of his Friend the Prosecutor, and see him safe Home. No, says Mac Cray, I will make a hundred Pounds of him before to-morrow Morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kelly. Between eleven and twelve at Night, the Prosecutor and Mac Cray knocked at my Door, the King's Arms in Wild Street, and wanted a Bottle of Wine. I told the Prosecutor he was drunk and had better go home. However, they came in, and then I went to Bed - I think Mac Cray was not drunk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kelly's Drawer. They had a Bottle of Wine, and then called for the Reckoning; the Prosecutor put his Hand in his Pocket, and said, By G - I have no Money, and then Mac Cray gave a six and thirty Shilling Piece to change.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clendon. I have heard the Prisoner say that he never had but twenty Pound for the Note, and that was from one Wreathock an Attorney in Hatton Garden.</p>

            . I went to Mr. Heath's about eleven in the Morning, and there I saw Boyle, and afterwards the Prisoner came down, and Boyle told him that he waited for Mac Cray to whom he had given a Note the last Night. But he did not say a Syllable of the Prisoner's having the Note.</p>
               <p>Boyle. I am positive that this Man was not there, for there was no such Person in the Company, and I never saw this Man before Yesterday.</p>
               <p>Heath. Bowyer was there, and drank with Boyle, and they afterwards dined together with other Company.</p>
               <p>Heath and Bower were put out of Court - Now Boyle, what had you for Dinner that Day?</p>
               <p>Boyle. A Leg of Mutton boil'd, but it was half raw, and when the out-side was cut off, we broil'd some of the rest.</p>
               <p>How many might there be in Company?</p>
               <p>Boyle. Five or six. It was but a little Room, and they pretty well filled it. I scolded and made a Noise about my Note, and there was one Bradshaw a lusty Man, who said if I would give them an eighteen-penny Tiff of Punch, they would help me to my Note again - The Prisoner came in about two of the Clock, and I insisted upon his giving me the Note, but he said Mac Cray had it.</p>
               <p>Now call in Bowyer - Here Bowyer ! What had you for Dinner that Day?</p>
               <p>Bowyer. I cannot say what; for I dined there two or three Days in a Weeks, and this was four or five Months ago. We pay nothing for eating, but each Man pays for a Bottle of Wine.</p>
               <p>- What Day of the Week or Month was it?</p>

I got down and went in pursuit of the Man, as far as Cheapside, but not finding him, I returned. The Boy told me his own Name, and where he lived. I advertised the Horse, and dispersed a hundred printed Bills among the Inn-keepers. Going afterwards to the Talbot Inn my Landlord told me that such a Horse as mine, was left at Mr Havards, at the White Horse in little Wild Street. I went thither, and found the Horse to be mine. I advised the Landlord to stop the Person who came for the Horse. And accordingly the Prisoner was taken the next Evening.</p>

So I spoke to a Constable, to attend at a little Distance, and then I went with the Horse to the Swan and Horseshoe, where I found the Prisoner, and gave him my Bill, which came to ten Shillings for eight Nights: He said his Name was Phillips, and bid me write a Receipt, which I did, and he paid me, and was going to take the Horse; but seeing the Constable, he run out at the back Door, we cryed out stop Thief, and he was taken by a Soldier.</p>

            , a Boy sixteen Years old. My Master sent me from the Burrough to carry a pair of Breeches into the Strand. I got behind this Coach upon the Bridge. The Prisoner came and stroaked the Horse under the Belly, and then went off towards the Houses, and so he did several times, and at last asked me if that was my Master's Horse, I said no. I got down by Dutton Stone, and followed the Coach, and then I saw the Prisoner get on the Horse's back. I asked him what he was going to do; he called me Names, and then I see him lean forward with something bright in his Hand, and presently the Horse was loose, and he rid away full speed the contrary way the Coach was going: I saw him by the light of the Lamps. I called to the Coachman a good while before I could make him stop - I went to see the Prisoner in the Gate-house, where he was sitting with seven or eight more, and as soon as he went out, I said that was the Man.</p>

On the Tuesday before the Men were hanged at Kennington, four Men came to my Mistresses House, the Swan and Horseshoe Tavern in Wildstreet, about ten at Night; one of them had a Horse, which he twisted to the Post as the Door, they had two three Shilling Bowls of Punch. When they were going they asked for a Porter to carry the Horse to a Stable. A Porter came, and I sent him with the Horse to the Black Horse in Little Wild Street. On the Friday following they came again, and the Prisoner came in at the same time. They sat down together, and called for a Pen and Ink, and I heard one of them say, a Guinea and a half, and the Prisoner answered, I will give a Guinea. And then I went to fetch the Horse.</p>

He slung the Garters at me, upon which I looked hard at him and then I knew him, whereof I says to him, I beg you will take this Knife and grind it, and I will call for it to morrow.

I had been taking leave of my Brother, and he see me most of my way home and left me at the end of Princes street - I went to the Prisoner again, and told him I had got a Warrant, and would certainly serve it, if he did not give me my Money: I kept the Warrant two Days, and then I took him in his own Shop.</p>
               <p>- Did you cry out when you were rob'd?</p>
               <p>A. Gowen. No, for I saw nobody to Subsist me. But there was another Man stood by the Prisoner when he robbed me; and he said to the Prisoner: If you do not give her the Money again, we are undone, for she knows ye.</p>

             came to me crying, and said, her Friend had given her a small parcel of Mony, and a Man had taken it from her, but she knew where he lived. I bid her go and see if he would not return it; and she went, but came back again, and said, he bid her be gone about her business. So at last he was carried before a Justice, and while we were at the Justice's House, but before we went into the Room where the Justice was, I heard her say to the Prisoner, Are not you the Man that took my Money? And he answered, Yes, I am, and I own it was a great Fault. My Husband and this Man heard the same. Then when we went in before the Justice, she charged him with robbing her, but he denied it.</p>

               <p>M. Frost. Why at first we all went in, and she said to the Justice this is the Man, and then the Prisoner took her aside, and said, For God's Sake my Dear make it up. And she said, are not you the Man that took my Mony? And he answered, Yes, and I am sorry for it. And I begged of her for Christ's Sake not to swear it upon the poor Man, if she was not very sure that he was the Person.</p>
               <p>- It seems she was very willing to have made it up before, therefore how came it about that she did not agree to it when he offer'd it?</p>
               <p>M. Frost. Why the Justice called out and said, What? Are you going to compound Felony in my Presence? And so they went in again the second time, and it was then that I went away.</p>
               <p>- Do you consider that you are upon your Oath, and that the Man's Life is at Stake?</p>

               <p>W. Frost. I have heard she has been in Bridewell, and she goes for a loose Woman, that's all.

He told me that what he had to say, he would say before a Judge. When we came down again, Frost said to me. I don't much like this Man. O says, Nan Gowen, we have laid the Scheme between us. He is to swear that he came to the Queen's Head in Baldwin's Gardens, and there he saw me and a young Man; and that he said to me, How do you do Mrs. Hunter; who is this Man that is so much like you? Is it your Brother? and that I said, Yes: And that then he saw my Brother give me eight Shillings.</p>

On Sunday the thirty first of August, at a Quarter past eight in the Morning, I went down to give my Cat some Victuals, but she flew down into the Cellar, and I followed her, and hearing a Noise in the Vault, I thought she was fallen in there, for I once had a Cat that met with such a mischance. I got a Candle, and looking down I saw something wabbling about, which I thought was the Cat. But my Wife coming down for some Coals, the Cat came and fondled about her, at which she screamed out and said, It is not the Cat in the Vault - I got a piece of an Iron Hoop, which I tyed to a String and put it down, and by moving it about I discovered part of a Child - We got Assistance, and broke up the Vault, put down a Ladder, and a Boy went down and brought up a Child alive; but it died at about five the same Day - I found a Stick in the Vault about seven or eight Foot long.</p>

So my Husband went out and desired him not to beat his Wife. The Prisoner (as my Husband afterwards told me) said, G - D - your Blood, though you are a Constable, you have got no Warrant for me. The Deceased answered, No Sam, and if I had I would sooner let you know of it, than serve it upon ye. The Prisoner D - 'd his Blood again and having a Pipkin in his Hand, with Eggs in it, he upped with this Pipkin, and knocked the Deceased down in the Kennel: I helped to take him up. The Wound was at the Corner of his Eye, and the Grissle of his Nose was broke, he bled near three Hours. I sent for Mr. Meadows a Surgeon, who, after trying several things to stop it, was forced to bleed him in the Arm, and that turned the Blood. The Prisoner came into the Shop, my Husband said to him Sam, I did not think that you of all Men would have served me The Prisoner d - 'd his Blood, and said, If I had killed my Wife I had not cared, for I could but have been hanged for her. This was done on Thursday and my Husband died on the Saturday sennight following - And he said two or three times the Day before he died that the Wound was the cause of his death.</p>

D - ye, say, the Prisoner, You have no business between me and my Wife; and then having a Pint Pipkin with two or three Eggs in it, in his Hand he lifted his Hand up, and with the Pipkin he struck the Deceased a Blow just by the left Eye; but whether he threw the Pipkin, or held it in his Hand when the Blow was given, I cannot say, but the Pipkin was broke and the Deceased fell in the Kennel. I stepped from the Door where I then stood to help him up. But he being a heavy Man, I called his Wife to assist me. I called three times before she came, for she was then in a little Room backward, and saw nothing of the Affair. We brought him into the Shop, and she sent me for a Surgeon; after which the Prisoner came in and said, If you had kept in your Shop this had not happened - It is done and I cannot help it - I am sorry for it, but if I had killed my Wife I had not cared, for I could but have been hanged for her</p>

            , Surgeon. Four Days after the Deceased's death, I viewed his Body, he had a Wound on the left side of his Nose, there was no Fracture of the Bone, but the Cartlage or Grissel of the Nose was separated from the Bone by the Violence of the Stroke. I opened the Head, I found no Fracture in the Cranium, nor any extravasated Blood, nor visible Cause of his Death from that Wound. Indeed I have heard he lost a vast Quantity of Blood. The violent Contusion made by the Blow might cause that extraordinary Effusion of Blood at the Nose, and this might cause the subsequent Convulsion Fit, to be more violent, which might carry him off.</p>
