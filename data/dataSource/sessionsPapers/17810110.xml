               <p>In what manner did he accost you? - I overtook him going up the hill; as I was going past him he seemed to keep close to my elbow; I spoke to him and said it was slippery walking, he made no reply; we walked on ten yards farther; then he turned about and clapped the bayonet to my breast and demanded my money. I said friend I have but very little money for you. He told me to be quick he must have it. Upon that I gave him two half crowns. He asked me if I had any more? I told him no; and then he asked me what I had got in my bundle? I believe I told him some dirty linen. He said he must have it; and as soon as he had got it he ran down the hill.</p>

               <p>I am an headborough. On the 14th of last month, between seven and eight in the evening, I took charge of the prisoner at the request of Mrs. West. I found a gimlet upon him, which she swore before the magistrate was the gimlet the window was fastened down with. (It was produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is the gimblet I fastened the window with, I know it by the crack in the head of it.</p>
               <p>What did you find besides?</p>
               <p>Whiteway. Nothing more but a knife; he denied being in the house, and said the gimlet was not her's, but he had had it sometimes. I do not remember that he said how he came by it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That gentleman did not take me, I was delivered up in Justice Sherwood's office to him.</p>
               <p>Whiitway. Yes by the woman and some of the neighbours.</p>

               <p>I was going past to the tide work at Glasgow wharf; it was dark. This woman was sitting at the window; when I got about eight yards past her she cried stop thief! I stopped, and she came up and laid hold of me opposite a publick-house door. Some people came about and they carried me to Justice Sherwood's office, and gave me in charge to that man. I am as innocent of it as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>To Whiteway. Did he tell you this story when you was charged with him? - I do not remember that he made any such defence.</p>

He took my lantern, and he said would carry it for me; he carried it a little way and then returned it again. He then asked me to let him carry my bundle? I refused, because the linen was wet and might dirt his clothes. I went a little farther; then he asked again to carry it? I refused. He then took it from me, and said he would carry it. I went a little way and asked for the linen again; I said it was wet, I was afraid it would dirt his clothes. He said, no, he would carry it. When I got into the park, he seemed rather to lag behind; I turned and looked, I thought it was very odd a <rs id="t17810110-4-deflabel19" type="occupation">grenadier</rs>

He said, it is very heavy, what is in it? I did not inform him what was in it, but asked him again for the bundle; he would not give it me. When we got to the single sentry at the coach-road in the front of the queen's palace, the centinel said, who comes there? He answered a friend. The centinel said pass. I went past the sentry; then the prisoner went up the passage in the dark, and ran away with my linen. I clapped my hands together and said, stop him, he has robbed me of my linen.</p>
               <p>You did not suspect he meant to rob you? - No I did not. He never came back. A gentleman and lady advised me to go and have the roll of the guard called; I did directly, and the prisoner was the only man missing. The serjeant took me to the sentinel again to know what man he recommended to me. The sentinel said it was Peach. The man's cap fell off in the palace, when he took my lantern from me; I looked at him and am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Did you see his face clearly? - I saw his face quite clearly.</p>
               <p>Had you any reason at that time to take particular notice of his face? - Not at all. I turned and looked at him several times, not that I thought the man was a thief.</p>
               <p>Have you seen the things since you lost them? - Justice Durden sent for me the day after, and there I saw them.</p>
               <p>Do you know that these things are your's? - Yes. There are separate clouts I brought from Marybone; the gentlewoman lies in. Some are opened at one end and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100006"/> not sewed down. I have nursed the lady twice and know the things.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing in the bundle but what you had lost? - No.</p>
               <p>Whose possession did you see them in? - Justice Durden's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you come to the king's guard next morning, and you was asked if you knew the man, and you said no? - The colonel called the men up and asked me if I knew the man? I said I could not tell. I looked at him; they were ranked; I did not see him in the first row; I looked again and saw the man and that is the prisoner.</p>

She asked me to recommend her to a lodging; I said I could to Mrs. Atkins. She had a few things and asked me to let my girl shew her the way to the door. I said she should. She said she would leave some things she had in a bundle; I said she might; that it would be very safe, and she left them.</p>

I went the next night to the merriment; the next morning my girl said she was afraid I had got something not right. I got the advice of the neighbours about it, and by their advice I carried the bundle to Justice Durden, and left it in his possession.

               <p>To the Prosecutrix. How came he to be let go at large, after you had pointed him out? - The colonel said the man could not be apprehended at the king's palace, upon which we made an application for a warrant. The colonel undertook to deliver him up upon the parade next morning.

               <p>I am a constable. The prosecutrix brought a warrant to me; we went and endeavoured to find the man out; I went to the Horse-Guards, and could not find him. I saw the pay serjeant; he went with me and Matthews went to the Rose and Crown, thinking to find him there; he was not there. He went with me and showed me where he lived. We found him in bed. I apprehended him. As soon as he rose up in bed Matthews said, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Was you at the justice's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any serjeant of the Guards there? - Yes; he said at the time of the alarm he was required to call the roll, and that this man was absent.</p>
               <p>Did he undertake any thing? - Yes, he was ordered by Justice Addington to bring the two sentinels the next morning.</p>
               <p>And he undertook to bring the two sentinels? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you there the next morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he bring them? - No.</p>

Hearing a woman's voice calling out stop thief, a soldier with a bundle, I ran immediately to seize the soldier; when he found me near him he dropped the bundle; I did not stop to pick up the bundle but secured him immediately. The woman came up and picked up the bundle. He was carried before a magistrate, who committed him.</p>

I bought a pair of sleeve buttons for a penny; she asked me to toss up for a quartern of gin. I would not, but went out of the house directly; going home I recollected I should go to the washerwoman's for a shirt for the next morning. I ran back in haste; as I was running along the street, I ran against a woman who had a bundle upon her head, the bundle fell down; I continued running on till I heard the cry of stop thief, I turned round and asked what was the matter. They seized me, and said I had robbed the woman. I never had the bundle.</p>

               <p>I was going from Southampton-court, Queen's-square, to Norton-street, Marybone, on the 7th of December; I went across the fields; four of my acquaintance went with me to see me safe across the fields. They left me in Tottenham-court Road, just above the Tabernacle; I was going along <placeName id="t17810110-7-crimeloc33">London-street</placeName>

When they came up to me, the tall man Larby, held up a knob stick and said stop and deliver your money! I said whatever I have got you shall have; I took eighteen pence out of my breeches pocket, which the short man Dobey took; the sixpence was a counterfeit. Dobey immediately felt at my fob and said where is your watch? I said I had not one. He asked if my buckles in my shoes were silver? I said yes Sir. He then said</p>
               <p>"I will have them." He stopped down and took them out of my shoes. He said have you no more silver about you? I said no; he then said have you no more money? I said only a few half-pence; the tall man did not take the half-pence; the short one said yes, give me them? which I did. Dobey then catched hold of my neck and said is this stock buckle silver? I said no, metal; they then went laughing away towards Tottenham-court Road. I saw them run down John-street, I followed them; when I turned the corner of John-street they were then walking pretty fast; I called out stop thieves! upon which they set off running; there happened to be a watchman at the corner of the street; he swang his rattle, they kept running down Howland-street; I followed them and never lost sight of them but when they turned the corner of Howland-street. I got sight of them again as soon as I turned the corner; they kept running all the way; they ran down to Tottenham-court Road; they crossed the way and then stopped running and walked; and in that time they threw the buckles and the money over the pales as we afterwards found. I clapped my hand upon Larby's breast, he stopped and said indeed I am not the man.</p>
               <p>When he said that had you charged him with any thing? - No; the watchman took them to the watch-house. I saw the buckles after they were found in the road just by the pales; one of them was in

               <p>Did you lose any money in the month of November last? - I believe it was about that time, about thirty pounds; it was in a box in the room where I sleep, in Mr. Childs' house.</p>
               <p>Was the box locked? - I cannot say; I found it unlocked when I missed my money. I had never found it unlocked before; I used to keep it locked.</p>
               <p>Was it unlocked, or had it been broke open? - Unlocked; my money was gone.</p>

               <p>For days before had you seen the money or only the paper? - The money; I opened the paper. At the time I lost my money the prisoner was flush of money and was changing gold. He was a <rs id="t17810110-8-deflabel41" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

               <p>Was he taken up? - Yes; the serjeant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100010"/> took him up and he was put in the Guard House and kept there for seven or eight days; then he was let out; then he changed more gold and I had him taken up again.</p>
               <p>What did he change then? - About three guineas; I don't know what he changed before; we had him before Justice Hayes, who committed him to prison; I can say nothing more against him.</p>

               <p>On the twenty second of October I lost my watch in the Park; there was a swivel seal and key to it. As I was coming down the Park the prisoner asked me where I was going? I told her I was going home; she persuaded me to go with her. I went with her from the Mall as it is called towards the gate that goes into Fludyer-street; she made a stop near <placeName id="t17810110-9-crimeloc45">Fludyer-gate</placeName>

               <p>Did you perceive her when she did it? - Not at that juncture of time; when she left me she made a run; as soon as I perceived her to run I put my hand to the side of my fob and missed my watch.</p>
               <p>When was the last time before that that you knew the watch was in your pocket? - About ten minutes before.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was in your pocket when this woman came up to you? - Yes; I am perfectly sure of it; I pursued her when I saw her make a run, she made a flip out of the Park into Fludyer-street. I thought my watch was lost, I went home to bed. The next morning I went to the man who had mended it in Wood-street, and told him I had lost my watch; he advised me to advertise it, which I did three days and heard nothing of it. In the Christmas week I had an information where the watch was; I went to Sir

               <p>Had you any care of these bottles? - No. He told me a man had been taken up with a hamper on his back that was supposed to be taken out of our hall and was in a stable yard behind the house. I went to the place and saw the prisoner with a number of people about him who had stopped him; the hamper had been taken from him; it contained twenty four empty bottles. I knew the hamper to belong to us by a parchment direction on it to John Beach, Esq. Hackney, who is one of the partners of the house. I went to Mr. Plummer, and one of the clerks went with the prisoner to the compting-house while I went to Mr. Plummer who was out.</p>

On the 14th of December I lost a gold ring with five rose diamonds out of a drawer in the shop in which the goods were kept. The prisoner came in about a quarter after three in the afternoon with another person; one of them asked for a gold seal; I cannot take upon me to say which asked to see the seal. I took out the drawer and one of them took up a silver seal and asked the price of it; the other then said, they wanted a gold seal for a present. I said I had no gold seals. They then made an apology for giving me the trouble and went out of the shop. As soon as they turned round to go out I looked to see if any thing was missing out of the drawer, and immediately missed this ring. I went after them.</p>
               <p>When had you last seen that ring before they came in? - I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Had you seen it that day? - I cannot say; I put it in the case the day before. When I went after the women and brought them back the prisoner threw the ring down on the counter. When I first went out I did not see them in the street; I looked up a passage beside the house and saw them running; I ran after them; I took hold of the prisoner's hand and said you must come back; one of you have taken a diamond ring! she said how could I think such a thing! I said I was sure they had; she hesitated at the end of the passage, but then went into the shop and threw the ring down on the counter.</p>
               <p>Did only the prisoner or both go back to the shop? - Both; I met a friend in the passage who brought back the other; but before she came into the shop I saw the prisoner throw the ring into the drawer which I had left on the counter; it struck on a pair of spectacles; she took her hand from under her cloak and threw it in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did any other person see her throw it in the drawer? - No; there was no person in the shop but she and me.</p>

               <p>Did not you examine them both? - They were taken up and examined.</p>

               <p>Did you know them before? - Yes, as being people of bad character. The prisoner swore he would have it. There were two master-shoemakers in the bar. Thinking they were Christmas-box people, they persuaded me to draw it, as they promised not to sit down, but go as soon as they had drank it. They staid about half an hour, standing by the fire. My husband came in by that time and said to them, gentlemen, what business have you here, and desired them to go out. They had drank the beer and wanted more; they insisted upon staying, that caused a great wrangle, a scuffle ensued between my husband and them; the prisoner threw me down and picked my pocket.</p>
               <p>Are you sure Lions threw you down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were any of the others near you at the time? - No. When I got up I went to the bar, and Lions was gone out then. When I got to the bar, I said I was robbed of every sixpence in gold I had got. I had in my pocket a guinea, a half guinea, and upwards of twenty shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to suppose Lions picked your pockets while you was down? - Because I found he was upon me when I was down, and had both his arms round me to my pocket.</p>
               <p>In what situation was you on the ground? - Upon my face; I turned my head and saw him.</p>
               <p>How long was you on the ground? - Not above half a minute. I had given him change for sixpence for the pot of beer just before, and my money was safe then.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of the money again? - No, we went immediately after him, and took him between one and two in the morning. I charged the watchman with him. There was a guinea, a half guinea, and some silver and halfpence found upon him; the constable has it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were a great number of people in the house at the time I threw her down. I never went out of the room till all the rest of the people were gone; we had seven or eight pots of beer.</p>

               <p>Lego. It is every word of it false; they had but that one pot of beer in the house.</p>

Knowing the prisoner in particular, I desired them to go out, for they had no business there. The prisoner refused to go out, he said he would stay as long as there was any company there. I endeavoured to get them out; which occasioned a scuffle; the prisoner was down upon my wife with his arms under her apron, with a pretence to lift her up. Says he Mrs. Lego, I will lift you up.</p>
               <p>Did you see his hands under her apron? - Yes, she lay upon her face.</p>
               <p>Do you know what money she had? - No, she had a guinea and four half-crowns of me at noon. I saw the prisoner searched, there were found a half guinea and fourteen shillings in one pocket, and six shillings and sixpence in another; the guinea and a half crown and two shillings were afterwards found in his shoes.</p>

When the rest of the watchmen were gone he said, d - n them all, I have flung them now, I have ten guineas about me. I desired to have a candle, I took him out of the kitchen into the parlour and searched him. I found in his shoes a guinea, a half-crown, two shillings in silver, and three penny-worth of halfpence.</p>

Lego came in and blew the candles out, and said we should have no more beer there, and fell a fighting with one Morris, and said we should go. Morris and he were quarrelling together, and his wife came to take him away; then we all went out of the house. I went out first; we went into Bird's gin-shop, and drank several quarterns of gin together. Lego took another man first to the watch-house, and then came back and took me, and carried me to the Compter. I took my money out of my pocket as I was going to the Compter and put it into my shoes, for safety. I was much in liquor. I did not know what I was about. My head has been fractured, and I do not know what I am about when I am in liquor.</p>

I missed the barrel. I enquired of a little lad just by, who said he saw two men take them from the door. I enquired of several people and was directed which way they went, rolling it along the ground. I overtook them both in Bow-street, near Broad St. Giles's. They were at the top of the street, about 500 yards from our shop; I laid hold of them both and asked them where they were going with the barrel? They asked what it was to me? I said they should soon know what business it was to me. I called to some of the neighbours, as I was known there. They did not resist; I took them back to the shop and left two people in care of the barrel. The prisoners were taken to the office in Bow-street, and committed that night.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was your barrel of fish? - I know the barrel very well though there was no particular mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Did they give any account how they came by it? - They said they found it in the horse-way in the street.</p>

He said he was going to call at an house there, and would be with us presently. We rolled it across the street-way and coach-stand, we never saw the man any more.</p>
               <p>To Reynolds. When you saw the prisoners roll the cask away, did you see three men? - No.</p>

               <p>Where was the bag? - In the middle of the street. I came up to them and asked the prisoner if he belonged to that cart? He said yes. There was a cart standing by. I saw part of it come out of the cart. I went about five yards farther, and heard the other man bid him lift the bag on his shoulder. He did so, and shut the cart door. Then I went up to the prisoner again and asked him where he was going with the cart? He said to Watkins's, the dyer. I asked him where that was. He gave no answer to that; then I suspected he did not belong to the cart, and took him into custody. I asked where the carman was? He said at the publick-house, and he would fetch him. I said he should not, and took him about twenty yards up my father's yard, and I met the carman and asked if he had lost a wrapper? He went to the cart, and said he had. I told him to go up the street and he would overtake the other man. He did, but could not meet with him; he got clear off with the goods. I told him I saw the prisoner take the things out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me take the things out of the cart? - Yes; it was all in one piece. I saw part of it come out of the cart and he pushed it into the bag.</p>

               <p>On the 23d of December I lost thirty yards of woollen cloth out of my cart. I saw it in the cart when I went into Mr. Seward's yard. I went up to ask a question. There was a load of hay, I could not get my cart up the yard; coming back I met the last witness; he asked me if I had lost any thing? I went to the cart, and missed the cloth. He said he saw two men putting it into a black bag, and that one of them was gone up Compton-street, opposite the yard, and the other he had secured. I ran up Compton-street after the man and made enquiry, but could hear nothing of him.</p>

On the 22d of December the prisoner came into my house and asked me for a pennyworth of purl; she had it; and staid rather late. I told her I thought it time for her to be at home. She begged I would let her lie all night with the little girl I have, or that she might sit up. I said she could not lie with the child. I gave her leave to sit up in the tap-room. The next morning I complained that the little girl I had was too little for me. The prisoner offered her service to me. I asked her where I could have a character, as I was a lone woman? She told me from one Mrs. Phillips, Serjeant Major Phillip's wife. I sent my child down with her to Serjeant Major Phillips. They sent me word she was sober, honest, and an industrious clean girl. I took her into my <rs id="t17810110-15-deflabel82" type="occupation">service</rs>

On that evening or the morning of the 23d, the next day, I missed a large pewter dish and two pewter plates. The Sunday afternoon there came in Mr. Price, a constable, and told me the prisoner was a bad woman. I went into the tap-room, very much frightened, and said to the prisoner, I have heard a very bad character of you. She came into the passage, and as soon as she saw Mr. Price she ran out of doors. On the evening of the 26th, she knowing the way of the house, came slily in, and stripped a pair of sheets off the bed in the two-pair-of-stairs room. I missed them in the evening about eight o'clock; they were there at four. On the evening of the 30th she came into the house again and went into the same room; the man happened to be in bed; he thought it was his wife; he called out; she went up into the garret and took a pair of sheets. The man finding there was somebody in the house, alarmed the house. She threw the sheets on the bed, and was found concealed on the top of an adjoining house, behind the chimney; she got through the trap-door of my house.</p>
               <p>How do you know she went up into the garret and took the sheets? - Because she confessed it. She was taken on the top of the house, and was carried to Justice Durden, who committed her. The pawnbroker has the sheets, one pair she pawned, the other she threw at the man's head who alarmed the house.</p>
               <p>When did she own it? - Before the justice. I was present. She confessed she had pawned two pair of sheets.</p>
               <p>Were the sheets your property? - They are my brother's property, because I cannot act in my husband's name.</p>
               <p>Were the sheets purchased with your brother's money? - Yes, for me to have the care of them.</p>

I went down, when I came he shewed me a spoon. I searched the prisoner and found this spoon in his pocket; by its appearance it was the fellow of one he had offered to sell.

On Thursday the 4th of January between nine and ten at night I went to a public house the King's Arms, it is now called the Jolly Sailor, to order a pint of beer; it is about one hundred yards from my house; I staid in the house about two minutes. Going home I was stopped by the three prisoners and one who is not taken.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of them before? - No; I never saw either of them in my life before to my knowledge. They were all coming a-breast; the outside one who is not taken, and who is a lad of about thirteen or fourteen years of age struck me on the breast; I asked what it was for; he immediately gave me another blow in the face and said, you bouger take that. I endeavoured to seize him; upon which the three prisoners laid hold of me. Thompson seised me by the hair behind; Henley laid hold of my breast; and Smith laid hold of a silk handkerchief I had on my neck and throttled me so that I could not call out for any assistance. When they had me fast one of them with a knife or some other instrument wounded me in the throat. The wound was in length two inches; there was a knife found upon the man.</p>
               <p>You do not know who stabbed you? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you receive much injury from that wound? - Very great; I am bound up for it now; I have a doctor attending me every day. I cannot eat my victuals on account of it.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoners, are you sure they are the persons who used you in this manner? - Yes. When I was robbed of my handkerchief I called out I was robbed of my handkerchief, and never quitted Henley till by the assistance of a sailor belonging to a privateer I got him into my shop.</p>
               <p>You don't know who took it? -

               <p>I live right facing Mr. Davis's in New Gravel lane. As I was sitting at my fire side last Thursday night, I heard a noise; I came to the door to see what was the matter; I heard a man say, I am robbed, I have lost my handkerchief; I crossed the way and saw that Henley had hold of Mr. Davis by the breast, and the woman was hanging by the hair of his head.</p>
               <p>Did you know his voice? - No; not till I had crossed the way.</p>
               <p>When you had crossed the way did you see any of the people there? - Yes; all three of them. The middle one Smith had him by the hair. I saw them the next day at the justice's and knew them directly.</p>
               <p>In what situation was Davis with regard to Smith? - She had hold of him by the hair of his head, the hind part. The man had hold of him by the collar or breast.</p>
               <p>Is that the man you say had hold of him by the breast? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see the other woman do any thing? - No; if she did any thing it was before I came out.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of those people before? - No; I never saw any of them to my knowledge in my life.</p>
               <p>Are you certain they are the people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you do? - I took Smith's hands out of Mr. Davis's hair and said what are you about.</p>

               <p>I am headborough of the parish of St. Paul's Shadwell. I was sitting in a publick-house the Three Tuns; some women came up and said a man was robbed.</p>
               <p>You was not present at this transaction? - No; I went down to Gravel lane, and took a knife from the man; it was all over blood. They told me it was one Mr. Davis had been robbed; I went into his house and saw him all of a gore of blood; Davis could hardly speak. I asked him which was the man; Davis shewed me Henley and said that is the man, and I secured Henley and searched him, and found upon him this knife; I put it in a piece of paper, it has never been out of my custody since (producing a clasp knife all stained over with blood;) his coat was all over blood at the same time. I would have kept his coat to produce in court, but the justice said, as it was cold weather, I had better let him have his coat, and that I might mention it in court. Thompson, when she was going to the watch-house, said to the man, why did not you cut his wheezan over! Smith told them where to find the boy that had done it if they would go after him; they said he was gone to sea.</p>
               <p>To Davis. Did you at the time you received the wound say the boy did it? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the boy gone when you received the wound? - He was; and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Are you certain he was not the person who stabbed you? - He was not the person who stabbed me or took my handkerchief.</p>

               <p>I am headborough of St. Paul's Shadwell. I was going home about ten minutes after ten; I heard that Mr. Davis in New Gravel lane had been robbed and his throat cut by two men and some women. I went down to see him; a gentlewoman said she saw two women running up the gardens swearing all the way; they were about thirty yards from me; I followed them, it was a moon light night. I heard at a distance their conversation; they consulted together to go home. I took them both by the back of the neck and took them to Mr. Pigott's, and heard a word drop from the tall one that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100018"/> other had something about her. I searched her and found upon her this handkerchief all over blood. (producing it)</p>
               <p>What was the conversation? - One said to the other, d - n your eyes don't go back; if they fix you, you will be done. I don't know which said that.</p>
               <p>Why did she make use of that expression? - That I cannot take upon me to say; they said together, d - n your eyes if you go back you will be fixed; they will do you. One said her dear fellow was fixed and she would go back and see what was become of him. The other persuaded her not to go back.</p>
               <p>Who had the handkerchief? - Smith had it in her side pocket. I took it down to Davis and shewed it him while the surgeon was with him.</p>
               <p>Is it bloody now? - Yes; and my hands were all stained with it when I took it out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>To Davis. Is that your handkerchief? - It is.</p>

               <p>HENLEY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I belong to a privateer, the Greyhound Cutter. I was coming on shore at Execution Dock. I went down that day and entered on board a man of war; I came on shore at night, and coming down New Gravel lane I met these two women and a little lad with them. I knew nothing of them before; I knew the boy, he was at sea with me on board the Resolution man of war. This lad happened to know me and asked me how I did; we had a few words together; he asked me to give him something to drink. I went down with them and treated them with a pot of purl. They all three went out of the house together; I staid behind and had a glass of gin to myself; after I came out I heard some screaming with these two women and that gentleman. I ran up and when I came up, he had knocked Thompson down; I said, is it not a shame to see a woman knocked down in this manner. Davis and Thompson were in an affray together; I saw him strike her on the head several times when she was down. I asked him how he could serve a woman so? He said he would serve me the same, and came and catched hold of me; then there was an affray between Davis and I, we both fought together; I thought I was not to stand to be struck by him without resenting it. Then the boy who was with them came between Davis and me; he caught fast hold of me after he got the cut; and would not let me go. I believe the boy gave him the cut, because he bragged of it when he went home and shewed the knife.</p>
               <p>SMITH's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>That is not the knife that is produced; I know the knife, it was a broad pointed one with a crack in the handle. We sent Forrester after the boy and they would not go to take him. In the skirmish this good man knocked the young woman down; I went to take up her hat and he pushed me down; I lost my handkerchief and cap; I picked up his handkerchief instead of my own; being wet I put it into my pocket; I picked it off the flag stones. In the alehouse they asked me where my handkerchief was? I said it was in my pocket; Pagitt said, search her she has something that is not her own; they pulled the handkerchief out of my pocket; when I saw it was bloody I was amazed, knowing it was not my own. I never saw the man before in my life.</p>
               <p>THOMPSON's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As this young woman and a little boy and I were coming up New Gravel lane we met this young man; the little boy said he had been to sea with that young man; he asked him whether he would give him any thing to drink, for he had no money. We went into a publick house in New Gravel lane and had a pot of purl. This young woman and the little boy and I came out together and left Henley behind. We came about half a dozen doors from the publick house; that gentleman the prosecutor snatched my hat off my head; I asked him what that was for; he asked me whether I did not like it; I said I did not as I had given him no offence. He made no more to do but pushed me down. I holloa'd out, and this young man came up; as he was coming by I was crying and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100019"/> saying, O! Lord I have lost my hat that I gave seven shillings for yesterday! this young man said, who has done it? I said that man has done it; my nose and mouth were all of a gore of blood; when the young man asked who had done it; the man (the prosecutor) collared the young man. That is all I know about it; how the cut came God knows; I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. You have heard what these women say, is it true? - There is not one word of truth in it. The whole circumstance was not above ten minutes before the doctor was sent for.</p>

I went to bed at eleven o'clock; the cellar door was locked, and I left all the doors fast. I got up about six in the morning. I did not know that my house had been robbed. A porter came in and said, a man was in the cage; that man was the prisoner. Between ten and eleven o'clock the officers were bringing the prisoner by my door to the justice's. I asked where he had been all night? They said in the cage. The officers had found him with two casks of liquor upon his back, going along Cabel-street. I desired to look at the casks; I found them to be my property. I unlocked my cellar and found these casks were missing. I cannot positively say that the bars of the window were fast at night, as I had not particularly seen them, but I believe I might have seen them secure a day or two before, but I cannot be positive that they were secure when I went to bed that night.</p>

               <p>About four o'clock that evening I went into a publick-house, the Kettle Drum. I staid there till past eleven o'clock; when I went to go home the door was shut. I turned from thence up Catherine-street; going along Rosemary-lane, I wanted some house to drink in; I could find none open. I went home thinking to knock my landlord up, to be let in. I met a man with these casks; he asked me to carry them to the Strand, and offered me a shilling for it. I said I would; I carried them along; he followed me. The watchman held up his lantern and asked me what I had there? I said I did not know. I laid them down and turned round to look for the man, but could not see him. The watchman laid hold of my collar, and said I must go along with him. I said I would go without his holding my collar. They took me next morning to the justice. I told them where I was quartered. They took me to the house of the landlord, and he owned the cask.</p>

               <p>I keep the One Tun. I was not at home when the things were found out. My sister-in-law sent to me. I sent for Mr. Rodd, the constable, and had the woman taken up. She denied it. The constable searched her pockets and found a tumbler glass in her pocket, which was my property. We took her to the watch-house. She denied it still. The constable and I took Hutchins up. A soldier who was quartered upon me had given me information that he had heard a woman and this man appoint to meet at such a place. We went there and took up William Hutchins. He confessed he had the watch of her and pawned it. We brought him to the watch-house. We went and told the woman (for they were separate) that Hutchins has confessed he received the watch from her. Then she begged for mercy, and confessed she had taken the petticoats and things in the indictment out of Mrs. Harrett's chest. Hutchins said, she gave it to him in another man's name, and desired him to get some money upon it. He told us the pawnbroker. We went there. It was next door to the watch-house, and there we found the watch. The man used to come after her, and sweet-heart her, as he said.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On Friday the 5th Mr. Macnavan sent for me and gave me charge of the woman at the bar. I found a glass tumbler of Mr. Macnavan's in her pocket. I took her to the watch-house; after that I took up Hutchins at the Gun. I asked him if he knew Mr. Macnavan's cook? He said yes. I said I have taken her up for stealing a watch. She says you have got the watch. He said he was innocent of the crime, but he had pawned the watch, that she told him she got it of one Harry who owed her money to make money of it; that he took the watch to Mr. Gordon's, and pawned it for half a guinea. I took him to the watch-house directly. He said he was to meet this woman the next evening, and give her the half guinea. I went down to her and told her the man had confessed all the robbery. She then went on her knees and confessed the fact herself. The prisoner said he was waiting for the woman when I took him at the publick-house. He went with me very readily. I believe the man to be innocent of knowing the watch had been stolen.</p>

               <p>I live at Iver in Buckinghamshire. Last Monday night about three quarters after six o'clock I lost a box out of the Iver waggon, by the <placeName id="t17810110-22-crimeloc126">Saracen's Head gate-way</placeName>

               <p>What part of the waggon was the box in? - About the middle; I saw the prisoner get into the tail of the waggon at the corner of the Old Bailey, and pull the box to the tail of the waggon. I lost him till I came to the Inn; then I saw him get in and take the box. I went after him and took him with it on his shoulder. My waggon was robbed before; but detecting them in the waggon, I could do nothing with them. Therefore I did not interrupt him while he was in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the man that removed the box in the Old Bailey, is the same man who took the box out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that man is the prisoner? - Yes. He looked into the waggon several times as I came down Fleet-street; at the end of the Old Bailey he got into it, and

             this box to the tail of the waggon; when we came to the Saracen's Head he got into the waggon again and took the box out. I went after him and laid hold of him, he knocked me down, and said he was not the man; that the man with the box had ran up a court. I took him with it on his shoulder.</p>

Two went on the left hand side; Hodges jumped up behind the cart and rode for the space of half a minute reaching over into the cart; he did not take any thing out; then he jumped down and went to his companions and I followed them till they came almost to Bishopsgate church; then Hodges jumped up again, almost in the same posture he was before, and took out a bundle. I asked a man to assist me to take them, but he would not have any thing to do with it. I then went over the way and told the boy who drove the cart that his cart was robbed; and the boy and I ran down Houndsditch after the prisoner, but could see nothing of him; I described the prisoner to one of Justice Wilmot's men, who said he knew him extremely well; and he was taken by Mr. Wilmot's man on the Sunday morning following.</p>
               <p>Had you opportunity enough that night to observe the person in the cart, so as to be sure it was the prisoner? - Yes. I observed him particularly; I saw him again on the Monday; I am very sure the prisoner is the person. I had seen him at the time of the rioting and knew him again directly.</p>

               <p>Did she give you any warning that she was going? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any quarel? - No; I saw some of the things afterwards at Bow-street. In her room I saw six yards of lawn; the window curtains; a pair of snuffers; a bason, and neck handkerchief. Mr. Carpmeal went with me to the place and I found them in the room. I can swear to them all; one of the table spoons has a rock engraved upon it, and the word firm; and A. D. C. on another. I can swear to the other table spoon by the bruises as particular marks.</p>

               <p>On the 13th of December the prisoner Martin came to live servant with me; on the 14th in the morning she went off. When I got up in the morning I found the door open; I went into the kitchen for a light; when I came into the parlour I missed a watch which had hung up in the parlour; I concluded we were robbed by the prisoner. I alarmed the house; my wife got up and missed the rest of the things mentioned in the indictment. I went to the office in Bow-street, I advertised the prisoner and the property lost, and she was taken about Christmas, and we had notice to attend at the office; I went and saw six tea spoons which I can identify.</p>

               <p>I am wife of the last witness. I hired the prisoner at the bar as a servant, on the 13th of December. I took her on her own account. I was to send into Kent for her character. I went to bed on the 13th of December, at night, On the 14th when we got up we found the house was robbed of the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them).</p>
               <p>When did you hear of them again? - On the Wednesday following; then one of the men from Bow-street office came to our house to inform me she was apprehended. When I was at the office she would not own to any thing she had taken.</p>
               <p>What do you think those goods are worth all together, be rather under than over? - I would not be hard; I will suppose them under forty shillings. On the Saturday following I was ordered to attend at Bow-street again; then she owned where the goods were.</p>
               <p>Were any promises or threats made use of to induce her to make this confession? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100029"/> None. She gave the names of two different pawnbrokers in the Strand.</p>

               <p>I am housekeeper to Mr. Crawford. Upon the 1st of November my master was distressed for a servant; I went to the office in Holbourn, facing St. Andrew's Church. I enquired for a servant; the prisoner was recommended to me. My mistress hired her at twelve o'clock the next day. I was not in the room when she was hired.</p>
               <p>Did she act as a servant in the house? - Yes, the time she staid, which was from twelve o'clock till within a quarter of six at night. Then I went down stairs to show her where the candles and candlesticks were, that she might bring up lights. I found the door open. I walked into the kitchen and missed her. I found a white apron on the floor in the kitchen; I went to hang it up under a cloak, which belonged to my young mistress, and missed the cloak. I was frightened, and ran up to the side-board; the plate was all gone, except a coffee-pot and a butter-boat. All the pieces of plate mentioned in the indictment were gone (repeating them).</p>
               <p>How long before she was gone had you seen all that plate in the house? - Not above five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Was there any other person in the house who could take the plate away? - No. There was no person in the house but my mistress, the young lady, and me.</p>
               <p>You do not know where they were found? - No.</p>

               <p>What time was it? - Some time past six in the evening; I thought it was almost half after six. I went to the Britannia for a cutlass or something to assist me, and the woman said it was about a quarter after six.</p>
               <p>Had you been drinking at the Shepherd and Shepherdess? - No; my brother and I went straight from where we were at work; as we were going through a lane near Islington, we passed by two men; then we met another, and he passed us; and then we met another and he passed us; they then turned back after us and laid hold of me; by the coat behind, and one of them made a job at me with a cutlass.</p>
               <p>Which was that? - I cannot swear to that man, there was a man taken up two or three days after that, who I believe to be the person, but I could not swear to him. My brother put up his hand over my head and catched the cutlass; it cut his hand. I cried out murder! upon which three of them laid hold of me and one of my brother. I cried murder! whether they threw me down or I fell down I cannot say. They beat me with the butt end of a cutlass till my head ran down with blood every way. I was so bad I could not stand for two or three days after. They put a handkerchief in my mouth, that I should not cry out; I got the handkerchief out of my mouth and cried out murder! and then they put their hands before my mouth. I bit one of their fingers, in trying to get their hands from my mouth; then they began searching my pockets, and one of them said, d - n him, rip him up or cut him up. Then they took out a clasp knife and began ripping up my pockets. I said pray, gentlemen, forgive my life, I have no money you are welcome to search. We had but ninepence between us. I had nothing but a pruning knife, they took that from me, and then went to my brother.</p>
               <p>Do you know any of the persons who committed this robbery? - The prisoner was one of the three who were beating me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes. I am.</p>
               <p>Was it light at this time? - I had a small lantern and a candle in it.</p>
               <p>How soon after this was the prisoner taken? - The man who took him, said they had him in custody a quarter before seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100032"/> that same night. I subscribed the man to Mr. Howes; he had seen four people talking in a publick-house, in Old-street-road. My brother and I went and had our wounds dressed, and then we came to the house; the prisoner was there without his hat. I bid him put his hat on and then I said, that is one of them.</p>
               <p>At the time they were beating of you, was the light in your lantern? - No, it was gone out.</p>
               <p>So that all your knowledge of this man is from your having first of all met him? - No, he was one of the three that came to lay hold of me.</p>
               <p>Your lantern was out then? - No, it was put out by the second or third blow they made at me.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You did not know this young man before at all? - No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>When he was taken up it was on account of his having spoken with four persons at a publick-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have described yourself as having been robbed by four; he was not one of the four who came into the publick-house? - No. He spoke to the four men.</p>
               <p>Whether you did not say you thought this was the man who had the bite of the finger, and if you saw the finger you could swear to him? - No. I said one had a bite of the finger, if I saw him I could swear to him. I said I believed I could swear to two out of the four; one of the three that came to me I bit in the finger.</p>
               <p>You said you thought if he had a bite in the finger you could swear to him? - That was another man.</p>
               <p>The whole transaction lasted but a few minutes? - They had me down ten minutes I suppose.</p>
               <p>At six o'clock at this time of the year I believe it is dark? - Yes; it was dark.</p>

               <p>I was present with my brother the night he was robbed. We were going from the Shepherd and Shepherdess to Islington; in the lane this side the first field from Islington, about half way up, we met two men; they passed us; a little farther we met another and he passed us; we met a fourth, he passed us; we went on about our business. When we had gone about ten yards, as we were going between the stiles, they came back and catched my brother by the back part of the collar; I looked back and saw the cutlass over his head. I held up my left hand and catched the cutlass; I have the scar of it now. I held the cutlass in my hand and took the man by the collar and he and I struggled a good bit; then he got me up against a post and held the cutlass over my head and a pistol to my breast, and said if I offered to move or wag, or holloa, he would blow my brains out; then he asked me if I had any money? I told him no, I had not. Then he unbottoned my breeches to see if I had any watch and searched my pockets; he felt something in my breeches pocket and asked what it was? I said I had no money. He said I had and took nine pence out of my pocket. Then the other three left my brother and came to me; a young man came up to me with a cutlass and swore he would run me through; my right hand was pinned back against the post; seeing him coming up to me I gave him a smack on the face; I thought I should have been killed; I thought my brother was dead. One asked me if I was cut? I said, yes; my hand was almost cut off; they said I was very well off and bid me walk away and not run, for they should know me again.</p>
               <p>Do you know either of these men? - No; I cannot swear to either of them; Howes is not here; he took the prisoner. He saw the prisoner and four more come from Moorfields, and the prisoner drank with them at the Round About House in Old-street.</p>

His mother said she had some cold fish; he sat down and eat some; I suppose it was half after five o'clock before he began to eat his dinner.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay at home? - Till near six o'clock; his mother and he had been insuring a number in the lottery; his mother said, Well Neddy, I would have you go down to Fore-street to see what luck we have had to night. He went out of the house a little before six; he was gone the best part of an hour; I was never out of the house; it was very near seven when he came back. He had not been in the house above five minutes before some people came and knocked at the door and took him.</p>

               <p>How far is your house from Islington? - From the place where they say the robbery was committed, it is better than half a mile.</p>

I gave the landlady 1 s. it came to sixpence; the prisoner took the sixpence in change from the landlady. When I was coming out of doors the prisoner said I should give them a shilling to get oysters, or something of that sort. I told them I could not afford it. One<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100036"/> made answer I should give them three pence. I said I had no halfpence, I could not afford it. They teazing me, I put my hand into my pocket to take the halfpence, and took out a guinea; and the prisoner took it out of my hand. I went to seek for a constable to take her up.</p>

               <p>Where did you find her? - At the Angel and Sun.</p>
               <p>Did you see her go into the house when you came away? - No.</p>
               <p>What did she say when you charged the constable with her? - She denied having it, and we took her to the watch-house. I went with them.</p>
               <p>What did she say there? - She denied it.</p>
               <p>How much money had you in your pocket? - Near three pounds.</p>

               <p>On Monday night, going down the street, I met the prosecutor with a young woman. I asked him to give me something to drink. He said he was going farther down the street, and would as he came back. He met me as he came back with two other women; we took him into the Angel and Sun and he treated us with sixpenny-worth of liquor. We then asked him for a shilling to get something for supper? He said he had nothing but two-pence. I went about my business. About eleven o'clock, I went into the Angel and Sun, and the prosecutor was there at supper with three women. He charged the watch with me, and took me to the watch-house. He broke open the door and lay with me all night. He charged another woman with it, and she gave him eight shillings back.</p>
               <p>Did you charge another woman with it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you receive some of it back from another woman? - Yes, eight shillings from a woman who was with her.</p>

               <p>Did you pass that night with the prisoner? - I did not break open the door.</p>
               <p>I asked you whether you passed that night with the prisoner? - Some part of the night.</p>

             is my son; he lodges with me. On Tuesday when he went out in the morning he left his coat on a chair in the back room. The prisoner came into the house and pretended she wanted to make water. I took her to the back room. I was in the shop while she was in the room; when she was gone I missed the great coat. I made enquiry after it and found it at a pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Coxe.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any damage being done to Mr. Coxe's house? - Yes; it was on a Wednesday morning in Jene. I know the prisoner was concerned in it.</p>
               <p>Were there many persons there? - I suppose there might be twenty boys and men concerned. I was in the old dwelling-house which Mr. Coxe used to live in. The old dwelling-house was not injured at that time.</p>
               <p>How far is the old house from the house which was injured? - It may be ten or fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>What was done to Mr. Coxe's house? - They pulled the inside of it out; I saw them carry out the linings of the window's and the skirting of the house, and the middle part of the stairs were entirely destroyed. I could see that from the old dwelling-house, for I never was in the new house. Afterwards some of the floors were taken up.</p>
               <p>Where did you see the prisoner? - I saw him pull the skirting down, which was part of the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>How long did you see him there? - Ten or fifteen minutes; then I went back again.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do any thing else? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know why they went away? - No.</p>
               <p>Were any of these fifteen or twenty persons employed at the same time? - Yes. They were employed in pulling the boards of the house down.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner before? - Yes; I know him by sight.</p>
               <p>What is he? - A <rs id="t17810110-33-deflabel201" type="occupation">carpenter</rs>

               <p>How many people might there be assembled? - Twenty or more. I saw Davy Miller there between the hours of eight and ten, on the Wednesday morning. I saw him pulling at the sash weight.</p>
               <p>How were the others employed? - Some were carrying out boards and timbers belonging<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100038"/> to the house. I was standing at the back of this house, in the counting-house of Mr. Coxe's old dwelling-house, with the last witness.</p>

               <p>How came you just now to do it? - There were three or four of us together.</p>
               <p>Is he so desperate a fellow you could not have done it before? - No.</p>

               <p>Was it on the ground when she came in? - No. I picked the persian up, and told her it was my property. I was satisfied in my own mind it must come from some part of her clothes. I immediately ordered one of my servants to go for a constable.

She offered me all she had about her and all she had in the world if I would not proceed against her. She further said, if I would go into the back shop with her she would relate something to me that would induce me not to proceed against her; she entreated Cope in the same manner and said she had something to say to him that would induce me not to proceed against her. The other when we detained Gilson was exceedingly troublesome; she said there was nothing found upon her, and if we would not let her go she would force her way. We locked them both in till the constable came, and then we took them in a coach to the justice's.</p>

               <p>About four o'clock last monday afternoon the prisoners came to our shop and enquired for some white persian; I shewed them two quantities; I told them they should have a yard of the best for two shillings. When I cut that off, they enquired if I had got any pale pink persian? I told them we had; I shewed them two pink persians, one paler than the other, the palest of which they fixed on; and enquired of me the quantity that would take to line the hood of a cloak. I turned to the farthest woman,

At the time I was looking over the counter I saw the piece of persian standing up under the stays of Gibson; it seemed to me to stand nearly perpendicular to the peak of the stays.</p>
               <p>It did not stand on the ground? - No.</p>
               <p>She had a long cloak on, you could not see whether she kept it up with her hands or her legs? - Probably both; I cut her off the persian.</p>
               <p>You did not see her take it off the counter? - I did not see it till after it was in her possession. I cut her off a piece of persian and missed the largest piece of the white persian off the counter; I was then sure it was a piece of persian she had got in her possession. She then enquired for some quilted coats, which I shewed her; she bought a quilted coat, and gave seventeen shillings and sixpence for it. I put it in a piece of paper and came on the other side of the counter, the side next the door. The coat was put up in paper and tied; and as they were going out of the shop they said they should call the next day and buy a cloak. I went out of the shop; I passed by Mr. Arnett, and told him the women had robbed us. I overtook them very soon after they got off the step of the door; they were never out of my sight. I stopped them and told them they had robbed us of a piece of persian; they said, what! we rob you? Yes said I, you have; you must come back and I will search you; they came back into the shop; I catched hold of

               <p>"Is there any sink in it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>"Is there any cupboard or door by that sink? - There is a door shuts in the sink that parts the kitchen and the sink; it is a sort of a closet.</p>
               <p>"Have you ever been down in the hole below the kitchen? - I never saw any thing of the like kind; the boards were nailed down.</p>
               <p>"When did you see it? - Three or four months ago.</p>

               <p>"In May or June? - I cannot say; it was before last term.</p>
               <p>"Have you any thing to do with the terms? - No, only I was here attending last term.</p>
               <p>"Last session you mean? - Yes.</p>
               <p>"Did you know this house in the month of March? - Yes, before that; I knew the house before Mr. Wilson was in it; a relation of mine lived in the house.</p>
               <p>"Was there any communication from the sink to this hole? - I never saw any thing like it.</p>
               <p>"Have you examined it enough to say there is no communication from this place to the kitchen? - I have.</p>
               <p>"There is no communication? - No.</p>
               <p>"You swear there was no communication in the month of March? - Yes; and I stand to it.</p>
               <p>"I asked you if you had been acquainted with the house before? - Yes; three years.</p>
               <p>"Have you examined the house sufficiently to swear to the situation of it in the month of March? - I have, and there was no communication from the sink to the hole that you speak of; I can speak within these three years, there has been no communication.</p>
               <p>"Was there any communication from any other part of the kitchen to this place? - I never saw any, I examined it thoroughly; I can say positively there was not.</p>
               <p>"Have you been in the hole since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>"Which way did you go in? - From the top of the house.</p>
               <p>"Jury. Do you call the sink the closet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>"There is a communication from this closet to the hole? - No, Mr. Wilson asked me to go down and examine the place, that was about a fortnight before last session; I have lain in the house several nights.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>"Where do you live? - At No. 7, Aldersgate-buildings.</p>
               <p>"When you went to this house you found it in the same situation as it was when you saw it before? - I did not see any difference.</p>
               <p>"The wainscoting was not pulled down, nor the cupboards altered at all? - I did not see any difference.</p>
               <p>"How came you to examine if there was any communication between the hole and the kitchen? - Mr. Wilson desired me, for he said there was a fellow would swear his life away, and he must be guarded against him, if possible; I know there was an affair happened in that house and I was surprised at it.</p>
               <p>"How did you get down into the hole? - From the top of the house, the top story.</p>
               <p>"Three pair of stairs? - I believe there is two pair of stairs besides the garrets, because I plaistered the garrets I went through.</p>
               <p>"This passage was from the garrets down to the hole? - Yes.</p>
               <p>"How deep was it? - About twenty-seven, or between twenty and thirty foot.</p>
               <p>"This hole did not exist then, nor upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100042"/> your oath never did exist? - I do not know that it ever did exist; there never was a hole made in the sink to appearance.</p>
               <p>"Nor under the sink? - No.</p>
               <p>"Jury. Whether you saw that hole in the month of March? - I did not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You I believe went from Bow-street in the month of March to Wilson's house? - I did; when I went first there I was taking care of the back part of the house in Clerkenwell-close; I was outside. A man who went by the name of Nash jumped out of the back parlour window into the yard; he was taken into custody, and I got in at the window he came out of; after he was in custody the other officers who were in the front of the house entered the house; I knew nothing of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100043"/> what they were doing, till I came forward; we searched some time but did not find any thing. Our information was so exact and strong that we knew coining must be carried on somewhere in and about the house. In a short time after that, a man whose name was West was found in the kitchen, but I was not present when he was first seen there; I saw him afterwards in the kitchen with one of his shoulders all over white; a little time after that, being satisfied he must have come from some concealed place, Prothero and I went up stairs; I saw Prothero pull up a board in a little room; the whole house is but one floor; it opened like a well into a closet. I immediately went down by a rope, and there were little pieces of wood nailed upon the wainscotting in order to make steps. Where I got down to the bottom I saw a complete apparatus for coining; the closet appeared to me to come into the kitchen where I had seen West. When I got down to a level with the kitchen, there was a square hole cut out of the floor, and that led to a hole which was dug in the ground. In that hole all the apparatus for coining was found; the passage I went down had been a closet in the kitchen, but it was nailed up and did not appear like a closet, but as wainscotting; there was no appearance in the kitchen of any communication. I then came up stairs again.</p>
               <p>Did you after that find out any other communication with the hole besides that from the one pair of stairs room? - Yes; the hole the presses came out was on a level with the kitchen; the presses were drawn from the places where they were fixed, and lifted up, and taken in at the hole of the kitchen; from the earth at the bottom of this hole, where the presses were fixed, it went up perpendicular to the first floor, but there was a hole by the side of the sink, through which the presses were taken out.</p>
               <p>Describe that second hole? - It was made larger for the presses to be drawn up through it; when I first saw it, it was big enough for any person to come out of.</p>
               <p>Did you see it before any of the presses were drawn through? - I did; it was then large enough for a man to go down.</p>

               <p>The presses are a very great weight and large? - Yes; they weigh half a ton.</p>
               <p>This hole was by the sink, was it under the sink? - By the side, or under, I will not say which; I think the hole came from underneath the sink but I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I understand you to say that you had such an information that you had no doubt of coining being carried on here? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Did your information extend to tell you what they were coining? - Yes; it did.</p>
               <p>Then you must know that this coining business could not be carried on without some large machines? - We know that well.</p>
               <p>Then consequently wherever these machines were, they must take up a pretty considerable space to work, including room for the workmen? - That depends upon the size of the fly.</p>
               <p>Who were the officers that went in at the front of the house? - Prothero was one; I believe Lebar was at the back with me.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect who you found in the kitchen? - I do not.</p>
               <p>I forget whether you said West was or not in the kitchen when you came in? - I am very sure he was not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether there was one door or two in this kitchen? - There were many doors and trap doors I really cannot tell how many.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect in the kitchen there is a door on the right hand that goes into a bedroom? - I believe there is.</p>
               <p>Beyond that door there is a pantry? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Then you come to the closet? - Where there had been a closet which was made up with wainscotting.</p>
               <p>Beyond this closet was the sink? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That ranged with the closet likewise? - I think it joined it.</p>
               <p>To that sink there is a door? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100044"/>What may be the height of the sink from the ground? - I suppose pretty near three feet.</p>
               <p>Then the hole in question was under the sink as you think or by its side? - I think underneath.</p>
               <p>The hole you are speaking of, if it was underneath, it could not be higher than the sink. - I should think not.</p>
               <p>Was it stopped up with a fixed wainscot or moving wainscot or a door? - I did not take particular notice of that.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether that hole was in a position to have completed the partition between the hole where the machines were and the sink or not; you said you did not see it at first, but it was made larger? - I saw it in the same state before the presses were taken up.</p>
               <p>Where was you then, in the hole below or up stairs in the kitchen? - I came down stairs; I saw it first when I was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>How did you find that out, was it not by a knocking, by agreement some of the people were to knock that you might find out the place? - It was.</p>
               <p>You did not find this place out? - After they had knocked I came down stairs and one of the officers said here is the place West came out at. I was up stairs when the knocking was.</p>
               <p>This discovery of the hole was not made till you had been down the hole from above stairs? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>In order to take up the presses there was a great quantity of wainscoting removed? - There was.</p>
               <p>One of the other officer's found the loose boards and you went down, how long had you been in the house before you made that discovery? - I suppose twenty minutes or half an hour.</p>
               <p>One of your fellow officers swore upon the former trial that you had searched for the space of two hours, I believe, and could not find any implements for coining? - I do not think we were two hours searching, we were in the house three hours, but not searching so long for the place.</p>
               <p>Court. All this was, I understand, concealed to the eye? - Yes, it was. I was there with Mr. Vernon the day after we brought the things away; it was then as we left it.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing a pail and a quantity of coals under the sink? - I do not. I always make it a rule to go out of court when a trial comes on in which I am to be called as a witness, whether I am ordered so to do or not, therefore I cannot tell what any other person said.</p>

               <p>You are one of the officers who went to Wilson's house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the kitchen when you first came in? - Yes, I was the first person who entered the kitchen.</p>
               <p>When did you see West? - I had been in the kitchen I believe five minutes before I saw him.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him? - In the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Was not you surprised at that? - I was.</p>
               <p>Which way did he come into the kitchen? - Under the sink.</p>
               <p>Describe the place from which he came? - When I went into the kitchen there was no person in the kitchen; I looked all round the room; I looked under the dresser where there were some coppers. I opened a drawer in the dresser in the kitchen, I there found some things which led me to be very certain coining was carried on there. Mrs. Wilson was in the kitchen. I spoke to her. I was coming out of the kitchen; I met another of the officers, Labar. He said we have catched a man who jumped out of the window. In a minute or less after that I was going to tell him what I had found in the drawer; I turned round, and West was behind my back. I said</p>
               <p>"Good God, where are you come from, out of the earth?" Said he, I was sitting by the fire. I replied,</p>
               <p>"it is impossible a cat should be there without my seeing it, for I have searched every place." I examined round the room to see if there was any door, at which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100045"/> he could come in. I could not find any door to come into that room, besides the door I stood at myself, except one, and that was nailed up fast. We secured him, and after searching some time, we found behind the wainscoting, in a back place behind the kitchen, a private still at work, which was in a room behind the kitchen, where the door was fastened. After being there sometime, I went up into the one-pair-of-stairs room. I talked to some women who were there. One woman was washing. I went into a little room, and in the middle of the room I saw a crack between two boards which were greasy; I thought a board might be taken up by a knife. I took out my cutlass and ran it between the two boards and lifted them up. Mr. Clark went down first; I followed him. There were steps to go down, and two ropes to lay hold of. When we came even with the kitchen there was an hole cut in the ground which went a little side-ways where the presses were fixed; then I desired some of the officers to go into the kitchen, where I secured West, and I would knock below, that they might give me an answer, that we might find out the communication at which West had come out. I went down and knocked with an hammer, and they halloo'd out. I then, directed by the voice, came to the kitchen floor. I desired them to knock again. One of them knocked; and then I found the hole West came out of. I believe one of the officers came out through the hole directly, for there were coals under the sink, and I did not choose to dirty my clothes. I then went up into the one-pair-of-stairs room and came down into the kitchen. I took a pick-axe, and pulled down the wainscoting. When I had pulled down the wainscoting I perceived how he had come out. The sink was on the left-hand side of the wainscot where the hole was made to go down; and at the bottom of the sink, underneath the sink, there was a hole that led into the hole where the coining tools were.</p>
               <p>Was the hole under the sink visible? - Not till the place was opened; it was only at that time that I knew of it; it was impossible to see it.</p>
               <p>Was the place always open? - There was a peck and a half, or half a bushel, of coals under the sink, it was a sink where they washed dishes and such things.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the hole concealed with any thing? - There was a moveable slap.</p>
               <p>When it was shut then you could not see that there was a way down? - Not without searching for it.</p>
               <p>But when it was open there was an hole to go down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that hole big enough for a man to go down? - Yes. Big enough for me; and I am as big as most men.</p>
               <p>There were coals there? - Yes, for the use of the family.</p>
               <p>Was there an hole in the kitchen as well as upon a level with the kitchen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could a person live in the kitchen without seeing this? - They might without seeing it; but when I pulled the wainscot down a person could not go into the kitchen without seeing it.</p>

               <p>You were in the kitchen when West made his appearance? - Prothero's back was towards me; he was telling me what he had found in the drawers. We were standing at the kitchen door in Wilson's house; I saw West come out of the closet; he came up towards Prothero; Prothero turned about and said,</p>
               <p>"Good God, where could you come from?" He said he had been sitting at the the fire. Prothero said that was impossible.</p>
               <p>This place then was inside a closet? - Yes, it was. The sink was in the closet.</p>
               <p>Had you looked in the closet before you saw West come out of it? - I had, and there was not a person there that I could see; I saw the door move and saw him come out. I had before looked in the closet and had shut the door.</p>
               <p>You was examined before upon the trial? - Yes.</p>

               <p>When you heard this complaint you went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100046"/> to Wilson's house with the officers? - The officers went into this house on the 29th of March. On the 7th of April the persons taken in the house were brought to Sir John Fielding's office for examination; it was my duty to attend upon that occasion, and the same account was given substantially as now. After the examination was over, they laid it was a curious contrivance to conceal the coining. I went with Clark and Prothero to look at this place. I there found it to be as it had been and is now described and that there was a cummunication just as it has been described. Take all the house together with the sliding wainscot and barricadoes, it was very curious.</p>

               <p>You have heard the evidence Clark, Prothero, and Labar have given to-day about this hole? - I have.</p>
               <p>Is it the same as they gave before you then as a juryman? - Literally the same.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the two defendants swearing there was no communication from the kitchen to the hole under ground? - Two or three of us went to view this place; it is as the witnesses have now represented it; they went down from the one-pair-of-stairs room behind the wainscot into about two feet below the level of the kitchen floor; the place in which they carried on the business of coining was not above four feet high; a man could not stand upright in it. They went along an aqueduct dug out of the ground. When they came to the level of the floor, into this place where the business was carried on, there was clearly a communication from out of this passage into the kitchen, but notwithstanding there had been I apprehend something of a moving door of communication, but that might be fastened when the officers were there, and no one might know how to open it but those more immediately concerned; but there was a door I am as clear as that I am here a living man. I was exceedingly particular in my observations whether there had been any nailing, for there were ledges there; I could not find out any nailing at all. I am firmly of opinion there had been a communication under the sink. It was like a closet with folding-doors. There was a partition between one part fastened up, the other part open with the sink; the sink stood about two feet three or six inches high; and the communication from under that sink was from under the right-hand side into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Do you think, that after having been told all the story you have heard, any person, going there with a view of seeing whether there was a communication or no, could possibly miss this, going for the purpose of observing it? - By no means.</p>

               <p>You have, with Mr. Gregory, examined this hole? - I have.</p>
               <p>Do you believe there was a door there of communication from under the sink? - I believe so. I believe the design of it was that in case any person should be in the kitchen who was not acquainted with coining carrying on there, they might go up stairs, and when they did not choose to go that way, they went through this passage.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A surveyor.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect, about the 16th of September, examining the kitchen of this house of Willson's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the closet where the sink was? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you examine, or gone into the hole, where the coining business had been carried on? - I looked in, I did not go down; that was not under the sink, it was in the closet adjoining; there is a partition between the closet, or beaufet, and the closet were the sink was. I saw, up stairs, that one of the joists and the flooring was cut away; I looked up and down, and saw there had been a communication made from above, to the level with the kitchen floor, and there was no hole under the sink, but in the closet adjoining<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100047"/> the sink; if there is any under the sink it is more than I know of.</p>
               <p>Did you examine under the sink? - I think, to the best of my recollection, there was no hole in the closet where the sink was.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the closet where the sink was? - I don't think there was room to go in; I stood by the door. I have here a copy of my survey. (The witness reads.)</p>
               <p>"My opinion is, there never was a way into the said cellar through the adjoining closet where the old sink is."</p>
               <p>Did you examine the sink? - I stood close by the sink.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the closet adjoining to the sink? - The hole was as big as the closet pretty near; there was no room for a person to stand inside</p>
               <p>"and further it appears to me that part of the old partition between said closet and beaufet has been forcibly broken away and that there was never any hatch door whatsoever under the said sink."</p>
               <p>Did you stand in such a position as to be able to examine whether there was or not? - I examined the adjoining closet more p articularly.</p>
               <p>Did you examine where the sink was? - I looked in and poked my stick into it; if there was a hole under the sink I do not think any man could get down between the bottom of the sink and the floor.</p>
               <p>Why did not you examine it with your hands? - There was not room for any person to go there.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You did not go down this hole? - I only looked down it.</p>
               <p>How high was the sink from the floor? - About fourteen inches from the bottom.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gregory. I was down in the place and examined it very particularly; the sink was two feet three inches high.</p>
