On the 24th of March, about half-past eight o'clock at night, my wife and I were sitting in the back kitchen, with my little girl - it was quite dark. I thought I heard somebody in the parlour, which was let to Mrs. Williams, who had been out ever since twelve o'clock in the day. I know the window of her room was shut down an hour before. My wife sent the girl up the area steps, she returned, and in consequence of what she said I went up the area steps; the prisoner jumped out of the window and fell into the area - I saw nobody else jump out. I secured him, and asked what business he had there? he said he was not in the parlour, but that a man had shoved him down the steps. I took him to Mount-street watch-house. I saw a bedgown found in his hat, which belonged to Mrs. Williams; she is my sister. He said he lived with his sister in St. Giles's, that his father had forsaken him, and when he came before the Magistrate he said he lived in Cato-street.</p>

On the 30th of March I came home about twelve o'clock in the day, and found the lock of my box, which was in the bed-room, had been taken off and nailed on again - I had left it locked. I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which were worth 66 s. - I saw them all in the box that morning about eight o'clock, when I went on duty. I left the prisoner asleep in the tap-room when I went out. I took the key with me. I went to the barracks, and reported to the pay-sergeant that I had been robbed, and that the prisoner was absent. I have since seen a pair of shoes, which were taken from another box in the room which was not locked. I had seen them that morning.</p>

            . I keep a print-shop at the corner of John-street, St. James's-square. Between three and four o'clock of the 26th of March I heard a great rush and ran to the door - I saw a spoon lying in the street, and some more in the area. I secured the property, and gave it to the constable, who returned it to me two or three days after. I produced them.</p>

I remember the night in question I went out about twenty minutes before nine o'clock, I had examined my cash-box a few minutes before I went. I had more money than I liked to keep in the house, took out 45 l., and left six 5 l. and three 1 l. notes, a sovereign, and various papers, in the box. I was going to Holborn, as I passed Mr. Clark's I saw three persons standing at his private door - the prisoner at the bar was standing with his back to the shutters, the other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120006"/>two, one looking towards Lincoln's Inn, the other towards the market - it was after his shop was shut; there was a gas-light just over the shop window; there is a light likewise from the Coffee-house; when I saw them stop, I was going to address them, but did not, thinking they were Mr. Clark's journeymen waiting to be paid their wages. I took particular notice of the prisoner, as the light was directly on his face. I went on to Holborn, was sent for back, and missed my cash-box with all its contents. I immediately went to Bow-street, and to Charles-street, Drury-lane, with Jeffrey, the officer, where I saw a boy that I met between my window and Clark's, and pointed him out to the officer. I went to the corner of Brownlow-street with Furzeman - there were about thirty or forty persons there; it was about eleven o'clock. I fixed on the prisoner as the person whom I saw at Clark's door, and he was taken into custody, We took up two other persons for obstructing the officer, and took the prisoner and the other two to my house. They were all shewn to Mrs. Drew separately, the other two before the prisoner; she did not hesitate a moment, for when the prisoner was brought before her, she exclaimed,</p>

               <p>"That is the man!" and said she knew nothing of the other two. I never found any of the property.</p>

An officer stopped him, and asked if the trunk belonged to him? he said No - the officer then asked me if he was my master? I said he had employed me to carry the trunk - the officer detained him. I followed them to the Mansion House, and attended on Saturday, when Stringer claimed it.</p>

On Thursday, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was in Distaff-lane,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120007"/>and saw the prisoner running down the Old Change, with the trunk on his back, I followed him into Thames-street, and saw him deliver it to Davis - I stopped him in Botolph-lane, and asked him if the trunk belonged to him - he said No. I secured him and the porter said he had employed him. I did not secure him when I first saw him, because I was carrying some prints.</p>

            . I am quarter-master of the ship. On Sunday evening, between eight and nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the cabin, and on Monday morning the watch was missed. The prisoner kept his hammock locked up which made me suspect him. He said, that any man who could find the watch should have a bottle of rum. On the Saturday following I was by the Royal Exchange, and saw the prisoner with a seal and key hanging to his trowsers; and as he ran up to me he tucked it in. I immediately fetched Rice the officer.</p>

            . I live in Aliff-square, Essex-street, Whitechapel. I work at the leather-breeches trade. I have known the prisoner eight years. I met him in the Minories about twelve o'clock on Saturday week. He asked me to lend him a few shillings to pay for a watch which he had bought of a man, and who was with him. I saw the watch in the other man's hand. There were three of them together, the prisoner and two more. I lent him ten shillings, the other man gave him the watch, and the prisoner paid him some notes and some shillings. The watch looked like silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the man who sold him the watch since - A. No; on the Monday I heard the prisoner was apprehended. I did not go to ask him for the ten shillings, as I thought he would pay when he got clear.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money do you get - A. My husband allows me one pound a week for market money. I have four children. I did not see Rice, the officer, that day - it was about the middle of the day.</p>

            . I am a porter of Newgate-market. I saw the prisoner in Newgate-street with a quarter of beef on his shoulder. I looked at him, and seeing he was a stranger, and the tail of the cart being down rose my suspicion. I followed him into Green Arbour-court, to Breakneck-steps, Seacoal-lane, and asked him where he was going with it? he said on board a ship. I said that was the wrong way; he then said he was going to Fleet-market to sell it. I took him back, and the prosecutor claimed it.</p>

The two together surrounded me a moment, and I felt my watch taken away - one of the party ran away. I turned round, seized the prisoner instantly, and am certain he is the person; he exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"A dog has bit my thigh." I then dragged him into a public-house at the corner of the street, and desired the landlord to send for an officer, which he did, but with some reluctance. In the room I took the prisoner to there were a number of men assembled; as soon as I took him in, one of them asked me why I took a gentleman by the collar? he said he belonged to Bow-street. They got the prisoner away from me, and took him to the back of the room. The officer then arrived, and I pointed him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were many people in the street when you was robbed - A. No, only the two persons. I have not recovered my watch. As we were taking him to the watch-house a fellow came up, and tried to rescue him; he then attempted to escape himself, but did not. I felt the watch go from me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I take your watch - A. I cannot say, but I swear you struck me.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody, and searched him, but found nothing on him. I was taking him to the watch-house, and he endeavoured to disengage himself from his coat - he then whistled and one or two people came to his assistance. I sprang my rattle, and got the watchman to assist me in taking him to the watch-house. The men went away without attempting anything.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The person I lodge with was at work at the fire in Suffolk-street, and his wife sent me to see for him. A man came behind, and shoved me against the gentleman, a third came out of Exeter-street, and ran across the road. I had been bit by a dog about a week before, and I had hurt my thigh. The gentleman asked me what was the matter? I said I had hurt my thigh.</p>

I saw a man rise from under the window, and pass the door; I immediately went out a few paces from the house, and saw a man in the act of covering something over; I followed him a few yards. He then passed another man, I asked that man to pursue him, which he did; he went a very quick pace till he had covered the bundle, and then ran. I followed him into Tavistock-street, and saw him throw an apron down with something in it, in a court which leads to Covent-garden; he threw it down in the street, and turned into the court. A person gave me a piece of bombasin. I afterwards saw the prisoner secured; he is the same stature as the man, but I did not see his face. The pane was broken large enough for the property to be taken out.</p>

            . On the morning of the 14th of March I was going up Southampton-street about ten yards from the shop - the prisoner passed me; he was then wrapping up a piece of bombasin in an old blue apron, which I at first thought was a bag - he appeared very much confused - I took particular notice of him. When he had wrapped the bombasin up he began to run. The prosecutrix came up to me, and I pursued him up Tavistock-street; he threw the bombasin away at the corner of Tavistock-court, I picked it up and gave it to her, and in about a minute the officer stopped him. Neither the bombasin or the prisoner were ever out of my sight.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutrix. On the 9th of March I went to bed about half-past nine o'clock at night; there were four lodgers in the house, who were gone to bed. There are three doors, which I bolted myself and fastened the windows, Mrs. Slade unlocked her bedroom door, and found two chests of drawers opened and emptied - I had seen all the property safe in them that day; I found the window half open, and half a pane out of it. This window opens into the back garden - there is a gate which leads into the back garden; the window is five or six yards from the ground - there was no ladder against it.

On the 9th of March I was in my room about six o'clock in the evening - the property was safe then; it was scarcely light. I did not go up again till I went to bed - I was principally in the bar; the bedroom window is exactly over the taproom; we could not see a person in the garden. When I went to bed I missed the property stated in the indictment, and about 11 l. or 12 l. in silver money. I had written the names of the persons of whom I took the notes on them. I have seen my gowns, watches, and notes since.</p>

In consequence of information which I received, I went to Colebrook, which is about eight miles from Twickenham, on Thursday, the 16th of March, about a week after the robbery, I got there about three o'clock in the afternoon, with Jefferys; we went to a house where I understood Perks lived - I did not see him there, but I saw a woman, whom I understand was his wife.

I cannot swear to him, but another was with him whom he said was his brother. The gentleman said he was a doctor, and attended the London Hospital. He said his brother was a seafaring man, and asked if I could allow him to come and spend an hour or two with him in the evening, as he had not seen him for a long time. I said I had no objection. They came about eleven o'clock in the morning, went away, and came again about five in the evening both together. My daughter let them in. They went into the parlour. Soon after a porter came with a parcel - they were both in the room then. I went into the room to the cupboard, and took a spoon out of a silver cream-jug, the watch hung over the chimney-piece then. I went down stairs leaving them in the parlour with the porter. In about ten minutes I head Pulaston, the porter, go out. I heard the door close to.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your daughter - A. She was down stairs with me. When Pulaston came back I opened the street door to him, he said he wanted the two gentlemen. I opened the parlour door and they were gone. I missed the property as stated in the indictment, which is worth 7 l. 17 s. Thompson was one of the men, I talked a great deal to him. He said he had been to the Mediterranean, the other said he was a doctor. I can swear positively to Thompson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you live in the same house now - A. Yes. I did not see Thompson again till he was taken. He did not come till the evening, they then both came together.</p>

            . On the 28th of November, 1818, I took some tobacco for the prisoner Thompson, to the prosecutrix's house, he ordered it to be there by six o'clock. A little boy let me in and told me to go into the parlour where the prisoner Thompson, and the doctor sat together. I am sure Burke is the man who called himself the doctor. They were drinking grog. They told me I was half an hour too late, for the captain was gone to the Anchor-tavern to smoke his pipe. Thompson called himself the mate, and asked me for the bill and receipt, which I gave him. He asked me to take some rum which I did, and he wrote at the back of the bill</p>
               <p>"Please to pay the bearer, as I have received the tobacco." They sent me with a boy, who they called Jack, to the captain, who he said was in the parlour of the Anchor-tavern. Jack shewed me the parlour door and left me, saying the captain was there. They told me to enquire for Captain Thompson. I found no such person. I enquired at the bar - they did not know him. I went out, found the boy gone, ran as fast as I could to the house, and found the prisoners were gone, and the tobacco also. I had taken them forty pounds of tobacco. I did not see them again till they were apprehended.</p>

            . The doctor came about eleven o'clock, and took the lodging, and said he had a brother who was a seafaring man, and he wished to spend his evenings with him. He went away. He came again about five o'clock with Thompson, and a boy whom they called the cabin-boy. They sat in the parlour smoking till the porter came with the tobacco.

            , the magistrate - A. Yes; I said I was not certain the doctor was the man who took the lodging, because he was so disfigured and dirty. I thought at the office that as my mother swore to the other, it was not necessary for me to say more. I am now certain it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120011"/>him on seeing him now. I did not see the doctor till the second examination. I then said I was positively sure he was the man, but did not like to sware to him as my mother was not present.</p>
               <p>BURKE'S Defence. I was never in the house in my life, and never saw her daughter. When they came to identify me they said positively they had no knowledge of me. I was not committed on this charge, but for the tobacco, and had no idea of having to meet this charge. It is near two years ago. Mrs. Bond must certainly have a better opportunity of recollecting me than the porter.</p>
               <p>THOMPSON's Defence. I knew nothing of it. I was invited to the house by a doctor who was an acquaintance of mine. I left the house before he did, and knew nothing of the plate. It is more like a bad house than any thing else. That is the man (pointing to A. Seal), who persuaded her to swear to me.</p>

On the 15th of February, about eight o'clock in the evening, two lodgers came home and gave me seven 1 l. Bank-notes to take care of. Nobody was in the house but the prisoner, and he sat by the fire and saw me lock them up in my box below stairs. It stood on a table opposite the fire-place. I went out to get some butter and left him sitting there alone. I was gone about a quarter of an hour. On my return I found the door fast. A lodger who was out came up and we got in with her key. I found my box broken open, and the prisoner and money gone. He did not return. He had broken it open with a hatchet. I have not recovered the notes - he had lodged three weeks with me. I took him in out of charity. Nobody could have come in while I was out.</p>

I had left some company in the house. It was the prisoner and another that knocked me down. They both fell on me with their knees, held my mouth and hands, and robbed me of this property. I made every effort to cry out, but they throttled me. Before I could get up they run out of the court. One said to the other, have you got it? They then gave me a dreadful blow, and I was obliged to let my watch go. I lost them and returned to the house, knocked hard, but nobody came to the door, and I went home. Next morning I took an officer to the house and shewed the landlord where the prisoner sat, as he had been there all the evening. I knew him to be the man who robbed me, for it was a moon-light night and saw him plainly. I was sober. I had had a pot or two of beer before I went there. He was apprehended on Tuesday, and I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. How long have you been in town - A. I came up that night. I came from Manchester with Mr. Holden, he had been at the public-house with me, but was fetched home. We had called at several places in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any dispute at the house - A. There was a quarrel about a fire which was at the docks. I saw no fight. The prisoner and two or three others went out before me.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday after did you see the prisoner - A. He came running after me in the court, and asked if I wanted him. I said I wanted nothing of him. He had changed his dress. He was then dressed in a drab coat like a quaker. I did not know him in that dress.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Tabernacle-square. The prisoner came to me to know if I would buy some chairs, a chest of drawers, and a table. He said they were rubbish, and I did not go to see them. A week after, about seven o'clock in the evening, he came and asked me to go and see the drawers and table. He took me to the house and asked 4 l. for them. I gave him 2 l. 10 s. for both, which I think was the full value. We carried the drawers, he came first. The prosecutrix afterwards claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You took them away at two different times - A. Yes. I bought them at one time.</p>

On the 30th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to look at some apartments I had to let, she said they were for a gentleman in the Bank. As she came down stairs she asked for my name and address, I asked her into my sitting-room to write it. She kept talking to my little boy, and said she would call again next morning at ten o'clock. As she was leaving the room she drew near the fire-place, and I heard the chain to the watch jingle - I immediately missed it off the shelf, and charged her with it, she made no answer, and held up her right-hand, I saw the chain hanging out. I sent for my husband, who came and took the watch out of her hand.</p>

On the 10th of March I saw the prisoner go into Guildhall, just before the poll was closed, I suspected and watched him; he was alone - I lost him in the crowd, he came out in about half an hour, I then secured him, and found the purse in the left-hand pocket of his trowsers - it contained a 20 l. Bank post-bill, six 1 l. Bank notes, and some memorandums; I also found a silk handkerchief on him. Next day I took him before Mr. Alderman Ansley - Mr. Slade appeared at the second examination and claimed it. The prisoner said he found it in Guildhall.</p>

On Saturday, the 19th of February, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I left the warehouse safely locked up. I returned on Monday morning, at half-past six o'clock, and found the warehouse loft-door forced open; it was only fastened by a bit of wood. I then examined the warehouse, I found my desk forced open, a 5 l. and a 1 l. note gone, also 18 yards of woollen cord. I also found the till forced open, and 24 s. 9 d. taken. A chest of tea was broken open, and 40 lbs. gone, also a sack marked WW - we have a stock of these sacks. I saw a sack at Guildhall that day marked Slocock, we had some of that mark in the warehouse. The prisoner, Parsons, was employed by my masters about fifteen months previous, and Sawyer had been employed by us at Trigg Wharf, but not in the Steel Yard.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday morning, a little after seven o'clock, I saw the prisoners in company together in Coleman-street, they each had a bag on their shoulder, which I produce. I followed them, they both turned down London-wall - I followed them to Cripplegate-buildings, and heard them enquire for the White Horse, which was pointed out to them and they went in - I followed them, both went into a box on the opposite side to each other, and called for a pint of beer - nobody else was in the room. I asked the prisoner, Sawyer, what he had there? he said it was no business of mine - I said I would see what it was; he said it did not concern me. I shewed my staff, he then said,</p>
               <p>"Sit down and make yourself comfortable, we will make it all right with you." I said I wanted nothing to be made right, but to know where they had the bags from. He said he had some corded stuff for breeches in it, and that he had bought it at Manchester, but he had got no bill - I said that would not satisfy me. He said,</p>
               <p>"Sit down and make yourself quiet, for 1 l. is as well in your pocket as it is in another person's" - they both said they would give me 1 l. to let them go about their business. I said I did not want their 1 l. notes, and asked Parsons what was in his bag? he said it was chaff, I am sure he said so. They told me not to talk so loud, and offered me 2 l. to let them go. I secured them both with the bags, and took them to the Compter, One bag was marked WW, and contained 36 1/2 lbs. of tea, the other, marked Slocock, had woollen cord in it. I found 1 l. 4 s. 9 d. on Parsons, but no money on Sawyer.</p>

               <p>PARSONS'S Defence. I was walking through Bow-lane on Sunday morning, and met Sawyer; we met a man in Thames-street loaded with these bags, he asked if we wanted a job? we said we did not work on Sundays - he offered us 1 s. to carry it to the White Hart.</p>

            . I keep a stall in Leadenhall-market On the 10th of February, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, this poultry was brought to me by a man, who desired me to sell it for him, I did not ask him how he got them as I was busy - they were killed in an awkward manner, which I did not observe at the time. He stopped about half an hour with me. I did not particularly notice him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was the prisoner taken up - A.About four or five days after. I believe he is the man, but cannot positively say. I thought the man was lustier, and of a fresh colour. I often have fowls killed in that way - it is the custom all over the market.</p>

            . I am a salesman in Leadenhall-market. On Thursday morning, about nine o'clock, the prisoner came into the market with the ducks and geese; he took them out of a bag, and laid them on Parnell's stall, which joins mine. I was present when Morris came and claimed them - I then looked at them, they appeared as if they had been stolen, for they were improperly killed - I should have suspected them if they had been brought to me. About a fortnight after I saw the prisoner in custody, and am sure he is the man.</p>

I stopped him, and asked him what he had got in the bag? he said they were rabbits, but I found they were two dead pigs; they were sold by the order of the Alderman, as we could find no owner - one was a brown pig, and that was marked; the heads of the pigs appeared to have been broken with a hammer, and the prisoner had a hammer - they appeared warm; they had been stuck also.

I was at tea in my house in Clare-court, heard the cry of Stop thief! ran to the door, and saw Mr. Smith following the prisoner, who was coming from Drury-lane towards Blackmore-street; just as he turned into Blackmore-street I saw him throw the handkerchief down, and secured him about fifteen yards off. A woman picked it up and gave it to me.</p>

They then asked to look at some gold keys? and I shewed them four; they took them up, and asked the price of them? put them down, and drew a brooch towards them, which laid by me, and asked me the price of it? I said it was not for sale. They then reached farther across to a pair of garnet ear-rings; I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't touch them, they are not what you asked for" - they then snatched up two gold keys, a brooch, and the ear-rings, and ran out.

I went out, saw their garden gate open, and saw a light through a hole in the parlour window-shutter. In a short time I heard a noise at the window, saw it opened, and a man come out with something under his arm. He, came towards the gate, and I shut it, kept outside, and asked him what business he had there? He asked what business it was of mine. I collared him, and opened the gate; he threw the bundle behind the gate, ran back, and I with him. I held him till assistance came up. The light was put out before he came out.</p>

I went to my brother's with her between ten and eleven o'clock at night, and about eleven I was fetched home, and found Phillips with the prisoner in custody. He said in the prisoner's presence,</p>
               <p>"Are those things behind the garden gate yours." I said Yes. I found no violence on the window or door.</p>

            . I was employed to nurse the prosecutor's child, and was there on Monday, the 3d of April. Gillings went out in the morning, I went out with his wife about ten o'clock at night, and took the child. I locked the door, kept the key, and shut the shutters to, but did not fasten them - they are outside; I am sure I shut the casement down - any one could open it from the street. I was the first person that entered the house after the prisoner was taken. I found the windows open, also a box and the drawers open. The articles stated in the indictment were taken out of a box which was not locked.</p>

On Sunday, the 26th of March, I went to bed last, about half-past ten o'clock at night. I fastened all the doors and windows myself; my house is at the corner of Villier's-court, into which I have a private door - I fastened that; there are two squares of glass in the door, each about ten inches by nine, one was broken on the Friday - the pane was broken quite out; I observed it to be so at three o'clock on Saturday morning, when I got up - it was perfect and firm on Friday night about ten. The prisoner was a cadee at the White Horse Cellar. On Sunday morning, about half-past one o'clock, the watchman called me up, and said a man was in my house; I came down, found nobody in the house, but found the prisoner's hat on the floor - he was gone to the watch-house. The bolts of the door and the double-lock were undone; but there was a secret latch which he could not undo - the shop-door was also open, but nothing taken. I went to the watch-house, found the prisoner there, and knew him. I neither threatened or promised him. I asked him how he got in, and what made him do it? he said he was coming up the court, saw the square broken, and thought he would get in. He said he had broken the square on the Friday.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. James's. On the night, between Sunday and Monday, I was going my rounds at one o'clock; when I came to Mr. Taylor's house I heard something rattle in the shop - I passed by, and cried the hour three doors farther, but kept my eye on the door; I then returned, and heard a chain rattle - I also heard an iron bar make a noise and saw the door open. I stepped forward, pushed both the doors open, and found the prisoner in the shop without his coat and waistcoat. I charged him with robbing his master, and said I would see his master. I thought he was a servant. I alarmed the house; he ran in backwards and came back into the shop. I seized him, we both fell together, he got out and ran; I at last secured him, and took him to the watch-house. I saw a good deal of blood on the door in the court, just by the glass. When I got him to the watch-house I saw his hand was cut.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. The prosecutor delivered me a hat. I examined the prisoner's hand at the watch-house; it bled very much when he was brought in, and there was a large gash in his hand which appeared to be cut by glass. I found a small piece of glass in his pocket, which I compared with the piece took out of the door. It appeared the same kind of glass from the thickness and colour - it would not fit it. It was sticking in the top of his pocket, as if it had stuck there as he got through.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Taylor. I was going to my master's stables, in Bond-street, on Sunday night, between seven and eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner - I knew him before. He asked if I lived with Mr. Taylor? I said yes. He said, he supposed I slept at the top of the house. I said, I did not know whether it was the top or the bottom, I had but just come to live there. He asked who slept on the first floor, I gave him no answer and left him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TAYLOR. I thought some drunken man had broken the glass, as it was about the height for a man to break.</p>
               <p>His LORDSHIP in summing up the evidence, desired the Jury to consider whether they were of opinion that the prisoner broke the glass on the Friday night, with intention to enter at another time.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live at Harbour-square, Commercial-road. On the 22d of February, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner passing the house with two other boys. He had a blue coat on his arm. He left the other two, went behind a stack of bricks, and doubled the coat up in his apron which he had on. I followed, and as soon as they saw me they ran, and in crossing the ditches towards Stepney Church, the prisoner threw the coat into the ditch. Mr. Shord, who is not here, picked it up. I stopped the prisoner and took him to the prosecutor's house. As we brought him back we found a pocket-book within ten yards of the prosecutor's door. Shord brought the coat to the prosecutor.</p>

I told him not to take my things for I was but a poor boy. He took my clothes, went out of the cabin, and fastened me in. I got out at a little hole under the stern sheet, and saw him get on the wharf. I lost the articles stated in the indictment, and two quartern loaves which I had to take home to my mother.</p>

The prisoner and two others came to my shop on Friday evening, the 10th of March, between five and six o'clock. One of his companions asked to see some black silk handkerchiefs, and I produced some - they all stood together. One of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120019"/>them asked the price? they did not suit, and as all three were going towards the door to leave the shop, I saw the prisoner putting something under his jacket, near his arm - at that time I did not perceive that any thing had been taken from the counter. I followed them out, laid hold of the prisoner, and took from under his jacket four black silk handkerchiefs in one piece. I took him back, and sent for an officer, who took him into custody; they cost me 17 s. I saw nothing to induce me to suspect them - nobody was in the shop but myself.</p>

I shut up at eleven o'clock - the prisoner had access to the room - the bag was on the sideboard. The shutters were not closed at the usual time, therefore I enquired for the boy, but could not find him anywhere, and the bag of silver was missing - he had given me no notice of his intention to leave. On Sunday night I went over to his former master in St George's Fields, but did not find him there. On Wednesday he came voluntarily to me, and I charged him with stealing the bag of silver, but he denied it. I told him the officer had found the bag in his jacket-pocket at his grandmother's - he said nothing to it. I found no property on him.</p>

I watched him for about an hour, and saw him try several gentlemens' pockets; at last I saw him take a handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket, whom I do not know. I laid hold of him, took it from his hand, and asked the gentleman if he had lost any thing? he said he had not. I told him to feel, which he did, and said he had lost a blue and white handkerchief. I produced one, and he claimed it. I went to the Magistrate's room with the gentleman and the prisoner, but the Alderman had done sitting. The gentleman refused to give me his name, and I have never been able to learn it. I found another handkerchief in the prisoner's breeches.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 4th of March, I was in Long-acre, and saw the prisoner at the top of James-street; I saw His Royal Highness's carriage turn up James-street; the footman was on the coach-box. The prisoner got up behind the carriage, and leaned over till he got to Little Newport-street, and in turning the corner of Leicester-square I saw his hand up, as if he was undoing the braces; he got off the carriage in Chandler-street, St. James's, with the braces in his hand. I took him into custody under the piazzas of the Opera House with the braces. I had been watching him three nights.</p>

On the 27th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the house with a pair of shoes for Mrs. Bligh. He said he brought them from Mr. Perkins, Red Lion-street, he waited on the mat of the passage to know if they would fit, while I took them up stairs - my mistress said they were not for her, and I brought them down. He appeared to be standing in the same place - I was not absent three minutes. I gave him the shoes, and said they were not for us; he said it was a mistake, and he would go back and see where it was. I let him out, and in coming across the hall, nearly at the top of the kitchen stairs, I turned my eye, and saw the parlour door open - I thought I had not left it open; the cloth was laid for dinner. I went in and missed six desert spoons and three silver forks from the sideboard, which I had put there about a quarter of an hour before. Nobody else had been in the passage or dining-room during that time. I immediately ran out down a street, but did not see him. I ran to the end of Tavistock-place, and saw him running slowly down Wooburn-place. I called Stop thief, he ran faster down Bernard-street, and was stopped in Little Guildford-street, taken to the watch-house, and the property found on him in my presence, under his waistcoat, and in his breeches.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 17th of February I went to Mr. Williams's, and found the prisoners there, with a basket containing ten pair of high-shoe legs, and another piece of leather. I asked Summers, in the hearing of the other prisoner, what was in the basket - he said, some leather, which belonged to him. He said he was a shoemaker. I took them both into custody.</p>

               <p>"I suppose you did." He then threw them off his shoulder, and said he bought them of a man in Westminster. I took them up, and told him he might follow me if he liked; he said he would follow me as far as I went. When we were in the Strand I took a nail out of his hand, he then ran away. I followed him, and he was stopped in Chandos-street. I am sure he is the man.</p>

There is a staircase leading to it from my garden. On the 17th of March, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I found a square of glass had been broken in the door, and some books stolen from the the desk which is near the door. The door was not opened. A female servant went into the room before me, she is not here. I saw every thing safe at half-past eight o'clock - it was then dark.</p>

            . I am watchman of Spitalfields. On the 17th of March, at a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner standing at the corner of Wentworth-street with a bundle under his arm - the day was just breaking. It was three quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's house. He said to me</p>
               <p>"Watchman, can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120023"/>you tell me where there is a cook-shop?" I said, what bundle is that? He said, a bundle of clothes. I took it from him - he then said a bundle of books. I asked him where he had brought them from? He said from Hackney, and was going to take them to Stepney, and they were his own. As I was taking him to the watch-house he ran away, and hid himself in a house. Another watchman brought him out. I am sure he is the person.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's fellow-apprentice, and was with him. The prisoner came before us, and dodged us - I am certain he is the man; he left us and came again. Harridge pushed him away, and immediately said he missed his watch. We found the prisoner at the corner of the Piazza; he set off as hard as he could run, but was stopped. I am sure he is the man; a mob came round, and said he should not go to the watch-house. They struck the prosecutor very violently, and broke his jaw-bone.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running, followed, and secured him at the end of Russell-street. He cried out to the mob,</p>
               <p>"Come on, and I will get away!" About twenty came up to rescue him, and struck me on the head. I at last got him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>JOHN OVER. I am a butcher, and live in Fleet-market. On the 7th of April I turned into Bolt-court, the prosecutor was against the wall. I saw the prisoner take something from the prosecutor's breeches and run off with it. I pursued him, calling Stop thief! and saw him stopped in Gough-square - the watch was picked up, and delivered to the prosecutor. The prisoner behaved very bad, and made use of bad language - he told me to be on my guard, for if he was in confinement there were those who would mark me, and he did not care for himself, for he was as well out of the country as in it and he knew we could not rope him for this.</p>

               <p>HAVING received several sums of money, and not having accounted properly for them, I beg to inform you that I have supplied a countryman of mine, who is in the King's Bench; he deceived me with promises of payment every week, but has deceived me. I have to inform you that I have an assignment of 250, which I will not part with till I have received all that I have lent. I hope next week to be able to refund you the sum of 32: 14: 4, which is your just demand upon me; I have now received 12: 13: 7, which I will settle on Monday. Having so much deceived you, you need not wonder at my leaving, which I should not have done but for the disgrace.</p>

On the 17th of February, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise in the back parlour - daylight was entirely gone. I entered it, and saw the prisoner run across the room; he made his escape out of the parlour window into the street - mine is a corner-house, and the back parlour window leads into the street as well as the front. I jumped out, and pursued him some distance, knocked him down, and brought him back to the house - he had no property about him. I found my servant in possession of the property. I lost a plated toast-rack, and two silver spoons, worth about 8 s. together; a dark lanthorn was found outside the area railing - I had not moved the property from the side-board. My wife and servant were the only persons in the house.</p>

            . I am landlord of the house in Cherry Tree-court, Upper Whitecross-street, St. Luke's. Brees came down, and awoke me. I got a candle, found Brees' coat and three waistcoats doubled up, and laying on his own bed.</p>
               <p>ROBERT GOULD. I am a watchman. On Saturday morning, the prisoner was given into my charge. The clothes were on the bed. One watch was on the table, and the other in the prisoner's hand.</p>

            . I slept with Brees. About four o'clock in the morning, I heard the door open, which awoke me. I called to the prisoner, who was in the room out of bed. I heard him dress himself, he said nothing. I asked</p>
               <p>"Who was there again?" he said, me. I said</p>
               <p>"What are you doing?" he said, nothing. I jumped up found my clothes and my box as they ought to be, but found my watch taken from my pocket. I said,</p>
               <p>"Where is my watch?" he said I do not know, I saw it on the table just now; and at that time I saw my watch in his hand, and saw him put it on the table. Brees jumped up and enquired for his watch. He said he did know - he then put his hand in his pocket, and delivered it up. Brees's clothes were on the bed. My watch is worth 2 l. We sent for the watchman. There is a lamp opposite the window which enabled me to see the prisoner at the table. He had both the watches.</p>

I took no notice till next morning at six o'clock. I then rung the hostler's bell - he produced the two 1 l. notes to me. In consequence of what he said, I sent for a constable.

On the 16th of February I had him apprehended, taken to Hatton-garden. I went to him afterwards to the lock-up-room, and asked him his motive for robbing me? He said he ought to have been the last person to rob me, in consequence of the kindness I hat treated him with - he enumerated the several articles that he had robbed me of, began to cry, and said that if I would forgive him, he would confess all. I said on no condition would I forgive him? he said he had sold the cloak to a Jew in Gray's Inn-lane. I got a warrant and found it there. I found the other things in pawn.</p>

            . I keep a sale-shop in Gray's Inn-lane. About three weeks before the officer came to my house, a man, whom I knew before, brought this cloak for sale - I offered him 6 s. for it, he refused that, and I told him to go and see if he could get more. In about an hour after, he brought it, and said his brother sent him with it - I gave him 5 s. for it; it was very old fashioned.</p>

Storr went with me to the watch-house, where I saw the meat and Lloyd in custody. I asked Storr, on his return from market, if he had sent out any meat or missed any? he said No. I told him a man had been taken to the watch-house with the meat, and as he was my foreman, he could have no objection to accompany me to the watch-house to see if it was mine. He went with me, and at first said it was not mine. I said it depended very materially on his conduct how he should be dealt with, and desired him to tell me how the meat came there. In consequence of what he said I left him in custody. There was a piece of bone in the meat projecting out in a particular manner - it was torn - I compared it with a piece of beef in my shop which it was cut from, which perfectly satisfied me it was mine. I have preserved the bone, and produce it. The mutton was of the same quality with that in my shop, and it is not well dressed, having been done by my apprentice.</p>

            . I am in Messrs. Slades' service. I saw the mutton at the watch-house; I had cut it up the morning before, and am certain it had not been sold - it was safe in the house when I went to bed. Storr slept in the house; he got up earlier than me. We generally open shop about six o'clock in the morning; I got up a little after six. The meat was not sold that morning - I saw it at the watch-house about eight o'clock in the morning - it must have been stolen. Storr might have been in the shop alone for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I came down. I have never seen the two prisoners together. I was present when the beef was compared; it had been torn in a hurry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. Storr was gone to market before you came down - A. Yes. When I came down the door was shut - nobody could get in, except at the door. I found two of the hooks had had meat taken from them, but cannot say what meat had hung upon them.</p>

I enquired at different shops. Garner came to the watch-house and claimed it as his master's. I then returned with him to the shop till Storr came in, and then Mr. Slade went with him and me to the watch-house. I shewed Storr the meat, and asked him if it was his master's? he said No; he said he could not tell whether the mutton was his master's or not, but the rest was not. I kept the prisoners separate, and told Storr that Lloyd said he gave it to him; he then turned to his master, said it was his first offence, and begged for mercy. No promise had been made to him.</p>

I left the parcel on my shopboard, returned at three o'clock, and found it still there. He came about four o'clock, and as I suspected it had been stolen I told him an officer had been enquiring after him (Ruthven had been), he said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, has there, I must go." I said you shall not go unless you satisfy me where you got these things. I had opened it in his absence - it contained a piece of cotton; he set off, and ran away. I went after him, overtook him in about a minute, and asked him to satisfy me where he got the property; he said he would go with me to his father, who was in prison for debt, and this was property he had to sell to support him; we went as far as the Yorkshire Stingo, in the New-road, he then said he dare not go to his father, for he had robbed him, and that the property belonged to Mr. Miles, furniture warehouse, No. 33, Oxford-street. I wanted him to go there, he would not, and I took him to my house. He said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, destroy it, or let me pledge it in your name." I said I should do nothing of the kind. We then set out to go to Mr. Miles; he said Mr. Miles had a man who had robbed him just before, and he had forgiven him, and if I would go to him, he would forgive him also. He was Mr. Miles's servant.</p>

On the 11th of March<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120030"/>the prisoner came and bought a herring, he offered me a sixpence, I rubbed it on my stone, and found it was a counterfeit; I looked at him, and recollected him. I asked him if he had any more silver? he said No. I said this looks suspicious, you have only one, and that is a counterfeit. My husband secured him, he snatched up the sixpence, and was going off the step - my husband brought him back.</p>

            . My wife gave me the sixpence. I thought it bad, went into the shop, and asked the prisoner if he had any more - he said No. I put it down, and he ran out with it, I secured him, brought him back, and searched him, with the patrol's assistance, found two bad sixpences in his breeches-pocket, a bad shilling, and two more bad sixpences in his coat-pocket, one of them was the one he gave my wife. I knew it by the marks where she rubbed it. I found 2 s. 11 3/4 d. on him, and a candle, in his hat.</p>

On the 25th of February I took the prisoner up at the door of Worship-street Office, and asked what he had done with the things he had taken from the prosecutor? he said he had taken nothing.

I found a hat at No. 8, Pope's Head-court, Whitecross-street. on the ground floor, also a shift, a handkerchief, and apron.</p>

            . I live next door to Hogg. About eleven o'clock I saw the prisoner go by and go to the bottom of the court - he then returned whistling. In about ten minutes he came back in a direction from the house, with a bundle under his arm - he walked exceedingly quick - I heard of the robbery about five minutes after. In about a quarter of an hour I saw him pass again, and asked him what he had done with the bundle that he had passed my house with? He said he had taken it to Worship-street Office - I said I would go with him to ascertain if it was so. I walked by his side, and when he got there he denied having told me any thing about it, and said he came there about a bad shilling. I gave him into custody.</p>

On the 11th of March, the carpet and rug were on the front parlour floor, the muslin was in a box in the same room, not locked. The blanket and sheet were in the bed-room, the back room on the first floor. My brother, W. Purshouse, lives with me. His coat, waistcoat, and trowsers, were locked in a box in that room. I employed the prisoner daily to work for me. I am a milliner, and she had access to every part of my house. She came to me on the 1st of February, and continued till the 11th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss the articles - A. On Saturday night, the 11th of March, about half-past eight o'clock. I left her in charge of the house while I went to Holborn. the lodger was ill in bed at the time, being near her confinement. I left nobody else in the house except two, small children. I returned before half-past nine o'clock, and she was gone, and my eldest child, who was six years old, was sitting up crying. I did not expect the prisoner to go. I went into the front parlour, and missed the property stated in the indictment, which was there when I left. I was in my brother's room before I went out, his box was then locked. I found it broken open. I did not see her again till the Wednesday following, when I met her by accident. I secured her and sent for an officer. I have seen the carpet, rug, muslin, and sheet since - they were worth 52 s. I knew my brother's things were in his box. I have not seen them since. When I took her she asked me to have mercy on her, and said, without either promises or threats, that she sold the coat, waistcoat, and trowsers, to a Jew for 25 s., in Fishmonger-alley. She lived in Francis-court, Berkley-street.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 11th of March, about nine o'clock, the prisoner came and knocked at the door, and brought a carpet, rug, and blanket, said She was glad I was at home, for she had told my wife, on Tuesday before, that I was to go to buy some goods in Belvedere-place, for the person could not wait, and she had brought something. She represented that she were selling them for her mistress, and asked 15 s. for them. I gave her 14 s. I am positive she is the person - the constable took them away on the Wednesday evening.</p>

The prisoner and another woman came on the 28th of February, and asked to look at some muslin, which she said was too dear. She then asked to look at some lace. On the middle of the counter there was some stuffs and callicoes. While I was turning round to get the lace-box, I heard a rustling. I did not take any notice at the time. I shewed the lace, and they bought half a quarter of a yard, which came to 3 d., the other woman paid for it. I let them go out, and having a suspicion from the rustling, I called the other two young men, who were at dinner, to follow them. They both went and returned in about an hour and a half with the prisoner in custody, and 11 yards of printed stuff. I had shewn it to a lady about half an hour before.</p>

            . I am in the East India Company's service. On the 13th of April, about ten minutes past six o'clock in the morning, I was passing along Brick-lane, and saw the prisoner and another man coming out of the prosecutor's shop; they had a bag, through a hole in which I saw that it contained some boots. The prisoner turned to the left, and the other to the right - the prisoner kept the bag. I then went to the shop, but could make no one hear. I afterwards went in search of the prisoner, and got sight of him. The other, on turning round, and seeing me running after them, left the prisoner with the bag. I still pursued the prisoner, and came up with him in Spitalfields-market, collared him, and took him to the watch-house - he was running at the time; I am quite sure he is the man. I saw the bag examined; it contained two pair of top-boots, one pair of Hessian, and one odd Wellington boot.</p>

About two o'clock in the morning of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120033"/>17th of March, I saw the prisoner go past my box alone, he had a bundle under his arm - I did not stop him. He came by about three o'clock without anything. About ten minutes after four he came past again, I then asked him what he had got there? he said some nails. I asked him where he got them from? he said from his master. I said he should go the watch-house before he went to his work. I went to the chapel, and asked for the foreman; he went to the watch-house and owned the nails. I weighed them - there were 22 lbs.</p>

I had a five-shilling piece and two half crowns in my pocket, in a purse. I was standing with two boys in front of me. I saw the prisoner, Barnett, a little to my left. I think Sampson was one of the boys, but I am not certain. I missed my watch and money, but did not perceive it go. I laid hold of a boy, who was searched, but nothing found on him - he was discharged. I went to Bow-street, hearing a person was taken. My watch was produced there, and I saw Barnett among others in the room, and identified him particularly, as being near me at the time. My purse was also produced.

On Tuesday night, the 4th of April, I was returning from Bishopsgate-street, and went into a public-house in Cheapside, about a quarter before eleven o'clock. I had a pot of ale, and came from there with a hackney coachman. He was a stranger to me. I merely rode on the box with him - I believe he is here. He sat me down in Charles-street, Covent-garden, about half-past twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not have been all that time going there, had you been drinking - A. I had, but knew what I was about - I may be mistaken in the time. I went into the watering-house, in <placeName id="t18200412-101-crimeloc579">Charles-street</placeName>

I was going out and was surrounded by a set of people just at the door. A person came up to me and knocked me in the breast, merely to push me back, it was not a violent blow. He snatched my watch and ran away - they held me fast to prevent me running away. Every one in the house was concerned in it. They came round me and held me back that I should not run after the man. They came from the taproom directly as I was going out, I pushed them back and ran after the prisoner. He had got very near to the bottom of the street, towards Tavistock-street, and as he turned round a hackney coach at the bottom of the street, he flung the watch into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of them hold of you at the time he snatched the watch from you - A. Yes. They had at the very time it was taken from me. I was not able to defend myself and property. I did not stop to pick the watch up, but pursued after the prisoner and caught him. Just as I caught hold of him, two men came up and forced him away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sufficient view of his person to be able to say the prisoner is the man - A. I saw him, looked him in the face, and know the prisoner was the man. I knew him by a rising on his nose, which I particularly noticed. He got away, and I took the two men who rescued him to the watch-house. They were bailed out. As soon as I gave them in charge, I came outside, and the beadle said,</p>
               <p>"Should you know the man if you saw him?" I said I should. He took me to the house where I was robbed - it was the sign of the Marquis of Granby. When I got in I turned round, the prisoner was sitting in the room, and directly as he saw me he dropped his head, and covered his face. I went up to him, lifted up his hat, and pulled away his hand. He then said I am not the man who took your watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he said so, had you given any intimation what was your reason for looking at him - A. No. I had said nothing. I am quite sure he was the same man I caught before. I gave charge of him to the beadle. I have not recovered my watch, it was new, and worth 3 l. I attended at Bow-street next day, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been able to see the parties who confined you to prevent your following him - A. Yes. I have seen several of them here. As I gave charge of the prisoner to the beadle, they surrounded us, and said he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120035"/>not the man, and he should not go to the watch-house. In going from the house they came round two or three times, and tried to rescue him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where did the men surround you - A. At the Marquis of Granby. I first laid hold of the prisoner at the house. I took the two men to the watch-house. The beadle returned with me, and coming from the house and while in the house the men surrounded us, and tried to rescue him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say when the beadle had the prisoner, some men surrounded and tried to rescue him, where was that - A. In the house. I did not say at the watch-house, that my watch was worth seventy guineas, the men round said so, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, where you not insensibly drunk - A. I certainly had been drinking, but knew what I was doing at the time. If I was so I could not have done what I did. I described the man who robbed me as having a light coat on, and two belcher handkerchiefs round his neck, and told the beadle I should know him by the rising on his nose. I think he was taken about one o'clock, which was about three quarters of an hour after he got from me. I never entertained a doubt of his being the man. I should know the men who surrounded me. I never saw the coachman before. I did know the man before he took me from Cheapside to Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect taking your watch out when you was on the box with him - A. I do not. I know it was safe when I was in Bishopsgate-street about half-past ten o'clock - I was at the Four Swans, public-house, Bishopsgate-street, and walked alone from there to Cheapside. The prisoner is a coachman, but I do not know his number.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Paul's, Covent-garden. On the 4th of April I was in Charles-street, and saw the prosecutor there - I was standing at the end, near Russell-street - the Marquis of Granby, public-house, is about the middle. I heard Watch! called, and when I came up the prosecutor laid hold of a man - there was a crowd of men about him, assisting the person he had hold of. The prosecutor said the prisoner had drawn his watch from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of men were they - A. They appeared like hackney coachmen. I laid hold of the man. The prosecutor gave him to me, and left him with me while he went to look for his watch in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not come up till the watch was thrown into the coach - A. Yes. He was rescued from me, but I do not think I should know the persons who rescued him, and I cannot say the prisoner is the man, for his coat was over his head - I could not notice him when he was rescued. I called Stop thief! and sprang my rattle, but could see no man. The prosecutor called me to the coach - I told him to take the number. Some men behind me said,</p>
               <p>"Take the coach to the green-yard" - the prosecutor was there at the time; they got quarrelling, and he gave charge of them; I took them to the watch-house. I should know them again if I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor appear to be able to hold the man - A. Yes. He held him till I took charge of him - he was tipsy, but appeared to be sensible; he walked, stood, and spoke very well. After this there was a cry of Watch! and I assisted in conveying the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the people about suffer him to go peaceably, or attempt to rescue him - A. No, not as we took him from the house to the watch-house. We pulled him along, for he did not wish to go. The watch-house is in the market.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The Marquis of Granby, public-house is a watering-house - A. Yes. I did not know the prisoner before that night - I was not in the public-house. When I took him he had a light coloured coat on, much the same as he has now. I did not notice it - I cannot say whether it was like it or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was it from the time of the alarm, till the time you took him into custody - A. I think about three quarters of an hour. A man might change his dress in that time.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was any attempt made by other people to rescue him - A. No. He struggled himself.</p>

            . I am beadle of the parish. The prosecutor came to the watch-house, said he had been robbed, and brought two persons in for attempting to rescue the prisoner from him - they were detained.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be insensible - A. He appeared agitated from the robbery, and talked very fast - he did not appear incapable of giving an account; he had his senses about him. I went out with him, and asked him if he should know the man who had robbed him? he said he should, and that he had a rising on his nose. He said he had been robbed coming out of the door of the house. I walked with him under the Piazza, and into the first public-house, near Bow-street - he said that was not the house. We then went to the Marquis of Granby, public-house, and he said that was the house - it is kept by a widow woman. I knocked at the door, but it was some time before it was opened. I told the prosecutor to go in and look well about the taproom, but not to notice me as if I was in company with him. I went in in about two minutes, the taproom was full of people. He looked round, and pointed out the prisoner, who sat in a box in the corner of the room, with two or three coachmen round him. The prosecutor leaned over the table, put up the prisoner's hat, and I believe asked him what he had done with his watch? he said he had not got the watch. Two or three coachmen said,</p>
               <p>"What do you mean by saying he has robbed you?" I went up and asked the prosecutor if that was the man who had robbed him? he said Yes. I told the prisoner he must come out, as the man had given charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was this - A. About a quarter past one o'clock - he did not come out. I said if he did not come out I should call a watchman in to bring him out by force. A man on the other side of the room said,</p>
               <p>"Why, that shews you are guilty if you don't go out." He then came out, and as we were going towards the door they tried to rescue him from us, and when we got out we were surrounded by coachmen and others, who tried to rescue him.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know any of them again - A. I think I should know some of them. I called Watch! and the last witness came up among others.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120036"/>Q. Was there any further attempt to rescue after that - A. Yes. As we went along Tavistock-row, by the New Hummums, I had hold of the prisoner by the left side, and the watchman on the other - I think it was another watchman that had hold of him, not the witness. They laid hold of him, and pulled him about, but I said if they did not stand back I would knock them down; we got him to the watch-house. He had a rising on his nose as the prosecutor described.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What had he on - A. I cannot say. I do not recollect the prosecutor's description of him. He said the watch was worth about 3 l. at Bow-street - I heard nothing about the value at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent, and leave it to my counsel and witnesses.</p>

            . I am watch-house-keeper of St. Paul's Covent-garden, and was on duty when the prisoner was brought in, I think it was after one o'clock. The prosecutor gave charge of two men for rescuing a man - he appeared to be tipsy.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean fresh, or stupidly drunk - A. I believe he was not so far drunk, but he could recollect what he was doing - he appeared agitated at first. When the prisoner was brought in, I believe he had on the coat which he now wears; the two men were held to bail at Bow-street for an assault. I believe I should know them again - one of them is a printer. The prosecutor said himself that the watch was worth seventy guineas.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was you at the watch-house when he first complained of having been robbed - A. Yes. I did not hear him describe the man - it did not pass in my presence.</p>

            . I am a hackney coachman. I took the prosecutor up about half-past eleven o'clock at night; he was drinking in an alehouse - I did not know him before. I heard him say which way he was going; I said I was going that road, and he said he would give me something to drink to carry him - he said he wanted to go to Portland-place. I set him down at Drury-lane Theatre.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put him down on that spot by his own desire - A. No, by my own will. I know he had a watch, for I saw the chain. He was so drunk he could hardly stand when I took him up.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left you did he talk sensible and rational - A. Yes; he went in to treat a coachman opposite where I put him down. I left him there about half-past eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How long were you coming from Cheapside to the Theatre - A. About half an hour; the Theatre was just breaking up when I set him down.</p>

            . I am a hackney coachman. I drive No. 713, for Mr. Boreham, No. 37, China-mews. I believe I have driven it two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you at the Marquis of Granby, in Charles-street, on the night this happened - A. Yes; I was there before the Theatre broke up. I had been there about ten minutes when I heard a rattle spring - it was half-past eleven o'clock when I put my coach in the rank; I then went into the house, and sat in the taproom. I dare say there were a dozen or fourteen persons in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that lad there - A. The prisoner, Yes; he sat within one of me in the same box - he was asleep, leaning with his head on his hands; I knew him - I did not awake him. I had just began my supper, and then heard a cry of Stop thief! and Watch! I had been there about ten minutes then.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner then - A. Just by the side of me - he had not been out of my sight. I did not go to the door, but remained there eating my supper.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he awoke by the noise - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the prisoner have got out of the box without passing you - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner appeared to be asleep - A. Yes, he appeared so to me. I afterwards saw the beadle at the entrance of the taproom door - he afterwards came in. The prisoner did not go out of the room from the time I went in till the beadle came. When the beadle and the prosecutor came the prosecutor looked about for two or three minutes. The prisoner awoke up, and was rubbing his eyes, as if he had awoke out of sleep, and the prosecutor said to him,</p>
               <p>"I think you had a light-coloured coat on."</p>
               <p>Q. That was the first thing he said to him, was it - A. Yes. I think he said,</p>
               <p>"You are the young man that stole my watch." I believe he said he had a light coat on first.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that - A. I think I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know whether the first thing he said was,</p>
               <p>"I think you had a light coloured coat on," or not. Now mind, the beadle heard what was said - A. I will not be positive. I will not say whether he said that first or not, or whether he charged him with robbing him of his watch - I really think the first thing he said was about the coat.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Tell us, as well as your memory serves, all that passed between the prosecutor and prisoner, in the order in which it happened - A. He accused him of having a light-coloured coat on; the prisoner said he never wore a light-coloured coat. Then again, the prosecutor said,</p>
               <p>"I think you had a light-coloured coat on, and that you are the person who looked me in the face, and robbed me of my watch."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to swear that he said,</p>
               <p>"I think you are the man," or did he positively say he was the man - A. He said he was the man; at first he said he thought so, and then he said</p>
               <p>"I am sure you are the man." I am sure his first words were,</p>
               <p>"I think you are the man."</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was the beadle near enough to hear what passed - A. He stood at the entrance of the taproom, I dare say he could hear.</p>
               <p>"I said,</p>
               <p>"You know yourself innocent, and you had better go back into the parlour and be searched." The beadle immediately took hold of him, and instead of taking him into the parlour, he drew him out of doors, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that he went willingly, or was he obliged to be forced out - A. He went willingly. I said to the prosecutor,</p>
               <p>"You must be a very false man for saying it was him, when the young man has been asleep here for this hour."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say that in the hearing of the people - A. I did. I said he had been there above an hour to my certain knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the cry of Stop thief! but had not the curiosity to go to the door to see what was the matter - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you heard the cry of Stop thief!<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120037"/>was it that the beadle came in - A. Near three-quarters of an hour.

               <p>Q. Did you go to the watch-house with the prisoner - A. No, I did not think they were going to the watch-house, as I knew the lad was innocent. I thought they were going to take him into the parlour, but they took him out. I went out, but did not go farther than the first coach, and met the others coming back. They said they would let nobody speak.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Marquis of Granby, and have lived there ever since September. I saw the prisoner in the taproom about half-past ten o'clock on the night of the robbery. Randall came in and sat on the right side of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the prisoner get out of the box without making Randall get up - A. Yes, the prisoner was nearer to the entrance of the box than Randall. Several others were between Randall and him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the rattle sprung - A. Yes. I did not go out, for my mistress sent me after the prosecutor for his reckoning. They had a glass of rum and water and a pipe of tobacco between two of them. He stood in the bar, not in the taproom; he was drinking with Judd, who had driven him.</p>
               <p>Q. Judd was with him - A. Yes, he brought him there. A person named Phillips, and another, whom I did not know, was drinking with him. My mistress gave the prosecutor leave to go into the bar; he went out of the bar into the street with his pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it immediately after that that you heard the cry of Stop thief! - A. Yes, two minutes before that, I saw the prisoner with his head down on the table; Randall was eating his supper by his side. I do not think the prisoner could go out without my observing him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you tell us what would prevent him - A. No, I cannot. As soon as my mistress sent me after the gentleman for his reckoning, he might have gone out. I went after him, and he was giving charge of two men. He had been out about two minutes when I went after him. He did not return to the house for better than a quarter of an hour after that.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. He requested leave to go into the bar - A. Yes, she gave him leave to come through the bar into the taproom, which my mistress never allows people to do after twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear the cry of Watch! and Stop thief! - A. Yes, and went out about two minutes after that, and saw him by the York Hotel, which is opposite our house. The gentleman who keeps the hotel said,</p>
               <p>"Don't kick up a row here!"</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the cry, and took no notice - A. Not till my mistress sent me out; I am sure Judd was there. When I returned to the house the prisoner was in the taproom. I cannot say he was there when I heard the cry of Stop thief! I was at the bar at that time. He was in the taproom just before the prosecutor was in the bar. Judd, the coachman, brought him there. The prisoner could have got out without passing Randall. The box was open at both ends.</p>

             re-examined. Q. You said you set him down at Drury-lane Theatre, were you at the Granby - A. He went and treated a coachman there, and bid me follow him; I went into the house at the same time with him. I left the house after him; I heard the cry of Stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the door to see if the prosecutor was the man that was robbed - A. Yes; I did not see him robbed. When I went out I saw him running down Charles-street. I went out immediately as he called Stop thief! I do not know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in the house - A. Yes, I saw him asleep on the table when I went to light my pipe. Whether he was there when I heard the cry, or not, I cannot say.</p>

            . I am a hackney coachman, and drive No. 720, for my father. I went to the Marquis of Granby about half-past ten o'clock on the night of the robbery. I went with the prisoner. I have known him about six years. Randall was there, and sat with his back to the window on the opposite bench to me - the prisoner was on the same bench with him, and went to sleep. There was a cry of Stop thief! about twelve o'clock. I did not go out, the prisoner was then asleep on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did Hughes come into the taproom - A. Not for a good while after. Taylor was then in the same place - he was awake then. Hughes said he thought he was the person that took his watch from him, and said he had a drab coat on. Taylor said he had not. Hughes said he had, and then the beadle came and took him out. He had not been out of the taproom. He had a snuff-coloured coat on, the same he has now. He never had a top-coat on - he could not have been the thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not go to the watch-house when you knew he was not guilty - A. Several went, but Hughes swore so positive to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not there - A. No. I went with him to the watch-house, but did not go in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to go into the watch-house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On the solemn oath you have taken, could he have been out of the taproom, or out of your sight, before you heard the cry of Watch! - A. No; he was not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you give any reason why you did not go into the watch-house to declare the man was innocent - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When the cry was rose, how many coachmen were there in the box with you - A. About seven; none of them went to see what had happened.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prosecutor came in did he not positively<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120038"/>declare the prisoner was the man. No. He said he thought at first - he afterwards said he was positive.</p>

            . I am a coachman, and drive No. 712. I am servant to Mr. Boreham, who Randall drives for. I went to the Marquis of Granby, about half-past eleven o'clock, on the night of the robbery - all was quiet then. Taylor laid with his head on the taproom table. Randall sat on his right, and I was facing him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he first awake - A. When the gentleman came in he just rose up, was wiping his face, and was going to lay down again. The gentleman said,</p>
               <p>"I think you had a light coat on - I think you are the man that looked me in the face, and took my watch." He said he was not, and we all said he was not, for he had not been out of the box. Randall advised him to go into the parlour to be searched. I expected he was going there, but he pushed him out into the street. To my thinking Hughes was no ways sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible Taylor could have been out of the house for an instant - A. He was not. I am positive he did not change his dress. I went to the watch-house to say he was not out of the house, but they would not let me come in. I went to Bow-street next day, and they said I must attend at the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the springing of the rattle, and the cry of Stop thief! had you seen Hughes - A. No. Nor Judd.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for a man sitting where you were to see what passed in the bar or lobby - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go out to see what was the matter when you heard the cry - A. No. Nor any one at all from that box. The prisoner did not like to go to the watch-house. At first he stopped against the wall, and said he had done nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not any one attempt to pull him away - A. Not at all. I never saw any one, and I was close to him. I followed behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear nobody attempted to force him away from those who had him in custody - A. I am speaking about the door. I can swear nobody attempted to rescue him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I am speaking about the Hummums - A. I will swear nobody pulled him behind to get him from the beadle, if it did happen I must have seen it. I am sure it did not happen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any one leave the taproom before the cry - A. Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BUDGE. I am a coachman, and drive No. 173. I came down to the Marquis of Granby to water my horses just as the rattle was springing. I saw nobody about the door, but some persons were at the bottom of the street near the York Hotel. They said a man had been rescued.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the Marquis of Granby - A. Yes. The doorway was then quite clear. When I got in the prisoner leaned with his head on the taproom table asleep, with his arm on his head. I pushed his head up, he appeared quite intoxicated - his appearance was sleepy. I did not speak to him. He was dressed in a brown coat, the same he has on now. Randall sat in the same box under the window, within a yard of the prisoner. I went to the other side of the taproom and had my supper, and was there when Hughes came in with the beadle.</p>
               <p>Q. Who spoke first - A. The prosecutor. When the prisoner awoke up he looked at him very hard, and said</p>
               <p>"Hold up your head, young man - I think you had a drab coat on." Then he said to the beadle," I think it is him, we will take him at all events." They went out and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they take him for - A. They charged him with the theft of the watch. Somebody said,</p>
               <p>"Go into the parlour and be searched." He got up, and the beadle pushed him out of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then he never said particularly that he was the man - A. Never, I am quite sure. I will be on my oath that he never did say so in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, man! the beadle and prosecutor are here, will you say he told the beadle he thought he was the man, but would take him at all events - A. Those are the very words he made use of. I am quite sure he never said more than that he thought he was the man.</p>

               <p>"He was the man that robbed him, and he would take his oath of it - he was always positive." I saw he had his eye on the prisoner. He held up his hat - the words I heard I think were</p>
               <p>"What have you done with my watch?" he said, what watch.</p>
               <p>"Why" said the prosecutor</p>
               <p>"You are the man that robbed me at the door." He never expressed the least doubt of his being the man.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prosecutor much agitated - A. Not when he gave him in charge. I saw Judd at the house, he came to the watch-house with another young man, and tried to rescue the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any attempt made to rescue him in the house - A. The most was at the door, it was made by persons who came from the taproom.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Whitelock, an attorney, of King-street, Cheapside. I had been to Covent-garden Theatre. I was coming up Tavistock-street, towards Charles-street, there was a general row and calling of Stop thief! I went into the Marquis of Granby, in consequence of what passed, and was in the house at the time Hughes came in with the beadle.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you been there - A. About five minutes, not more. I was only looking at what passed.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. When Hughes came in, what did he say - A. I positively swear, he said, I think you are the person who stole my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner - A. I did not see him. I do not know who Hughes addressed himself to. I stood by his side. I had other friends with me at the time, and went away immediately.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say the cry of Stop thief! was only five minutes before the prosecutor came in - A. I cannot say when the cry was, I was at the door sometime with my friends.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor did not return for three-quarters of an hour after the cry, did you wait at the door all this time - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. All was quiet then - A. No; the coachmen and others were canvassing the thing over at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that did you become attorney for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120039"/>prisoner - A. The prisoner's friends who were there, believing him to be innocent, entered into a subscription afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they find you out - A. I go to the house every night.</p>
               <p>Q. What, to the Marquis of Granby - A. No; to the Salutation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner laid hold of - A. I did not, the room was full of people.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you avoid seeing him laid hold of - A. My attention might be directed to the people. I was talking to my friends at the time.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You said you went in for the express purpose of seeing what passed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the defence of the prisoner your own business - A. No; it is Mr. Whitelock's - there are no profits. His friends wished me to ask Mr. Whitelock and I did ask him. I cannot say whether the prisoner was taken out of the room while I was there.</p>

On the 15th of March, I was going down Shoreditch, with Walters, and saw the prisoners going in and out of different shops, they then saw us, and turned into the Fountain, a public-house, which is a thoroughfare. I followed them, Cox appeared to have something under her shawl; they got through the passage. At the back of the house I secured Cox, and asked her what she had got under her shawl; she said about eight yards of linen - Walters took Reading, I found the cloth was four yards and a quarter - she said she bought it in Shoreditch, then in Old-street. Reading immediately said,</p>
               <p>"No, you bought it of a man by Miles's Mad-house, Hoxton." They cried, and said if we would let them go we might have it. I went to different shops, and found it belonged to the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>"Sergeant! how do you do? will you give me a glass of gin? for I am very cold." I went into a public-house, and gave her a glass of gin; we came out, and she followed me into Great George-street. I went with her to her lodging No. 45, <placeName id="t18200412-103-crimeloc590">Duck-lane</placeName>

On waking in the night I found her and Green sitting by the fire in the room. Jones began to use bad language, and said she wanted more gin; I gave her a shilling, and she fetched some. Shortly after they both went out, and returned about six o'clock together. Jones then fell on me in the bed, and as soon as I could extricate myself from her, I missed Green from the room, and also missed my waistcoat from under the pillow, with a pocket-book containing two 5 l. and five 1 l. Bank notes. I got up, secured the door, and kept Green in the room. She said she knew nothing about it, and pretended to be very drunk indeed - she was a little tipsy. I dressed myself, locked her in the room, and went for an officer, returned, and found the outer door locked. The officer said he dare not break it open, but if I would come at night he would assist in apprehending them. I went at night, and looked up to the house to see what number it was. A woman came out, and I said,</p>
               <p>"What number is this?" she said 48, and ran back into the house. I followed her; she ran into the room where I had been, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes! lock the door, he is come again!" I said,</p>
               <p>"No, I will lock the door, and stop here till the officer comes." I saw Jones on the bed, apparently very drunk - Green was not there. I locked the door, and staid there from seven o'clock till nine, when I heard the watchman. I then ran to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120040"/>street door, called him in, and unlocked the room door. We secured her, and took her to the watch-house. I then returned with the constable of the night to search for this property, and found Green up stairs, half-naked, in the passage. I found part of my pocket-book under the bed - the contents were taken out. Part of the money was given to me to subsist upon on the road. I am certain they are the women.</p>

On Sunday, the 26th of March, my housekeeper represented to me that the prisoner was in the neighbourhood in the greatest distress, and I ordered her to give him a dinner - when he came in he said he had dined. I asked him to sit down, and enquired the cause of his distress. He said he was coming from Leith to London to finish himself for his profession as a singer, that the smack he came in was run down by a Greenland ship, and they were wrecked. I asked him what brought him to Gloucester - he said Mr. Martin, who is a traveller, and lives there, had been a very great friend to him, and he came to get his assistance, but he was in Scotland, and would not be home till Friday or Saturday. I said if that was the case, I was going up the town to church, and if he would come again I would call on some friends of mine, and procure him a few shillings. I called on two friends, got 7 s., and put 5 s. to it myself - I gave it to him at tea. In the course of the evening I asked him where he thought of going? he said he must go to a public-house. I took him to a house where I knew he would be treated well, and told the landlord to let him have every thing in moderation that he wanted, and I would pay for it. On Monday morning I left home, and did not return till Thursday - while I was out I learnt that Mr. Martin would not return for three weeks. On my return I found the prisoner at my house - I have no family. I told him that Mr. Martin would not return for three weeks, and he might make my house his home till he did return. He continued with me from that time till Saturday morning, the 15th of this month. The night before he said he had taken some medicine, and if he had occasion to get up in the night we were not to be alarmed; I heard him get up about five o'clock in the morning but took no notice - I got up myself about eight o'clock, and missed him. I then suspected all was not right, and went to a portable writing-desk, where I put up some Bank notes the night before, and found it broken open; a pocket-book was gone, which contained a 10 l. and nine 1 l. Bank notes, forty-six country notes; a 7 s. piece and a ring were also taken out of my looking-glass drawer. I immediately took a post-chaise, went to Cheltenham, and pursued a young man answering his description to London - he had been booked by the name of Johnson. I came to town, and found nineteen of my country notes at the Bolt in Tun, Fleet-street. I gave information at Bow-street, and on Monday morning I found him in custody. The ring was found on him.</p>

            . I am a salesman, and live in Brydges-street, Covent-garden. On Sunday morning, the 16th of April, the prisoner came to my house, and asked if I would supply him with wearing apparel? he said he was going to Scotland, and asked me if I could take country notes. He opened his pocket-book, and pulled out forty or fifty notes - some Bank notes were among them, I said,</p>
               <p>"Can you not pay me in Bank of England notes." He said No, for country notes were of no use to him in Scotland. I said I could not take them unless they were payable in London. He said he would leave me sixteen notes, and send for the things in the morning - he bought things to the amount of 8 l., returned in about twenty minutes, and wanted five of the notes away again - I had told him in the morning that I should find whether they were good. I presented them at the Golden Cross, Charing-cross, where they usually pay them at a discount, and they stopped the notes. I returned, found the prisoner at my door, and took him into custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of April, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was fetched to Lazarus's, and took the prisoner in charge. I searched him, and found a knife on him with Mr. Duff's name on it, also a seven shilling-piece and a ring, and in his pocket I found a pocket-book, which contained 42 l.; a 10 l. Bank note was among them. He said they were Mr. Duff's property.</p>

I saw him put his hand in at the window, take a handkerchief, and go away with it. I ran down stairs, pursued him, and caught sight of him about fifty yards off; I am positive he is the person - I had seen him lurking about for some time previous - another boy was with him - he was stopped before I came up.

On the 13th of March, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I went to a banker's in Henrietta-street, on business. My watch was then safe - it was the time of the election. As I returned towards the City, the prisoner, and two others, surrounded me, and forced me into the crowd. I begged of them to let me go, as I did not want to go into the crowd. About a minute after they gave way, and let me out. I immediately missed my watch, turned my head round, and saw the prisoner hand it over to one of the others. I immediately rushed in and collared him, and his companions called for assistance. The others was rescued by the mob, but I never lost my hold of the prisoner. I have not recovered my watch.</p>

I asked 9 s. 6 d. a pair for them - she offered 9 s. which I refused. They went out - returned and bought 1 1/2 yards of gauze. I was doing up the parcel, and saw the prisoner putting a pair of stockings under her child's clothes, and then into her pocket. They bought things which came to nearly 1 l., which the companion paid for. They went out, I followed, and brought the prisoner back, and she delivered them to me.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Margaret-place. On Saturday night, the 18th of March, between eight and nine o'clock, Walters came to my shop, and bought a leg of pork, which came to 4 s. 8 1/2 d., and gave me a 1 l. Bank note. I asked him his name and address? he gave me</p>
               <p>"Walters, Wick-street, or Wick Hackney." I said,</p>
               <p>"You appear like an honest man, I suppose you took this of your master?" he said Yes, and that he had been a cook in London-wall. I did not mark the note, as I considered it useless. I do not remember his saying when he received it. Directly after he was gone, a neighbour came in, and gave me reason to suspect it was forged; it laid on the block. I then took out two or three notes from my pocket to compare with it, I could discover no difference. I always kept it separate from the others. Sometime after, Chapman brought Walters in, and I gave him the same note Walters paid me I am certain.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, and live in Margaret-place, Hackney. On the 18th of March, a little before nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner, Walters, came to the shop, and bought 3 lbs. of butter. He asked if I could give him change for a 1 l. Bank note? I said I believed I could (in order to get the note into my hands.) - He gave me the note; I looked particularly at the signature and date, as I had previously taken some bad ones; they did not correspond - it was signed E. Staple. I could not tell whether it was good or not. I told him I could not give him change, and returned it to him. He told me to weigh him a pound of cheese, and then perhaps I could. I said No. I noticed the date of it. He went out, leaving the goods, and said he must see if he could get change somewhere else. I followed, suspecting him; he carried the note in his hand, and went into Mr. Hayward's shop, a few doors further on. I saw him give Hayward the note, and get the change. He then came out, went down Margaret-street, and about twenty yards from the shop the prisoner, Cock, joined him. They conversed together, then went into a chandler's-shop at the bottom of the street, and had some grocery weighed, but did not purchase it. They came out, I followed them up Margaret-street again about twenty or thirty yards; they then went into Mr. Haddock's. They stopped, and had some conversation together in the middle of the street before they went in, they then both went into the shop together, I went over to a butcher's shop, where I saw Gray, and called him to assist me. I stood looking through Haddock's window, saw him looking at the note by his lamp, and observed one of them hand some paper behind him to the other; we then went in. I asked Haddock to give me the note, and said, quite loud enough for the prisoners to hear me, that I knew they had been passing bad notes. Haddock gave me the note, and then said</p>
               <p>"Give it me again" - he marked it and returned it to me, it was not out of my sight - it was not the note he offered to me, for it was a different signature. I secured them both, took them into Hayward's shop, and asked him, in their presence, to give me the note he had taken from Walters; he did so, and Walters gave him back the change - it was the same number and signature as the note he offered to me. I and Gray then took the two notes to the house of Mr. Glover, the inspector, and gave them to his housekeeper. I put my name on both the notes at his house - (looks at two) - these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had both the prisoners in custody at Hayward's - A. Yes; and while Walters was giving back the change Cock escaped. When I secured them at Haddock's, and said they had been passing bad notes, they both said,</p>
               <p>"If they are bad we have just taken them of our master." I am sure they said we, and I understood them that they had just taken them. It was on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the prisoners come to your shop on the 25th of February - A. Yes, Cock came about eight o'clock in the evening, and asked if I had got a hock of bacon? I said No. He had a piece of bacon and some butter weighed, and gave me a note. I asked him his name? he said it was Cook, and that he lived in Mutton-lane. I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120044"/>certain he did not say Cock. This is the note - (looking at it). I gave him the change, and he left.</p>

Haddock put his name on the note in my presence, and delivered it to Chapman. We took the prisoners to Hayward's, and he gave Chapman a note; the change and meat were returned to him. We took the notes to Mr. Glover's housekeeper, having left the prisoners at Hayward's; we returned, and found Cock had escaped; I took Walters to the watch-house.

I fixed Gray at the front door and Gleed in the garden - it was about seven o'clock in the morning.

I went into the house, and saw his wife and sister there. I went into the front room; it was all darkness - I called for a candle, they had none. The shutters were opened, I looked round, but could not see him. I at last found him in a cupboard, doubled up, and a knife in his hand, which was shut.

Walters was received there as an assistant-cook for about six weeks, and as he was considered a laborious and deserving man, a gratuity of 1 s. a day was given him when he was discharged, which was on the 1st of March. I myself paid him two 1 l. notes and 6 s. I was in the habit of paying new notes; I almost always paid everything in new notes. I have a strong impression in my mind that I paid him two new notes - I should certainly think I did not pay him these two - (looking at them.) The notes I paid almost invariably came from my bankers, Messrs. Smith, Payne and Co., or from Messrs. Lubbocks', the bankers of the establishment. I certainly do not think these notes ever passed through my hands. He behaved extremely well with us.</p>

I then sent my son out for change which I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120045"/>gave to the prisoner (looks at a note), this is it, it has Stanford, with my initials, on it.

I gave him the whole 10 l. - he returned me a 1 l. note and 1 s. He said he was going to some place in Berkshire, on Tuesday, and promised to call on me on Monday, but did not. I did not see him again till I saw him at Marlborough-street, which was about three weeks after. He was about five minutes consulting me.</p>

He wanted the note back, I told him it was in the hands of Mr. Cameron, and sent there, but they were gone to bed. I have no doubt of the prisoner's person.</p>

I said I did not think that I had sufficient change. I took it to the bar to my master, and told him what I had observed, and he declined changing it, and I took it back to the prisoner. He said he had no way of paying unless that was changed. I returned with it to my master; he examined it by another; and at last changed it.

            . I am in the house of Mr. Jarman, who is a jeweller, in the Strand. On the 21st of December, between five and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to see some seals - he bought a gold seal and key; he then offered me a 10 l.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120046"/>note. On first sight I thought it was bad. However I examined it very minutely, and saw it was more perfect than many I had seen, and from that, and his genteel appearance, I was induced to take it. They came to four guineas. I gave him the change, and shewed him some pins, he paid me 12 s. in silver, for one. I observed a stain on the note, and the name of Tomlinson and Co. on it, before I took it. I did not ask his address.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. At Marlborough-street. I kept the note in my possession till I produced it there, and then marked it. My employers were in France, and as I doubted it I would not pay it away - (looks at one) - this is the indentical note I took of the the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a waiter at Payne's Hotel, Brook-street, Bond-street. On Sunday, the 2d of January, I saw the prisoner at the Nelson Inn, North Cheam, where I then lived; he came in a horse and chaise, with another young man, they came into the house, and remained three-quarters of an hour, or an hour. The reckoning came to 9 s. 6 d. - the prisoner gave me a 10 l. Bank note, I took it to my master, at the bar, he could not change it. I then took it to a person named Lott, who keeps the tap at the inn, Mrs. Lott gave me a 5 l. and four 1 l. notes, and 1 l. in silver; I brought the change back, put it on the table, the prisoner took it up, and was going to put it into his pocket, when his companion said,</p>
               <p>"It is my change," and took it. They staid about ten minutes longer, gave me half a crown, and went away in the chaise together, to Epsom; they ordered dinner to be got for four persons on the Wednesday following. I was frequently in the room, and have no doubt of his person.</p>
               <p>AMEY LOTT. My husband keeps the tap of the Nelson inn, I remember early in January, the last witness brought me a 10 l. note, I gave him change, took the note up stairs, and put it into the drawer - there were two more 10 l. notes in the drawer; they were rolled together with some smaller ones. I put this by itself. I had no loose 10 l. notes in the drawer, except this. I locked the drawer, and always kept the key myself. I paid the same note to Mr. Taylor, who is clerk to Mr. Earl, of Kingston. I put no mark on it myself.</p>

            . In February last, I was servant to Mr. Braham, Euston-street, Euston-square, New Road. He keeps a private house - the prisoner lodged there for three weeks. He gave me a note which I did not look at. He said it was a 10 l. note, and told me to go and pay Mr. Lunn's bill, at the public-house, and bring him back the change - the note was open. I took it over and gave it to Mr. Lunn, jun. He deducted the bill, and gave me a 5 l. and three 1 l. notes, with some silver. I brought the change back and put it on the prisoner's table. He took the notes up, and asked me to get him five 1 l. notes for the 5 l. note, as it was a very old one. I did so, and gave them to him. I never changed a 10 l. note for him before. He went away about an hour after, and left no direction where he was gone to. I did not see him again till he was in custody. I believe he left on the 3d of February.</p>

            . I am a solicitor, and live at Froome, Somersetshire. On the 5th of February, I was at the Sussex Hotel, Bouverie-street, and was desired to assist in securing the prisoner - he was out then. I went up into the sitting-room, where I found a young woman. There was another in the bed-room; both rooms looked into the street - the other woman came into the room. I took my station at the window, and they both went up into the bedroom. In consequence of information, I insisted on their coming down, and placed them at the back part of the room that they should not look out of the window. I placed myself so as to look out of the window without being seen. I did not see the prisoner in the street, he came into the room. I immediately went to him and charged him with uttering a 10 l. Bank of England note, knowing it to be forged. I did not tell him to whom he uttered it. He said I must be mistaken in the person, for he never changed a 10 l. Bank of England note in his life - I am perfectly sure that he said so. I kept him waiting till Mr. Ross came. He then told him he had uttered a 10 l. note to Mr. Tuson, and shewed him the note. He then admitted that he had paid it to Mr. Tuson, but added, that he had given his right name and address. I had two constables in waiting - I called them in, and delivered him up to them. He asked if he might be allowed to have some dinner, I permitted him. He then wished the constables to withdraw, which I permitted - I and Mr. Ross remained with him, I believe the young women were not there. He asked Mr. Ross, what end he could have in prosecuting him? and said he was the only man that could possibly save his brother, but if Mr. Ross persisted in what he was doing, he would turn against his brother, and nothing would save him (a person named

On the 5th of February, I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120047"/>to the Sussex hotel, the prisoner was not then within, he afterwards came in; he was in the custody of Mr. Miller. On my entering the room I charged him with passing a forged 10 l. Bank of England note; he said he had done no such thing. I said I had a charge of that nature against him. He asked to whom he had passed it? I told him to Dr. Tuson, of Percy-street, Rathbone-place. He said he believed he had passed a 10 l. note to Dr. Tuson, but he was not aware that it was forged, and that he had given his right name - he might have said that he gave his residence also, but I am not certain. I gave him in charge; he wished the officers to withdraw, they did so; he then said it would be of no service to me to prosecute him for this note, but that ultimately it might do me much mischief; that he was enabled to help my brother's case very materially, and that he was the only person who could do it (my brother was in custody on a charge of this nature). He said, if I suffered him to depart in the present instance he should feel grateful for it, as I must be aware it was a case that would at any rate affect his liberty, and perhaps his life; and if I would not comply, he should be compelled to be hostile, which I understood to mean respecting my brother.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any transactions with him yourself - A. Never. I saw him once by accident, but did not then know his name. He said a great deal more, which I do not recollect. I afterwards saw him at dinner, as Mr. Miller has stated.</p>

            . I am a cashier at the Bank, and sign 10 l. notes. There is no other of my name. The note is not signed by me.</p>
               <p>(The note was here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have heard the evidence, which requires no ordinary mind to disconnect. I admit passing the notes, but you will find I gave no false names or addresses to them. I might have told Dr. Tuson that I was going to Kennington. Mrs. Cane did not bring me the change for three-quarters of an hour; but there is no evidence of my betraying any fear; and I will leave you to judge whether, in the course of passing six notes, there is sufficient to prove that I knew them to be forged, further than bare suspicion. Misfortune drove me to the life I have followed, which was depending on the chance of a billiard-table. I am aware that was not a reputable life, but I trust you will allow that in that life I may have taken the notes in question. You will see whether I passed the notes for any unnecessary articles - one was for wine, another for jewellery, and a third was to pay the publican. The bare suspicion of my knowing them to be forged, is not sufficient to prove me guilty of an offence which I am to suffer death for. The officers who apprehended me have not been called. -</p>

            . I am an officer, and assisted in apprehending the prisoner. I found 12 s. 6 d. on him, but no notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner (in continuation.) It was my determination to plead Guilty, but the Court advised me not, and I put myself on my trial, not for the purpose of vindication, but that I might address you. I have made application to the Bank, with a full confession that I passed the notes, and praying their mercy on account of my youth, and having had no paternal protector since the age of sixteen. I wished to make every atonement in my power. Various misrepresentations have been made to influence their opinion. I have nothing but death before me, having been denied their clemency. Instead of my being the leader of a desperate gang, I was only the instrument of Stewart - he took advantage of my distresses; my wife and myself had not bread to eat for two days. Stewart said if I could pass bad notes he could get them for me. I was provided with one, and passed that; he got me another. He was apprehended in a day or two, and laid the blame on me; he was allowed to be transported for fourteen years. I was then sure that the officers were after me - I had no money to leave the country, and was led to the desperate resolution of passing more, to raise money to leave the country; at this time I became acquainted with Mr. Ross (the brother of the witness, who has only done his duty) - I informed him of my situation, and that the officers were after me - he was living with his father at home, enjoying a comfortable house and everything he wished for. He said if I would suffer him to join me, he would pass sufficient notes to get us both out of the country. I suffered him to participate in it, he passed notes with me, and through the means of his brother's taking me, he was allowed the clemency of the Bank; and I suppose, from misrepresentations on my character, I am to be cast for death. I now throw myself entirely on their mercy, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120048"/>perhaps, before I suffer I shall detail the circumstances more particularly, and shew that I deserve the same mercy as others.</p>

            . I am a private watchman. On the 20th of February, about six o'clock in the morning, I had a person to call up, which I did, and then returned to the premises, which join Mr. Whiting's. I heard something fall heavily from the roof, ran down the alley, and heard a man say,</p>
               <p>"What do you do at the top of the building, stealing the lead?" I then saw the prisoner drop from the building, and secured him; a person looked out of a window, and said that was the man who was on the roof. I said,</p>
               <p>"I have got you at last - I have been looking for you a long time, for the people have been robbed four or five times." He said,</p>
               <p>"Then I suppose I must pay for all" - I asked if any body was with him? he said No. I found 56 lbs. of lead by his side, and took him to the watch-house, then returned to the roof, and found another piece of lead cut off, ready to be thrown down. I saw it all fitted to the roof; it was quite fresh cut. I found a knife on the tiling.</p>

He made a snatch at my watch-chain - the chain gave way, and two rings went with the seal; he ran off.

He was met by Greve, who stopped him. I found my key on the ground, but not the seal.</p>

            . I was sixteen years of age on the 5th of April last. My father was a shoemaker; I worked with him till he died, and then went to New Providence. On my return I was ill, and was confined in St. Bartholomew's Hospital. After that I went to sea, came home again, and went to St. Thomas's Hospital, which I left a fortnight before I was taken up. About the 3d or 4th of February, I was loitering about Charlotte-buildings, Gray's Inn-lane (it was about a week before I was taken), and I met a man named Lloyd - I had some conversation with him; the prisoner was not with him. I met him afterwards, and he proposed to introduced me to somebody. On the 26th of February he introduced me to the prisoner at the door of the Black Dog, public-house, Gray's Inn-lane. He said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Here is a chap that will pass pap for you, and I know he is all right." The prisoner then said,</p>
               <p>"Very well, shall we have any thing to drink?" They said Yes. He took us into a public-house, and treated us with gin, (Lloyd, me, and two young women) - the prisoner gave me 1 s. to buy some victuals, and I went away. I did not like to go out that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you meet him again - A. I met Lloyd next day, by accident, Sunday, the 27th, in Holborn - he gave me 4 d. to pay for my lodging, and appointed to meet me at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120050"/>Black Dog on Monday morning. I went there about nine o'clock, staid till eleven, then Lloyd came - some men who pass bad notes, came in afterwards; they were strangers to me. The same day, between five and six o'clock, the two young women whom I saw on Saturday night, went with me and Lloyd to St. Giles's - the young women went before, and Lloyd and I went after. We met the prisoner about Broad-street, and then went to a house in St. Giles's. Lloyd and the prisoner went up stairs, and told me to remain at the bottom; Lloyd came down, and told me to come up - (do not know the street or number, but I should know it if I saw it). I went up into the garret, and there saw the two young women, another girl, a man whom they called Mike, Lloyd, and the prisoner; the prisoner told me to stop till they came back - he and Lloyd went out immediately; I waited there, and they returned in about three-quarters of an hour. The prisoner pulled out five 1 l. Bank notes, and gave one to Mike. Lloyd got a pen and ink, wrote on the other four both back and front, and put them into my coat-pocket. He said,</p>
               <p>"Here are the notes, put your hand upon them" - the prisoner was in the room; I desired to look at the water-mark. The prisoner said there is a good water-mark on them, and nobody will tell them from good. I looked, and saw West Smithfield on one of them. The prisoner, Lloyd, and I left the house, and as we went along, Lloyd said,</p>
               <p>"You shall have 6 s. for each note you do for us," meaning the prisoner and him - we were all three in company. The prisoner said I should have some bottles. Lloyd said,</p>
               <p>"Here is a bottle shop;" the prisoner told him to go in and buy one or two. Lloyd went in, and bought a small bottle for me to put the rum into, and a pint and a half bottle for the prisoner to put it into as I came out with it. As we were going along, the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"This house I know, if they stop you they will let you go" - it was a public-house and wine-vaults. The prisoner told me to wait while Lloyd went and got the chaunt.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the chaunt - A. The direction of some neighbour's door. Lloyd brought me this direction,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Orton, No. 42, Devonshire-street, Red Lion-square, plumber and glazier." The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Go in there, (pointing to a wine-vaults), ask for three half-quarterns of rum, and give the chaunt which Lloyd gave to you."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep the four notes, or return them - A. I forgot to mention that I gave them back to Lloyd before he got the chaunt, and when he brought it he gave me one of the notes back. I went into the wine-vaults, kept by Mr. Clark, I believe, at the corner of a passage in Devonshire-street, Red Lion-square. I went in, asked for three half-quarterns of rum, and said, please to change a note for my master. The rum was put into the bottle, and I asked for change? He said he had not got change, and I then said I could not have the rum; he emptied it out, and I came away with the bottle and note, and told the prisoner and Lloyd, who were waiting for me at the door, that I could not get change. The prisoner pointed to the Turk's Head just by, and told me to ask for the same thing there, and give the same chaunt. I went in - there was a lady in the bar, and asked her for the rum, and to change a note for my master. She asked what direction? I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Orton, No 42, Devonshire-street, plumber and glazier." She took the note, and gave me 19 s. 1 1/2 d in change. I came out, and Lloyd came to me and asked if I had the smash, (the money). I said I had - the prisoner was by - they always kept together, and outside. I gave the prisoner the change and rum, and told him he owed me 5 s., which with the 1 s. I owed him on Saturday night, would make the 6 s. for the note. He grumbled, and said,</p>
               <p>"What?" and on hearing him grumble, I said,</p>
               <p>"Nothing." Then we all three went up by another public-house, near Devonshire-street, close to Red Lion-square, and Lloyd gave me another 1 l. note. The prisoner told me to ask for the same quantity as before, and give the same chaunt. I went in - it was the Hole in the Wall; I saw a man and woman in the bar, the woman was sitting down. I asked for the rum and change, and gave the same name. The woman said she did not know any such a person, but the man said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do; he mended my pipe last week." They gave me 19 s. 1 1/2 d. in change; I came out, and gave the rum and change to the prisoner. We then went down into Red Lion-street, and Lloyd gave me a note; the prisoner told me to wait while Lloyd went and got a new chaunt. He brought me one, but I told him that was too hard a name, and I could not recollect it - he then brought me,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Brandt, watch and clock-maker" - I think it was Theobald's-road or street, and by Lloyd's direction I went into a wine-vaults in Red Lion-street (I don't recollect the name). I asked for three half-quarterns of rum as before, gave the note to a woman, and gave her that direction. She said,</p>
               <p>"I know Mr. Brandt, but I don't know you." I told her, as Lloyd had instructed me to say in case I should be questioned, that I had only come there that morning. She took the note, wrote the name on it, and gave me 19 s. 1 1/2 d. and the rum. I went away, and gave both the rum and change to the prisoner - they were both waiting outside; the prisoner always received the change, except once. He then said we must go down to Temple-bar - we all three went. Lloyd went and got a chaunt, and brought me, I think it was,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Hambler, boot and shoemaker, Water-street." I went into a public-house, in a street on the right hand side from Temple-bar, going down towards the water. I asked for the same quantity of rum, and change. He said he had got but 15 s., or else he would give my master change, without the note or the rum. I went away, and found Lloyd and the prisoner at the corner of the street. The prisoner pointed to a public-house in a passage, and told me to go in there. I went, and asked for liquor and change as before, and gave the same chaunt. The woman said,</p>
               <p>"Are you sure you are right?" I said Yes. She then gave me 19 s. 1 1/2 d. and the rum; I gave her the note, and left the house - Lloyd was at the door, but the prisoner was absent. He said,</p>
               <p>"There is somebody coming after us, let us run." We ran through Temple-bar, towards St. Paul's, and joined the prisoner in a court, I was going to give him the rum and change, but he said,</p>
               <p>"Give it to Lloyd, that is his note" - Lloyd took it from me, and I said he owed me 6 s. for it; he said,</p>
               <p>"Lend me this 6 s. for I want to get my top-boots tonight." I said I supposed he would pay me, and he said Yes. I asked the prisoner for the money for the three notes I had done for him? and he gave me 17 s., and 1 s. he lent me on Saturday night, made 18 s. We did nothing more that night. He agreed with Lloyd to bring another young man with him on Tuesday night, which was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120051"/>next night. Lloyd and I left the prisoner, and went to Gray's Inn-lane. Lloyd left me at the Black Dog.</p>
               <p>Q. On Tuesday, the 29th of February (the next night), did you meet them by appointment - A. Yes, between five and six o'clock, Lloyd, I, and a young man named Nicholls, went up to the same house in St. Giles's, and saw the prisoner there; he told me and Nicholls to wait till Lloyd and he came back, we did, they returned in about three-quarters of an hour, the prisoner came and pulled out eight notes, I am certain, if not nine - I saw him give one to Mike, who was there - he lived there with two young women, and a girl. Lloyd asked for a pen and ink and wrote on the eight notes, back and front. I saw him put them into a piece of brown paper - he then put them into my pocket and told me to put my hand on them. Lloyd told Nicholls and me to go to the corner of Fleet-market, at the Fleet-street end, and he and the prisoner would meet us there. We all four left the house. I and Nicholls went there, they went a different way; we found the prisoner and Lloyd on the spot they had appointed - they were there before us. Lloyd asked me for the eight notes, I gave them to him in the same paper, he gave Nicholls one, they went on towards St. Paul's, and Lloyd gave him a chaunt; he went into a wine-vaults, which Lloyd shewed him, and got change - we three waited at a little distance, not altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to Castle-court - A. Yes; Lloyd gave me a chaunt,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Janson, Castle-court;" I went into the public-house, they told me to get Mr. Janson's name on it, for they did not know me, and stopped the bottle. I came out, and told the prisoner and Lloyd. the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, come on, here is another bottle;" and gave me Nicholls's bottle. We all four went to Coleman-street, Lloyd gave me,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Johnson, Bell-alley," for a chaunt, and directed me to go to the Three Tuns, kept by Needham. I asked for three half-quarterns of rum, and, by mistake, I gave Johnson, Brad-alley. The lady gave me change, and desired me to look at it before I left the bar, as she would not change it after. I came out - as we were going on to Mr. Morris's, Nicholls left us. I gave the change and the rum to the prisoner. As we went along we stopped, and I said there is somebody touting us (which means watching). The prisoner told me to wait a bit, and Lloyd went and looked at the man, who was an officer; he then seemed to go away, and the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Now go."</p>
               <p>Q. To where were you to go - A. To Morris's, the Blue Anchor. Lloyd had given me a 1 l. note out of the eight, between Needham's and there. I went into Morris's, and gave the name of</p>
               <p>"Johnson, Brad-alley;" and asked for the same quantity of liquor. Morris asked me several questions, where Brad-alley was, and if it was in Coleman-street - I said Yes, for I did not know where it was. He was writing on the note when the officer came in and collared me, before I got the change. He asked what I was doing, and took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner soon afterwards taken - A. As we went along the prisoner and Lloyd came to rescue me; they had told me before, that they would rescue me if I was taken - they came round, followed us, and came in front of the officer. I supposed they wanted to rescue me. The officer told another man to take me into the public-house - I went in quietly - the officer ran out, and brought the prisoner in. That is all I have to say.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was taken, was anything said - A. The officer said to me, Do you know this man? I was going to say Yes, but before I could get the word out, he knocked his hand down, and said,</p>
               <p>"By G - d, you don't know me!" and then I said No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you no other name but Richard Hill - A. None, except what the boys in Gray's Inn-lane gave me. I had no home. I returned from sea three months before I was taken, and was two months and a fortnight in St. Thomas's Hospital; and for the other fortnight I lodged in Field-lane. I loitered about Charlotte-buildings, because I had nothing to do, and I must own I was obliged to pilfer and do other things. I have a father-in-law, a shoemaker, at Bradford, in Wiltshire, his name is

            ; I have not heard of him these two months. My father brought me up in the Wiltshire militia. I was thirteen years old when he died.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first ship you went to sea in - A. The brig Junius, Mr. Miller was the captain; I left him at New Providence, and worked my passage home in the brig Swan. I have had no employ on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lived by thieving - A. Sometimes I have opened the hackney-coaches for people, and other times pilfered meat to eat.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been a prisoner - A. Yes, three months ago I was in this very prison for stealing a piece of bacon - the Court had mercy on me. I was taken up once on suspicion. I have been in custody three times including this time, and no more.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you promised mercy, on condition of being a witness - A. About a week after I was taken. I was told to tell the truth, and I thought it best to tell the truth. I wrote on a paper what had passed between me and the prisoner, and when the gentleman of the Bank came I shewed it to him; he asked me some questions about it, and wrote down what I said. I have thought it best to tell the truth, and I hope I shall get a ship and go to sea, for I have had my life threatened by a parcel of rascals in the prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you call yourself a rascal - A. Yes, I am a very bad boy. They threatened to stick a piece of steel into me, and I can call them nothing else but rascals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what pap was before you knew the prisoner - A. No, I learnt all the slang when I was in the Old Bailey, of course I was not here three months without hearing these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write down all the chaunts they gave you - A. No, I went and shewed the officer the houses, and that called it to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the clothes you have on to-day - A. With a little money the Bank allowed me for victuals, I lived on the gaol allowance, and bought the clothes with the money.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. What did the turnkey give you - A. Ten shillings a week. I was destitute of employ, and had no friend to apply to.</p>

            . I am a City constable. On the 29th of February, about ten minutes or a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Coleman-street, and saw the prisoner and another young man standing opposite the Blue Anchor. I saw Hill standing by himself at the gateway adjoining the public-house - I suspected them. The other man came up, looked me full in the face, and I went away up the street sixty or seventy yards, then crossed over, came down on the opposite side, and took my station in Bishop's-court, directly opposite to where I stood before, they could not observe me. They remained there; the boy had crossed over to them, and was in conversation with them for about five minutes; he then ran across into the public-house, a hackney-coach was just passing at the time. I ran, keeping the coach between me and the men, and went into the public-house. The boy was at the bar, Morris had the note and pen in his hand. In consequence of what he said, I took the boy into custody. Morris gave me the note, I desired him to notice it, and I marked it in his presence with my initials - (looks at one) - this is in. I found a bottle standing on the bar, and brought it away. I found nothing on the boy. Before I left the house I got Wright to assist me. In our way to the Compter with the boy, I went into White Rose-court, and when I got to the end I met the prisoner and the other man; they must have gone down London-wall, and up Basinghall-street. When they saw me they fluttered and fell back - I had the boy by my side. When I got opposite to the Bell, public-house, which is about fifteen yards from the court, the prisoner was not two yards behind me. I said to Wright,</p>
               <p>"Take care of this boy while I apprehend this party" - the prisoner must have heard me. Directly as I spoke, the prisoner and the other took to their heels, and went down White Rose-court - I cried out Stop thief! and kept them both in sight. I came up to the prisoner and collared him, the other was a-head and got away. I said to the prisoner I want you!" he said</p>
               <p>"No, it is the other man you want." I took him into the Bell, where the boy was, and said to the boy</p>
               <p>"You know this man very well." He seemed anxious to answer me, but the prisoner knocked his fist down and said,</p>
               <p>"By G - d! you don't me, do you?" the boy said,</p>
               <p>"No, I don't." I searched the prisoner, and found 3 l. 9 s. 6 d. in silver and 1 s. 5 d. in copper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120053"/>all good money. I asked him his residence? he said he did not choose to tell me. I never learnt where he did live.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Hill was a stranger to you - A. Yes. I had no communication with him before I took him. I saw the prisoner before I went into the house. I do not think he knew me.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Mason's livery-stables, Coleman-street. On Tuesday evening, the 29th of February, about half-past eight o'clock, I was at the Blue Anchor. I had occasion to go to Fore-street, and saw the prisoner, another man, and a lad, standing opposite the Blue Anchor door. I returned in about five minutes, they were then gone from where I saw them. I went into the Blue Anchor, and saw the boy, Morris, and the officer. I knew him to be the same boy I had seen with the prisoner. Hughes applied to me to assist in taking him, and I went with him through White Rose-court, into Basinghall-street. Two men followed a little after us, about six yards behind. When we came within six yards of the Bell, the officer turned round and said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man I want" - (they might hear him) - he left the boy in my charge. They instantly turned back and ran away. I took the boy into the Bell till Hughes returned with the prisoner in custody. The prisoner, I understood, asked the boy if he knew him. He hesitated, and said he did not.</p>

            . I live at the Three Tuns, Coleman-street. On the 29th of February, a person came to my house for three half-quarterns of rum - it was not the prisoner, I think. The person brought a bottle like that produced. I served him, and he offered me a 1 l. note. I said I could not change it. He said he came from Mr. Johnson, Bell-alley. I said, then take the rum and pay for it another time, it is of no consequence. He said it was partly for change that he wanted it, for Mr. Johnson wanted to pay a bill. I looked, and found I had sufficient silver and changed it - (looks at it) - this is it. I wrote on it. The person was a stranger, and not the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Crown-street, Finsbury-square. On the 4th of February, between seven and eight o'clock at night, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked the servant for change for a 1 l. note for Mr. Cox. I heard him, came into the shop, and said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Cox of Wilson-street?" he said</p>
               <p>"Yes" - he is a bonnet-maker, and his men often come for change. I said I could not do it, unless he took 10 s. in copper. He hesitated, and then said he dare say it would do, he would take 10 s. worth. In the mean time I sent Mrs. Fortman next door with the note. He saw her go out, and I told him we always liked to ascertain whether a note was good - I put my initials on it before I sent it out - (looks at one) - this is it. When I said we liked to ascertain whether they were good, he said he would go and see whether Mr. Cox would take 10 s. worth of halfpence - he had agreed to take them before. I said,</p>
               <p>"No, stop a bit." He then run away, and I ran after him till I got into some ruins behind some houses; he had three or four pals waiting for him there - they kept close up to him, and I rather thought they were going to stop me. I thought it prudent to return - he had his coat off, his shirtsleeves turned up, and an apron on.</p>

I did not see the prisoner about the house; his wife and sister live with him. I saw him next day. I have since seen a 1 l. note, which I know to be mine by the hand-writing on it, it was in my house at the time.

               <p>Q. Why did you not go to the Magistrate in your own neighbourhood - A. I was advised to go to Bow-street. I have seen a note in the possession of Mr. Cook - it has the name of Kayne, of Richmond, on it in my own writing. I did not put the date on it. I had taken one or two of him before.</p>
               <p>Q. His name would be on any note you took of him - A. I do not think I have taken three notes of him altogether. I never charged my mother with stealing it. She left my house suddenly.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came by it - A. No, but he told me he had an old uncle dead at Hessam (which I believe is in the Portsmouth road), who had left him a house, which he had been offered 500 l. for. On the 30th of March I heard of the robbery, and made it known that I had this note.</p>

            . I am constable of the night at Hounslow. On the 30th of March I went to the prisoner's house; I found him at the King's Arms, public-house, in a lane near his house, and took him to his own house; I then told him I took him on suspicion of Hopkins's robbery, he said he was innocent. I found only 1 1/2 d. on him. Next morning I went to the cage and found he had hung himself. I found him tied up to the bar of the cage by his handkerchief, and almost dead.</p>

            , JUN. I have known the prisoner twenty years; he worked for my father at Hounslow, which is about one hundred and fifty yards from his own house. He usually came to work about half-past eight o'clock in the morning. On Monday, the day of the robbery, he went to work with me at Mr. Williams's, on the Heath, which is nearly three-quarters of a mile from where he lived, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning; he joined me about two hundred yards from his own house. I was with him from that time till a quarter past one, when he went to dinner; he returned to me about two o'clock, and remained with me till near four. I went with him to Brentford to the election, and lost him in the crowd about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know how much he got a week - A. Sixteen or eighteen shillings.</p>

            . I advised Hopkins to go to Bow-street. I enquired of him what he thought he had lost? - this was on the afternoon of the robbery. He said he could not tell, but he supposed there was 200 l. or 300 l. in notes and gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him when he saw it last - A. He said he had seen the paper that covered it, and it appeared not to have been removed, but he had not counted it. He said he did not know that he had marked any of the notes.</p>

I asked him where his right address was? he said at the Sun, Old Round-court, and that he gave the wrong address because he did not like his friends to know where he lodged. I said I knew the house, and well he might be ashamed of it - it is the sign of the Rising Sun - he said so afterwards. said he took the note of Parkinson, at a public-house, in Old Round-court (he keeps the Rising Sun), in change for a 5 l. note, which he took four or five days after the funeral of the King. I asked him how he came to pledge property when he had these notes; he said he often pledged property to the amount of 2 s. or 3 s., rather than change a note. I said the duplicates were to the amount of 14 s. or 15 s. He said he could not account for that. He said the things pledged in another name he bought of a young woman.

On the 24th of February, about a quarter past nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, and bought an umbrella for 7 s. 6 d., and said if it turned out good she would recommend me a customer. She tendered me a 1 l. note, but I begged of her to give me silver; she produced 2 s. and a 1 l. note from under her glove, said that was all she had, and she was determined to have an umbrella. I held the note up to the light, and saw the water-mark, then went out to borrow a few shillings, and gave her change - the umbrella produced is the one she bought. I gave the note she gave to me to Abbott; who got it changed for me.</p>

I took the note up, and while he gave her change I enquired her name and address? she said,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Marriott, No. 4, Off-alley, just by." I wrote that on the note - (looks at one) - this is it. The change<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120059"/>was given to her, and she went away. I afterwards enquired at No. 4, Off-alley, and could hear of no such person. Sometime after I found the prisoner lived there, but not by that name. I afterwards went there with Mayhew, about eight o'clock that evening, and found her sitting in the room with a woman, a child, and her husband. The officer knocked at the door, we could not get admission. I heard her voice say,</p>
               <p>"There is a knocking!" We went in, I pointed her out instantly, and asked if she did not recollect me? she said she did. The officer asked her where she got the note? she said from her husband (pointing to the man who sat opposite). The officer said he should take him, and went to collar him; he asked for his authority, he produced it; he then said,</p>
               <p>"I must see your warrant" - the officer said he had none. The woman came and laid hold of him, and said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, don't let him be taken!" I saw the man draw a pistol. He was at last secured and brought down stairs. The prisoner ran out; she came back without her bonnet, and said,</p>
               <p>"Where is my husband, where have you taken him to?" I said,</p>

            . I am a conductor of the patrol of Bow-street. I went with Butters to No. 4, Off-alley, and found the prisoner in a room there, he pointed her out. She asked if he came from the grocer's over the way? he said he did. I asked her where she took the note? she said from her husband (pointing to a man in the room). I asked him where he got it? he said he took it in trade, and that he was a tailor. I said he must go to the office, he refused; I put my hand on him - he asked for my authority, I shewed him my staff. He said if I had no warrant he would not go - a struggle ensued. I have heard the account given by Butters, it is correct. I took the pistol from him - it was loaded within half an inch of the muzzle, and in a drawer behind him was another pistol, loaded with three bullets. The one I took from him was a screw barrel, with one bullet in it.</p>

I asked him if he had not changed them, and got 1 l. notes for them; he said No, it was one of the notes he had received of his Captain, and that he went to the Bank with his Captain to receive it. I said I could not take it. One of the party said,</p>
               <p>"I have plenty of silver, I will pay you," and did so. They then went into the taproom and had five pots of porter; one of them, named Phelps came out of the taproom, and said,</p>

As soon as the gentleman went away, Phelps went out first, the other man next, and the prisoner after him. I sung out to them to stop a moment, but they all went out, leaving the note. I secured the prisoner myself, Phelps was brought back, and the other man escaped. The prisoner was searched at the watch-house, and sixpence and a penny found on him - a shilling dropped from him in the way to the watch-house. Phelps had a bundle containing sugar, tea, and tobacco. I asked him where he bought it - he said in the Highway; at first he said he paid for it in silver, and then with a 1 l. note.</p>

We took him to Brigg's, and as we were taking him to the watch-house a shilling dropped, it must have fallen from him. He said he would make it better for me than I could make.

            . I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's. On the 10th of February, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners and three others lurking about Stockham's shop, talking together. I saw Earl go into the shop, the rest were about five yards off. Then one of them went up to the door of the shop, and the others went down the street - the shop door was open. I stood on the other side of the way, and saw Earl offer a piece of paper to the last witness, and saw him receive the change. He took up the bread and came out. He went towards Wilderness-row, in a direction that Batten went. I ran into the shop, came out, and saw the prisoners going up the street together. I overtook them in Wilderness-row, and met Read. He secured Batten, and I took Earl. Batten then had the bread. I found 18 s. 10 1/2 d. on Earl.</p>

I asked why he could not get it himself. He said he lived at Mr. Johnson's, a bookseller, No. 10, Wilderness-row - I have been to that shop twenty times. He said he had had some bread in trust for his master, and did not like to go himself. I went in, came out, and put the bread into his lap. We went and got some porter, and before I gave the man the change, I heard the cry of Stop the boy! I stopped and was secured. I believe the man sold the bread to this prisoner.

            . I am a watchman. On Saturday, the 26th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I observed some dirt on the palisades of Mr. Wyatt's new house. I called Hollingsworth to watch while I informed Mr. Wyatt. He was not up, but sent word for me to go in and search. I did so, and on the third story I found Munt in a corner of the front room - there was a crow-bar by his side, bent. He advanced towards me, and I took him down to Hollingsworth. He said he came there to ease himself. I took him to the watch-house - returned to the house and searched the premises. I found no person but Munt there then. Davis was found in the same house in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. When you searched the house after you took Munt, what did you find - A. I found three pieces of lead packed up, fresh cut. They laid on the top of the ledge, and weighed about 30 lbs.</p>

I saw the prisoner and three or four men in his company, come rushing on the pavement - the one before him kept shoving while the prisoner put his hand before him and took a watch from a seafaring man's pocket. I saw him do it - he was next to me. He immediately passed it to another man behind him. The seaman cried out Stop thief! I have lost my watch. I immediately collared him and held him with difficulty - he tried very hard to get from me, and a man kept pulling one way while the prisoner pulled the other. I kept my hold till the officer came up. I tried to get back to the seafaring man, but could not find him. The prisoner was taken to Bow-street - the seaman never attended. I saw him take it plainly, it appeared to be a silver watch.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. James's. I was with Glasborough, and heard the cry of, Stop him! or That is him! I rushed forward, with my staff, and found the last witness holding the prisoner - the crowd was pushing him backwards and forwards. I asked what was the matter? Doyle said the prisoner had stolen a gentleman's watch. I asked where the man was? he said he was gone off with the pressure of the people. With great difficulty we got the prisoner out of the crowd.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 4th of March, between five and six o'clock in the morning, before daylight, I stopped the prisoner coming up Petticoat-lane with a basket on his head. I asked him what he had got in the basket? he said it was linen. I asked him where he brought it from? he said from No. 22, Finsbury-square, and was going to take it to the West India Docks, and that the captain of a ship gave it to him. I asked him if he had any bill? he said No. I called Stone to my assistance, and told the prisoner he had a glass and a basket, and said he must go to the watch-house. He said if he must go to the watch-house we might carry the basket ourselves; Stone carried the basket, and I took the prisoner - he went quietly to the watch-house. He put his hand to his pocket, and dropped something behind him, which appeared to me to be white, as if it was candle. The basket contained twelve bottles of wine, and was covered with brown Holland; some toe kept the bottles from breaking. On the prisoner's person was found a small hand crow-bar, a large clasp knife, three books, one was a slate book, a memorandum book, and a hymn book, with</p>
               <p>"Hoxton Accademy" printed in it. He had a hat in his hand, which he said he bought in Rosemary-lane for 4 s. 6 d. Mr. Colley claimed it.</p>

I compared the bar with two or three places at the chapel that had been broken open. The impression in the wood exactly fit the crow-bar. The wine-cellar in the chapel had been forced open.

            . I am hostler at the Half-moon, on the Godstone-road, about thirty-six miles from North Ease - it is about three miles and a half on this side of Godstone. On the 12th of April, about six o'clock in the morning, the prisoners both came there - I am sure of their persons. Williams rode a bay mare, which I have since seen, and Sanders was on a dark gelding pony - they each had a saddle and bridle on. I have seen the mare twice since in the possession of Saxby. It had been thrown down in the night, and dreadfully cut on the knees, the lip was also cut. I washed and cleaned it - they had both been travelling very hard; the mare could not feed, they remained for about an hour - I am certain they are the men. I helped Sanders to cut a piece of the mare's lip. I never saw them before. Our house is about sixteen miles from London.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FOX. I am hostler to Mr. Gearing, Red Lion-yard, Gray's Inn-lane. On the 12th of April, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners in our yard - I am certain they are the men. Williams was on a bay mare, and Sanders was on a brown pony; they appeared jaded, as if they had travelled - the mare was cut and very much hurt. The prisoners put them up at our inn, and went to lodge at the Bull, near our stable. They came backwards and forwards, and went away on the 14th. I had an opportunity of seeing them those two days, and am certain they are the men; I conversed with them about the horses - they said they were going to stop a night or two. Williams took the bay mare away about nine o'clock on Friday morning, and Sanders took the pony away about eleven o'clock. I have seen the mare since in the possession of Saxby - it is the same. I have not seen the pony.</p>

On the 14th of April, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, Williams came on a mare; he rode her into the yard, and wanted to put her up to bait - he told me to clean her, and then went to a public-house; he was intoxicated.

            . I am a saddle and harness-maker, and live at No. 14, Goswell-street. On Wednesday, April the 12th, Saunders came to my shop about the middle of the day, and asked if I bought second-hand bridles and saddles? I said I did. He went away, and brought a bridle and saddle, which I bought of him; I gave it to the officer - (looks at one) - this is it; I particularly noticed the saddle - he said his master came from Lewes, and I saw Lewes on it. When he brought it I believe he asked 49 s. for it; I said 30 s. was the most I could give. He said,</p>
               <p>"Can't you afford to give more. Well, you must have it." I asked him where he brought it from? he said his master's name was Captain Parker, that he had a letter from him, saying he must come to town immediately, and take a ship to go to sea, that he brought the horses up to the Repository, and sold them - he said his master gave him the bridle and saddle, and he did not want to take it into the country again.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at North Ease, near Lewes. I have seen a mare in the possession of Palmer, which is mine - I have never found the pony; I lost them both on the 11th of April. The saddle is mine, and I believe the bridle is mine. There is no Captain Parker in my neighbourhood, but there was a Colonel Parker, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120065"/>is gone to Ireland - the mare was never his. I bought it last August, and have known it more than twelve months; I had had the pony about three months. I saw them both the day before they were stolen, and in the morning about five o'clock, I found the stable broken open, and missed them. I gave 55 l. for the mare; she was in very good condition when she was stolen, and had met with no accident. There was a drain in the road, between Mersfield and East Grinstead, with marks of some horse having met with an accident. The pony was worth 16 l.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Portpool-lane. On the night the prisoners were apprehended I was at the Bull - I am a constable. I took them to the watch-house; they were both in the same room - Sanders sat in the same box with me. I said it was a pity men could not come to do business without being drunk, as Williams was drunk. He said Yes, it was, and it had been 25 l. out of their way.</p>
               <p>SANDERS'S Defence. My father lives at Ringmer, in Sussex, about two miles and a half from Lewes, and about half a mile on the London-road. I left my grandfather's about a quarter before nine, and went on the London-road to fall in with the mail. I waited at the public-house till about half-past nine o'clock, when the mail came by, but could not take me. I walked to Hucklesfield to get a bed, but it being late the house was shut up - it was between eleven and twelve o'clock. I walked on till I came within a mile and a half of East Grinstead, when the prisoner, Williams, overtook me with two horses, one of which he rode and the other he led. He asked me if I was out of work, and where I was going? I said I was, and was going to town. I mounted the mare, rode a little distance, and fell into conversation. I said I was a gardener, and was going to Lewisham for employ; he said if I would stop with him a few days, he would give me 5 s. a day and part of my board, as he expected to buy some more horses. accepted his offer; we put the horses up in Gray's Inn-lane. He said to the hostler,</p>
               <p>"I have borrowed this saddle, and must take it to a friend" - he offered it for sale, but the person would not buy it; he went to another place, but the master was not at home, and he left it there. As we went up Goswell-street he said,</p>
               <p>"You had better go into the saddler's there, and ask if he buys them." The man said he did; I said I had one, and he said if I brought it he would buy it. Williams told me to fetch it, and to tell the man it was made at Lewes, and that it was Captain Parker's, who had sold his horses, in consequence of taking a ship to go to sea - I did so. After that, I remained with him two days. We stopped at the Bull inn, the first afternoon he got in. He went to a man about the mare; they called next morning to look at the horses, and said they would call again in the afternoon, but did not. About nine o'clock he took the mare to the Horse Shoe, and told me to go with him; about half-past ten o'clock he sent me to fetch the brown gelding, and gave me the money to pay for the standing, which I did, took it to Goswell-street, and a man there bought the horse. I was taken into custody with him at the Bull, but do not know how he got them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAMS'S Defence. On the 12th of April I was coming to town, and bought a chesnut horse at Medhurst Fair. In my way to town I met two men with a mare and a gelding. I chapped with them, gave them my horse and five guineas for the mare, and sixteen guineas for the pony. The man said he bought them of Captain Parker, of Lewes, who was going abroad, and had no farther use for them. I paid him the money, proceeded to town, and met Sanders. The horse I had in hand hung backwards, and would not lead well - Sanders said he had missed the mail. I said I would give him a lift if he would pay the gates. We stopped at the Half-Moon to breakfast, and I offered him 5 s. to stop a day or two with me, as I meant to buy some more horses.</p>
               <p>MR. SAXBY re-examined. Colonel Parker left Lewes several months before my horses were stolen. Sanders is a gardener, and has worked for me.</p>

On the 16th of March, in consequence of information I received from my brother, I determined to watch the prisoner as he went to dinner at one o'clock. When he was going out I stood at the street door; he worked in the back-shop, and had been mounting silver teapots with silver wire. I called him into the counting-house, accused him of losing his time a great deal, and said I thought he could not live honestly - he asked me if I thought he had robbed me? I said I suspected he was either robbing me or somebody else, and was determined to search him. He opened his coat and waistcoat, and said you may search me - I said I suspected he had some of my property about him. He then opened his coat and waistcoat again, and said,</p>
               <p>"Do you suppose I am robbing you?" I sent for an officer. Before the officer came he said he had got a few bits of bead wire about him, but what of that? He produced the wire from his breeches-pocket. Limbrick came, and I gave him in charge. We asked him if he had any at home - he said there were two little pieces at home, and a number of pawnbrokers' tickets, but he could account for them, for he bought them of Prickett. We went to his lodgings, and found a small melting pot, which appeared to contain about twenty-four or twenty-five ounces of silver, very recently melted; the silver was not in it - the crucible had been broken, to get the metal out. On searching up stairs I found fuel in a grate, which appeared to have a hole in it, that had recently contained the crucible - there was the shape of it in the coals. There was also a pair of common tongs, and a poker, all over smoke, as if they had been just used.</p>

            . The prisoner worked eighteen months with me, during which time I have lost silver to a considerable amount. In consequence of the apprehending of the last prisoner, and discovering the duplicates, it induced me to go to Armstrong's, a pawnbroker, in Baldwin's-gardens. I went there on Friday, the 17th of March, about half-past one o'clock, which was the day after Beckley was apprehended. While I was there the prisoner came in to redeem four silver figures. I was giving a description of him to Armstrong at the time he came in. Mr. Armstrong said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man!" and seized him. He seemed confused at the sight of me, and begged he might have some water or something, for he was near fainting. We took him to the public-house opposite Hatton-garden office; I there asked him where he got the things from which were in pledge at Armstrong's? and asked him if he had not taken my silver to manufacture them? I made no proposition to him whatever. He said, Yes, he had. I said I was afraid a great many more were concerned. After that he begged I would be merciful, and said all the things were made of my silver.</p>

             re-examined. I have lost upwards of 300 ounces of plate within the last twelve months. The goods were not before him when he made the confession. I described the articles to him which I had found at the pawnbrokers' - he said they were made out of my silver. His confession was not confined to the goods found at Armstrong's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in business for myself three years, and bought the goods. Four of the snuffboxes were made for me by Mr. Angel's men in their over-hours. Everybody knew I was in business - his men have been to my house, seen me at work, and have issued cards. The prosecutor is greatly mistaken in the property he has selected from my stock - he has selected me for prosecution from suspicion only. The silver mug was given to me by my master, Mr. Socket, of Camberwell, when I was out of my apprenticeship. I was going into partnership with him, but he died while it was in agitation. I commenced being journeyman in April, 1818. The prosecutor had no reason to suspect my honesty, but as soon as he found out that I was in business for myself he suspected I must have robbed him. I went to Armstrong's on business, and met the prosecutor there, who gave me in charge. I do assure your Lordship I am entirely innocent. The same chaser worked for me as for the prosecutor. I have bought 173 oz. of silver within the last three years.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Sunday morning, the 19th of March, I was in company with Dean, and saw the prisoner, Castle, in Bridge-street, opposite Earl-street, about a quarter past seven o'clock, carrying a bundle under his right arm - the other prisoner joined him on the bridge, he had no bundle. They walked together to the other side of the bridge, then Wingar took the bundle from him. They relieved each other till they got to Lambeth-marsh, about thirty yards beyond the Anchor and Hope, then Wingar stopped and I seized Castle, who had the bundle - it was a two-gallon bottle, tied in an apron, and a silk handkerchief over it. Dean collared Wingar. I asked Castle what he had got there? he said,</p>
               <p>"You know what I have got." I said I did not know, and asked him who they worked for? they said they had no employ. We took them both to the Anchor and Hope, into the back parlour. In going along he said he would tell me all about it. When I got into the parlour I put the bottle down, and while I was tying them together Castle said he would give me a 1 l. note, or anything to drink, to let them go, for they should lose their situations. They said they worked for Messrs. Gordons, of Goswell-street. Directly as I secured them, Castle seized the bottle, stamped it on the floor, and broke it all to pieces; the contents were all spilt. They said they had it from their masters' premises, but it was for a sick man. I saw them in possession of it in Middlesex.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Pancras. On the 28th of February, I saw the prisoners and another going along Suffolk-street, knowing them all, I followed them - Asquith had a bundle, he set off running as soon as he saw me; the others did not run at first. I followed and Asquith dropped the bundle as he turned the corner, I picked it up. Taylor took Smith, the next day he was discharged from Hatton-garden office. I took Asquith myself - they were both together. I found a leg of mutton in the bundle, which the prosecutor claimed; there is a particular mark on it. I am a butcher myself.</p>

            . On the 26th of February, between eight and night o'clock, I lost a very large leg and chine of mutton, from my shop, which is at the corner of Skinner-street; I saw it safe about six o'clock, it then hung on a hook outside the shop. Teasdale afterwards shewed it to me; it was a particular sort of mutton - the chine had been taken away then.</p>

I missed the veal, went there about a quarter-past seven o'clock, and found the three prisoners there - Richards was not with them. I asked them if they had seen Richards? they said they had not, and I returned home; Chambers then told me the meat had been stolen. I returned between ten and eleven o'clock with the officer to Mullen's-rents, and found part of the veal boiling in the pot. Richards told me that night that the remainder was baked, and sent to Giltspur-street Compter. We took Duke and Chandler at the house, and they denied having seen the meat, but said nothing when it was found - I also found the cloth in the room. Dart was taken next morning. I took a post chaise, and apprehended Richards that evening at Brentford.</p>

            . I am a sweep, and live in Shire-court,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120069"/>Ship-yard. On Sunday morning, about nine or ten o'clock, Richards came to me, and said three persons had stolen some veal from the safe - he mentioned no names, but said he gave the apprentice the machine-cloth, and they went away with it. I persuaded him to go home, but he said if he did, he should get wallop'd. He told me his master came in as he was at breakfast, where they all lived, and he went up the chimney, and that he heard him come into the room. He said he should go to Brentford, which I told Lincoln.</p>

               <p>CHANDLER'S Defence. Richards owed me 6 d., which I went to him for, and asked him for a piece of cloth? he gave me the machine-cloth, and said it was of no use.</p>

The prisoner came to my house, on Thursday, the 9th of March, between four and five o'clock in the evening, and asked for lodgings - he was in the house all night. He had breakfast in a back room, and about ten o'clock he asked to go into the parlour to wait for a gentleman whom he expected to meet him there. During the time I went into the room and saw the watch there on the mantle-piece, where I am in the habit of keeping it. It was a silver watch - it had a ribbon, two keys, and a seal to it. He staid there an hour and no one came - he went out and said he should return again before one o'clock. I immediately went into the parlour and missed the property. I ran after him, and saw him running - I called to him to stop for I would have him, and he did. He came back without any force. When we had got back he gave up the watch without any officer. I sent for an officer.</p>

I had been informed by a young man that the prisoner had taken a pint pot from some person in the neighbourhood - I went after him into Portman-square. I asked him what he had in his basket? he said nothing. I took hold of him and brought him to my house - I searched and found the two pots on him. One has my name and sign on it, and the other has Mr. Hunt's.</p>

            . I live in Dog-street, Rosemary-lane. I was in Osbourn-street, when Mr. M'Queen was robbed. I saw three persons together. I was crossing from the corner of Church-street to Booth-street, and heard a little of their conversation. I am not certain that either of the prisoners were part of the three - one of them said,</p>
               <p>"Will you stick to me?" They answered they would as close as the shirt to his back. About five minutes after I saw two of them make a rush upon Mr. M'Queen - they both came up to him. I did not see what they did at the time - they lugged away the lady from his arm, and something from him. Mr. M'Queen ran about half-way down Booth-street, and fell down, and I fell likewise. I got up immediately. I lost sight of him till he (Harrison), was in custody at the watch-house. I cannot say that he was one of them. In going to Worship-street, on the Saturday, I saw Dyson there, I said I thought he was one of the party, and he was taken into custody.</p>

            . I live at No. 132, St. Martin's-lane. I saw three persons round the shop - one of the party (the prisoner), was at my window. They all went to Mr. Gordan's window together - then I saw the seal move in the window. I then went out and laid hold of the prisoner, the other two made their escape. He then dropped the seal, I delivered the same to Miss Gordon.</p>

On the 16th of March, about eleven or twelve o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought a sample of liquorice-root, and offered it for sale - he said he had about two hundred weight at 50 s. a hundred.

            , or some name very similar to that. I knew they did not grow liquorice there. After sometime we said we would take it - he was to bring it on the Saturday following, the 18th. After he left I went, made enquiry, and had a police-officer in waiting. On Saturday morning he came between eight and nine o'clock, with the liquorice in a cart, which had the name of</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. He produced it publicly - A. Yes. He said he grew it himself. When he was taken he did not say Armstrong employed him to sell it. It is of that sort called runners, and only fit to grow again, and is never sold.</p>

            . I am an herbalist in Covent-garden. On the 16th of March the prisoner called on me, said he had two hundred weight of liquorice to dispose of, and would take 50 s. per hundred. He said he grew it himself at Norwood, and had a little more in the ground. He produced a sample, and said being short of money he would take 10 s. less. I had my suspicious, and declined buying it. On the Saturday following I saw it at Dixon's, and directly knew it to be Mr. Moore's, of Mitcham. It was tied with pitched string. I knew he always tied his that way, and from its general appearance I knew it to be his. It is worth 60 s. a hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know Mr. Moore grew liquorice - A. Yes, I have bought a quantity of him. I speak to its being his more from the root itself than the mode of tying it - there is a vast difference in the growth. I do not know that Overton is a grower - he has ran away. I am sure the prisoner said he grew it himself at Norwood.</p>

            . I live at Mitcham. On the 18th of March the prisoner applied to me to lend him a cart, and said he wanted to fetch some things for his wife, and boxes from Clapham.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the prisoner worked for Armstrong - A. Never. I knew Overton had about two acres of ground, and have seen some liquorice-root in it, but it was a very small young root, and what they call runners. I have heard he has run away. I never saw Armstrong and the prisoner together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know much about liquorice-root - A. Very little. That which grows on Mr. Moore's ground is very different from runners. They are too young to bring to market.</p>

The prisoner had been discharged several months before the robbery, but some of the family are still with me. In the month of March I had many tons of liquorice-root in the store-house fit for sale. On the 19th of March I heard of the robbery, looked at my store, and perceived some was gone - I thought 4 cwt. was gone. I had sold none after the 15th. I saw the liquorice at Dixon's, and have no hesitation in saying it is mine - it is four years old, and I never heard of any grower growing it four years, except myself - two or three years is the common time. Runners are what the root is propagated from - they are not fit for consumption, except to plant, and are very seldom sold.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner continue to live at Mitcham - A. He lived nearly opposite to me, and was in my house that day; he came backwards and forwards almost every day. I sold the liquorice for 60 s. or 70 s. per cwt. It was kept in a bed of earth near my house, about five inches deep.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your bailiff here - A. No, not on behalf of the prosecution - I took the prisoner up myself. He is in Court. I can swear to the liquorice, to the materials with which it is tied, and the colour of the soil. I have seen every crop in England, and never saw any like my own - it has a whiter hue than any other; it is grown in a marly soil.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had Armstrong any ground at Mitcham - A. Yes; he shewed me all his crop the day before he absconded - it was by no means fit for market, and his soil is quite different from mine; it is as different from mine as it can be. His was only two years' growth - he had been there but two years.</p>

On the 15th of April, about twelve o'clock, I was called into the kitchen by the screams of the servants, and followed the prisoner up the area steps into Russell-square, and up Bedford-place. I again caught sight of him in the field by Tavistock-square - he got over the fence into the square. I called Stop thief! at the end of the square - he was stopped by a stranger. From the time I first saw him he was never out of my sight. I collared him, and brought him back to the house. The servant brought me up a pair of salts. Nothing was found on him belonging to me.</p>

            . I was going down Bedford-place about a quarter past twelve o'clock, and saw the prisoner running in a direction from Mr. Henry's house. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw him throw two salt-cellars down, I picked them up, and gave them to Mr. Henry's servant. I am sure he is the man. I only lost sight of him in turning the corner.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the warehouse on the morning of the robbery - A. I was called up about three o'clock in the morning of the 29th of February, I went to the warehouse, and observed the door leading to the yard open, and a skeleton key in the lock - it appeared they had entered there. I found a crow-bar on the premises; the door was left open. The door leading into Stonecutter's-alley was opened; the bar had been removed inside, it must have been opened inside. There is no access to the yard without getting over the wall, which is about ten feet high - there were marks on it, as if some person had climbed over. I missed three pieces of army cloth, in all about one hundred and thirteen yards. I saw them at Worship-street two days afterwards, and knew them to be ours.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Gate-street; the door of the prosecutors' workshop is in my beat. I tried it at nine and at twelve o'clock, it was safe then. Just before three o'clock in the morning I went up the alley, and saw some men pass by me in Stonecutter's-alley, at different times, and went towards Weston's-park, then up the mews again, and made a run. I wondered what was going to be done. I took my lanthorn, walked gently, and looked down Weston's-park, I there saw the back of a coach, it was yellow - there is a hackney-master lives at the upper end of the park. I went on the left hand, came to Mr. Dolan's warehouse door, and found it open; I then saw a parcel of cloth strewed about the yard by the door. When I got to the door, I saw the coach driving off in a direction towards Searle-street. I immediately sprung my rattle, and went round to Lincoln's Inn-fields. When I came round the corner two watchmen stood there; I desired them to follow the coach - it drove furiously away when I sprung my rattle, and I never got up to it.</p>

            . I attend Spitalfields-market, and usually go to business about five o'clock. On Tuesday morning, the 29th of February, about half-past six, I saw a coach in Dorset-street - it was a yellow-bodied coach, and stood before an alley. I took notice of it, as my father supposed there had been a robbery, and saw six or seven young men round it - I noticed two or three of them, and should know them again; I could distinguish Pitt, Dodd, Prussia, and Simpson, and the coachman, which was Hewitt, the prisoner. They stood round the coach, I watched them about a quarter of an hour; then Pitt, who had a white coat on, asked me if I knew where there was a public-house, for he wanted something to drink? I said I did not know of any being open. They found I was watching them, came to the coachman, and he drove round to the end of the alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he to pass the end of Crispin-street - A. Yes, to Little Paternoster-row. The men went up the nearer way and met the coach. I followed the men up the alley, and saw the coach right up at the end of the alley. Hewitt got off the box, opened the coach-door, and the men went up and took the cloth out. I think there were two or three more men than I have mentioned. It was woollen cloth. Pitt took one piece out of the coach, and went into Franklin's house, and the others followed with each a piece. I have known Franklin's house a long while. The coachman held the door open for them - the coach was emptied all at once. I did not see Franklin then, his house was not open - he keeps a little broker's shop, I have known him two or three years; the coach remained there. I went and told Gregory, the officer, what had passed; he ran down the court, and saw the men in the room; he sent for Armstrong. Gregory's house is eight or ten doors from Franklin's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Were not the shops open - A. There were none but potatoe-shops open. I was just by the coach, and saw them plainly - it was between dark and light. Franklin generally opens about half-past seven, or eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HONE. Q. You never saw Simpson before - A. No. I particularly noticed them all, and have no doubt of any of them.</p>

            . I am a cooper, and work at the corner of Little Paternoster-row. On the 29th of February, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was going to work, and saw the prisoner, Pitt, who had a light-coloured great-coat on; he came, and walked up Paternoster-row - a short man was with him, it was not any of the prisoners. Pitt went down the alley, and into Franklin's house, alone. I knew the house before, but did not know Franklin. I think the shop was open and the goods at the door. Pitt came out instantly with a blue coat on - he had taken his great-coat off. He walked down Paternoster-row, and was crossing over towards the Ten Bells; at that time I heard the noise of a coach - Gregory and others had stopped the coach. Pitt stood still; the man who was with him was a Jew - when Pitt left, the Jew joined him again. The coach was standing at the Ten Bells door, which is about two hundred yards from Franklin's - it could have got within twenty yards of his house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Franklin's shop was open - A. Yes, and a few goods before the door. I think he was putting the window up; he was not out at the door when Pitt went in.</p>

            . I am a potatoe-salesman, and lodge with my brother in Spitalfields. In consequence of what I was told, between six and seven o'clock in the morning. I went up Little Paternoster-row, and saw Pitt, Dodd, Simpson, and Prussia inside Franklin's door - the shutters were down then. I saw a coach, which was No. 13, standing at the bottom of Little Paternoster-row. I then went and informed my brother, returned, and found the coach at the Ten Bells, and the coachman at the coach-door. It remained there till about twelve o'clock, and then drove away. I ran and saw an officer come up and open the coach-door, nobody was in it then. I immediately ran to Franklin's house, went in, and saw five or six men in the back-room behind the shop, Franklin was with them - they could see me. I stood there a minute or two, and the men ran out of the side-door into the yard; Franklin came into the shop. I followed them into the yard - they began to get over the wall into a farrier's yard, which communicates with the street. I ran round and saw Simpson, who had got over the wall into the farrier's yard. I saw the four prisoners, excepting the coachman and Franklin, in the yard. There were others, who got away. Simpson was immediately secured, and I took him to the watch-house, the others were also secured. I saw the cloth in Franklin's back-room, where the prisoners were. It was afterwards shewn to Mr. Dolan.</p>

I immediately sent for Armstrong and Van, and about half-past seven I saw Pitt go up to Hewitt, the coachman, and speak to him, he then drove on, and was going to turn his coach back to Franklin's; I followed, called two constables to take him, and I secured Pitt, who was taken to the watch-house. As I came out of the watch-house Armstrong came up, he and I went to Franklin's, and found the cloth in the room behind the shop - it was not at all concealed, and under the cloth was found a white great-coat.

            . I apprehended Dodd in Union-street, leading to Bishopsgate-street. I had heard the alarm, and saw him come out of the farrier's yard. I pursued<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120075"/>him, calling Stop thief! - he had a stick in his hand, another person attempted to secure him, he struck him with it. I secured him, and took from his pocket a tobacco-box, containing tinder, and a knife, which appeared to have been used as a steel.</p>

            . I am a headborough. Pitt was brought to the watch-house. When Dodd and Simpson were brought in I observed them frequently putting their hands to their pockets, as if they wanted to get away something. I searched Dodd, and found two centre-bits on him, and Chapman found a tinder-box and knife on him; the knife appears to have been used as a steel, and the tinder was fresh made. I found two flints on Simpson, and some list.</p>

            . As I was taking Hewitt to the office, he said he would not be hurt for others who had hired him, and that Simpson hired him at Charing-cross a little after two o'clock in the morning, and brought him to the corner of Gate-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, a little way up the street on the left hand, which is Stonecutter's-alley; that they brought the cloth from the alley - he could not tell from where they brought it out, but they brought it round the corner, and that he drove up and down the Strand till the watch went off.</p>
               <p>PITT'S Defence. A Jew fetched me to Franklin's to ask what the cloth was worth a yard; another person was with him, whom I took for one of Franklin's lodgers - I said it was worth about 5 s., a yard, and went away with the lodger and the Jew to the Ten Bells. Some persons were running - I believe Gregory was running after the men who belonged to the cloth. The boy pointed to me, and they seized me, and took eight 1 l. notes from me.</p>
               <p>DODD'S Defence. I was in Union-street, and heard' the cry of Stop thief! a man stopped me, I said I was not the thief, and he let me go. I was afterwards taken again.</p>
               <p>PRUSSIA'S Defence. I saw a number of people going down French-alley, they said there was some stolen property in the house. I went round the yard to assist in taking the men, and in about ten minutes several people came and took me.</p>
               <p>FRANKLIN'S Defence. I knew nothing of the property having been stolen. It was brought to my place by the desire of Pitt, and I believe these to be the men who brought it, except the coachman. I did not know what sort of goods were coming.</p>

I watched them all three together into the fields, almost a quarter of a mile off. I saw them hide it in a hedge in the fields, and then all three went away - I went, and told Mr. Lancaster, my master, and we both went about an hour and a half after I told him. He told me to watch to see if they returned, which I did for an hour, but nobody came. I went into another field, from which I could see if they came. I saw the men after they were taken into custody by Lancaster - the sack laid in the same place. A person, named Westman, carried it away - I knew Pizzey before; I was a schoolfellow of his.

I found the sack when I got up to them, which contained lead - they resisted. I told them I stopped them for taking a sack and bundle away from Harris's house. They said they had taken nothing.</p>

I fitted the lead to Mr. Amer's house, over the door, and it tallied with the shape of the roof - it was ripped off. It weighed about 60 lbs. The sack belongs to Burrows.</p>

            . I live at Twickenham. On the 9th of February, I was going by some stables belonging to Messrs. La Costes', about two o'clock in the daytime, and heard some one say,</p>
               <p>"All is right." At that instant Mullard came out of the stable door, (I do not know of their being Messrs, La Costes') - Mullard opened it to come out; Tidey was at the door too, walking about. I saw Mullard with something in his apron, which upon my looking, I saw to be about a peck of oats. I knew him before; he is in the hardware line - he was going towards his own stables In passing by I looked down, and then saw the oats. I ran towards the King's Head, and was informed that Messrs. La Costes were the owners, and they knew of it. On the 26th, as I accompanied Mr. La Coste to the Magistrate, Tidey was going at the same time, I heard him acknowledge to Mr. La Coste, his stealing the corn, and selling it to Mullard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. They were both close to the stable when,</p>
               <p>"All right" was uttered. Tidy was about three yards from the stable when it was said.</p>

One Monday in March, I saw a person named Coleman, walking about the buildings - he had no right to be there; I watched him on several other occasions. On this occasion he got out of my sight, and I found some lead secreted in a dark part of the buildings, which could not be seen without a light. I know where the lead was taken from. Before the prisoner was taken I saw the lead fitted to the tank.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody in the court-yard; he was in company with Goulden - this was on the 15th. On Tuesday or Wednesday, I was on the watch, and about half-past nine o'clock I saw them come into Albany west door steps, where I had seen the lead laying; they both returned, and the lead was concealed by Johnson in his jacket under his arm. Gouldin walked fast; Johnson was standing, and I took him into custody, but Goulden escaped. I did not know the lead belonged to the Albany but by its being there. I stopped him in the court-yard.</p>

I missed the things on the 16th, they were in my portmanteau. I went to bed about ten o'clock, he was there, and it was safe; I saw the prisoner when I awoke at half-past six o'clock dressed - the morning before he got up at seven. He went out and never returned to the house. I got up at half-past seven o'clock, and missed my shirt and money. We took him between one and two o'clock the same day, and he declared he had not done it. I found the three farthings on him, one was new, and notched round the edge, and the other was an old one worn whitish.</p>

            . I was standing in Fitzroy-place, and saw the prisoner run through the court with a caddy under his arm. The servant came up and asked me if I had seen a man go by with a caddy? I said, Yes. I ran on before her and got sight of him - the dog had then hold of him. He had not got the caddy under his arm then - he dropped it, and I picked it up and gave it to her. He was about ten yards from me when I saw the dog lay hold of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was going towards the fields - A. Yes; running - and when he returned he was walking. I never knew him before. I saw his face as he was running through the court - they called after him, and he turned round. I am sure he is the man that dropped the caddy. He was absent about a minute - he ran behind some houses and returned walking.</p>

I did not sit above two minutes there. She then went out - there was no other person on the same side as I sat. On the other side of the box there was a millwright. When I went out of the door she was there, and asked me to go home with her, which I refused. She then snatched my watch, and ran up a court; I ran after her, when two men came up and knocked me down. I went home and washed myself, being bruised, and described her to an officer, who apprehended her the same evening. The watch was afterwards brought to my house by a child, but not the seal. I am sure the prisoner is the woman, I have seen her before.</p>

About six o'clock, I found her at the Blakeney's-head - I told her the charge, which she denied. He was not intoxicated, for he gave a clear account of the affair and of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>"No, I never sold oats yet, and will not begin now." He said,</p>
               <p>"Why, you do not put every thing down." I said Yes, I did. He said then I was a fool, but if I put them down he must deliver them. I entered them in the book - he took away seventeen five-bushel sacks of oats.</p>

On Tuesday, the 23d of March, in consequence of suspicion, I marked the money in the till about eleven or twelve o'clock in the day, and went out about eight at night; I returned about eleven o'clock - the till was not locked - he was my only shopman. I do not know how much money there was in the till. When I came home he was in bed. I did not charge him with the offence till Wednesday night after he had shut up. I then took him up stairs, and asked him what change he had in his pockets? he said he had only one or two shillings. I asked him if he had not got to the amount of a guinea? he said No. I then said,</p>
               <p>"William, you have been robbing me - I know better," he made no reply. I said,</p>
               <p>"Come, pull it out," and he immediately pulled out 22 s. 6 d. marked, four or five were unmarked. I told him he had increased his stock since last night - he said nothing. There was always sufficient money in the till to give change. On Tuesday night he asked me for 2 s. 6 d., which I owed him, and said he had not got one shilling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. He sometimes gave the customers change out of his own pocket - A. Never. We had above 16 l. in silver in the till all that day. I sent for the prisoner's father, and allowed him to go away with him, on his father's promise that he should return next day. My loss is above 300 l.</p>

I thought I saw him cross the street, I turned round, and saw the prisoner, Smith, she immediately pushed her hand into my right-hand breeches pocket, and took out a 1 l. note and 5 s. 6 d., and ran into No. 6; the 5 s. 6 d. was wrapped in the note. I followed her into the house, and laid hold of her by her wrist - she handed the money over her shoulder to the other prisoner, who was in the room - (she was not present when it was stolen.) I found it was a bad house. I was going to secure them both, they cried out, and about a dozen more women came in with one man, struck me, cut my eye, rescued them, and beat me out of the house. I fetched a constable and returned, but could find neither of them. In about a quarter of an hour I saw Smith about a hundred yards from the place, and the constable took her - I am positive she is the woman. Wyley came to her at the watch-house, and was secured.</p>

On the 5th of April the prisoner came to the door, and staid looking at the breeches which hung there, he then unhooked them off the nail, but they still hung on a line. He went out and touched a woman, they both came together to the door, he took them off, and put them under the woman's shawl; she went off, and he came into the shop, and produced a pair of shoes to pledge. I ran by him, and caught the woman in Golden-square with the breeches; I brought her back, and made her produce them. I told her the prisoner was the man who took them. He still remained there, as he did not know I was gone after the woman. I went for an officer, and our foreman let the woman go.</p>

On the 4th of April, at half-past four o'clock in the morning, I went to work in Norfolk-street, and left her asleep. I returned about eight o'clock in the evening, and missed these things off my box by the bed side - she was not at home then. She slept with me. She came home in a half an hour very much in liquor, and abused me very much - she had my bonnet on her head, and my shoes on her feet. I asked her where my things were, and told her if she had pledged them to give me the duplicates. She said she would not, but she would bring them home as she liked. I got a constable who took her. Some duplicates were found on her at the watch-house that related to my property.</p>

I saw a person come to the corner of the house - two persons came to the end of the building; then the man whom I saw at the corner came to them and gave a whistle. I saw the prisoner put something on his shoulder - he came across the street with the marble on his shoulder. I followed, collared him, and told him he had stolen it from the new building. He said he picked it up coming across Moorfields. I told him I saw him take it up at the corner of the building. Several more came up and said they saw him find it.</p>

I asked her what she had got? she said a blanket, but I saw it was a coat and a piece of beef, and stopped her - there was no watch found on her. When I had taken her to the watch-house we searched her room, but found nothing; the bed had not been laid upon. We afterwards went to a room in Sugar-loaf-court, where a companion of her's lodged, and found the prosecutor. We asked him if he had lost anything? he said he did not know. We asked him what clothes he had? he said a great coat and a body coat. As he was getting up he said he had lost his watch, went to the watch-house, and claimed the coat.</p>

             I attended two ladies to see the chairing in the Haymarket, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I left the ladies there in a coach, and went to Charing-cross on business; on my return, in about a quarter of an hour, a young man passed before me, and made a snatch at my watch - he got it - it had also two seals; I seized him immediately, and held him about half a minute, when I was surrounded by a gang of them. They took him from me after a great resistance. The prisoner bit my thumb; he is not the person who took my watch, but he was one of the party - there were about twelve of them; they came up immediately, and the prisoner bit my finger, which made it bleed freely. I called out for assistance, but there was such a gang of them that the people were afraid to come and help me. I kept hold of the prisoner - they turned out my pockets, and kicked me. I did not lose anything else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You were in the crowd - A. No, I was not in the crowd at all - it was in <placeName id="t18200412-213-crimeloc1238">Cockspur-street</placeName>

When I went before the Magistrate I only charged him with an assault, and through the solicitation of his father he was held to bail. After that I went before the Grand Jury, and preferred a charge of felony. I told them the same story I have told you.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason, after you preferred a charge of assault, that you went before the Grand Jury - A. I heard that he was a bad character. I believe he was found at his own dwelling.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is the prisoner the man who bit your hand - A. Yes. He bit the hand that I held the other by, to induce me to let him go.</p>

            . I am an officer, and live in Coventry-court, Haymarket. I saw two men holding the prisoner, and calling for an officer. Mr. Mayne told me that he had been robbed by a gang - his hand was bit; they did not attempt to molest me. I said he had bit the gentleman's hand. He said the gentleman had nearly choaked him, and he bit him to make him let go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was all over before you came up - A. Yes. When the complaint was made at Marlborough-street Office, the prisoner was remanded for re-examination. He was charged with the same offence as he is now, but there was some little difference on the second examination. The prosecutor did not appear quite so sure of his being the man. He was, with the approbation of the prosecutor, committed into custody for an assault.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he ever say that the man only struck him, or that he was one who attempted to rescue the other - A. He said he tried to rescue the other.</p>

On the 14th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked to look at some black silk handkerchiefs; I shewed him some, he wished to see some smaller. He said he had not money sufficient, and would call on Monday and buy them; the price was 4 s. 6 d. While I was looking for the smaller ones he took the three handkerchiefs and put them into his breeches-pocket. I let him go out of the shop, then went after him immediately, and brought him back. He pulled them out of his pocket; they were all in a piece.</p>

            . I live in Cumberland-street, Middlesex Hospital, and am a shoemaker. I was drinking in the house. I was not there when the prisoner came in - the prosecutor was not sitting by him. When I came in he appeared quite sober, and I saw Saunders drinking with him - I drank likewise with him, and we had not more than a pot of beer each. I was there when he lost his money, and was on the opposite side of the box. Saunders was the only one that sat on the same side with him, no other person could set next to him on the other side. Saunders was on the left side of Vercolme. I observed Vercolme get change at the bar, and did not see Stone; I must have seen him if he had been there.

            . I am the gate-keeper. On Wednesday, the 23d of February, a few minutes before one o'clock, I saw the prisoner walking along with some shavings under his arm, coming from the back part of the building. I asked him who gave him the shavings? he said, a man had given them to him. I then saw part of a garment in the shavings, and asked him what he had got there? he said it was a jacket he had bought of a man. I detained him, and sent for the carpenters, and the prosecutor owned them.</p>
