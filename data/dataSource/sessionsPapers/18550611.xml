                  </hi>. I am a shorthand writer at this Court I was present at the trial of Charles Mallett, and took down the evidence of Louisa Harrison; I do not remember the person of the defendant—I have here the evidence she gave—it is contained in the Sessions Paper; I have my original notes here—I corrected the press from them; it is correct—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "I am the wife of Edward Harrisson, a carpenter; we live at No. 2, Bull Inn yard, Aldgate, right opposite the tap, which shows a light upon our door, and the gas light lights ail over our kitchen; the house consists of a kitchen below, and three rooms over it I occupy all but the middle room, which is occupied by a lodger, Mrs. Blower, a laundress—I have two chil<lb/>dren, one is fourteen months old, and the other four years—there are two long muslin curtains and a blind to the kitchen window, which looks into the yard, but they are quite thin; anybody can see through them—I assist my husband by taking in dress and mantle making—last Monday week, about half past 6, or a quarter to 7 o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in the parlour, the ground floor room; I had a lamp, and there was also a</p>

               <p>good fire which gave some light—I saw a person looking in at the window, as if he was reading my name as dress and mantle maker, which is on a sign board in the window, and directly afterwards I heard a gentle knock at the door; I went to the door, and saw the prisoner with a bundle—he asked if Mrs. Harrisson was in; I said, 'I am Mrs. Harrisson'—he said, 'I have brought you some work from my sister'—I asked him into the parlour to see what work it was he had—I went in and he followed me, and shut the door after him, and the parlour door also—the light was on the table close to the door; he put out the light and said, 'Now I want your money'—I said, 'I have none'—he touched the outside of my dress, and my money jingled in my pocket—I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, loose in my pocket—he dragged my pocket out, took all the money out, threw the coppers on the floor, and left them there—he then struck me on the nose, and the blood flew on to the bosom of his shirt; I then fell with my head against the corner of a chair, and then he dragged me across to the other side of the room and struck me at the back of my head with a large stick of my husband's, and left me on the floor unable to speak—then he went to the other end of the room, took two pistols out of his pocket, put them on the table, and said, that if I hallooed out he would kill the baby, which was lying asleep—he cut each end of the line which was hanging in the room, tied my hands together with it, and then dragged me to the other side of the room, <hi rend="italic">jammed</hi> me in between two chairs, and left me—the eldest child then began to scream—the prisoner went upstairs, came down again, and the children were then both screaming; he went out of doors; and I saw him look over the short blind as he went by the window—I was then on the floor, unable to make any alarm—my eldest child ran over to the tap, and gave an alarm, upon which two men came to me, and afterwards the police, and a medical gentleman—in the course of that even<lb/>ing I gave a description to the police of the person who had attacked me; and on the following evening I went, at the request of the police, to a penny theatre, about 300 yards from our house—I went into the pit alone, and saw the prisoner standing by the orchestra with a short pipe in his mouth, and the same handkerchief and trowsers as he had on before; it was a white handkerchief with large blue or green spots; I believe blue—I felt quite certain that he was the man, and I feel quite positive now; I went out directly and spoke to the police, and they went in and took him into cus<lb/>tody—I had seen him before, on the Wednesday before this happened, that is three weeks to-day; I was coming from the Metropolitan Hospital with my children, and saw the prisoner near the Exchange with some handker<lb/>chiefs, which were not new, and one of which he asked me to buy for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., then for 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; but in consequence of what a woman who was with me said to me, I did not buy it—I did not stand still, I was going on, and the prisoner followed me—I had an opportunity of observing his features; he was five or ten minutes in my sight on that occasion, and he was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour in my parlour on that night.</p>

On Monday evening, 11th Dec., I was in the tap; it is nearly opposite Mrs. Harrisson's house—Coster, the porter, was also in the tap, and several more—about half past 6, or a quarter to 7 o'clock, Mrs. Harrison's little girl came in and said something about her mother—in consequence of that, I went across, into Harrisson's house, and Coster also—I took a light with me—I went into the parlour—Coster had got in before me—when I got in I saw Mrs. Harrisson sitting on Coster's knee—he was sitting on a chair—she had got her hands tied—she was bleeding from the left temple—she did not appear to be sensible—I undid the rope from her hands—Mr. Cook, the surgeon, and a policeman, came, and I then left her—I did not hear her say anything.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the child came, you say she 'appeared alarmed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she ran across the yard, very much in a hurry, crying out, "Police!"—she was not crying, but she was hallooing, making a noise—she seemed quite frightened—there were no tears that I saw—I went over in a hurry—I could not notice whether she was crying or not, being rather frightened—I had not heard anything before the child came across—I was sitting down in the tap room—the door opens into the yard—there was not much noise in the tap room, it was all pretty quiet—the tap room window is right opposite Mrs. Harrison's—the width of the yard is only enough for one <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> to go up and down, not to turn; it is very narrow; there is just room enough for the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> besides the pavement—Mrs. Harrison's parlour opens into the yard, and the window also—there are no back rooms to the house—I did not hear any scream or any noise—no one told me that she was</p>

                  </hi>. I am office porter at the Bull Inn, Aldgate. On Monday evening, 11th Dec, I was in the tap room which is in Bull Inn-yard, nearly opposite the prisoners house; with about two steps across, you can get from one door to the other—the Barking omnibus has gone from that office for some years—on this evening, "Barking" was hallooed out, but whether it was the omnibus or the Barking cart I cannot tell—at the time "Barking" was hallooed out, the prisoner's little girl was in the taproom; it was then about half-past 6 o'clock, but I cannot say exactly because the coaches and omnibuses do not start exactly to a moment, but half-past 6 o'clock is the time; it never goes before the time—after the little girl came in, I went over and found Mrs. Harrisson lying on the floor between two chairs, with her wrists tied together, on her back, but not quite flat—she could not assist herself in getting up, but her head was not on the ground—her legs were straight out, and she was on her back, but the chair on the off side could not separate from the other because there was a table there, and she could not get right down on her back—I did not observe whether her back was against anything—I picked her up imme<lb/>diately, and sat her on my lap—I called directly for help, and Harvey came in with a candle; there was a fire in the room—her wrists were tied; I did not observe how far they were apart—Harvey untied them—they were not touching—the knots were on top of the cord to the best of my belief, but I had quite enough to do to take care of her without looking after the cord—I saw blood on the right side of her head, as she lay on my left arm—as soon as I got relieved from her, I went for her husband, Mr. Cook, the surgeon, was there when I went.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook at the Bull Inn, Aldgate. On Monday evening, 11th Dec, I was in an upstairs room there, which is opposite Har<lb/>risson's house—there were a great many people in the yard, outside Harris<lb/>son's house, and I heard a great talking—I ran down directly, and as I went down it was 20 minutes to 7 o'clock by the clock on the stairs—I went over to Harrisson's house, went in directly and found in the parlour, Coster, the porter, from the office, Harvey, and Mrs. Harrisson, who was lying in Cos<lb/>ter's arms—she appeared to be not quite conscious at the time I went in—Harvey was beginning to untie her hands, and I helped to untie them—I asked her where her husband was, and after a little time she said that he was at the Garrick Theatre, and I sent for him—this was at the time we were untying her hands—she was bleeding from her nose and the side of her face, and she had a scratch on her forehead—her hands were tied about four or five inches apart—Harvey had loosened the knot when I went in, but it was tied in the middle—that might have loosened it—shortly after this a policeman named Little came, and I heard him ask her what had happened—I heard what she told him, she was sensible then—after a time her husband came; he seemed very much excited, and said, "Oh dear, the man could not tell me;" that was the man that went for him—I told him what she had said; she had told Little that a man had come to the door and knocked, and asked if Mrs. Harrisson was at home, as he had some work from his sister; that she said that she was Mrs. Harrisson, and he asked her for her money; that she said that she had none, and he cut her pocket, and took the money—I repeated all that to her husband, and he said, "She told me at tea time she was sure something would happen be<lb/>fore night, for she had had a dreadful dream"—she must have heard that—and I heard her say the same, she repeated it after her husband said so—after Mr. Cook, the surgeon, came, I stayed some time with her, and assisted in getting her on to the sofa, and sent Coster for her husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of No. 140, Minories. On Wed<lb/>nesday, 11th Dec, in consequence of information, I went to No. 2, Bull Inn yard, between half past 6 and 7 o'clock, I found Mrs. Harrisson sitting on a man's lap, insensible and unable to speak—there was no candle, the room was lighted by the fire—a candle was brought, and she was then removed to the sofa—she was bleeding from the nose, and there were two abrasions on her right temple, and a contused wound on the back of her head—it was as if the temple had been rubbed against something rough—I bathed her face with vinegar and water, and as soon as she came to herself I gave her a little brandy and water, washed the blood from her nose, and sponged the abrasions and the wound on the back of the head with warm water—the wounds might have been made by herself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you the gentleman who was examined on the part of the prosecution on the former occasion, when this young woman was a witness and the person was convicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am—I did not on that occasion say that the wounds might have been made by herself—the question was not asked me—I have been asked the question now for the first time—I was asked it at the Mansion House; when I say the first time, I mean since this case has been investigated—I think it is quite competent for anybody to strike the head against any hard substance—it was a contused wound—there was blood from it—there was an abrasion of the skin, and a contusion all around it—I might myself knock my head against a desk, and it might produce a contused wound; I think it might have been done in that way—I have never met with such an instance—the idea of her doing it herself, never occurred to me till the second case—I now say that such a thing is possible—I have been out of Court to-day but I have heard of the mode in which the prisoner's hands were supposed to have been tied—assuming all those facts to be true, it would have been impossible for her to have inflicted that blow; if she did, she must have done it first and tied her hands afterwards—no place was pointed out against which she could have knocked her head—a stick was produced on the last trial with some blood on it—it was also produced on the same night at the house—it is possible that she could have inflicted the wound herself with the stick at the back of her head, but I should think it improbable—I attended her during the evening up till 12 o'clock—she was in the family way, about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110007"/>
               <p>three months gone, she told me—she had a convulsive fit which lasted about five minutes—a doctor cannot be <hi rend="italic">done</hi> by a sham convulsive fit, if he knows his business, and I know mine—it was some time after I came in before she became sensible—she recovered gradually—she gave those evidences of confusion which always attend fits—she looked round—a practised surgeon cannot be <hi rend="italic">taken in.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The pulse is the best indication, is not it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and she was almost pulseless for half an hour, from the time I came in and found her in a fainting state—I got there about a quarter to 7 o'clock, and five minutes after I arrived I had her removed to the sofa.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The blood was actually flowing from the back of her head when you saw her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not flowing, but it was a contused wound, and had a small quantity of blood on the surface—blood was flowing profusely from her nose—I observed no blood in any part of the room—her nose must have been struck before her hands were tied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any other mode of making the nose bleed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but I perceived a bruise next rooming between the top of the nose and the bridge—if she did it herself she must have done it previous to her hands being tied, I should consider—I saw no blood elsewhere—it does not follow that the blood would have spirted—I saw no blood on her hands—I can only tell from what she told me, whether the child had quickened or not—some quicken at four months, and some at four months and a half—taking her condition into consideration, an attack of this kind would be likely to produce a great effect upon her system—I should consider that she is not a person of an hysterical temperament—I never saw her before—supposing an attack of this kind occurred it would most probably affect the nervous system.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Taking that in connection with the action of pregnancy going on, might it have been very likely to produce hallucination? <hi rend="italic">A. I</hi> never had a case of that kind occur in my practice—it is sometimes the case under the ordinary circumstances of pregnancy that we find a woman excited, and not under that mental control which she is under when perfectly well, but it is not necessarily so—when you once get a diseased action on the nervous system it is very difficult to know what it will lead to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LOCKE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were called into this house were your suspicions excited in any way as to whether it was a true case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—by the second case I mean the occurrence which took place on 8th Jan., about a month afterwards—I heard that case investigated at the Mansion House—I first formed the opinion that it might have been done by herself on 8th Jan., the evening I was called to her at the Bull Inn yard the second time—she could not have inflicted that injury to the back of her head with her hands, if they were tied, but she could have done it by striking her head against something, the edge of any place—the corner of a mantel piece would have occasioned it, and if she had struck her nose against a place of that sort that would have occasioned the injury I saw on her nose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it be easy for a woman voluntarily to do it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it would require considerable force; but sometimes the nose bleeds violently with small blows—there was a small circular bruise on her nose sufficient to indicate a blow which would produce bleeding—I think it possible for the nose to bleed from an external blow which leaves no mark or bruise, for instance, a side blow—it is quite possible to produce bleeding by scratching some small vessel on the inside, but the whole mucous membrane was very</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110008"/>
               <p>much congested with blood, just as it would have been if the nose externally had received a blow, and that, together with the small bruise, led me to the conclusion that it was the effect of a blow—she was in a fainting state when I first entered, and almost pulseless.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You saw a stick on the trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was asked whether that sort of instrument might have inflicted the blow at the back of the head, and I expressed my undoubted opinion that it would—it was a blow of considerable severity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a person had been in convulsions, and had fallen among furniture, would that account for the blow and the wounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not for the whole of them—the state of fainting and convulsions might, in the con<lb/>dition she was in, have been occasioned, if she had made these injuries on herself—they were serious injuries; violent injuries—sometimes a blow on the head will have a great effect on the constitution, and would be more likely to have the effect if inflicted against the will than by the party, be<lb/>cause of the circumstance of terror.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it have been immediate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she could not have tied her hands afterwards while in convulsions—the injuries could not have been inflicted with her hands fastened, but she could have given herself a blow on the head with her hands tied.</p>

My real name is Simon Marriott—I have a brother named Jonathan Marriott—down to the time when I was taken into custody on Mrs. Harrisson's charge, I lived at No. 19, Old Rutland-street, Cannon-street-road, with my father and mother—I was getting my living at the penny playhouse, keeping order of a night, and likewise when I got a job at any of the docks I went to it—on Monday, 11th, and Tuesday, 12th Dec., I was employed at this penny theatre—I used generally to get there at 5 or half-past 5 o'clock, and staid till about 11 or half-past 11 o'clock—on Monday, 11th, I was at the theatre from a quarter past 6 up to 11 or after 11 o'clock—I came out twice to victuals—on the Tuesday evening, I was taken into custody in the theatre on Mrs. Harrisson's charge—I was committed on that charge, and tried in this Court on 20th Dec—I was found guilty, and judgment of death recorded against me—that sentence was altered to fifteen years transportation—upon my trial, the defendant, Louisa Harrisson, gave evidence against me—I have since received a free pardon, and have been entirely at liberty—I do not know the Bull Inn-yard, at Aldgate—I know it now since the trial; I did not know it before—I did not know it before Monday, 11th Dec, and had never been in it or seen it—though I have walked by it, I took no notice—I was not there on Monday, 11th Dec.—I first saw Mrs. Harrisson on the Tuesday night that I was taken to the station house, and I said she was mistaken—to my knowledge I had never seen her or known her before that Tuesday evening—I remember what she swore against me at my trial-there was no truth in it; I am quite innocent of it—on or about 6th Dec., I had no handkerchiefs to sell—I never tried to sell any handkerchief to her or any other person—sometimes I went to Billingsgate market to try to get work there, and sometimes I went to the docks—if I could not get work at the docks, I went to Billingsgate market; if I could not get it there I was at home till 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and sometimes I might be at the playhouse in the day, helping them to put the scenes up, if I had not got any other engagement—there is a shop in front of the theatre that the people must go through, in order to get to the theatre—in the course of the day I sometimes sit in that shop, when I have no other employment—I could be seen there by anybody passing along White-chapel—my duty at the theatre is to set the people down in their seats, and keep order—I was at the playhouse from 3 o'clock on the Monday afternoon—I stopped in the shop for a few minutes—a young man of the name of Tomlinson came to me and asked me if I would take a walk with him; that was a little time after I had been there—I said, yes, I would—I took a walk down the Mile End-road with Tomlinson—we got back as near as I could judge about half-past 4 o'clock, because we went after his clothes at a coffee shop in the new street near Leman-street—we then went back to the shop in front of the theatre; we got back about half-past 4 o'clock—we went to the theatre about 5 or a quarter past 5 o'clock—he thenreturned to his tea—I afterwards went into the Red Lion and Spread Eagle; that was about a quarter to 6 o'clock—I went in first alone—I saw</p>

               <p>several persons there—I cannot now recollect who they were—I saw the barman there; that was at a quarter after 6 o'clock—I cannot tell you his name—I staid there about five or six minutes—I did not notice the time exactly; I noticed the clock, and I observed to the barman that it was late, and I hurried away to the theatre—the theatre begins about half-past 6 o'clock, sometimes rather later—I got there before I was wanted—we generally open at a quarter or half-past 6 o'clock, and we light up directly—the performance begins about a quarter to 7 o'clock—I was by the orchestra; that is my usual place—I came out of the theatre again about five minutes to 7 o'clock, with a young man named Lawrence—we went into the Bed Lion and Spread Eagle, and had a glass of shrub and water—I staid there about three or four minutes—I then returned along with Lawrence into the playhouse again, and I staid till the performance came to an end; that was a little after 8 o'clock as near as I can judge—on the day I was taken into custody, I had on a white handkerchief, with spots on it; they were rather bluish spots and rather big ones—I had bought that handkerchief on the Sunday morning previous—I did not wear it on the Monday—I had it on the Tuesday—I had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on me when I wastaken into custody—I get sometimes 1., sometimes 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a night, at the theatre—I got the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by a benefit which I had taken on the Tuesday before, with another young man named Wood who was engaged there—I got a few shillings by it—I was never taken up on any charge before this—I was never at a police court before—I have never been discharged from any place for misconduct.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman; I live at No. 8, Green-court, Coleman-street. I rent two rooms there, the prisoner lived in the room above me with her parents—I had occasion to go to the cellar on the morn<lb/>ing of 25th May, between 7 and 8 o'clock; I found two books there, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> in the top of the wall between the rafters—I gave these books to the officer Green.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness. I am just turned twelve years of age—I have a younger brother, named William—I was playing in the cellar with him about three weeks ago—I saw two books upon a ledge by the side of the cellar—I took them down, and Thomas Burrison, the prisoner's brother, took them from me and put them under a cupboard in the inner cellar—in about a quarter of an hour afterwards, the prisoner asked me if I had seen the books—I said, "Yes," that her brother had taken them and put them under the cellar door—I afterwards saw two more books in the same place—that is about three weeks ago—I saw the prisoner bring something into the house under her apron—I do not know what it was—she took it down into the cellar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live at No. 31, Little Bell-alley. The prisoner brought me some books between three and four months ago—I bought one—this is it—she brought some that were so torn up I was obliged to send them to the mill—the work was the "Lancet"—I only bought this one book and those that were torn up—she came again, and brought this book—I asked her where she lived, and she said in Coleman-street, and her mistress sent her with this book—I said, "I shall not purchase it till your mistress comes"—she went away, and the book was in the drawer about three months, and when the policeman came and made inquiry I gave him the book directly—it is Griffiths's "Universal Formu<lb/>lary "—the prisoner did not say where she lived.</p>

               <p>were torn to pieces—there were a few copy books—I cannot recollect whether there was a copy book from which I tore the covers myself—the majority of the books that were torn up were the "Lancet"—there may have been a copy book or two—I did not take a copy book from her and tear the covers off and buy the rest—they were all intermixed—I never tore the cover off any book—I did not make out any memorandum of the waste paper; I did of the book which I bought—I did not about the book which I detained—I sent the waste paper to the mill—I did not send it direct to the mill, I sent it to a person who sends it to the mill—his name is Mr. Merrick—I very rarely buy waste paper of this description and send it to the mill—I buy clearings of counting houses—this was not anything better than clearings of counting houses—by the top I could see that it was the "Lancet"—I did not tell Mr. Bain that I sent it to Mr. Merrick—I told the policeman I sent it to the mill—I send small quantities to Mr. Merrick and he sends them to the mill—I did not know Mrs. Myring before this.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. You watched her, and always found her at her work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was ill when she came—I had not any one before her—I was ill one week—the prisoner was there till she was taken into custody—she was there all day—she might go out on errands, and would stay half an hour or three quarters when she might have gone in ten minutes—she might go for bread and cheese—I very rarely sent her out in the evening—there was a duplicate given up to me; that was of a plane I sent her to pawn—she was in the habit of going to the pawnbroker for her own parents before I sent her—I have sent her with other things—I sent her with a book of my husband's, which I afterwards fetched home; that might have been in May—it was "Peter Nicholson, on Staircase Work"—I dare say I may have sent her with something of wearing apparel—not with a coat; with a pair of trowsers of my husband's—he has more than one pair—that would not be on a Saturday night; more likely on a Monday or Tuesday—other gentlemen have offices there beside Mr. Baynes; Mr. Toppin and another gentleman—none of them sleep there—they go away about 5 o'clock, or from 5 till half-past 5 o'clock, and after that the rooms are left in my care—I sent this girl with three or four "Johnson's Dictionaries"—they were not my husband's; they were Mr. Stoughill's—that was not by Mr. Stoughills authority—I took his dictionaries, and sent them to pawn—if Mr. Stoughill had been there, I could have borrowed the money of him—I never sent a</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You knew there is a regulation about pawnbrokers not taking in things of persons under sixteen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She told me she had been in the habit of going—I remember Mr. Bain missing a book—he asked the prisoner about it, and she gave it him—she got it from my room—there were two books—I scolded her for giving them to Mr. Bain, because she had no right to go to my box—I never gave her an old account book to sell—I remember her coming back once and saying that if I had any covers, Mr. Palmer would buy them, and give her a halfpenny a pound for them—just before that she had had three pounds of waste paper of me; that was paper that was left in an office, and after the persons went away, the paper was brought to Coleman-street—I burnt the books as waste paper, but I took the covers off—they were old books that the gentleman had had in business—the prisoner sold the covers herself—it was about three years ago that those books came to me, and I took the covers off—the covers had been lying in a cupboard littering about—after she suggested that she could get a halfpenny a pound for them, she took the covers and sold them, but I did not get the money; I got some tea and sugar—I told her to get them, and she did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of a warehouse at Blackwall, the pro<lb/>perty of the Eastern Counties Railway Company. On Friday, 11th May, 100 hogsheads of pale ale were delivered out of the warehouse, some part of it in my presence—I saw some of it delivered into a lighter—Bol-ton had charge of the lighter—they were to be put on board a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Nugget</hi>. bound for Sydney; the casks appeared to be in good condition—Bolton was servant to the lighterman.</p>

Tooth's store to the I barge; I dare say it would take quite that number to roll them—they do not roll a great deal out of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had the ale been in the warehouse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell, we are receiving ale daily—I cannot say whether it had been there a month; I would not say it had not—four or five of Messrs. Tooth's men have access to the warehouse in which the ale was kept, they work there—I should say from 3,000 to 4,000 casks are kept there—perhaps twenty casks had been lying on the wharf for one night; there might have been fifty, I cannot say; I believe they were not lying there more than one night, I will not swear they had not—all the persons employed about the wharf had then access to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman in the service of the Eastern Counties Railway Company, at the pepper warehouse, Blackwall. On Friday, 11th May, from information I received, I followed a barge laden with hogsheads of ale—Bolton was the lighterman of that barge—I concealed myself in the engine house at the lower wharf, opposite where the barge was lying—I saw Arnall take a bucket from another barge and lot it down into the cabin—I did not see where Bolton was at that time—after it had been down some<lb/>time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110027"/>
               <p>Arnall went down—I do not know whether Bolton's barge had any name on it—I had watched that barge—Arnall remained in the cabin a very short time—he then came up, and they drew up the bucket—I could not see whether there was anything in it—he took it to another barge that was lying alongside, and put it down in the cabin—the bucket was open so that any one could see it—there was nothing on it but a piece of rope, by which it was let down into the cabin—I should say it was about a gallon bucket—after a short time the bucket was brought back again, and put down again into the cabin where the ale was; Arnall went down, and in a short time came up again, drew up the bucket again, and took it to the barge that was lying alongside, where he took the first one, and let it down into the cabin—this was from 1 or half past, till 3 o'clock—the second time the bucket was taken I saw Bolton put his head up out of the cabin—after Arnall had disposed of the second bucket I saw him go to another barge, he went down into the cabin and put up a gallon bottle—he put a coat round it, and took it aboard the barge where the ale was—he went down into the cabin, and in a short time it was brought up again—Bolton stood at the top and took it—I could not exactly see from where I stood, who put it up—Arnall took the bottle from the side of the cabin, and went to the barge where he had fetched it from—I could not see Bolton at that time, he was in the cabin—I saw him when the second bucket went down; some minutes elapsed before the bottle went down—Bolton could not have left the cabin without my seeing him—he had not left it between the time the bucket came up the second time and the bottle going down—after the bottle was put down I saw the bucket put down once more—that was by Arnall—it was brought away again—I then went and gave information to Mr. Steele; he was waiting at the stores—I then accompanied him on board the barge, and into the cabin where I had seen the bucket go down—I found nine persons there—that was not in Bolton's barge, but another barge where the ale was taken to—I first went on board Bolton's barge—the barge that the bottle was taken to was Arnall's own barge—I went there and placed Steele against the cabin—I did not go into the cabin then, I went on board the barge where the ale was taken in the buckets—I there found the nine persons—Bolton was there, and Arnall also—I am quite sure that I saw Bolton at the time when the bucket was being let down the second time—Arnall was not on board his own barge when I and Mr. Steele went on board it—I afterwards went on board his barge again; I did not find him there, I found Mr. Steele there, standing at the top of the cabin—I found a gallon bottle of ale in that cabin—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bottle—it is a similar bottle to the one I saw go down into the cabin of Bolton's barge.</p>

                  </hi>, I am foreman to Messrs. Robert and Alfred Tooth, brewers, of No. 14, Mincing-lane. On Friday, 11th May, I saw 100 hogs<lb/>heads of ale put on board a lighter; it was Messrs. Tooth's ale, which they were exporting—I saw it put on board the barge from the premises of the Eastern Counties Railway Company—Bolton had charge of the barge when it went out of the wharf—I saw that the hogsheads were in good condition, not leaky; they were filled up, and properly vented—I knew that Duce was watching—he afterwards fetched me, and we went aboard a barge; he told me to stay at the top of the cabin stairs, and see that no one went down or came up; he went elsewhere—he afterwards returned, went into the cabin, and brought up this bottle of ale; I tasted it; it contained Messrs. Tooth's ale—I have got here a sample from the hogsheads—it is the same quality and flavour; it is a peculiar ale—I afterwards went on board the lighter where the 100 hogsheads were—I found one hogshead lying on the top of the barge, which had had a spigot put in the head of it; I took the cask in my hand, and found it had been <hi rend="italic">ullaged</hi> considerably—there was no spile in it when it was sent out—the cask was lying on the deck, on the top of the 100 hogsheads, lying by itself—the spigot was broken off—I examined the other casks on the following day, and found that five had been spiled—I missed altogether fourteen gallons of ale from those five casks.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Glass House-buildings, Whitechapel, and am an unfortunate girl. On Monday night, 7th May, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was in the Blue Anchor public house—the prisoner and two More men were there, and all three of them accompanied me to my lodgings,</p>

I keep the rooms in Glasshouse-buildings, where the last witness lives—she is a girl of the town—on the night of 7th May she came to her room, with the prisoner, and two other gentlemen—the other two went away; they did not stop more than half an hour—the girls went to their own apartments—there are two rooms; I live in the first, and Julia White has to go through my room, which is the kitchen, to go into hers—I was called into the room by the prisoner—he gave me a shilling—I do not know where he took it from—the girl was in bed with him—I went to a public house with that shilling; it was refused—I brought it back to the prisoner, told him that it was bad, and he gave me another—he had them in cartridges—he was still in bed when he gave me the second shilling, and so was the girl—it was the prisoner that gave me both the shillings—I took the second shilling to another public house, and that was refused—I came back with it, and told him that it was bad—White then got up, went out, and called a policeman—I cannot tell what time it was then, but it was not very long after he gave me the first shilling; it was about 2 o'clock when I went for the first pot of beer.</p>

On Sunday evening, 20th May, about a quarter past 7 o'clock, I was in Tottenham Court-road, between Fitzroy-court and Grafton-street, and saw a cart being driven along; there were four men in it, three were sitting on the seat, and one behind—the prisoners are three of the men—Howard was driving—it was going at a very furious rate, the horse was galloping; it was on its wrong side of the road—it was about a yard and a half from the kerb when the accident hap<lb/>pened <hi rend="italic"/>; it was going towards Oxford-street—Howard lashed the horse as soon as it passed me—between Grafton-street and London-street I saw a female crossing the road, from the east to the west—I did not see her till the cart had actually got up to her—she seemed to hesitate, and the wheel of the cart apparently knocked her down, and ran over her head and body—I saw her fall, and the cart go over her—that was on the west side, the same side as Tottenham Court chapel—after that, Howard commenced lash<lb/>ing his horse as hard as he was able; he did not stop—I went in pursuit of him as fast as I was able; I had got a bad hip, I could not run very fast—I sent another constable in pursuit, and I left, and went back to the woman—I afterwards saw her in University Hospital.</p>

On 14th May I was living at No. 43, Clement's-lane, in the second floor back room; the prisoner lived in the front room on the same floor—on that day, William Maxfield, Hawkes, and some other persons, were taking tea with me—whilst we were at tea the prisoner came up stairs with a policeman—she had before that said that I had taken some of her children's frocks away—I cannot say whether anything had occurred before that—I believe that was the begin<lb/>ning of the disturbance—in the afternoon she brought up two policemen, and said I had forced her door open and taken some of her children's frocks—Hawkes and Maxfield were in my room at the time—my door was shut and the policeman and her were outside—I heard her tell the policeman this outside—the policeman asked me for a candle, I gave him one, and he went and looked at the lock, and said she was a very wicked woman for so saying, for nothing of the kind had been done, and the children's frocks had been taken off the stairs, and she had them in her hand at the time—she then went down with the policeman, and I shut my door as the policeman told me to do—about half an hour afterwards she came up again, and violently kicked against my door, and said, "I want that b—w—, Jane Holland; I will have her out of the room"—Maxfield got up, opened the door, and told her to be quiet—he had no sooner spoken the words than</p>

               <p>she <hi rend="italic">heaved</hi> a dish at him; it struck him. and knocked him down, and he bled a great deal—I saw her throw another dish, which struck Hawkes on the forehead—I picked Maxfield up, and took him to the hospital—his wound was dressed there, and he afterwards returned to my house—I saw Griffiths there—at the time Maxfield went to the door he had not a poker in his hand, nor had Griffiths—I had only one poker in my room—they did not hold pokers over their heads at the prisoner, nothing of the kind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Lock, and live at No. 1, Clare-passage, Clare Market. On 14th May I was living in the same room with Mrs. Holland—my husband was not living there—I was not present on the day in question when they were having tea—I came in between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening—Maxfield came in between 10 and 11 o'clock (they had been out drinking)—whilst I was in the room I saw Griffiths and Maxfield stand <hi rend="italic">brandishing</hi> pokers over the prisoner's head—each man had a poker in his hand—the prisoner was in her own room; the door was wide open—they were aggravating each other—the expressions they used were dreadful, on the one side as well as the other—there were five of them: Maxfield, Griffiths, another man, and these two women—there was also another female and myself, but we had nothing to do with it—the other woman ran down to get a policeman—the men were <hi rend="italic">brandishing</hi> the pokers over the prisoner's head in her own room—I saw her throw the dish at Maxfield—Hawkes and Holland were in their own room, or in the passage—the prisoner was a few yards from Maxfield when she threw the dish—they stood aggravating her, with the door open, and challenging her to come out to fight, and they would have her life, <hi rend="italic">brandishing</hi> the pokers, and then she threw the dish—Maxfield got his poker out of Holland's room, and so did Griffith—I had been living with Mrs. Holland about five months—I will swear there were two pokers in her room—Maxfield staggered from the blow; he was not knocked down, he did not fall; he reeled against the bed-stead—I saw his head, it bled very much; it did not appear very much cut—Mrs. Holland took him to the hospital—next day I went with him to the hospital, and the surgeon extracted the pieces from his head, and I begged him, in the surgeon's presence, not to get drinking, for I said, "Erysipelas will take place, and that will cause your death perhaps"—he said I was an old fool for saying so—the prisoner said she was very sorry for it, she did not intend to do anything; and he said to her in the room, "I had no business to be there; it serves me well right what I have met with."</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at King's College Hospital, when Maxfield came there about 10 o'clock, on Tuesday morning, 15th May—he had been there the evening before, and was seen by the house physician—I examined his head—he had two wounds on the forehead, each about three quarters of an inch in length, the upper one extending throughout its whole extent to the bone of the skull; the under one was not so deep—I removed several small portions of earthenware from the upper wound—they were contused and lacerated wounds—I thought they would probably go on favourably—I dressed them—he continued to come to the hospital until 21st May, when considerable erysipelas appeared on the face of the scalp in the neighbourhood of the wound—he was then admitted as an in-patient—I continued to attend him—he died on the morning of the 25th—I have no doubt his death was caused by the erysipelas, which resulted from the scalp wound—those wounds might have been caused by an earthen<lb/>ware dish thrown.</p>

Q.</hi> They were not in themselves dangerous wounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, only in the event of erysipelas coming on—scalp wounds very often heal—intemperate habits would very much expose him to erysipelas, and might tend to bring it on.</p>

I have an order to supply the army with horses; in consequence of that I was at Banbury fair on 23rd Jan., or about that time—I had before employed the prisoner a few times to bring horses to town—on that occasion the prisoner had charge of twenty-one horses, which he was entrusted to bring to Woolwich—the instructions were given to him by my foreman, who is not here—I was there when the prisoner came away with the horses—I know of their being delivered at Woolwich—I did not see any money given to the prisoner when he left—he has on former occasions delivered vouchers; it is always done—I received this letter from Mrs. Burnham, dated 20th March—I showed it to the prisoner, and read it to him, when he was taken, at Mr. Saul's livery stable, in Finsbury—I received two letters from Mrs. Burnhain—the first time I saw the prisoner after receiving a letter from her was at Beverley, in Yorkshire—I called his attention to the bills—I asked him if</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Sutherland-terrace, Caledonian-road. On 17th May, I made a communication to the police, and two policemen came and remained in my house that night—nothing happened that night—they were in the house on the 18th and on the 19th—on the night of the 21st they were on the first floor landing in the first part of the night—they went down to the parlour about 3 o'clock—a little after 3, I heard a latch key go in the door, and the latch was raised, and immediately after I heard a scuffle; I went down and saw the prisoners in the custody of the police—I lent a hand, and they were secured—the door was on the latch when I left it—it was shut close.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now a bookseller, carrying on business at 106, Great Russell-street, near the British Museum. I have known the prisoner about fourteen years, during which time I have been very inti<lb/>mate with him, and had great confidence in him—formerly I was not in the bookselling trade, but owing to matters between me and the prisoner, the house having been distrained for rent by the Duke of Bedford, I paid him out, and therefore became possessed of the business—it is my sole and entire business, I carried it on under the name of Atchley and Co.—my wife's maiden name was Atchley, and her sisters trustees, have advanced money to enable me to carry on the business—after I entered into the business, I entered into an engagement with the prisoner, and he undertook to get orders at 10 per cent, commission; and when they were obtained I delivered the orders to him to deliver to the customers; unless he had some of our own works when he had them out to show—publications which he had out with him he would sometimes sell—last Dec. a gentleman called on me to in<lb/>quire about a copy of Roberta's "Holy Land"—I understood that his name was Brocklehurst, and told the prisoner that he had better see him—he told me that he had called on him, and ascertained that it was not he who had called, but that he had become a customer—he is a member of Parliament, and lives in Milk-street, Cheapside—the prisoner said that he had bought two copies of Digby Wyatt's book, value eight guineas each—I believed his statement to be true, and delivered to him the two copies for</p>

               <p>Mr. Brocklehurst—a day or two after that, the prisoner left a memorandum for me, a further order from Mr. Brocklehurst, who, he said, had given a further order for two copies of "Belgian Architecture, "two copies of Roberts's "Holy Land, "and two copies of Finden's "British Gallery of Art"—the value of those six books was 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the after part of this account book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my writing; I have written underneath the order at the same time—in Dec. the prisoner came to me and said that the Earl of Bradford wished to see a coloured copy of the "Holy Land," to compare it with his own, as he wished to show it to a lady who wanted a copy—I had one copy in stock which I gave to him to deliver to the Earl of Brad<lb/>ford; it was arranged that the price was to be 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as it was rather scarce; it was worth that—on 5th Jan., the prisoner desired me to enter it to the Earl of Bradford, and he would pay for it—I have not seen that book since, and have not been paid for it—on Oct. 30th, 1854, the prisoner had one volume of the "Holy Land," to show to Lord Calthorpe, and brought me the order, that Lord Calthorpe would take it at 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I did not see it again till I found it at Mr. Sutherland's, the bookseller's—(I had sent it to Lord Calthorpe by the prisoner and a young man named Henry Smith, in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—about Nov., 1854, the prisoner brought me word that Mr. Leaf, of Old; 'Change, had recommended Mr. Cotton to purchase books, and also a Mr. Gurney; he then brought me an order from Mr. Cotton for "Naah's Wind<lb/>sor," coloured, value 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., publishing price; but he said that he had engaged to sell it at 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—afterwards he gave me a further order from Mr. Cotton, and an order from Mr. Gurney, of No. 7, St. James's-square, a friend of Mr. Leafs—in Jan. 1855, the prisoner ordered for Mr. Cotton, a copy of Finden's "Gallery of Art, "a coloured copy of "Mexico," and the "Land-Steward; "this memorandum that I am looking at is not in my writing, but I saw it at the time it was, written, it is a day book which I refer to hour by hour; the date I am looking at is Nov. 30th—the prisoner gave me an order for an original copy of Roberts's "Holy Land, "in four volumes, in reference to Mr. Cotton—he said that Mr. Cotton wished to present it to Mr. Hubbard; the name of Hubbard is put here over Cotton, and the pri<lb/>soner had the books for that purpose, the value of them is 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he also brought an order on 6th Nov., alleging it to come from Mr. Cotton, for two copies of Finden's "Gallery of Art" one plain and one India—the prisoner has been transacting business for a gentleman named Meesom—I have an entry here on 21st Nov., from which I remember that the prisoner had ordered a copy of a work on Belgium, value eight guineas, some time before I had got it—he said that Mr. Meesom also wanted a copy for Sir Charles Barry—on 23rd Nov. the prisoner said that Mr. Laws had ordered a copy of "Belgian Architecture and Sculpture, "the value of that is eight guineas—here is the entry—on 6th Dec he ordered a copy of the same work for Earl de Grey, and it was handed to him—since the investigation I have seen all the books that are in this list but one, Digby Wyatt's—I discovered this by writing for the account to Mr. Leaf, Mr. Brocklehurst, and one or two more, and in consequence of the replies I received, I spoke to the prisoner; either the same day or the day following; it was about the 5th Feb.—I said, "Mr. Brocklehurst and Mr. Leaf have written to me, that they have no accounts, and have nothing owing"—he said, "There must be some mis<lb/>take, I will go and see them"—I received a letter from Captain Leland, and about 7th Feb. met the prisoner in the street, and told him that I had received a letter from a gentleman, and had been with it to Messrs. Cox and Greenwood's, to see the secretary to Captain Leland, showed him the</p>

               <p>to show—some of the noblemen who have been named, were on my books and I had known the prisoner to serve some of them during the first two or three years of his being with me—on those occasions I had received the money from the prisoner, but it was entered to the party whom he received it from—the cost price of the "Belgium" is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I sold it for eight guineas—the real cost price was not 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the "Holy Land" was published at 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the difference between the cost and the selling price is 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent—sometimes as much as 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, is made on old books—I have never reckoned how many books were sold in this way by the prisoner in the course of the year—one of these accounts was upwards of twelve months, and the other six months—there was a settlement of accounts in 1853—I would not give any more commissions to the prisoner until the accounts were paid to me, but I continued at intervals to advance to his wife certain sums of money—no agreement was come to—after 1853 the business was carried on in the same way—during that period bills were not sent in to customers in the name of Williams, that I am aware of—I never sued a person named flower, in the County Court, in the name of Williams—I recollect the morning when certain duplicates were handed over to me by the prisoner—it was at his house—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the books which I have refreshed my memory by—no part of this agreement is in my writing, but the pencil marks are—I have seen it before—(This was entitled, "Minutes of an intended agreement to be made between Emma Atchley and John Willams, (as soon as the latter shall have obtained his certificate;) Richard Allen and R.

Q.</hi> Have you accompanied Williams to other places with books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he has on some occasions left books, and called for them afterwards—I am aware of his selling books in that way—I was in Mr. Sprigg's employment in 1841, when he first had the business—I have seen the prisoner pay Mr. Sprigg money, and represent it as coming from the parties that the books went to—Mr. Sprigg has not, to my knowledge, spoken of the way in which business was done in Williams's absence—in speaking of a book, when I have said, "Who has had it?" Mr. Sprigg has not said, "John Stiles, or anybody," and told me to put it down, saying; "Never mind, Williams will pay for it"—I have heard him say that Williams would pay for it, and receive his commission on it—this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is, I think, relative to some cash which Mr. Bailey received for Williams—this other paper is in my writing—I believe I have received 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Williams for books which had been entered to parties in some irregularity, and he paid me, and pot it to the parties' account, which was debited in the books—books were never pawned by Williams during the time I was at Mr. Sprigg's—I never pawned any for Mr. Sprigg, or Mr. Williams—I have done such a thing for myself, a book of my own—I have never owned books higher than 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I have done that six or seven times in eleven or twelve years—I know a person named Shoredrag, and recollect his giving me an acceptance—he did not pay it when it became due—Williams was not called upon to pay it—I think he sued in the Bloomsbury County Court, in the name of Emma Atchley—Williams had not afterwards to pay the money on the acceptance which I received from Shoredrag, because I put an execution in, and obtained the money—Williams had nothing to pay in money—I believe he paid it in commission, which forms part of the present entries before the Court, because Shoredrag repre<lb/>sented that he bad had the books, and he said that he did not receive them—I recollect a man named Flower, a customer of my master's; he was in debt three guineas to my master in July, 1853—I sued him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you sue him in the name of Williams? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Flower repudi<lb/>ated the account, and said that he purchased them of Williams, in Dec, 1853—Williams brought us the money as if it came from Flower—I know that he repudiated Atchley's invoice, and sued him in Williams's name—I recollect applying to Professor Hall, at King's College, for an amount for books, and afterwards ascertained from Mr. Guolf, there, that he had returned the books.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask Williams for the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I first of all stated that they repudiated the accounts, and afterwards I took Williams's acceptance—I believe these two promissory notes are renewals—I think the original of this was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe they were paid on their being given up——sometimes it was my duty when I took money to give receipts; but when Williams paid me money, I often credited the parties themselves—(<hi rend="italic">receipts read</hi>: "May 18, 1854.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I live at Albert-place, Turnham-green, and am a tailor. On Wednesday morning, 25th April, I came up to town on business, with a horse and chaise; I was very short of money, and thought if I could sell it I would—"For sale" was written with chalk on the chaise—when I came to St. Martin's-lane, a policeman told me I was not allowed to stand there with it, so I went off—I was looking to see a man named Turner, who was at Aldridge's—in about ten minutes two parties came and asked me if I would sell the pony and chaise—I said, "Yes"—one of them looked at the pony to see if he was sound, and tried him to see if he was young or did—the short man then said that be should like to see the pony going, and got into the chaise and asked me to drive him; I drove them to West-street, to the Marquis of Granby—he asked me to come in and he would make the bargain—one man came into the house, while the other minded the pony—the man who came in offered me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the pony and chaise, and made a bargain for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we remained there about twenty minutes—we then left, and the pony and chaise remained outside the Marquis of Granby, while I went to another public house with the man who was to buy it; his name was Ringwood; there was a man to mind it—we made a bargain at the other public house—there were two men there—I asked the landlord to write a receipt, and after it was written I saw the prisoner coming towards me with a horse—one of them, Brydges, said that the horse belonged to them, that he was</p>

               <p>steward in ft Quaker family, and the prisoner was the coachman, and in order that the prisoner should not know how much Ringwood paid for the pony and chaise he sent him away with Brydges—Ringwood had the money in his hand to pay me, and I saw the prisoner walk very quickly towards my chaise—I called to him to leave the chaise alone, and Ringwood ran away towards the other corner—the prisoner jumped into the chaise, and drove away as rapidly as possible, while I held the horse that the prisoner had been holding; Ringwood had begged me to do so—I never saw my pony or chaise again—Ringwood never came back to pay me the money—1 ran after him, and called to him to stop—I next saw the prisoner on 27th April, near the City-road, and gave him into custody—the horse I was left to hold was a black one, worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no doubt whatever that the prisoner is the man who ran away with my chaise—I am a cripple, and cannot run.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, South-place, Finsbury, and am a silk manufacturer; there are two houses adjoining each other; I reside in one, and the business is carried on in the other; there is a communication internally. On Friday night, 13th April, I examined the premises—they were all closed up and fastened—next morning my man sent a message, and I went and found the next house in confusion—the door of the weavers' entrance was unfastened, and three other doors opened—the top room was kept open by a stool, it was never locked—the two rooms had been entered by a centre bit from the inside—a person could get to the inside from the window which opens on to the parapet—that window was open—the next house but one was unoccupied at that time—persons could get to the roof of the unoccupied house, there is a parapet five feet nine inches wide from the window of my house—there were footmarks in the gutter, and some tow which had dropped off the thieves' feet—there were footmarks in the warpers' room—the door of the warehouse had been broken open, the drawers opened, and 130 dozen scarfs and 100 or 200 lbs. weight of silk missing, amounting to between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also missed from the warehouse a canvas bag, containing waste—I had seen it the night before—it was partly filled—the contents had been turned out on to the floor.</p>

               <p>the door communicating with the house was locked; I went inside, and found the drawers open, and the lobby door, where the work people are served, open—there was a bundle of scarfs, and pieces of velvet were lying about—the lock of the street door had been picked, and opened from the inside—the first door of the winders' room had not been touched, but in the top winders' shop the lock had been cut out from the inside—in the warpers' room, I found the window open—I went and told Mr. Phillips, and he came in with me.</p>

I am the wife of James Taylor, of No. 1, Matilda-street I know the prisoners; they live in the opposite house, No. 28, and have done so to the best of my recollection more than nine months—on Tuesday evening, 17th April, at a little past 5 o'clock, I saw a cart drive to the door; it stopped two doors past their house—two men were in it—they went to No. 28, Coles' house; they were in conversation some time, and then I heard Swann, who was at the door, say to the other, "You had better come in"—he then went to the cart, took a parcel out, and took it into the house—the other man was talking to Swann at the door, who said to him, "You had better come in," and then both men went in, and left the cart standing outside—in a short time they both came out, Swann had a narrow bag on his shoulder; he placed it in the cart, and they drove away—it was a spring cart with a chesnut or brown pony—I saw the same two men there on Thursday, and saw them coming out with a bag each, which appeared quite full and very large—Swann walked first, and they followed him.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am a barrister, practicing in the Equity Courts—I am one of the directors of the Deposit and General Life Assurance Company—their offices at present are at No. 18, New Bridge-street, Black-friars—the prisoner was the secretary of the Company—he came into the office, I think, about Aug., 1853—1852 or 1853; I am not quite sure which—he resided at the Company's house—at first he had a salary of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; it was afterwards increased to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or rather more, I think—it was his duty to make such payments on behalf of the Company as were pre<lb/>viously authorised by the board, to open all letters addressed to the secre<lb/>tary, and generally to manage—it was his duty to enter, or cause to be entered in a cash book, all receipts on behalf of the Company—we had two bankers, the Commercial Bank and Messrs. Hopkinson's—our payments were made by drafts drawn and signed by the directors at our weekly meetings, and counter<lb/>signed by the prisoner—they required his counter signature before they were issued—it was also his duty to lay before us at our weekly meetings, a statement of all receipts and payments during the preceding week—when payments were to be made, either he or one of the clerks, by his direction, filled up the cheques; they were then laid before the Board, and signed by two of the directors, and they received his counter signature either then or afterwards—in consequence of something that reached my ears about 22nd July, 1854, I had a conversation with the prisoner; that was at a meeting of the Board—there had been two cheques drawn for the premiums of some assurances which we had effected with the Home Counties Com<lb/>pany, and those cheques had been delivered to the prisoner at some previous Board to be paid to that Company—I asked him what had become of those</p>

               <p>two cheques—I have the particulars of them—(<hi rend="italic">referring to a paper</hi>)—one was No. 1211, dated 8th June, for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and the other, No. 1212, same date, for 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is a memorandum I made with a view to the inquiry before the Magistrate, as I had forgotten the exact amounts and dates of the cheques—we were sometimes in the habit of re-assuring with the Home Counties office; our practice was not to keep above 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one life—when we took more than that, we reassured with another office—sometimes with one office, and sometimes with another—the Home Counties was one—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the cheques I speak of, and about which I spoke to the prisoner; they are for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., both dated 8th June, 1854—they were drawn for premiums on re-assurances with the Home Counties—I asked the prisoner if those re-assurances had been paid; he said they had—he ought to have paid those cheques to the Home Counties before the time expired during which the premium was payable—what that time was I cannot tell you exactly, but it would be at any rate within a month from the date of these cheques, probably a shorter period—it is the custom of offices to allow a certain number of days after the date at which the premium becomes due—I do not know, but I think these were new insurances—the risk on the part of the Home Counties would not begin until these were paid—they were new insurances; it was the prisoner's duty, therefore, to pay them at once—if for any reason the payment was delayed after the cheques were signed by the directors, it would have been the prisoner's duty to retain them in his own possession—when he told me that he had paid these two sums, I asked him to produce the receipts for them—he sent down stairs to have them produced—he sent the messenger or sent a message that those receipts were to be brought up—I had previously examined the voucher book where the receipts ought to have been, and found they were not there; the messenger returned without them—the receipts are pasted in a book called the voucher book—the prisoner directed the messenger to bring the voucher book—when he returned without the receipts, the prisoner after a time admitted that he had not got the receipts—he said he had had the receipts but had given them back—I wanted to know why, and said it was very strange—he said there was some question of account between him and Mr. Mills, the secretary of the Home Counties for which these receipts had come, and he had got them back; that was the substance of his statement—he said he would have them the next day, and I think we appointed a Board for the following day, the 23rd; I attended—I think the first Board was on the 21st, but I am not quite sure, and the next on the following day, the 22nd; it was the day after this conversation—the prisoner then produced the receipts—I said it was very extraordinary, and it was necessary to have an expla<lb/>nation about it, and I therefore proposed to the Board that a letter should be sent to the Home Counties to know when these moneys were paid, and, in fact, for an explanation—before the letter was sent, a copy of it was read to the prisoner; that copy is in the minute book—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "22nd July, 1854.

On the part of the directors of this Company, I shall be greatly obliged by your informing me, under the authority of your Board, when the two sums in question were paid to you, and upon what day your Company first was under the risk of assurance on those lives; for example, whether if the persons, Armstrong and Prosser, or either, had died before yesterday, your Company would have considered itself liable to pay the amount insured by us upon those lives? I should also be glad to know in what mode those payments were made, and the circumstances under which the receipts were given. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, your obedient servant, R. A.

Mr. Coode, thereupon, called upon the Secretary for an explanation, which was thus given: first, the Secretary denies in to to that he pays the cheque into his credit, and retains the money there before handing it to the parties, and thereby benefiting his own and injuring the Company's credit; but, on the contrary, what the Secretary does is this; he gets the bill dis<lb/>counted by Hopkinson's before he even cashes the cheque. When he is advised the bill is discounted; he then, for convenience, pays the cheque into his account, and simultaneously sends the Amount due, to the party in a cheque of his, paying the law charges to the solicitor, and the premium, etc., to the Company, thereby benefiting the Company, inasmuch as by this process the cheque is not presented for one day; whereas, if the Secre<lb/>tary were to adopt the only other two courses, viz., a registered letter or a bank order, the cheque would of necessity be cashed instanter, and the Company's balance be immediately reduced; whereas, by the process adopted by the Secretary the Company gains a day, and sometimes two days, as well as the saving of considerable time, in either cashing the cheque and obtain<lb/>ing a registered letter, or cashing it and getting a bank order, both of which processes are avoided by simply enclosing a cheque to the party. The Secretary stated that it was done solely for convenience; that it was more trouble and inconvenience to himself personally; and he produced his banker's book, which proved that the allegation was totally incorrect and false, both as to the amount of 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as well as to the paying in the money immediately the cheque was drawn, and when drawn and paid in, retaining it any time beyond that required by the transmission of the cheque by one post and the return of it to his bankers by another, or by return of post His book showed that he had only even done this in four instances, and at remote dates, and that his assertions as to time of keeping the cheque were true; for it appeared that in each instance the cheque was cashed by return of post. The Committee considered his explanations entirely satisfactory, and the mode adopted by him to be the most convenient. The Secretary further adds that his mode is the best for the Company, inasmuch as if the Company were to trust the party to remit the premium, etc., it is doubtful how long the Company would have to wait for it; and, as an instance of</p>

               <p>this, in the case of Wildman, the Company was a week and more without the premium, owing to an informality in the cheque given for it, and the Company had to wait till a fresh cheque was obtained, the borrower having received a fortnight previously the whole amount, and given his cheque, which was returned, for the premium.")—that minute is signed by George Coode, Chairman—I have not myself traced several instances in which the prisoner has actually paid the Directors their fees, I only traced my own—I have not said that I had traced at least three—what I said was this; when I was examined before the Alderman, I found I had received three sums of money for fees, and at the moment when you put into my hand one cheque I thought it probable that I had received the others, but I find I have not—on one occasion, I think, the prisoner paid me my fees in cash—I think that was before he had a banking account at all—I think, on one occasion, he had a cheque for fees, and he went and got the cash at our banker's and paid us the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not very frequently receive cheques for a considerable amount, which had to be distributed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never to my knowledge—he never to my knowledge paid a cheque of ours, or anything on account of the Company, by his own cheque—I do not know of an instance of a cheque for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid into his banker's which he afterwards paid out to the Directors by his own cheques; I only know of the one instance in which he gave me mine—the Chairman is here, and Mr. Knox—I have seen three Directors here besides myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Used the prisoner to have sums for what was called petty cash, cheques for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and so on, which he had to disburse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think he ought to have kept the petty cash—we gave him cheques for petty cash when he asked for them—we had a rule, I think, that no sum above 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be paid out in petty cash—he did not frequently receive cheques for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he had to distribute—he had not frequently cheques for such sums as 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for expenses, which expenses occasionally consisted of very small items, not to my knowledge, nor do I believe to anybody's knowledge—the reason I did not know of the minute which has been read, was, because I was not there—I would not have permitted such a system to have remained for a clay—the first discovery I made of it was when you put the bundle of cheques into my hand—I can very well understand why I should not know it; 1 was not present at the Board—I do not trouble myself to read the previous minutes on all occasions, I do on many occasions—I remember something being said at the time, and being distinctly denied by the pri<lb/>soner, about cheques being paid into his account—that was a long time ago; he knew that I would not have tolerated it if it had prevailed—by the deed. the Directors ought to have a guinea each time, but we do not get it—I never knew that the prisoner was security for Mr. Coode for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I heard, it from the prisoner, but I never inquired about it—I do not know whether he is liable for it at this moment, I know nothing of it—I never asked Mr. Coode about it—I do not know that it is true, I should never have dreamt of such a thing—I have heard the prisoner say that he had money trans<lb/>actions with Mr. Coode, that is all—I say unhesitatingly, that this is the first time I have heard that the prisoner was actually security for a loan of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard the prisoner complain that there were pecuniary differences between himself and Mr. Coode; the particulars of those transactions I know nothing about—I have heard him say that he was security for Mr. Neison, our Actuary; I do not know it except from his statement—I know Mr. Coode's handwriting (<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>), that is Mr. Coode's writing—I really do not know what the amount was that I heard he was security for.</p>

Kingsford, Norris, and Kendall—I do not at this moment remember any others—they were not discharged for irregular transactions in the Company; we dis<lb/>charged Kingsford because his health was unfit; he is liable to fits at times—that was so when Bevan was there—he was the keeper of the cash book, and had to make the entries under Mr. Bevan's direction—I have not found out repeated instances in which he omitted to make entries; I mean to say that, certainly; I do not know of any instance—Kingsford had been dis. charged once previously for incapacity, and was afterwards reinstated—I have not found defalcations by any one since Mr. Bevan left—Kendall was discharged because he disobeyed the directions of the Secretary, and Norris because it was thought he was mixed up with the prisoner's matters—we discharged him very shortly after the prisoner left—I have heard Mr. Bevan state that his wife has an allowance from her father; I do not disbelieve it; I do not know anything about it; her father is a very respectable man—we gave Mr. Bevan 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he left; we gave it him as a matter of mercy, at his own request—there is some furniture of his in the house; we have not kept much, and there are some chairs, and tables, looking glasses, and so on; I really cannot tell how much—they are there still, and they are used by the resident Director—they are up stairs, not in our room—I should think they are not worth more than 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they may very possibly have cost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I do not know—the prisoner professed his desire to make every re<lb/>paration, and he left that to pay us back part of what we had lost by him.</p>

               <p>to about double the amount of the loan, and we, in fact, borrow the money from our bankers to lend to them—the prisoner's explanation clearly refers to those loan transactions.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You lend money to persons who insure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it is an inducement to parties to insure—the bankers advance the money upon the security of the bills or promissory notes that we take from the parties to whom we lend the money—it is done by many Companies, it is personal security—when we can get any other security we take it, but it is on personal security—the bankers do not take an assignment of the policy, they merely take the notes from us; they discount the notes for us, in fact.</p>

In June, '54 there were some premiums due from the Deposit Company to the Home Counties—there were two on the lives of Samuel Prosser and Dennis Armstrong—about 10th June, '54, I saw Mr. Bevan—I cannot speak positively as to the date—I think there were six distinct premiums, I am</p>

               <p>not quite certain as to the number that he ought to have paid me, and he paid me but two, or rather, I should say, four—I believe he paid four—I am not quite positive to the number—I saw him in his office—I had seen him at the same place shortly before, on that same day, and he told me that if I would bring him over my rough cash book, he would see that the premiums were entered in the ordinary course, and he would pay me the money—he told me to bring the premium receipts with me—I have got my rough cash book here—I fetched from my office the rough cash book and the premium receipts, and went over to him at his office—I should say that as I never make any entry in any book myself, I had the entries made in the rough cash book before I went over from my office to the Deposit, and I there showed Mr. Bevan that I had all the entries made—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the rough cash book—these are the entries I showed the prisoner—I saw that he had several cheques before him in a square box, which I think he called his private cash box—I showed him that I had the entries made, and I handed him over the receipts—I handed them over for the express purpose of receiving the money—he handed me four cheques instead of, as I expected, six—those four cheques corresponded with the smaller amounts—the two that he omitted to give me were for 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I said, "Mr. Bevan, you have not given me two cheques here for two premium receipts that I have given you, and I must have the cheques—he said that he would let me have the cheques in a very short time; that it was usual for one office to give credit to another; and, indeed, if he paid them within the month that would be sufficient time; that I ought not to be pressing to receive the cheques at that moment—I said that giving credit was one thing, and giving premium receipts for ready money was another—I believe some more words passed—I prayed him either to give me back my premium receipts or to give me the cheques—there was some little altercation between us, and he refused to do either the one or the other—I said it was very irregular, and repeatedly begged he would do either one or the other, but he refused to do either—I believe these were continuations of old premiums—I am not satisfied about that—they were what we call re-assurances from their office to ours—they might be new proposals, or old—that would not appear by any book—they were the first premiums, as far as we were concerned—they were new to our office—the first payment was the commencement of our risk upon those lives—in consequence of the prisoner's refusal, I left, without receiving either the cheques or the receipts—I saw the prisoner on subsequent occa<lb/>sions—I think the next time I saw him I was instructed by my Directors to ask him for the cheques for which I had given him the receipts—I made a claim upon him for those receipts a few days afterwards, possibly on the I Wednesday following, because that was the day after our board day—he again said I ought not to press for the money; it was true I had given the receipts, and I had not had the cheques; at the same time, it was a mere matter of credit; he should pay them before the next board day, I think he said, or soon; that he was doing a very good business with our office, and I ought not to press him—there had been some private transactions between us as to money matters—I had lent him some money—I cannot say that I pressed him for it—I asked him for it—perhaps I had better explain the transaction; Mr. Bevan wanted me to lend him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I borrowed the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a Mr. Plumley to lend him, and he gave me two-cheques of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, both dated somewhat forward; the first cheque was paid, the second was not paid—those were private cheques of his own, on his own bankers—upon the</p>

To Charles Bevan, Esq.: Dear Sir, we consider the lives of Armstrong and Prosser to have been re-assured to this office.

               <p>Mr. Beddall when he posts them; he can explain that—I know nothing about them—if you wish to know exactly when the money was paid, or how long he held these receipts, you can easily learn, because then they were entered there, they were not carried into the business cash book; when they were carried into the business cash book was the time I received the I premiums, and then handed back the receipts; that book will tell you—I have no doubt the receipt book is here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these are my initials, "J.

In the course of last year I made application to the Deposit Company for thirty shares—4 1 had a letter of allotment, and on that sent a cheque for 152.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I forwarded that to the prisoner, as Secretary to the Company, on 19th July, the date of the cheque—it has been returned to me from my bankers as a paid cheque—I received this letter acknowledging the receipt of the cheque—(<hi rend="italic">This was a letter, dated</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd July.</hi> 1854, <hi rend="italic">signed by the prisoner, acknowledging the receipt of a cheque for</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and stating that the shares should be sent)—I have never received the shares—some months afterwards I made application about them, and that led to an investigation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant In July, 1854,1 was employed to go through the books and accounts of the Deposit Company—I think I began on 26th July—I saw the prisoner at the office—I first went through the books by myself—it was probably three or four days after I first went to investigate the accounts, that I had conversation with the prisoner respect<lb/>ing them; about 29th or 30th July—I was passing him on leaving the office, and I remarked to him that it was a very large balance to account for on the cash book—he said, "Balance up the cash at the end of the month, and in five minutes I will give a satisfactory explanation of everything"—I balanced the cash book to the end of July—although Mr. Bevan was suspended he was still residing in the house—some days after, I made out a statement of the balance that appeared on the cash book at the end of the month, as also of some other cheques that had been drawn by the Company,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110092"/>
               <p>and had been cashed by the Company's bankers, for which there were no vouchers in the Company's books during the months of June and July, and on 3rd Aug. a copy of that statement was handed to Mr. Bevan—I have that statement now in my hand; a copy of it was furnished to the prisoner—about 12th or 14th Aug. I went through that statement with the prisoner, in the presence of his solicitor, Mr. Lawrence—he was present during the whole time—the balance that was shown on the books on 31st July was 521<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to be accounted for by the cashier of the Company—that ought to have been the balance in the hands of the Company's cashier to the 31st July—I arrived at that amount by taking the entries as they appeared in the books—there was a large account gone into between us with respect to amounts that had been discovered where there were no entries in the books; I have stated them in this account—I first called his attention to this deficiency of the 521<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not dispute that the balance <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the cash book was taken out correctly, and that that was the balance that ought to be in the hands of the cashier on 31st July, but he said there was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 that had been received, subsequently to his leaving, and was still in the hands of the cashier, and, therefore, that the balance at the time he resigned, and which he ought to have accounted for, was 516<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he said in terms that that 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he was not accountable for, and I admitted it at once—all the moneys that had been received between 2nd and 31st July, had been paid into the bank, except that 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., therefore that had to be deducted from the balance in hand at the time he resigned—he objected to the correctness of the cash book with respect to the entry of three bills of the amounts of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said those bills had been twice entered in the cash book, whereby he was twice charged with having received the money; that they were entered when they were received, and afterwards when they were discounted—I found that two of them had been twice entered, but the third one, for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., had not; it was not carried into account in the cash book, but some time afterwards, it might have been a month afterwards—I found that that mistake of the double entry had been corrected, I went through all the entries of the accounts of moneys due and cheques drawn—the payment of one cheque of 201<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Rashley was entered in the cash book, and the voucher appeared—I did not charge that against him at that time; it was not discovered then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the final result to which you came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The final result was that he admitted a considerable portion of these items charged in the account—I should think about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we did not agree on any balance between us—the prisoner did not admit all that was stated—I think the amount admitted in the account to be deficient, amounts to between 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that was not a balance—he did not, at the close of my investigation, name any sum as due from him; he did not admit that there was any sum due from him as a balance—I had never seen his account before—it was handed me at the moment—I had not an opportunity of examining it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With reference to the account which you say, on your own showing, showed a balance of 516<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., how much of that did he agree with you was due to the Company upon the statement of one side or the other of the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He admitted that the 516<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was correct, except those cheques for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he said ought to be deducted I from it—two of those were properly objected to, the other was not—that I would be a deduction of 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from 516<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 406<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the balance of the cash book, independent of the other items, which he admitted—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110093"/>
               <p>then called his attention to items which did not appear in the books at all—I have a list of them; the first is an item of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Armitage; he admitted that he had received that money, and had not accounted for it, therefore that would be added to the balance—the next item was 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from a Captain Drummond; that he admitted, that had not been entered in the cash book—there is an entry in the rough cash book of the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid by Mr. Armitage, but it is not in the principal cash book—there is no entry of Mr. Warren's money at all in any of the books—the prisoner had access to the books during all the time he remained, at least till within a few days of the time he left—I think he left on 19th Aug.—he had access I to the books to make extracts, and look over them from 30th July to 19th Aug.—I find no entry in any of the books of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid by Perks for Danks' premium; there is no entry of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. having been paid by Perks—those two sums of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. form no part of the 516<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not aware of any such items at the time the books were made up—the items of the account were taken one after the other, and the question how far he admitted and how far he denied them—he admitted the greater portion of them—he admitted the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., three amounts of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; all cheques that had been drawn for certain payments, and had not been applied to those payments—the amount of the sums admitted, independent of the balance in the* cash book, was about 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he admitted the receipt of money to the amount of 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which did not appear in the books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not Mr. Lawrence say to you, in the presence of Mr. Barnes, a Director, and Mr. Neison, when Mr. Bevan was there, "If you have any criminal charge, we are ready to meet it at the Mansion House directly?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no recollection "of it; I will not swear he did not—I have no recollection that Mr. Bevan repeatedly said so—I may mention that when I entered the room, there was some excited discussion going on between Mr. Barnes, Mr. Bevan, and Mr. Neison—I do not remember hearing Mr. Barnes say, "We don't mean a criminal charge"—I will not swear he did not—I have not seen Mr. Barnes here to day—I did not see any letter from the prisoner, or the account itself, until I came into the room at that time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe he also added that there was 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of salary due to him at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a dispute between him and Mr. Barnes about that when I entered the room—I do not know whether that excited Mr. Barnes—I do not think he claimed anything for his furniture in the account—there was no balance finally struck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> No balance was struck between the parties, nor any admission on one side or the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There could not be at the time, because I had never seen such a thing before.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110094"/>
               <p>709<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but he gives them credit for that amount, less the 347<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that independent of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, ascertained to be defi<lb/>cient by the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what he means by these items at all; that is no part of the moneys said to be deficient—he says he holds these moneys for the Company, but ho did not account for them at the time—the amount he gives the Company credit for is 362<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in this statement—this is his original statement—that is independent of the sum of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd which I had ascertained to be deficient.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Baxendale's employ—he gave me the receipt for it, and I followed him to Prince's-street, Westminster, and saw the box delivered at Messrs. Baxendale's office—Brown had the van, and he gave me the receipt—that trunk was returned to me again on 18th Nov.—Brown gave me a bill, and I told him I would look over it and pay it—as he went down the steps I went up to my trunk, and the property was missing—I had lost these two waistcoats, and a quantity of plated ware, some plain chessmen, some carved draughtsmen, a dressing case with fittings, an Indian brooch, a native brooch, a gold cross, a pair of undress epaulettes, a great coat, a new black suit, a black waistcoat, a white waistcoat, a pair of pantaloons and a coat, a telescope, a camera lucida, and several other things which I have forgotten—these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine, and were in the trunk.</p>

I received directions from Mr. Elliott to take them back—I found them in the stable—I brushed the cobwebs and dust off them, and took them directly to Major Corfield's—he was there—I went down stairs after giving him the paper—I went away with the cart—when I got back to the yard, Major Corfield came to the office and said he had lost some things—I did not notice the boxes particularly; I put them in the cart and away I went—when Major Corfield came John Pegram was in the yard, and was near enough to hear what was said—Major Corfield said he had been robbed, and I said I knew nothing about it—he said, "I have been robbed by wholesale," or some such word as that.</p>

I went on 19th April to the house of the two Pegrams, in Ingleton-street, Brixton—I told John Pegram that we had come to take him into custody, for robbing his masters, Pick-ford and Co., and enumerated the articles to him—he said he knew nothing at all about it—I searched the house, and found some things, which turned out to be his own—on 3rd May I went to the house again, and apprehended his wife—I had taken him on 19th April, and on 3rd May I went and took the wife—I said I came to take her into custody for being concerned with her husband in robbing Messrs. Pickford of the electroplate, and wearing apparel, and other things—she said, "Very well," and that she knew nothing about it—I told her she might say anything she liked to me; I might make use of it as evidence against her, or I might not—she then said, "Conner had the things"—I said, "What things?"—she said, "The plate; and he came to our house one night, and took a bundle away, which I suppose was wearing apparel"—she said she took spoons to his house, about eight of each—I asked her whether she knew what became of the chessmen and draughtsmen—she said, "Yes; Conner had them"—she was asked whether she had ever been stopped at Smithfield station—she denied it, but afterwards she said she was—she said, "Previous to going out of the house, Conner told me, if I was stopped by the police, to say my name was Emma Johnson, which I did"—she said that on the day she was stopped at Smithfield she had a gold cross and two of the electroplate salt spoons with her—from information I received from her, I went to the house of Conner, in John's-row, St. Luke's, the next morning, about 5 o'clock—Conner came to the door—I asked him if his name was Conner—he said, "Yes"—I asked if the whole house belonged to him—he said it did—I said, "You see who I am?"—he said, "I do"—I asked him if he knew any one of the name of Pegram—he said he did—I asked him if he knew where they were, or what they were doing—he said, no, he did not—I asked if he knew in whose employ Pegram was, or who Pegram worked for—he said, "No"—I told him I had come to take him into custody for receiving some things of Pegram, well knowing them to have been stolen from the premises of Messrs. Pickford and Co.—he said, "Pooh, pooh, nonsense"—he went up stairs—I told him I should search the house—he said, "Very well;" and, on searching, I found this white waistcoat in a clothes box—I asked him how he became possessed of this—he said he bought it at Mr. Groves', he believed, with two white slops, and he gave 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I told him I should take it away with me; the other things, the plate and wearing apparel, and chessmen and draughtsmen were named to him, which he said he knew nothing at all about—he said Mr. Groves lived in the New Cut, and he bought the waistcoat and slops about two or three years ago—on the Monday following I received this black waistcoat from a pawnbroker, in Wilderness-row, in presence of Caroline Railton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the Lord Mayor's office at the Mansion House. I produce the original information of Louisa Har<lb/>rison—it was taken before Sir Robert Carden—it was first given on 13th Jan., but sworn on 22nd Jan.—the warrant was applied for on 13th Jan., by the officers, Finnis and Jarvis—on that day the evidence of the defendant was taken against a person of the name of Taylor—the officer said they knew the person—I asked the particulars of the case—I thought it was better to take the particulars down in writing—I asked, in the prisoner's presence, what it was for, and against whom—I felt a little doubt as to the mode in which the warrant should be granted—I thought it better to take the whole state<lb/>ment in writing, and then judge in what manner the warrant should be granted—when I asked the officer who it was for, he said the party had been described to him by the defendant, and the defendant said, "Yes; that is, she acquiesced in that—the officer said he knew a party answering her description—her evidence was then taken, and read in her presence, and in his presence—the information was taken in my own room, privately; then it was taken before the Magistrate, and read by him, and read also to the defendant, and she signed it—a warrant was not granted then—I sug<lb/>gested that I had a little doubt on the subject—I felt a little difficulty in administering the oath—the warrant was not granted then—the deposition as read over, in her presence, by me, and handed to Sir Robert Carden—the defendant was brought by the same officers again on the 22nd—I took the same deposition out to her, and said that on the previous occasion I felt</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110110"/>
               <p>a great doubt in my own mind as to what was my duty; that, from infor<lb/>mation I had received, my own impression was that she was under a delusion or an error—I told her that since the day on which she had been with me before, inquiries had been made, and the result of those inquiries had confirmed the previous opinion that I had entertained, and that I did not believe there was a word of truth in the statement she then made—she was very calm and collected in her manner, and she said every word was true she had previously said that she rather expected her solicitor would come down; and just as she said that, her solicitor, Mr. Levy, came in—I then spoke to him, and handed to him the deposition—I asked him to read it over to her, and then to tell me what the result of his advice was, leaving him and her together in my room—shortly afterwards he called me in, and told me, in her presence, that she stated that the whole of it was fact, and she was quite willing and ready to swear to it—she then returned into Court with her solicitor, and she put a dry pen over her original signature, I and I administered the oath—she had signed it on the former occasion, but the oath had not been administered—the oath was, "You swear that the contents of this your information are true, and that is your name and handwriting, so help you God"—she kissed the book, and a warrant was issued on that occasion—this is the information.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement was here read, as follows</hi>: "The information of Louisa Harrison, taken on oath this 22nd day of Jan., in the year of our I Lord, 1855, before the undersigned Alderman of the City of London, and I one of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace in and for the said City, at the Mansion House Justice room, in the said City. The said Louisa Harrison I says on her oath—I am the wife of Edward Harrison, late of No. 2, Bull I Inn-yard, Aldgate, now of No. 6, John's-place, Barron's-place, Waterloo-road, in the county of Surrey, master carpenter. On the evening of Monday, 8th Jan. instant, after dark, I went up stairs to the second floor room I of the house in which I lived to take a jug of water and a hand towel into the front bed room—I know it was after 6 o'clock, as my husband went out I at 5 minutes to 6 o'clock that evening—I left my little girl Louisa asleep on the sofa, and I had my baby under my left arm—when I went up stairs I had a candle in a candlestick in my hand—I left the judge and towel up stairs, and turned down the bed clothes—before I got to the top of the stairs I heard a knock-ing, as if some one was poking my fire—I came down stairs, and as I opened the parlour door, having the candle in my left hand, and the child under my arm, a man struck me on the nose with his fist—this was as I was opes-ing the door—I observed that he had a mask on his face—it was a black mask, and had red lips—I dragged that off his face—it was fastened with a piece of elastic, and that snapped as I pulled it, and I threw it towards the step, inside the passage—I then saw a boy who had not any mask, and the man called out, 'Here, Taylor,' or, I say, Taylor;' and the boy then made two plunges at me with something he had in his hand—it was sharp—I thought it was a knife, and it cut my gown, and cut the skin of my right</p>

               <p>shoulder—my petticoat body was also cut at the shoulder—I ran up stairs I again, the boy followed me—I screamed all the way up—I kept the candle I alight till I got up stairs—the boy overtook me on the top of the stain, I and tried to drag me down—he seized me by the hair of my head, and pulled I my hair down—I kept on my feet, and screamed as loud as I could, and I made to the window of the second floor room; but as I went up stairs, the I window on the staircase was broken by some one from outside, because the I bits of glass flew in my face as I ran past—as soon as I went to the front window, he rushed to the window and struck me on the chest, and knocked I me down—it was with his fist, I believe—he then opened the window, and pat his foot on the box which is under the window, and then put his foot I on the ledge inside, and one foot on the spout which goes level with the window—I saw him stoop double to get out of the window, and I saw no—I thing more of him—I then fainted away, and when I came to my senses, I found Mr. Cook, the doctor, with me—I did not see anything more of the other man—I know that man by sight; it was the same man who had offered me a sovereign not to appear against the man Mallett, and I said to him that I knew him at the time I pulled the mask off—my husband went to work about five minutes to 6 o'clock, and the old lady who lived in the first floor went out about ten minutes afterwards, and I went and put the chain on the door directly she was gone—I put the chain up after my husband went out, and also after the old lady went out—I lighted the old lady out, and she undid the chain of the door, and I put it up after I had shut it—the man must have been in the room when I left it, because my husband went up stairs before he went out, and he also looked into the cellar to see that all was safe before he went out—when I got to my senses, found my husband was in the room, and he informed me that the boxes were broken open, his tool chest, and a small money box of the little girl's—he had given me the key of the money box that afternoon, and I locked it up, and put the key in my pocket; at that time there was 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it, all in silver, namely, four half crowns, three shillings, and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I received the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece from the change for the milk in the afternoon—when I went down stairs I found the money box had been broken, the top part was broken off, and the money was gone—a small wooden tool of my husband's was afterwards found in my presence in the top room, which had been taken from the chest—in the lower room was a chest standing upon the tool chest, and from that chest I missed a black cloth coat, like a frock coat, of my husband's—the pockets were behind, and the sleeves very wide—there was no breast pocket—it had been torn in the arm by a saw, and had been darned by me—there was a button off, which I have at home—it was off the bottom of the right side of the front of the coat—I do not know whether there was anything in the pockets—I had put the coat out for my husband to wear on the Sunday morning before, but he did not wear it, and I had put it back on that Monday morning; I also lost two gown pieces—one was a dark red Coburg, and the other was a brown ground, with a green running flower upon it, and was a de laine, and also two yards and a half of printed cotton—when I went down stairs, I saw a bundle of things which had been tied up, consisting of two of the children's hats, some of their clothes, and also an alpaca mantle—after I was in bed that night, I missed my wedding ring from off my finger—it was safe on my finger when I went up stairs with the water—it was a very thick ring—I have searched everywhere for it, but I can<lb/>not find it—a parcel of grocery was also taken away from the parlour which 1 had bought on Saturday night at Mf. Johnson's, in Whitechapel—it con<lb/>sisted</p>

                  </hi>. On the 8th Jan. I was living as cook at the Bull Inn tap, at Aldgate—the tap is exactly opposite Harrison's house—between half I past 6 and 7 o'clock that evening, I was in my bed room, which is directly I opposite to Mrs. Harrison's—I heard a scream of "Murder!" and "Police!" and I heard it was the voice of Mrs. Harrison—I was standing at the window of my room, and I immediately opened the window—from that window I could command a view of Harrison's house—I saw there were a great many people at the door, breaking open the door—I know the room she occupied as a bed room—it is up two pair of stairs, the top of the home—from my window I could see the window of that room—I could not see I anybody in her room; it was dark—there was no light in the room—I saw at last the door broken open before I left the window—I continued at the I window from the time I heard the scream till the door was broken open—no person left the house in that interval—as soon as I had seen the door I broken open I went down—I went into the house and up stairs to the second I floor room—Mrs. Johnson went up with me—the defendant was in that I room, and there were the policemen and others, and Mr. Cook, the surgeon—Mrs. Harrison appeared to be fainting away—I afterwards heard her make a statement of what she said had been done to her—she made that statement in a few minutes—she appeared much excited and agitated—in consequence of something she said in that statement Mrs. Johnson and I examined her shoulder—we found a scratch on her right shoulder—it looked like the scratch of a nail or a pin—that part of her shoulder had been under her dress—it would be entirely covered by her dress—she wore a high gown; we had to undo her dress to examine her shoulder—we afterwardi examined her dress; Mrs. Johnson helped me to examine it—we did not I find any mark or cut in the dress—it was a print dress, lilac colour.</p>

On 8th Jan., I was lodging in Mr. Harrison's—I occupied the middle floor room—on that Monday evening I went out a few minutes past 6 o'clock—I left no one in my room—I locked my room door, add took the key with me—when I came down to the street door, the chain was on the door—I said, "Hang this chain," and Mrs. Harrison came out of the ground-floor room—I took the chain down and let myself out, and I heard her put up the chain after me—I have no recollection of seeing any light; I did I not turn my head—1 saw her with the corner of my eye, bat took no par<lb/>ticular notice of her—it was my practice to go out every Monday evening about that time, all the time I was there—I had gone out en former Men day evenings for several weeks—I told Mrs. Harrison that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon I was sent for to the Bull Inn-yard that evening, between half-past 6 and 7 o'clock—I saw the defendant—when I got to the house she was sitting on the floor—there were several persons there—she seemed aware what was going on when I got there—I spoke to her; she made no reply, but she nodded assent—I observed she had blood on her upper lip—there was no cut; nothing to be seen out<lb/>wardly—I ordered a little brandy and water—I bathed her face—there appeared no incised wound on her face; nothing external—the blood I saw might be occasioned by her nose bleeding—I examined her nostril—I could not perceive any wound—I wiped the blood away several times, and it bled again—it stopped bleeding in three or four minutes after I got there—this took place upstairs—she was afterwards removed downstairs she said she had been cut in the right shoulder—she pointed out the place I observed her dress; it was a high dress—it came over her shoulder—I did not observe any cut on her dress—I removed the dress and examined the shoulder I observed three scratches, just such as you may make with a pin—the blood was coagulated—the scratch was about an inch and half long, and jagged it was very superficial—there was no cut on her shoulder—I examined her dress—I said, "If you have been cut on your shoulder, of gourde there ia a corresponding cut on your gown"—I begin immediately looking for that cut and I found none—I do not think she made any remark when I said that to her—the gown was shown to me again not on the next morning but on the second morning, by Finnis the officer, in presence of the defendant—it was the same gown—I looked at the shoulder of the same gown, and then there was a out—if there had been a cut on that shoulder of the gown the first time I examined it, I certainly must have observed it—she put the gown on that second morning; this is it (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—this is the out that I observed two days after—a cut made at this part of the gown would not have made any mark on the part of the shoulder where I saw the scratches—it is in a different direction to where I saw the scratches—I made her put the gown on—the out in the gown was at the back part of the shoulder—the scratch on the shoulder was downwards and forwards—the cut on the dress was at the back downwards and backwards—if an instrument were applied to it when the gown was on, it would not have been a mere</p>

               <p>scratch; it would have been a cut—it would have made an incision in the flesh—there was no injury on the defendant's person, except the nose bleed<lb/>ing and these scratches, and she might have done either of them or both of them herself, most decidedly—her husband came home, and came into the room where she was—he said, in her presence, that she said before he went out, that something was going to happen that night, and in consequence of that he had searched the house thoroughly—I have seen the defendant several times—from what I have seen of her, I considered her a very self-possessed woman, a woman of strong nerve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did you intend to convey by that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have visited her a great many times, and always found her perfectly reason<lb/>able in what she said, which led me to conclude that she was a woman of strong mind—it is not conclusive that great apprehension arises from a strong state of nerve—my impression is that it is so—I attended her after this second affair—I found she was a woman of strong nerve, and requiring no medical attention—I went to watch her, and see that there was nothing particular the matter with her—I did not watch the case with respect to legal proceedings, but I watched her after she had said this about the cut—the cut in the dress is behind, and the scratch is in front—she did not exhibit any apprehensions of any kind as to this story that she would not be believed—I had to her "If you have any misgivings about Mallett, it is a very horrible thing for a man to be transported; if you have any misgiving you had better communicate it to me," and she said she had no doubt about it—my notion was that she might have been mistaken in the identity of the person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing there had been really this sort of attack made on her, would it be likely to act on her nervous system very materially? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On some females it would—anything that has a great effect on the waking mind would be apt to recur at night—impressions that have been fixed on the brain become re-produced in sleep, or partial sleep, or a sort of demi-sleep—if the nose had been once cut, and bleeding had occurred, that bleeding may occur again on any excitement—on this occasion I did not discover any marks of violence on the nose—I have known of a person by terror having the nose burst out bleeding—the defendant was about four months and a half in the family way on this occasion—I was anxious to come here to convey any conclusion that I might arrive at—I went to see her, and she did not discover the slightest indisposition to talk to me, certainly not—there was no evasion whatever—there was a readiness and a determination in everything she said—her manner to me was truthful—my suspicions were roused certainly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LOCKE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the first occasion your suspicions were not at all roused? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I looked at it as a mere ordinary case—now that my suspicions are roused, it throws a doubt on the whole of it—there are many different reasons why persons' noses may bleed—some persons can make their nose bleed very readily—this conversation took place after Mallett had been convicted—she had then given her evidence against him, and he had been convicted.</p>

I went to apply—Mrs. Sammons was out; I left our porter in the house—when I returned he had taken half the goods—there were a great many other people taking their goods away also—there was a van of furniture at the corner of New Church-court—there was no appear<lb/>ance of Mr. Hammond coming into possession, or of anybody but Mrs. Sam<lb/>nions being in possession—she acted as mistress whenever I went—Dump is the man I took the order from, in the name of Hammond, but J never saw him there.</p>

               <p>on the London and Westminster Bank, Lothbury—that was the value of the bar, assuming that there was that amount of silver and of palladium in each pound troy—the man said that he came from Anderson, of No. 29, Skinner-street, Clerkenwell—I showed the bar to my brother in the evening when he came home, and from what he said I went to No 29, Skinner-street, Clerkenwell, and found that the person did not live there—it was Saturday evening—on Monday morning I cut the bar, and found inside a quantity of copper—it contains the cut that I then made in it—it is a mere casing of valuable metal, and copper in the centre—my brother then went to the bank to stop the cheque which I had given—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I should not have given that sum for the bar unless I had believed it to be all the metal described in the assay paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farrier, and live in Warwick-place, Whitecross-street I saw Burke on Easter Monday, about 8 o'clock in the morning—he is a costermonger, I believe; a sort of itinerant fishmonger—he said he had some pieces of deal, or quartering, or pieces of wood to sell—I told him I thought I knew a man who would buy them, who dealt in old wood, and chairs, and tables—I did not mention the name—I told him he lived in Long's-buildings—I referred to Perkins—he said he would sell them to Perkins—I went with Burke to Perkins—I heard him offer to sell Perkins the deals, and Perkins agreed to purchase them of him—I saw one shilling pass between them, to bind the bargain, and we had some gin together—I had seen Burke at Young's on the Sunday evening, the evening before this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, Frederick William Stevens; we reside at Matlock, in Derbyshire—we there carry on business as barites-manufacturers, which is an article used by colour-makers. On the 29th of March I received this letter, (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>); in a few days afterward this other letter was, I believe, received at our house of business—I was not at the works that day—in consequence of these letters my brother supplied a quantity of barytes—in April I came to London, and in consequence of the receipt of a third letter I went to Rose Wharf, Pritchard's-road, Hackney—I did not find the colour works of Morris Brothers, and Company—I went the next morning, and then I saw the prisoners; I saw Samuel first, and John a few minutes afterwards—I had the two last letters in my hand; I showed them to them—I told Samuel my name, and I said, "I suppose you are the persons we have been doing business with;" he said, "We are; this is my signature"—these are the letters he saw on that occasion—(read: "Rose Wharf, April 17th, 1855. Gentlemen,—We</p>

               <p>duly received the barytes, with invoice; the first quality suits us best. we shall require five tons of the same at your earliest convenience. As the distance from the station is so considerable, we shall prefer having them as before." "March 30th. Gentlemen,—We are in receipt of yours of yesterday, and will thank you to send three tons of barytes at 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., two ditto, at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to be left till called for, as we generally like to draw our own goods by our own carts.")—In compliance with the first order, that quantity of barytes was supplied from our works—the value was 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I had never seen Morris Brothers, and Co.—I should not have suppllie that quantity if I had not believed there were such persons, and that they were those persons, certainly not—we believed they were carrying on the business of colour manufacturers in a large way, otherwise we would not have parted with the property—the second order we did not execute; we received it on the 18th of April, and I came up on the 1st of May—I went on the 2nd, and did not see them—I went the next morning with an officer—we were just inside the gates of Rose Wharf—I suppose that is a wharf occupied by wharfingers—I did not see the prisoners in any part of the building; they did not appear to have been on the premises, but they came in at the gate—I did not see the name of Morris Brothers, and Co. on the premises—I said I had not executed the second order till I had made inquiries, and I presented the bill—when the second brother came up, the first brother introduced him to me as his brother, his brother John, I believe—my conversation was then directed to both of them—I asked for payment of the bill; they both said something, the result was they promised to pay in a fortnight—I said my time was precious in town, I should like to be paid before I left, and after some time they said, "We will pay in a week"—I went over the premises with a view to ascertain if there were I any colour works—I saw no symptoms whatever of colour works there nor near it—I saw a heap of cinders and ashes, an old pair of rollers, and something which appeared to be like guano—I said, "You have not taken then premises, nor commenced your work, what did you do with the goods we supplied?"—they said, "We exchanged them for dry goods and colour with Mr. Morgan, of Pomeroy-street, New Cross"—I asked what reference they could give me as to their respectability, and they gave me the name of Mr. H. Cockburn, 22, Bedford-terrace, Old Ford-road—they said he was A chemist, and a friend of theirs; I said, as they had not taken those pro<lb/>mises, I wished to know their previous residence; they said their private residence was in Church-lane, Upper Clapton—I asked for the number, they Raid there was not any number on it; but it was the sixth house down, or the sixth house from the top—I asked who had introduced us to them; they said a young man from Croydon had mentioned our names to them; they said they had only recently come to London—they did not tell me from what part of the country—I went out and made a communication to the officer, and opened my pocket book, and showed him the reference—the officer took them into custody in a few minutes afterwards—I did notes See them taken—I went back to the wharf, and they were gone; I returned and told the officer—he told me to stop there, and in a few minutes he brought them—I have been to Pomeroy-street, but was not able to find Mr. Morgan or the barytes—it is gone.</p>

               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">ROWE</hi>. I am traveller to Messrs. Champion and Co., vinegar makers. I have known the prisoners about two years, by the name of John and Samuel Read—I sold them goods for Messrs.

On 3rd May, I accompanied Mr. Stevens to Rose-wharf, Pritchard's-road—I did not see any colour works there—in consequence of a communication made to me by Mr. Stevens, after having been on the wharf, I looked for the prisoners; Mr. Stevens said they were gone—I said, "They can't be gone this way"—I went round to the back, and saw John looking round the corner in a stooping position,</p>

I am the wife of Edward Johnson, a fish<lb/>erman, and live at Barking—I left Barking about the latter part of April last, and came to Hackney—I was acquainted with the prisoner at that time—she lived at Barking—when I left Barking, I left with her a box containing some clothes—it was not locked, but there was a till in the box which was locked—the till contained a pair of coral drops, a brooch, some pawn tickets,</p>

On the evening of 28th May, I was at Greenwich fair between 6 and 7 o'clock—I had a watch in my right waistcoat pocket—the prisoner was standing on my right-hand side—I found a little bit of a tug at the top of my neck, bat not much—I found it out more by the silver guard chain hitting me, to which the watch was fastened—I directly looked down, and saw the guard swinging without the watch—I looked round at the prisoner, and saw the watch between his fingers—the police were there watching, and took him into custody—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the watch, it has my initials on it.</p>

On 21st May, I was in company with Sergeant Turpin at the China Hall public house, Lower Rotherhithe-road; we were in plain clothes—there is a trough for water on the south side of the road, opposite the China Hall, and behind it some vacant ground and then a shed, and at the back of the shed a door leading to a harness room—I saw a team belonging to the prosecutor come up, driven by Verrall and Franklin—there were four horses to it; it was driven between the water-trough and the shed—after the waggon stopped, Franklin took two nose<lb/>bags from under it, and placed them on the ground underneath the shed; they appeared full—Verrall took the bits out of the horses' mouths, and then took two other nosebags from under the same waggon, and put them by the ode of the two that Franklin had placed on the ground—I then saw Verrall take an empty sack from the waggon, which Franklin received and held open while Verrall took the four nosebags one by one and shot the contents into it—Franklin then took the empty nosebags and placed them on the four horses' noses—they left the sack containing the food on the ground, and in two or three minutes afterwards, Abel came from an enclosed shed behind the waggon, picked up the sack, and took it into the shed—shortly afterwards he came out with the empty sack, and placed it on the ground where he had taken it from—Verrall put it into the waggon, and he and Franklin crossed over to the China Hall—Abel remained underneath the shed—(some other waggons had just left when this took place)—about ten minutes afterwards I went to the China Hall, told Verrall and Franklin that I belonged to the police, and that they must consider themselves in custody for stealing the horses' food, belonging to their master, and selling it to Abel—Verrall replied, "You must be mistaken; there has nothing of the kind taken place"—Franklin made no reply—I took them to the station—we found in the mixture some small pieces of marked paper cut up.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On Monday, 28th May, I was with Hinch<lb/>lift, another constable, in plain clothes, and saw a waggon belonging to Smith and Sons in charge of Wisby and Low, coming from Deptford towards London, empty—it came up about 20 minutes past 5 o'clock, and was drawn up between the watering trough and the shed—I saw the horses stop, and Low went to the side of the waggon and unhooked two nosebags, and took them into the shed where Abel was—Low went to the outer shed first, and put down the nosebags, Abel then unlocked the door of the inner shed, and took them in—they were full—Wisby unhooked the other two nosebags, and gave them to Low, who carried them into the inner shed—he went through the doorway, and I lost sight of them—Low came out of the door<lb/>way, it may be a minute afterwards, with four nosebags empty—Wisby then watered the horses, and put the nosebags on them—Abel came from the shed towards the waggon, and I saw him put hid hand into his pocket and give something to Wisby; it was impossible to see what, as the one hand went into the other—Low and Wisby then went across the road to the China Hall public house—I afterwards saw the waggon drive away to<lb/>wards London—after Verrall's waggon came up, we followed them, but did not take them into custody then, because there was another waggon there—I took them the same evening at Messrs. Smith's.</p>

On the evening of 15th June, my attention was attracted to a sack of oats, covered up under some refuse straw in one corner of the stable—the sack was totally concealed—it contained six bushels of oats—there is a hutch in the stable, in which it is usual to put the oats required for the horses—it will contain about a sack—when the prisoner required oats for the horses, it was his duty, to ask the foreman of the mill for a sack of oats—he had no authority to ask for more at one time—I got a constable, Dendy, who mixed some pieces of paper in the sack, in my Pre<lb/>sence, and replaced it in its former position—he afterwards cut a comer of the sack—next evening, Friday, I found the sack removed from the corner, and concealed nearer to the door, in a better position for removing—King-shott was to take a load of flour to Bromley, in Kent, about eleven miles off, on the Saturday morning, and was to leave at four o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing, with the waggon—I observed the waggon that evening, it had two nose bags strapped to it, each of which would hold about a peck—no other food would be required for the horses on that journey—this hay is similar to mine, and is bound in a similar manner, and these oats are of a similar kind to mine, of which I produce a sample—the officer put his initials, in pencil, on some of the papers, but I did not see him find them—these sacks are mine, they have my mark on them—Kingshott had gone that journey for me for three weeks before.</p>

I am waiter at the Royal Albert tavern, Wands-worth-road, kept by Mr. Smythe—he has recently gone into that house—on Tuesday, 8th May, there was a large party there—in the course of the evening I saw the prisoner in the house; about half-past 11 or 12 o'clock—I do not recollect seeing him before—he was in the parlour—I took no notice of him—the party separated and the house was closed about half-past 2 o'clock—I went to bed about 2 o'clock—I slept in the kitchen, close to the bar-parlour—my master was the last up—when I went to bed I recollect pulling off my apron, and throwing it on the bed—I was disturbed about half-part 4 o'clock, as near as I could judge, by hearing some one about; but I did not take any notice of it for a time—some one then opened the door leading into the kitchen—I lay very quiet for a time, then got up and went out of the kitchen into the passage leading to the street door; I there saw the</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Royal Albert public house, Wands-worth-road—on Tuesday evening, 8th May, 1 had a large party at my house—it was rather a late one—towards midnight I saw the prisoner in the parlour, taking a glass of wine with a friend of mine—he had not been invited as one of the guests, and had no business there—the party broke up about 2 o'clock—I was the last up—I saw the house cleared of everybody, as I believed, and made everything safe; the hall door especially—between 4 and 5 o'clock I was awoke by Constable, who brought up a bundle containing a piece of cheese which had been on the bar table over night—I got up and went down as quickly as I could—the prisoner was brought to the house shortly afterwards by one of the railway police—my house abuts on the goods railway yard—I asked him what he could mean by it, or something of the kind; I almost forget the answer he made to me; it was some evasive answer—when the metropolitan policeman came, I asked the prisoner what business he had in my house—he told me he had slept in an easy chair—there was an easy chair in the bar parlour—one of my guests, Mr. Letts, had left a coat on that chair, and a handkerchief of mine was also left there—when I came down in the morning that coat and handkerchief were gone—I afterwards saw them in the possession of Murphy, the policeman at the station—I saw some cheroots taken from the prisoner's person—I cannot swear to cheroots, and he told me so—they were like some cheroots that I missed—I saw some envelopes taken from him; they were like some that I missed—I saw some pieces of ham taken from him—I cannot swear to them—there had been a bam left partly cut; the pieces looked as if they might have come from that—there were places below, in which the prisoner may have concealed himself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You missed no money or plate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I should think there were near fifty persons at the dinner; it was an opening dinner on obtaining my licence—I had been in the house fifteen months—only those came who were invited—the whole of the persons who were in the room at 12 o'clock at night had been invited, with the exception of one or two—I knew the prisoner by sight, and by reputation—he is a public house broker; at least, he is an appraiser and auctioneer—I have known the name for five or six years—I have heard that he is a notoriously drunken character, and that he has had <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—I do not know it; I never drank with him—it was Mr. Goodwin that I saw him drinking with on this night—I do not recollect seeing him drinking with Mr. Timmings; Mr. Timmings was one of the party—I do not believe the prisoner would have stolen these things if he had been in a sober state—the fifty persons consisted of friends connected with the house, and also friends' friends—a small piece of cheese was taken out of the prisoner's pocket; it was the</p>

               <p>same kind as the larger piece—he was very drunk—a coat was found, which he had left behind; that coat was torn off at the sleeve, the part that was torn was also found—I think the policeman took it out of the coat pocket that the prisoner had on—his own coat was not nearly as good as Mr. Letts'.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, Marlborough-place, Albany-rod, Camberwell, with my mother, Diana Oliver. On Wednesday, 23rd May, the prisoner came to our house—he took a bed room, and the use of a sitting room, which he was to have occasionally to himself—he took them by the week—he only stayed two days—he left without giving any notice—I was out when he left for a few minutes, and when I returned he was gone, and I missed my writing desk from the piano in the sitting room—when I went out I had left the prisoner sitting at the piano—the desk had a gold seal inside, and it was full of letters—I also missed the whole of the plate which had been in the plate basket—I had seen it safe about half an hour before in the back parlour—it contained eight tea spoons, two table spoons, one ladle, two. dessert spoons, one mustard spoon, two pairs of sugar tongs, all silver, and three forks and one table spoon plated—I immediately gave information to the police, and on the following Wednesday, the policeman, Frazer, came to my house—I went with him to No. 19, Southampton-street—I knocked at the door, and asked if they had a foreigner lodging there—they shut me into a room, and while I was at the window I saw the prisoner going out of the door down the garden in front of the house which led into the street—he was brought back by Frazer, immediately, to the gate, and he asked me if that was the man, and I said, "Yes"—when at the station, the prisoner said he had taken the desk and burnt the letters, and he had pawned the plate—he said he had pawned the seal—the policeman brought the desk from the house and produced it—this is it—it is mine, and the one I lost all the plate was my mother's—her name is Diana, she is a widow—the prisoner brought a box to our house, which was locked—the robbery was committed on Saturday morning—the prisoner hired the apartments on Wednesday, and he came on Thursday morning, the 24th.</p>

On Thursday, 7th June, about half-past 3 o'clock, I was in the New Out, Lambeth, with my mother—I met the prisoner and his young woman—I heard the prisoner say to his young wo<lb/>man, "There goes the b—cow that gave me the four months," and he ran up to me and struck me under the jaw, and his young woman struck me, and tore my dress—the prisoner then knocked me down—I tried to get up, and he threw himself upon me—I was then on the ground trying to get up, and he put his left hand in my pocket and tore my dress—I had a half sovereign and a sixpence in my pocket—I saw him take the money out of my pocket with his left hand, and he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it into his right hand, because I caught hold of his left hand, and he bit my left hand and arm—I said, "Give me my money," and he struck me and knocked me down, and said he had not got my money—he then got away from me, and I gave information to the police—I saw the prisoner in custody in about twenty minutes afterwards—I am quite sure he is the same man.</p>
