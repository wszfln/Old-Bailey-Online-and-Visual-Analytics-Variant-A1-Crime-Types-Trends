C. Bennett, before H. A. Lovett, on 26th February; B is the one that was sent back; A was sent in substitution for one of the other two that were returned—I noticed on B some initials, which were not there when I sent it back—Mr. Tijou spoke to Mr. Hoare about it—on the 1st March, a letter was written to Mr. Ault, and before he could have received it, he called and saw Mr. Hoare in my presence—the affidavits were there, and this letter D, dated 26th February, signed with the prisoner's initials—I think Mr. Hoare first spoke; he said "I have just written to you." Mr. Ault said "I have called in consequence of something I have heard from Mr. Lovett, about some affidavits; it is a serious business for me." Mr. Hoare replied that it was a serious business. Mr. Ault then said, "Perhaps you would allow me to give my version of the affair," or words to that affect—Mr. Hoare said "Certainly, sit down"—he then sat down,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187508160004"/>
               <p>and said that on the affidavits being returned from the Court to him, and knowing that one of them was sworn before Mr. Gover, who objected to initial alterations without have the affidavit re-sworn, he had prepared a fresh one himself in its place, that was the affidavit marked A—he said "I prepared this affidavit and gave it with the one marked B, to a clerk or canvasser in my employ, of the name of Shown"—he stated that Shown had also drawn his journey money to go to Millwall, to bring the deponent to the City, and that he had brought them back to him the following morning, apparently correct, and he then at once enclosed them in a letter to Mr. Hoare—the letter marked D was then shown to him, and he said "Oh, that is the very letter"—Mr. Hoare then said "Do you know anything about this man Shown, what sort of character has he"—he said "Well, he was recommended to me as a good canvasser, and I employed him in can<lb/>vassing in my business in making inquiries as to addresses, but I was told by the person from whom I had his character, that whilst he was a very good man of business, it was just as well if he did not have too much to do with money matters"—Mr. Hoare then indicated that the other affidavit, B was also a forgery, and Mr. Ault said "Yes, no doubt," he also said that the "J. C. Bennett," and "H. A. Lovett" on the affidavit A he recognised as Shown's handwriting, and he believed the initials to B were also Shown's—as he was leaving, he asked Mr. Hoare whether he should send Shown down, and Mr. Hoare said "Oh, no, I don't want him, I can do no good with him," or something of that sort.</p>

A. Lovett" I should say is not mine—it is such a close imitation that it is really almost difficult to say whether it is or not—I have no entry in my book of an affidavit sworn by Bennett, on 26th October—the signature "H.

Gostling &amp; Co., Limited, and was indebted to them in the sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 24th November I accepted a bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., due on 9th February, 1874—I also accepted a draft for 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. marked C, dated 23rd February, 1874, due on 26th April, 1874, and a draft of the company for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., marked B, on 21st August, 1874, due 24th November—on 29th September, 1874, I paid to the company a cheque for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in settlement of the balance of the account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. Metcalfe. I had done business with the defendant for some three years, I think, before the company was formed—he was the" only responsible person that I knew connected with the business; he was the only person whose signature I would accept as final—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was not given directly as an advance on goods—the company, as I understood, was in need of money—Mr. Gostling came to me, and having done business with him for so many years I made this advance in relief of the company; I understood that from the prisoner—the state of the accounts I can only explain in this way, we had made certain advances to Gostling &amp; Co. against goods, and there the matter ended, and we should be entitled to hold those goods, and when the returns came I gave him a cheque for the balance, if the goods covered a balance—there were balances continually accruing from time to time—I made the advance to him because I had done business with him so long, and I was anxious to help him—I advanced them as a loan, always bearing in mind that I had the possible surplus returns to come—I took the risk of that—that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was afterwards honoured—the advance was increased to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. determined on 27th February, 1874; it was then increased to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there were renewals from time to time—the final bill was dishonoured; I have that in my pocket—the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was also, as I understood, advanced to the company for the company's funds—I was doing a current business with them, and of course the monies I advanced would come from their account to get them settled—we made advances on shipments, and they have been completed during the last month; the returns have been determined since the pro<lb/>secution has been going on—at the time I was at the Mansion House they were not returned; some of them at least—those transactions were not to a very large amount; a few hundreds—it is a very great point that a new firm should be known abroad, and until it is known the business can't be pushed at all—it was pushed for the purpose of establishing it abroad—this being comparatively a young company, in my judgment there was a necessity for pressing it rather beyond what would ordinarily be done by an older company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I knew nothing about how Mr. Gostling stood with the company—all I knew was that he was the representative of the company, and whatever statement he made I took it as the company's <hi rend="italic">ipse did it.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, at 5, East India Avenue—in August, 1874, I was indebted to the company in the sum of 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid that amount by cheque on 21st August, 1874—that cheque has come back through my bankers—this is it, marked A—I paid it to Mr. Gostling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. Metcalfe. When the cheque came back it was crossed with the name of John Browd &amp; Co., and also the stamp of the London and County Bank—one crossing is above the other—I should</p>

               <p>surmise that it had been to both banks—I have no doubt that the London and County Bank were the bankers of the company—I have often seen my cheques from the company crossed by the London and County Bank, and I presume they bank with John Brown &amp; Co. as well—the cheque came to me from my bankers—I can't say whether it went to the London and County Bank first and was refused, and then went to John Brown—I have exchanged ac<lb/>ceptances for the company, I think, since, November, 1873, about the time of their commencement—I lent him 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash on interest—the 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was payment for goods I had bought and paid cash for—subsequently Mr. Goatling, the managing director, and the only man I knew in the concern, applied to me for a further loan—I told him I could not do it—he pressed me, and proposed that I should give him my acceptance and he would give me the company's acceptance in return—I told him I would do so if he gave me security, and he gave me a fully paid-up scrip of the company—it was not paid; it was renewed continually up to the present time or until the disruption of the company—I hold it against them now—I endorsed the bill away, and the company were sued upon it afterwards and paid it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw Mr. Gostling in all my transactions—the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loan was made in November, 1873—that was a cash loan—it was arranged in this way, he said that he had formed a company, he had got other directors to join him and he was rather short of his portion of capital, they had to make up 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and if I would lend him 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would oblige him, and as I had been doing business with him since 1871, and I was anxious to assist him—he gave me as security the fully paid-up scrip of the company, which was in his own name—I still hold the scrip, and the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not paid—I consider the company liable to me for the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they have not been sued upon that—I consider both the company and Mr. Gostling aw. liable—I considered it a personal loan and a loan to the company as well, because I think he gave me a sale note for 500 casks of cement, or a letter to that effect at any rate—I have not lost it; I have got it somewhere—I lent him the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a sale note or a letter to that effect, it was not posi<lb/>tively a sale note, it was not stamped.</p>

C. Gostling and William Gostling be allowed to draw upon the company in anticipation of profits during the current six months at the rate of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month each, and five per cent, to be charged on the respective accounts—the minute book represents that the prisoner was present—on the 24th of February there was a resolution that</p>

               <p>the prisoner and his brother should be allowed to draw in anticipation of profits a sum not exceeding 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each during the current half-year for the payment of certain sums falling due for interest on private loan, interest to be charged at the rate of ten per cent—they were present when that was resolved; the prisoner resigned as managing director and director on the 3rd December and his resignation was accepted on the 9th—at that meeting the prisoner was present—this letter was written by the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "14th September; I beg to place in your hands my resignation as managing director of J. C. Gostling &amp; Co., which please communicate to the shareholders.") The resolution was carried on that date and he ceased to be managing director or director—he did not act—he was present at the meeting—I was aware of his subsequent appointment as manager of the cement works at Northfleet—he wrote this letter to Mr. Miller on 11th September "I will accept the offer made by the shareholders to execute works as hitherto on the same terras offered to and accepted by Mr. William Gostling"—that appointment did not in any way involve any financial dealings on his part—the prisoner's letter was answered by this letter marked I from Mr. Miller. (<hi rend="italic">Read-</hi>: "I am in receipt of yours of yesterday's date the contents of which I will submit to my directors; it will however be needful to define exactly what your duties are in the future to be, so as to prevent any misunderstanding; one of the stipulations that we make is that you cease to have anything to do with the management of the City office but leave that entirely in the hands of your brother and myself; that being so, your duties would be solely confined to the works at Northfleet; also that you hand over to the company the lease of the office in Gracechurch Street. There are several other matters which it may be needful to have set forth.") <hi rend="italic">Another letter dated 14th December from Mr. Miller to the prisoner, was read which was to the same effect.</hi> The prisoner continued to manage those works until 30th October and he was then suspended and finally dismissed—on 13th November and since then he has never taken any part in the management of the company or of the business at Northfleet—at that time there was an investigation going on into the accounts—this resolution was passed on 30th October.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> These three bills have been placed by the cashier to the prisoner's own drawing account; Capper's on 2nd September, Rendell's on 14th September, and Lockyer's on 31st October—they did not form part of the 1,680<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the moment the nature of the transactions was discovered they were transferred to what is called, rightly or wrongly, a defalcation account; that does not include the liquidation account—it would be Mabbs' duty to enter those bills in the bill-book if he knew of them—the bill-book is generally in his writing, or that of another clerk named Pollcok; he was the book-keeper—the company's account was overdrawn at times; the 27th December, 1873, was the first date—I have no note about the other dates—I think from 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be the largest amount overdrawn—it was not so much as 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I remember—to the best of my belief the London and County Bank frequently refused to discount the bills of the company—I cannot from personal knowledge say that they were then sent to John Brown &amp; Co.—there is nothing in the books to show it; the banker's book would not show it—I was at the police-court, and heard Mr. Stanton, from John Brown &amp; Co., examined—after that I asked for a copy of Mr. Gostling's private account there, and it was refused, so I made no further inquiry—there is nothing in the books to indicate John Brown's account at all, or any connection with it—I find that there are five or six sums paid in by the prisoner to the credit of the company, not to the amount of Borne thousands—I am not able to say that bills were refused to be dis<lb/>counted by the London and County Bank, and then taken by him to Brown's and there discounted and placed to his account, and afterwards transferred to the credit of the company—I am not in a position to say whether he did not continually pay large sums for the company in that way; I cannot find. anything to that effect on the face of the books—he paid into the County Bank to the credit of his own drawing account 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 22nd November, 1873, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 24th November, 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 27th December, and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 2nd January, 1874; that is all I have got a note of—there is no entry of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 21st August, 1874—on 21st November there is 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received by the company, paid into the bank to the credit of "exchange cheque account"—that was in this way, a few days before this he took two cheques of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; I don't know what he did with them, the name of the</p>

               <p>the prisoner—the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for goods supplied to him a long time back, before the partnership began—it was about 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque about which I have been asked was paid in to meet the two sums of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that had been previously taken out; the company got no benefit from that—the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in November, 1873, was paid to his drawing account; the company got the benefit of that to the extent of its being paid into the bank account—that was Collins' bill that the prisoner discounted—there was nothing in the books to indicate it, but that was the explanation he gave—the company did not in any way get the benefit of that 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., except that his previous drafts were replaced—it was the same with Tickells bill of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of 24th November—I can't find where he got the 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he got from Mr. Tickell—the company had to pay that—they got the benefit of it simply by its replacing former drafts of the prisoner's; they are all the same, the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that reduced the over draft to 1,686<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it would have been so many hundred pounds more but for that—the prisoner was dismissed on 13th November, and I believe he left London for America that evening—he returned, I think, about the end of February this year, and he was then arrested—the meeting of shareholders was being held about the time of his return it; so happened, he could not know of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was residing at the Cedars, Upper Tooting—I have since removed—I have retired from business for some time—in May, 1873, I became partner with the prisoner and his brother William, as cement dealers—that partnership continued till October, 1873, and then the com<lb/>pany was formed on 1st November—I advanced 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the partnership, and William Gosling, and the prisoner were to advance 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—the prisoner's 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be represented by the assets of the old firm, which did not turn out so fruitful as was expected—I hold 140 shares in the com<lb/>pany, amounting to 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the capital of the company was at first 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was afterwards increased to 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the whole of that was paid-up—there are only 10 or 12 shareholders—they are wholly my personal friends who I induced to join the company—I also advanced 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was afterwards paid off—the prisoner was managing director of the company until September, 1874—after that he was appointed manager of the cement works, Northfleet—he had nothing to do with the commercial affairs of the company—nearly 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was laid out on the buildings at North fleet—the prisoner had an account with Brown &amp; Co., bankers, that account was not in any way authorised by the directors—I did not sanction or know of any payments that he made in to Brown &amp; Co.—if he received any monies on behalf of the company, it was his duty to pay them in to the banking account of the company, and have them duly entered in the com<lb/>pany's books—if he received a bill from a customer, it would be entered in the bill-book, and if he received cash it should be entered in the cash-book—it would be his duty to do that or order it to be done—Mabbs acted under his direction; he is not now in the company's employ; I think he left in December, 1874—the prisoner had no authority to appropriate any monies that he received from customers or in any way in the course of the</p>

               <p>business, to his own use, either for a short or a long time—until the investi<lb/>gation of the accounts I was not aware that he had made use of Tickell's bills, of 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or the 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, nor was I aware of the three bills of 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or of Collins' cheque for 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or Taylor's bill of 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I received this letter from the prisoner, dated 27th January, 1874, in reference to Brown &amp; Co.'s account—my attention was first called to that letter the day prior to the last examination before the Lord Mayor—the letter was not produced then, it was attempted to be produced, but there was some difficulty made—he says in this letter "I have however discounted to-day at Messrs. Brown &amp; Co.'s, who have at times done a good deal for us at 5 per cent, which amounts to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I am not aware that I answered that letter—I must have noticed that passage at the time, but it had entirely escaped me, and until I accidentally found the letter I was not aware of its existence—bills that were accepted by the company required the signature of two directors—the articles of association state "that the directors shall have power to draw, accept, or endorse any promissory note, or to empower and authorise any one of the directors so to do on behalf of the company, all such documents being signed by two directors, or in such other manner as the board may direct"—the practice was in accepting bills that they should be signed by two directors—the prisoner had no authority to accept bills in the name of the company on his own private account, and until the three bills mentioned were dis<lb/>covered I was not aware that he had ever done so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When this company commenced I was residing at Whitehaven, in Cumberland—I did not often come up to town—early in May, 1874, I removed to the Cedars, at Tooting—Mr. George Peel, one of the other directors, lived in the county of Durham, and still does—Mr. Bargate lives in Lancashire—we took no part in the management of the business of the company—William Goatling, the prisoner's brother was the other director—I have given you the names of all the directors at that time—the prisoner and his brother, who were the original owners of the business, attended to it—William Gostling was residing, in London—the two Gostlings signed bills; I signed at times—blank bills were not sent down to me, blank cheques were occasionally—I can't say whether they were altogether in blank, they might have the names of the parties to whom they were payable, or they might not; I cannot remember—until I was shown a letter, I was under the impression that I had not signed cheques in blank; it was a letter that I found in my own possession—I then made the admission; that brought to my mind that I had done so—I at first declared that I had never heard of Brown &amp; Co., until the letter was produced which brought it to my notice, I had forgotten <hi rend="italic">it. (Letter read</hi>: "27th January, 1874. Dear Sir,—your letters are to hand—the Lon<lb/>don and County Bank flatly decline to discount your draft, and nothing I could say would lead them to believe other than that it was an accom<lb/>modation bill." (That was a draft of mine on Mr. Alfred Peel, not the director, but his brother.) "I certainly felt much disposed to move our account, and if you could get us a good introduction to Barclay's, through your own bankers, we would go to them. I have, however, discounted it to-day, at Messrs. Brown &amp; Co., who have at times done a good deal for us, at oh per cent, which amounts to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

I now enclose you a letter, which I trust will meet with your consideration, and I think, you will agree with me, that what I ask is fairly chargeable to the limited com<lb/>pany. William writes that he will see you tomorrow, when, perhaps you will discuss the matter.") I have not got the letter that was enclosed, I don't know that I made any inquiry where the prisoner was getting the funds to pay things, or why he went to Brown's—the complaint is not that the bills were taken to. Brown's, but that the money was left there—we had no account open with Brown &amp; Co.—I presume if we had got the money we should have had no ground of complaint—I do not know of my own knowledge that large sums have been paid by him from Brown &amp; Co. to our company; I do not know it from the books, I have nothing whatever to do with the books, and never examined them—Mabbs was taken to the police-court on the part of the prosecution and gave evidence; I can't say whether I was present—Pollock. succeeded him as cashier; I do not think he was examined on the part of the pro<lb/>secution—I suppose the funds the prisoner paid came from the capital, 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was paid up by the shareholders—I can't say how long it was before Mr. Peel's was paid up, the books show—the bill I have spoken of was not for the purpose of paying Mr. George Peel's shares, it was for the payment of Mr. Alfred Peel's own shares—Mr. Bargate gave a bill for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a portion of his shares—I have heard that was refused by the London and County Bank; I made no inquiry; I know it now—I can't say of my own actual knowledge that was taken to Brown &amp; Co. to be dis<lb/>counted, I have heard that it was—my own actual knowledge, does not extend to much, because I was paying no attention it—it was discounted somewhere—that was in June or July, 1874:—the 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not all paid up at once, but in a very short period—I can't say from memory what period, the books will show—I know that the company was occasionally short of money, I can't say continually; it was short of money, and for good reasons—applications were made to me continually for money, and I sent up very large sums—I did not direct the prisoner and his brother to get money wherever they could, to protect the interests of the company—I suppose the bills were to be met partly by the payments for their own shares, which had not been fully paid up—the prisoner was to realise his assets, but they never were realised; it was his business to collect the assets, and they were to form the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the shares that were allotted him—the assets were supposed to be good when the company was formed, and as they were realised. they were to go in pay<lb/>ment of the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of shares that were allotted him; if the assets turned out bad he would have to pay for his shares; that is not in writing, but it was understood, and was recognised by him—his original 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of shares have not been paid up to this date"; his brother's have been paid up—something like 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd of the prisoner's shares has not been paid—I can't say whether that corresponds with the liquidation account—I can't say whether he paid off 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the liquida<lb/>tion account, I corresponded with him—I am sorry to say I have not kept a great number of the letters—the prisoner paid something on his shares undoubtedly, I can't say what amount—I can't form an opinion of the pre<lb/>sent value of the property, I have not estimated it; I suppose at a rough guess it is worth some 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the present moment—my interest is represented by 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had a mortgage of 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides; that has been</p>

I think in the books of the company at present—the prisoner and his brother are not re<lb/>presented at 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the books—they have not forfeited them, they have been transferred by them—I think the registry is here—I believe the amount standing in their names at present is 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the name of William Gostling, and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the prisoner's—there are ten or twelve share<lb/>holders, including the five directors (<hi rend="italic">referring to the register</hi>)—there are twenty shares (1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.), standing in the name of J. C. Gostling, and thirty shares (1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.), in the name of William Gostling—the shares deposited with Mr. Tickell must form part of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because there was no transfer to Mr. Tickell; they form part of the shares that he still holds, part of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they have not been transferred—I may have known as early as the 12th November, 1873, that the company was very short of money, and may have directed the prisoner on no account to let the bills be returned—I did not give him directions how the money was to be raised; I assumed that money would be coming in for payment of his shares—I have no recollection of any letters passing then—I was up in town in November, and no doubt I should have verbal communication; shares were being taken up by Mr. Peel and others; I was only making efforts to raise money by the issue of the shares; I offered shares to my friends—I am not aware that there was any difficulty with Mr. Peel; he paid for his shares as they were allotted him, according to an arrangement made—I believe there is a letter of mine in Court, to the effect, that I suggested to the prisoner to have recourse to all kinds of expedients in order to meet the acceptances and the weekly payments—I did not recommend him to raise money in any way it could be raised, or by discounting the bills of the company—of course he would have to discount the bills of the company—he would do that with the London and County Bank—I gave him no directions if they refused—I did not tell him not to discount with John Brown &amp; Co.—a gentleman from Brown's was examined at the police-court, I don't know whether he is here; Mr. Peel is not here, or Mr. Bargate, or any other director or shareholder that I am aware of, except the prisoner's brother.</p>

Gostling &amp; Co., Limited, have an account there—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two paying in slips from the Company to their account—on the slip dated 17th August, 1874, there is a bill of 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mr. Taylor; that with other bills was paid in for dis<lb/>count—the whole of the bills were returned to the company for the signa<lb/>ture of Mr. Miller the chairman; they were returned by the cashier, but were submitted to me—they were brought back with Mr. Miller's signature on 21st August, with the exception of the 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill, and discounted—I don't know what became of that bill—if it had had Mr. Miller's signature I should not have refused to discount it, but it was never brought back to me—I remember receiving this letter of 12th March; that was acted upon by me up to the date of the resolution of 10th July.</p>

I shall be further obliged if you could let me know when the dividend is payable on the Egyptian 7 per cent. Khedive Loan, 1870 <hi rend="italic"/>; also how often drawings take place, and when the next is. I think it is a good plan to buy in when a dividend is near, is it so or not? The Egyptian, 1873, dividend is nearly due, I believe, which would be most profitable, 1872 or 1873? I shall be glad of further particulars about City and County Bank; is it under the Limited Liability Act? What were the shares orginally; how much paid on them; how long established, and all particulars; also the same about Wedgewood Coal and Iron. I don't see either in the <hi rend="italic">Money Market Review</hi> quoted. What do you think of Lima</p>

I received this telegram F, dated 12th April, stating that he had bought five Egyptian Bonds, 1873, at 80 3/4, and requesting draft by next post to cover same. I wrote this letter on the same day. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed a cheque on Sir Samuel Scott &amp; Co., for</hi> 403<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to meet the purchase of the five Egyptian Bonds.</hi>) The letter G enclosed a receipt for the amount remitted. (A <hi rend="italic">number of letters were put in and read, containing questions from the witness as to certain Companies and investments, and also pressing for the delivery of the bonds, with replies from the defendant</hi>) I expected the bonds by the next post, because I had paid for them and inquired whether they were purchaseable cum dividend, and upon the strength of that I sent my cheque—I looked for nothing more or less than the five Egyptian Bonds—I was no party to any interest for non-delivery—after receiving this letter of the 12th May, from the defendant, stating that he was compelled to carry over until the next settlement, the 31st May, I telegraphed to my solicitor, and then came up to town and saw. the defendant in the presence of Mr. Govett, my solicitor—I understand he is very ill to-day, he was on Sunday—we went to the prisoner's office to demand my bonds—I asked him why my bonds had not been sent—I pressed for the bonds, and my solicitor asked to see the note, which would have satisfied us that they had been purchased, but we could not satisfy our minds, except on one point, that they had not been purchased—the prisoner produced a piece of paper, but I did not look very much at it myself; I left it to my solicitor, and he informed me it was utterly valueless—I saw the amount 403<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the paper, which answered to the amount of the cheque I had sent—I believe this is the piece of paper.

I asked for the bonds, and the prisoner went away and said he would go and get them or see some gentleman—we waited for a long time, until we were tired, and went away—they 'told us that if we returned in two hours Mr. Hawkes would be sure to be there—we returned in two hours and he had not come back, we were told by Mr. Hawkes' employes—we asked for the money or the bonds, and a gentleman, Mr. Hanrott, who was his legal adviser at that time, recom<lb/>mended them to produce the money if they could not produce the bonds, and he wrote a letter to Mr. Hawkes and left it for him with that advice in it—Mr. Hanrott appeared to be advising the prisoner while we were there, and before the prisoner left—he was asked a great many questions by the prisoner—the prisoner did not come back, and we got neither the bonds or the money, and I returned home—on the 18th May I applied for a warrant against the prisoner, at the Mansion House, and advertised a reward for his apprehension—every means were taken to find him at his own house, and at his office—at the time I applied for the warrant, Mr. Hanrott, the prisoner's solicitor, and a gentleman as Counsel, were there—I afterwards received this telegram from the defendant.

               <p>that I was perfectly willing if he pledged his word that the defendant should surrender, not to have him arrested if I could discover him meanwhile—I never was threatened by him or by anybody with any proceedings of any kind, neither was Mr. Hatchard to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I informed Mr. Sherwood that I had receive 1 a telegram <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Mr. Hanrott saying "Take your own course, my client will take his;" and I also informed him that I had communicated with Mr. Hanrott by letter, and told him to tell me where the prisoner was, that he might be apprehended, and whether he would surrender him; but I declined to allow the case to be settled in any way by the delivery of the bonds—I cer<lb/>tainly did not understand that Mr. Hanrott was threatening an action in respect of the advertisement of the warrant after the acceptance of the bonds by Mr. Govett—I think the advertisment appeared the day before the acceptance of the bonds—it only appeared once, and I think it was the day before the bonds were delivered up—I think it was on the 1st June the defendant telegraphed to Mr. Hatchard the bonds were ready to be delivered over; the advertisement was sent to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper on 1st June with<lb/>out any knowledge of the telegram; Mr. Hatchard residing in the country the telegram was sent up to me—on 2nd June the advertisement appeared, and on the 3rd the bonds were delivered up—T did not certainly understand that Mr. Hanrott was intending an action—I understood the phrase "my client will take his course "as a sort of threat that it was better to leave him alone; however Mr. Hatchard would not let him alone—I appeared at the police-court for Mr. Hatchard first, and I think it was on the third occasion Mr. Cannon appeared—you opposed that charge being taken before a summons had been taken out—Mr. Cannon said he had come from Brighton, and the Lord Mayor ordered an information to be filed, and it was filed and proceedings granted—it was not the act of the Lord Mayor, it was your act—I think he would have heard it at once, but you opposed it.</p>

I am manager of the National Bank, at Charing Cross—I believe this signature to this promissory note is Sir Henry Wraxall's—I have a signature which I saw him write, and by comparison I say this is his—on 25th May, this year, I bought for Sir Henry Wraxall, 5 Egyptian Bonds, 7 per cent., 1873—they were handed to our head office by the brokers, and the money was received from there on the following day—we kept the bonds till 1st June, and then handed them to Sir Henry Wraxall on payment of the balance due to us—the head office had paid for them I think on 26th May, and we did not withdraw them I think for two or three days, as they were in our hands we made an advance to Wraxall, on the security of the bonds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clergyman and live at Oriental Place, Brighton—I saw an advertisement and a circular purporting to come from the Consolidated Exchange and Banking Agency, and I communicated with the company at Gracechurch Street—I received letters from the com<lb/>pany, but they were not signed by Hawkes until October—there was another manager before him—after October I received letters signed by the prisoner—on 22nd February, 1875, I wrote this letter to the company.

                  </hi>. I am a mason, and live at 31, Romney Street, West<lb/>minster—on the 7th July, about 11 a.m. I went to see my brother off from Waterloo Station, and I did not go to work that day—after that I went to Kew, with Mr. Young, the landlord, of the Brown Bear, Millbank Street—we got back from there about 10 p.m., and I and my wife, and some other friends remained at the Brown Bear till they closed, at 12.30, we then went outside and were standing having a few minutes' conversation, when the prisoner 391 B, came up and said "Clear the corner"—he was in uniform and on duty—I said "You will give us time to say Good night," and I had no sooner said so, than he up with his fist, struck me on the eye and knocked me down—my face was cut and I got up and went to the station, at Rochester Row, and reported him to the acting sergeant, whose name I believe is Geary—I have heard it since—I wrote my report on paper at a desk outside, and handed it to Geary—that was I should think three quarters of an hour after I was struck—Mrs. Barrow, my sister-in-law was there when I was struck, and my wife, and Mrs. Hallom and Mr. Washing<lb/>ton, I do not know the others—when I received the blow, three constables were standing on the opposite side of the street, by the White Hart, the prisoner had been with them—he left them to come across—none of my party were the worse for liquor—there were six or seven of us standing at the corner of the Brown Bear, but there was no disturbance whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no disturbance, no noise, and no screaming of women—we were standing there perfectly quietly, and without the smallest provocation he came up and struck me, he being in uniform at the time—my wife is not related to a man named Hicks—I have heard since that Hicks has been in custody for assaulting the police—my wife is a witness against a constable named Heavingham in reference to a series of assaults later on, she is actually prosecuting a police sergeant for assaulting her at a later hour in the neighbourhood of Vincent Square—I first went to the Brown Bear at 8.30 in the morning—I did not go to work at all that day, I stayed at the Brown Bear for two hours till between 10 and 11 o'clock—I was drinking during that time, I had a glass of ale—I then went to Waterloo station and from there to Kew and came back and went to the Brown Bear between 1 and 2 o'clock and remained there about an hour and a half—I also had some ale on that occasion, I cannot say how much—I then took a boat up the river to Kew—we only went into one public-house at Kew, but we stopped at one before we got to Kew—I had drink at both those public-houses—we got back at 10 o'clock and I then paid my third visit to the Brown Bear, but I went home first—I had beer again, I cannot say how much—I have said "I had been drinking during the day I cannot say how many glasses, not twenty I think," or something to that effect—I</p>

               <p>was perfectly sober—I am not in the habit of drinking twenty glasses every day—all the people with me were as sober as I was—I did not hear the pri<lb/>soner request the people not to make such a noise but to disperse quietly—I did not say to him "Mind your b----y business, you are only a youngster in the service, nothing of the kind; I only heard him say "Clear the women"—I did not say "I shall go when I like"—I did not see a lot of women crowd round the defendant and push him into a doorway, there was not a lot of women there, nor did I see them push him into a doorway—I did not see him trying to push through the women to get out of the doorway—when I was knocked down I felt inclined to return the blow, but they persuaded me to go the station and report him instead—I did not say "I want to get at the b----"—I said nothing to the prisoner when I was struck—it was a smartish blow, it cut my eye and knocked me down, but I never said a single word to him, I went direct to the station—my wife came into the Brown Bear about 10.30, but she did not stay, she came in and out; she did not ask me to go home, she came about twice—I did not say before the Magistrate-" It was a temperate day with me, I can almost swear I did not take twenty glasses," but it was a temperate day with me, I was not drunk—I used no offensive words to the constable—I know Hannah Brown, she is the wife of a cabdriver in Horseferry Road—I attended five times at Westminster—my solicitor is named Sampson and so is theirs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I heard last night that the Grand Jury have thrown out the bill against Hicks for the assault—the charge against Heavingham, was after I had made my report at the station—I was not present at the assault of which Heavingham is accused—I began to drink at 8.30, and the twenty glasses of ale extended right through the day—I took my ordi<lb/>nary meals and I include what I had with them—I did not take anything, with my meals in the boat—I do not think the glasses would come to twenty.</p>

I went to the Brown Bear, about 10.30 p.m., and remained till the closing of the house at 12.30, when we all came out together, and were standing at the corner wishing one another good night—there were three or four policemen opposite, and one of them came across towards Pizey, and said "Now then clear this here corner"—Pizey said "Allow us to wish one another good night" and he up with his fist and knocked him down—I advised Pizey to report the case at the station, instead of getting into any bother with the prisoner, and I went there with him and saw him write the report—he was sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Brown, a cabman, of 11, Castle Street, Horseferry Road—on the morning of 7th July, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was in the Horseferry Road and saw Richard Hicks in the custody of two constables—the prisoner was standing in the road—I asked him what the matter was, and he hit me a blow with his hand which cut my lips top and bottom—my mother, Mary Ann Hill, and my sister, Mrs. Hicks, were there—my mother said "Oh, my God, what did you hit my child for like that"—he then struck my mother, she had given him no pro<lb/>vocation—I said to her "We will go and report him at the station"—I walked to the station with her, and when we got between Austin Road and Earl Street he knocked my bonnet off and told me to mind I did not lose my comb—my mother stepped back and we walked as far as Mr. Bovett's yard where he heard me say that I should go to the station, and he gave</p>

               <p>me a blow at the side of my face which knocked me down and my mother as well on the top of me—I did not go to the station, I went no further—I was out at that time of the morning because we had been to see my other sister, Elizabeth Hicks, who had just been confined—she is another brother's wife—I did not go to the station to make the charge, till the next morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to the Magistrate the nest morning,' that was after my brother-in-law, Hicks, was in custody for assaulting the police—I live in the same house with my mother and sister-in-law; Mr. Hicks lives at 101, Praed Street—when I came up, my sister was in the custody of another policeman, and upon my asking him quietly what was the matter, he struck me a violent blow on my mouth with no provocation at all—he had his uniform on and I knew he was on duty—Hicks was going quietly with the constable, and thirty or forty people were following—I saw Hicks struck by the policeman but not by the sergeant—I did not see the sergeant Hicks was going quietly, he did nothing to provoke it that I saw—my mother also was knocked down without provocation—I should say if the policeman was not drunk he was mad—I don't know what Hicks was taken for, he was orderly and quiet, and so were the rest of the people as far as I saw—I had not been out with Hicks that night—I did not ask him what was the matter, nor did his wife, or mother-in-law—he is a cabdriver—I did not see Pizey that night, Mrs. Pizey was not with me, but I saw her after she came <hi rend="italic">from the</hi> station—I did not see her struck—there were several people there—I did not see the sergeant draw his staff—I did not hear a cabman say "The b----is drunk, I should like to have him in the square and I would give him a b----good hiding"—my husband was not in the crowd, he was at home when I got home—he did not go the station—I went there next morning with my mother—I did not hear a cabman say "I have a mark on you you b----and I will do for some of you"—there was no shouting in the Horseferry Road—I call forty people a crowd—they smacked Hicks' face and I said "Go quietly or you will be killed."</p>

               <p>a blow and knocked me on top of her—two cabmen came out of the yard and picked us up—I said we will go to the station; the cabmen begged us not, but my daughter went next morning—the prisoner was almost mad I think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Only seven or eight people were following my son, and they ware going quietly—when I came up, the first thing I saw was Hicks being struck in a brutal manner by the police—he went quietly—my daughter asked the sergeant what was the matter and he struck her in the mouth—I was knocked down twice by his fist, not with his staff—he struck my daughter as hard as he could, and he struck me so as to fell me to the ground—no bad language was used by the cabman or the people.</p>

I am the wife of James Pizey, a mason, of 31, Rodney Street, Westminster—on 7th July, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, I was in Horseferry Road, and saw Hicks, and I afterwards saw him in custody—I knew him him, and I knew Mrs. Brown—my husband was in front with my baby, and Mr. Hicks was about crossing the road, and he stopped and said "Come along, mother" once or twice, and the two police-men came up him and shoved him—I said "Be off; get along"—he said "I am going home"—they took hold of him, and the sergeant came across and struck Hicks in the face—I said "What a shame to knock a man about like that"—he said "What has that to do with you" and he knocked me down with his hand on my chest—I was going to the station to report him and had got into Vincent Square when I saw three young men in the road—he went up to them and asked them who they were following—they said they were not following anybody, and he struck them with his staff—I cannot say whether he struck all three—he turned into Rochester Row, where he pushed me and struck me across the back of my arm with his staff—I went to the station door to go in to report him, and the policeman said that there were too many in; I could not go in then—I had a bruise from my shoulder to my elbow from the second blow—my husband had gone on with the baby—the staff did not knock me down; it descended on my shoulder, but I was knocked down in Horseferry Road—I went next morning and took out a summons by myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Greek Street West—my husband is a carpenter—on the Friday on which I went to the police-station and made a report—I was at the Westminster police-court on business of my own, and I never saw any of the parties there before—I saw a woman there, who I afterwards found to be Mrs. Pizey, and a man—who I afterwards found out was Hicks—it was raining—in consequence of what I heard pass between Hicks and the woman, I went to the police-office next door and made a report to the inspector, and he wrote in my presence, in this book, while I was telling it to him—Hicks put his hand in this way to Mrs. Pizey and said "You must stick to it and swear to it and swear that the sergeant struck me when I was in the Row, bidding my mother good night"—I then went in and told what I had heard—I was examined before the Magistrate.</p>

I live at 4, Cornwall Street, and am a boot maker—on the morning of the 7th July, I was in Rochester Row, between 1 and 2 o'clock, and saw the sergeant there in his uniform—I saw people outside the station, and saw a man put his fist in the sergeant's face, saying that he should like to have him in the square, for it was not him he was frightened of, it was his coat—several men and women were round the sergeant, pushing him about, and he took his staff out at that time, but did not use it—he did not strike anyone—my employer was with me and at his request I made a statement at the police-court.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police Sergeant</hi> 10). Between 11 and 12 o'olook on Saturday night, 23rd July, I placed some constables outside the premises of Messrs. Unwin, obtained the keys and went in to examine the premises, and under one of the counters I found Salmon and Andrews together—turning my light round to the other end of the counter, I saw Martindale stooping down with his head in the counter, but his body pro<lb/>duced—they were all three without coats, boots, or hats—I called constable Cole to assist me to take Martindale; I already had hold of the other two—I left a constable in charge of the premises and went to the station with the prisoners—I then returned and found that an entrance had been effected by getting into a disused churchyard, into which Messrs.</p>

               <p>Unwin's premises look—the windows were protected on the inside by iron bars—it appeared to me that the screws at the bottom of one of the bars had been removed, but had been replaced, not screwed home—entrance could be effected by moving back one of those bars—my impression is that without moving the bars, an entrance could be effected, although they were not wide enough for me they were wide enough for lads to get through—inside the window you land in the machine room—at the end there is a passage which leads into the shop—in that passage we found the three prisoners' coats, boots, and hats, which they are now wearing—there was a door at the end of the passage with a glass top, the putty had been taken out and the glass removed with a view to open the bolts, but the door being locked as well, it was forced—in addition to the window being taken out the door was forced—there was a holdfast lying on the ground with the broken glass—there were marks on the door leading to an inner office which corresponded with marks which this screwdriver would make—we found the screwdriver behind the counter, bent as it is now—I found a drawer had been forced which contained postage stamps, and there were a few receipt stamps as well in the drawer—I found about thirty-two receipts stamps on the ground in the middle of the shop where the prisoners had stood before they were taken to the station—they all have "Unwin Brothers" printed on the front of them—the marks on the drawer containing the stamps corresponded with the screwdriver—I found on Salmon, at the station, a metal match box, containing matches and a penknife—I did not know Martindale previously—he made a statement to me at the station—I cautioned him first, and he said "I was drawn into it by the other two"—I asked him how he came to be in the premises, if he was drawn into it, they did not carry him over—he said "When in the place they said 'pocket those pencils'; but I said I would not put them in my pocket lest we should be caught, and I did not want anything found on me."</p>

I live at 6, Bloomfield Road, Maida Hill, and have an office at 2, Pancras Lane, Cheapside—I am president of the German Relief Society—up to Friday, 16th July, the female prisoner was a stranger to me—she came to my office on that day and brought with her this card with the name of Mr. Dietmar who was known to me, and my name and address was written on the back of it by Mr. Dietmar—she said that Mr. Dietmar had sent her and had also assisted her; that she had a passage to Hamburg paid by the Society of Foreigners in Distress, in London Wall and she and her husband were to start the nest day, Saturday, but being destitute and having some things in pledge she wanted to take them out and for that purpose she asked me if 1 could do anything for her from our society—I told her that our meetings were once a week, on the Thursday and I gave her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of my own—I also gave her an address of another German gentleman—she came to me later in the day at my desire because I had told her that I would see if I could find any one else to assist her—I wrote the name of Gustave and Emiline Arnold on the card at the first inter<lb/>view—those were the names she gave of herself and husband—she did not say where she was living on either of those two occasions—on Monday, 19th July she called about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I expressed my surprise to see-her as I expected she would be on—the road to Hamburg—she replied that she had come from Dr. Sholl or Dr. Capel, I am not certain which, but one of the parties connected with the society to assist foreigners in distress, and she had arranged to postpone her passage to the Wednesday following—I asked her for what purpose—she said she had a few things yet to settle before starting, that she had a few things that she was most desirous of having with her, still in pawn and she wanted to get some additional money to take them out—she asked me if I could give her any further names—I told her I could not annoy my friends in that way—she then said she had a very nice dog which she could not pay the passage for to Hamburg, and if I liked to accept it she would give it to me—I said that under her circumstances I could not accept a present of that description, but if it was worth anything I would</p>

               <p>purchase it from her, and I desired her to bring it to the City—she said she could not well do that, but if I would oblige her by calling upon her I could see it and take it away with me; she gave me her address 40, Bloomsbury Street—I told her that I should be on my way home very likely between 6 and 7 o'clock, and I would call—she then left, and on my way from the City that evening I did call at 40, Bloomsbury Street about 6.45—it was a private house—I knocked and the female prisoner opened the door—she desired me to walk upstairs; she was living on the first floor—I did so and she followed me—I entered the first floor front room; she shut the door—I had my coat and hat with me—I was carrying my coat on my arm—I put it on a side table, just on going into the room with my hat—there were about half-a-dozen dogs in the room; I expressed my surprise at seeing so many dogs—she said they belonged to some friend of her husband's—she pointed out a black dog and said that was the one she wanted me to have—I said it would not suit me—she had desired me to sit down when I entered the room, and I did so—she remained standing; I was about leaving the room, when the door opened, and the male prisoner and another man who is not in custody, came in—I had been in the room about five or six minutes; the chair I was sitting in was at the back of the door; I noticed the woman went to the door before the men entered the room, but I did not hear anything; the male prisoner locked the door at once after he was in the room and put the key into his pocket; he first ad<lb/>dressed himself to the female prisoner, and said in German "Have I caught you at last;" she did not say anything—she put her hands before her face and sat down in a chair—he then took my coat and hat and put them under the table where there was a box; he put them in that box, and put that key also in his pocket—he then said "What business have you got here with my wife"—I said "I am here at the invitation of your wife about at a dog"—I spoke in German to him; he said "That is all non<lb/>looking sense, you have been seducing my wife, and you have to pay for it, I have got a witness here," referring to the other man—I said "If you think I am in the wrong or that I have done anything wrong you had better send for the police and give me in charge"—he said "I will have nothing to do with the police, I won't allow a policeman to enter this house"—I then applied to the female prisoner to say for what purpose I came into the room, and that I was a perfectly innocent man, but she did not reply—I then said to him "What is it you want of me?"—he said "I must have money"—I said if that was his object I had only got a few pounds in my pocket—he said "We know you, you are the President of the German Society, and you must give us a written acknowledgement to pay 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I told him that was a ridiculous demand, and he said "You will not come out of this place alive if you don't comply with my request"—the other man said "You bad better comply with what he wants or else you will have to bear the conse<lb/>quence"—I said it was ridiculous to ask such a sum, and he said "I must have it for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the man not in custody then ask me to sit down and write it out, and he put a paper before me, and stood behind and dictated to me, and I wrote—the first paper that the other man dictated to me was "I acknowledge being found alone in the room with Arnold's wife"—he then said that would not do, and destroyed it, and then he dictated a pro<lb/>missory note for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I wrote at his dictation—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the other man dictated it in English—he spoke German, but he dictated this writing in English; he gave me English words: "London, July 19,</p>

               <p>1875,—I hereby agree to pay you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling on 27th inst. to prevent any action against me"—that was what was dictated to me and what I wrote, and I signed it—there was no stamp on it then—the other man then said 'We must have the money that you have got about you"—I handed him the 21., at least I put it on the table—the male prisoner then said "You can go now; we will let you go"—I believe the man not in custody dictated something to the prisoner and put this penny stamp on the paper while I was there, and the prisoner wrote on it "Received on account 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., London, 19th July, balance 98<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the sixpenny stamp was not on it then—it is dated 20th July, the day after—I was not near the window at any time during this interview; I was about the middle of the room—one of the men was standing behind me and one in front, and the prisoner said "If you dare to move from this spot you do it at your peril," and he assumed a threatening attitude—the other man said as I was going "You must consider yourself a very lucky man to get so easily off"—and the prisoner said "You had better keep the matter quiet, we won't say any<lb/>thing more about it, and you won't hear anything more about it"—he then unlocked the box and gave me my coat and hat, unlocked the door and let me' go—I was induced to write this paper because I was in great fear—after leaving the house I went that same evening to the police-station and made a complaint.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The female did not say anything to me about my going to her house, till the Monday, the third time of her calling—I believe there was a bed in the room—it was a small room—she did not make any improper advances towards me; she conducted herself with strict propriety—I was there five or six minutes, it might have been a minute or so more—the conversation during that time was entirely upon the subject of dogs—I said I thought it was very unhealthy for her to have so many animals in the room—I examined the dog and did not like it—she referred to nothing else—she was standing talking—the door was shut, not locked—she had been moving about the room, and just before that man entered she hap<lb/>pened to be near the door—I did not notice that she was touching it—she went to the door, whether she opened it or not I could not observe—I did not hear the men coming up the stairs—I did not hear anything—when the male prisoner charged her with having caught her, she put her hand before her face and sat down in a chair in the corner of the room, not the chair that I had been occupying, it was at the other end of the room, and there she remained during the interview—she had her hands before her face pre<lb/>tending to cry—I would not swear she was not crying—I was about retiring from the room as the men came in—I had not taken up my hat—I gave her. the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when she first called, out of my own pocket, as I thought she was a respectable woman, and there was no time to apply to our society—I give away a good many 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am a cigar importer—I have been in London twenty-three years, and carrying on the same business for thirteen years—as a rule we inquire into cases before giving money—sometimes when I think it is a genuine case I give money out of my own pocket—I had every reason to believe she was a perfectly respectable woman—she says she is the wife of the male prisoner—I have heard things since.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>, <hi rend="italic">after referring to the cases of</hi> "Rex v. Phipoe," 2 Leach, 673, "Rex v. Edwards," 6 Carrington and Payne, 521, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> "Rex v. Hart," 6 Carrington and Payne, 121, <hi rend="italic">contended that the statute was not intended to apply to a negotiable valuable security, because no such instru<lb/>ment could be given under a case of restraint or violence. It expressly said</hi> "<hi rend="italic">any part of a valuable security</hi>;" <hi rend="italic">it therefore applied to any paper which might afterwards be converted into a valuable security. Its being in an imper<lb/>fect form would not prevent the operation of the statute. If it were otherwise, a lawyer who by restraint or threats dictated a perfect valuable security would be guilty, and a layman whose intention was the same, but had not the requisite knowledge, would not be guilty. The paper by the addition of "bearer" would be a perfect promisory note, and. it must be without alteration a warrant for the payment of money.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BRETT</hi>. "I <hi rend="italic">am clearly of opinion that this is not a promissory note or a negotiable instrument, and never could be made one. Therefore the question must be whether such an instrument is within the statute. The words of the stutute are 'a valuable security.' It is suggested that the meaning of that is a negotiable security; but when we look at the interpretation clause it is obvious that it is much larger than that, because it includes many things which are clearly not negotiable. If that be so, the question is whether this is a security, and whether it is valuable? It seems to me that on the face of it, if the a fair were a genuine one, it is an agreement to pay money; it is an agreement to pay 1001. in consideration of the person, to whom the promise is given, undertaking not to bring an action against the person by whom it is given. It is a document which, if it were genuine, would be strong, if not conclusive evidence against the prosecutor when made a defendant, that for a good consideration he had agreed to pay a sum of money. It is not a debenture; if it was, no consideration need appear on the face of it</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Being an agreement only, it is necessary</hi> in <hi rend="italic">order to make it valuable that a sufficient consideration should appear on the face of it, and I am of opinion that there is a sufficient consideration appearing on the face of it, and that it is strong evidence of a binding agreement upon which, if the affair were genuine, the prisoner might have sued the. prosecutor. It seems to me that it is an in<lb/>strument upon which, if genuine, the person who procured it might recover the amount against the person signing it. I am therefore of opinion, although it is not a negotiable instrument, yet in as much as it would, if genuine, be evi<lb/>dence of a binding agreement, it is a binding agreement between the parties, and it is within the Statute.</hi>

               <p>Theophile Negre. (<hi rend="italic">Through an Interpreter</hi>). I am a wine grower and dealer in wines and brandies, at 6, Cour de Chapeau rouge, Bordeaux—a customer of mine named Doussou acted as my clerk at Bordeaux—I know M. Bessome, the father of Challier's wife; he lives at Paris—through those two persons I was introduced to Challier by correspondence, and I appointed him by letter my agent in London for the whole of my wines—I was to pay him 10 per cent, on the sales—I received these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are in Challier's writing. (<hi rend="italic">These were partly translated by the Interpreter, and were orders to send wines of the first and second qualities to Challier</hi>) I afterwards sent him ninety-nine cases of wine and one of brandy by the English steamer <hi rend="italic">Lumley</hi>—this is a copy of the invoice for 1,038 francs. (<hi rend="italic">Other letters containing orders from Challier, and bills of lading relating to them, were here put in and translated in part</hi>). After that I sent 100 hogsheads of wine by the steamer <hi rend="italic">Henry Balker</hi>, and this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill of lading—I think the order for 100 cases of Medoc, amounting to 900 francs 50 centimes, was sent from Paris—this is a copy of the bill of lading—the letter is in Challier's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated London</hi>, 14<hi rend="italic">th January</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">signed by Challier, forwarding another order, and complaining that he did not like to sell thirty cases out of</hi> 100 <hi rend="italic">already sent, as the wine oozed out at the corks, and that in every bottle a piece of wood or straw was found.</hi>) This is the bill of lading, and this is the invoice (<hi rend="italic">For</hi> 977 <hi rend="italic">francs</hi>)—it was upon Guyot's orders that I sent goods to Challier—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in Guyot's writing, but before I received that I had an interview with Challier at Bordeaux—an order was given to Doussou to send fifty-six hogsheads of wine to Guyot—that order was transferred to me, and I had a conversation with Challier about it, but I cannot recollect where—I had a conversation with I him at Bordeaux after the goods were sent, but not before—before that it was by correspondence. (<hi rend="italic">Several other letters and invoices and bills of lading in French were here put in.</hi>) I saw Challier in Bordeaux and also in London in March—I came to London, I think, in the second half of March, and saw him at Mr. Lechevin's office, and also at Guyot's office—I saw Challier and Guyot together every day while I was in London, and they both came to reside at my hotel at Charing Cross—I saw Lechevin there—when I came to London in March I had these two bills of exchange with me for 261<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 364<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The first was dated Bordeaux, 11th January</hi>, 1875. <hi rend="italic">It had three endorsements, and was accepted by A. Guyot. The second was dated 25th December</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">to M. Lechevin, and was endorsed "Bills renewed by other drafts.</hi>") The first of those bills represented 3,000 francs, being one quarter of the invoice, and the one for 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the other three-fourths of the invoice—the bill for 251<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 65. was the only form of payment for the fifty-one hogsheads sent to Guyot—that bill was current at the time of my visit to London in March—I had negotiated it while it was current, and it was subsequently returned to me unpaid—the two bills, the one I brought with me and this one, represented the total amount of wine sent over to Guyot, and while in London I came to an arrangement for those two bills to be given up, and other bills being in their place—the endorsement on Lechevin's bill is quite correct, it is my writing; the four bills mentioned there are what were substituted in place of the two others—they were all returned to me unpaid—I only received 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—Challier told me in March, that all the goods I had sent had been sold, and he asked me to send him as many as possible—Lechevin told me he had a law suit about some cement he had</p>

               <p>forwarded to Calais and Caen, which would be terminated at the end of the month, and then he should be in possession of plenty of money, and then he would pay—he told me that he had no longer an office, on account of that law suit—I believed that he was then carrying on business, and I believed the representations made in the letters by Challier, as to Lechevin's position—I Bent the goods to Lechevin, relying on the contents of Challier's letters, and I dispatched the goods to Guyot on the references I received from Challier and Doussou; I mean the letters, and also the verbal re<lb/>ference which I received at Bordeaux, and also from Doussou when he came back from travelling—I came to London again in May, after Guyot's bill was dishonoured, or it may have been June—I met all the three prisoners accidentally in Cannon Street, and they took me to the office of Webber &amp; <hi rend="italic">Co.</hi>, Martin Street, where they told me that at. that time they had no <hi rend="italic">money to</hi> pay me, but that if I would serve them by giving some references, that would put them in a position to do business; and that after having robbed a few Englishmen they would pay me, and upon that I went to a solicitor—I went over to Bordeaux, and came back to this country while the prisoners were in custody—on the day before I gave evidence at the Mansion House, I went with the officers to different warehouses and saw some goods—I recognised the marks on the cases and hogsheads, and am able to swear that they were my property—I pointed them out to the officer, who made notes at the time—the actual amount of wine I have seen amounts to about 22,000 francs.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. I have been in business as a wine mer<lb/>chant eighteen months at Bordeaux—I was not in business before that—I have been an insurance broker, But that is not called a business—I was an insurance agent, representing a company—they paid me a salary, and I had private means of my own—I started as a wine merchant with capital—I bought for ready money and never on credit at that time; but I did after<lb/>wards—I always paid ready money, or I paid when the time arrived, that payment should take place by our agreement—I have carried on business at the Cour Chapeau Rouge, for two years—I was eighteen months a wine merchant at Bordeaux, and ten years an insurance agent—I am still carrying on both—I had another business there which I carried on six smonths, and gave it up to go into the town—I had an agent in Paris, M. Besson—he is not a relation of mine; he is Challier's father-in-law—he represented my house, selling wines on commission—I did not know him before—my traveller, M. Doussou, appointed him as my agent in Paris—Doussou, is my cousin—I have known him ever since I was born, but I have ceased to be on good terms with him since I made the complaint in this case—I was on very intimate terms with him—I never saw him in Paris—I have seen him in Bordeaux, at ray office, not at my house—he wrote letters for me and assisted me in my business—I had great confi<lb/>dence in him—he was my agent for a year—I paid him a salary—I did not see him for ten years before he was my agent—it was after the introduction of Bessou, that Challier was introduced to me—Doussou sent me some orders which he had obtained for wine from customers in Paris, and I sent much wine on his representation—I have been paid for it by bills which are all paid to the amount of about 12,000 francs—Doussou was in the habit of making inquiries for me about the solvency of customers—Challier wrote a letter to Doussou, which Doussou sent to me from Berne, in July, 1874—I think I first saw Challier in October or November, in Bordeaux—</p>

               <p>Doussou introduced him personally and represented him as a man who would be likely to be a good agent for me in London, and I had no reason to doubt it—I came to London in March—I did not see Challier in Paris after<lb/>wards—Doussou appointed him my agent in October—Challier remained, four, five, or six days at Bordeaux—he was a visitor at my house, but he did not live with me in October—he came to my office—he tasted my wine and talked to me at great length on business matters—I knew that he had been in London, and was returning back, but on what business I did not know—after he had been in London, I got the first order from him I think in the beginning of November—I received this letter from him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had not at that time sent the wine to Lechevin &amp; Co.—I received that letter at the 15th or 16th, and I did not send the wine for a month afterwards, perhaps move, because I was waiting for some confirmation by Lechevin, of what Challier had told me—I sent Doussou to London, to make inquiries, and he was absent a month, but he wrote to me sometimes—I have not got his letters here—if they have not been given to my atcorney they must be in Bordeaux—Doussou confirmed to me all the information which Challier had given me about Lechevin, in all its particulars—I sent the wine in consequence of what the one or the other had said—nobody has even advised me to say that it was in consequence partly of what Challier told me, and partly what Doussou told me that I sent the goods off—if Doussou had told me not to send them I would not have done so—I had perfect confidence in Doussou at that time; he had my power of attorney and I would have sent wine to any customer he alone represented to be a good one, and perhaps I should have sent it if he had been the only person who recommended-Lechevin &amp; Co.—when I started from Bordeaux the Bill of Exchange was not due, but it fell due while I was in London—while I was in London a letter from Sauge, was sent after me from Bordeaux—before I came to London I had not received more than one letter from Challier on that subject—he wrote to me after I had started for London—he asked me by letter to let him see Sauge's letter—he wrote to me seven or eight times upon that subject to Bordeaux after I came to London in March, but not before—I received this letter from Challier. (<hi rend="italic">This being translated, was dated April 22nd to the witness, acknowledging his letter containing</hi> 750 <hi rend="italic">francs in notes, and staled, "I am still expecting with patience the letter in which certain persons are mentioned, Sauge.

(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is accepted by Challier—I sent to meet it 1,715<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 70<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—no doubt Challier paid the remainder out of the proceeds of more than 3,000 francs worth of goods which I had sent him—Challier has accepted six bills. for me in the same way, amounting to 9,750 francs—only one has been. paid when presented—they were drawn on Challier and accepted by him—they were all overdue at the time he was taken, except one, which was due on the 30th June—the one paid was for 2,000 francs—it was paid by Challier, with' money that I sent him—this is another (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), also for 2,000 francs—Challier paid nothing on the other; it was dishonoured—he sent me 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash for the other, that was the amount of it—the two 2,000 franc bills were discounted at my bankers—the bill was presented in London, dishonoured and returned to me at Bordeaux—Challier then sent me I think a bill for 2,003 francs for money which I had sent him in April, and so he actually returned me my own money which I had sent him for the very purpose of paying this very bill—there is a long account between me and him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of it. (<hi rend="italic">Found on Challier</hi>)—it is in Losey's, my accountant's, writing—I sent Challier these papers I think in the beginning of June—out of the six bills I mentioned, none of them were accommodation bills—I had sent more money than the bills represented, also the goods.</p>

I am now out of business—I was a wine merchant at Bristol in September and October—Mr. Holt, of Great St. Helens, was my agent—I had at that time three cargoes of cement, one at Caen, in Normandy, and two warehoused at Bristol—Lechevin was introduced to me by Losey, and I made a contract-with him in reference to the cement—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have a translation here, signed by Lechevin—I have also got a document of 27th September, commencing "Bought of Mr. Isaacs—it is not dated; it is signed by Lechevin—he had it in French, and I had it in English—I gave him 74<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as he asked me for a cheque to pay the charges on the cargo at Caen—the cheque, which was given on the following day, is dated 17th October—I gave authority to the gentleman whose name is to the cheque, to pay the amount; that is Mr. Cockburn—Lechevin said he was a general merchant, dealer in potatoes, grain, cement, oil, and a variety of articles—he said he was going to Caen. for the special purpose of paying those charges and receiving the cement—I subsequently sent another cargo of cement under that contract to Calais, value 269<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some few shillings; I don't recollect the date—the third cargo mentioned in the contract was never delivered, because I found out that he was a swindler—I never received any money in respect of the cargoes or any money back for any cheque—he gave me some bills, the first of which was due just before Christmas, and before the first bill was matured he made a proposal to my agent, but I was not present—Lechevin after<lb/>wards told me that the ship put into Plymouth damaged, and that imme<lb/>diately on her arrival in London he would give me seventy hogsheads of wine to secure the payment of the bill—I had parted with the second cargo at that time—he gave me no charge on the seventy hogsheads of wine; I saw the hogsheads—the man who introduced Lechevin went to the wharf in Thames Street, in December, and tasted some wine, and I saw a number of casks and the names and marks—the bill has not been paid at all—when this conversation took place I met Lechevin in Thames Street—I did not see him afterwards—I neither got any wine or any money—I saw</p>

I am an accountant of 2, Leadenhall Street—in September last I was about taking an office at Great St. Helen's—I know Losey, he introduced Lechevin to me at the end of August, and said that he was going into business, and wished his name to be up, and he would pay me so much per annum to receive letters for Mr. Losey to do any busi<lb/>ness there for him—that was in October, and for a month I objected, but on 16th November, Challier and Lechevin came together, and it was finally arranged that he was to pay 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and they gave instruc<lb/>tions in my presence to have the name put up immediately, one was act<lb/>ing quite as much as the other—on the 20th a man named Passmore came and "Lechevin Aine" &amp; Co." was painted on the glass tablets, and on the landing, and on the general office door, both Challier and Lechevin were present when the painting was being done, and Challier wished to have the chalk marks rubbed off that it might look older, he asked me to get the housekeeper to do it—Lechevin came there about nine times in November, and about the same number in December, and when the bill of Mr. Isaacs became due in December he disappeared altogether—he paid nothing for the rooms—I never saw two Englishmen connected with them—there were no ledgers, day-books, or cash-books, but Losey ordered some headed paper—I did not know Lechevin by any other name.</p>

               <p>I came in I found them there—I refused to have Lechevin at first, because I did not want to have any other name up—that was in October, subse<lb/>quent to the first contract—Losey repeated the application some time after<lb/>wards, he said "You may as well have it, it will be no trouble to you"—he told me that Lechevin was a very rich man, a dealer in potatoes and grain who had depots every ten miles all the way from Calais to Paris—I saw Losey on Monday, I don't know where he is now—I saw Challier in Novem<lb/>ber—the bills for the cement bad been given the and then cheque also—it was all settled about the cement as far as Mr. Isaacs and I were concerned when I first saw Challier—I am not aware that Lechevin subsequently re<lb/>ferred to me as to his respectability, or at any time—Challier said in the dock at the Mansion House that he never saw me in his life—the name was painted up on 20th February about mid-day—my clerks were there—none of them are here—I have dissolved partnership; the firm was "J.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had never seen Challier before I first saw him and Guyot together when he came to make the first purchase in August—I saw Challier twice, first for perhaps half an hour, and the second interview was longer—I saw him again three days ago in prison, a detective took me there—I did not know what he was charged with or that he was a prisoner, twelve or fourteen persons were with him but they had not such black beards as he has—this is the first time I have given evidence, the officer who brought me over from Paris told me he wanted me to recognise Challier and Guyot.</p>

I am managing clerk to Mr. Henry Aird, the soli<lb/>citor to the estate of the defendant, and one of the committee of inspection, and from the commencement I have practically had the management of the affairs—in consequence of the last witness coming to me with instructions, I issued a writ against the defendant, but first wrote a letter—I have given notice to produce that letter, I have a copy here, and there was no reply—the writ was issued the same day and not served until two days afterwards—with these exceptional cases I ask them if there is any reply, and he said he should hand it to his solicitor—I also issued a debtor's summons against him on the 2nd January—there was no conversation between us then, simply that it might be attended to—I do not recollect on the occasion of serving the summons that anything was stated between myself and the bankrupt—the horse and cart were standing at the door on the 2nd January, he said to the boy something about binding up the vein in the horse's <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>; he stated at that time that he had sold them—I saw the horse and cart there, and I waited a little way off and watched where they were taken to; they were taken to the livery stables—I said nothing to him about it—on the 12th January I went to Fulham Road, for the purpose of serving the</p>

I am a bill poster and live in High Street, Hounslow—on 10th February last I was out collecting some debts—I went to the Five Oaks on Twickenham Common and had a glass of beer—the prisoner was there and a woman named Humphreys sat by his side—I was only there a few minutes, I left and when I had got about 100 yards the prisoner followed me, grabbed me by the neck, threw me down in a ditch on my backside, and took my watch and silver guard chain—I hallooed out and the prisoner disappeared up the Hanworth Road—I got home the best way I could and next day I went and told the police—I was frightened to go back that night—I described the man to the police and I went to where he used to work at some drainage works, but could not find him) I had seen him several times before—I saw nothing of him until the 25th of last month when he came into my house as I was at dinner and said "Does Graham live here"—I said "Yes"—he sat and said "Did you lose a silver watch with a silver guard to it 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "I said "I did"—he said "If you come along with me I will take you to the party as has got it"—as we were going along he said "If you follow me and sweat hard and fast that this woman robbed you I will swear the same"—I knew the man directly he came into my place, but I did not tell him so—he took me to Wilton and I went with Kerridge the policeman—he brought the woman out; the prisoner kept calling her nasty names and said to me "Will you swear this woman took your watch?"—I said "You come along, don't make a noise"—we went to the station, the woman was let go and the prisoner was locked up.</p>

I am a dealer in hardwood at Abbey Street, Bethnal Green—I have known Rose twelve months, and have seen him several times—he has introduced customers to me—he is a commission agent—on 10th April the two prisoners came together—I had never seen Muggeridge before—Rose said "This gentleman wants to select some mahogany to fit up an office in Lin<lb/>coln's Inn"—he said he had been a lawyer's clerk, and his name was Johnstons—they selected about sixteen pieces, which came to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Rose made out the bill, I signed the receipt and I gave it to Muggeridge—he then produced this cheque for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked Rose if it was all right, and he said "I have not introduced you a bad customer before"—Muggeridge wrote on the back of it "H. J. Johnstone, Tillotson Street, Stepney Green"—I had not sufficient change, and I went to my brother-in-law Mr. Dorling to get it—I left the cheque with him, and gave the change 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to Muggeridge, and gave Rose half a sovereign for introducing him—I said I would send the wood home if they liked—Muggeridge said no, he would send his own carman for it on the Monday—about 12 o'clock on Monday, Hills the carman came for it, and took it away, and signed a receipt for it—on the Wednesday the cheque was returned to me marked "N.S."—I went to the address in Tillotson Street that Muggeridge had given me, and found he had gone—I could find no trace of him—I afterwards found my wood at Mr. Mitton's in New North Road—I looked for Rose but could not find him—I paid Mr. Mitton 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the wood and bought it back from him—that was the price he had given for it—it was worth what I charged, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 89, Thurlow Road, Waltham—previous to January, 1871 I was a member of the Sir Walter Raleigh Lodge of Odd Fellows, held at the Shakespere Tavern, Woolwich—on 7th January, 1871, I sent 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Danvers, the secretary of that lodge, and received this receipt—my subscription was due at that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When the prisoner resigned his position of annual secretary Emby was appointed to succeed him, he is here—I know that the society prosecuted him for embezzlement—I was in various offices before the prisoner resigned—I went through the chair—I was never treasurer, I was elective secretary, the duty of elective secretary is to keep the accounts of the receipts and expenditure and to enter the contributions in the book kept for the purpose and to enter the receipts on the cards—Danvers was then annual secretary, he was secretary ever since I have been a member until he resigned—it was part of his duty to have the charge and conduct of the books and papers, attend the lodge meetings, and register the members' names and residences and so forth—other members have duties to perform at the meetings, the noble grand and the vice-grand; it is the duty of the noble grand to open the letters and to hand the members' subscription cards to be signed by the annual secretary or the elective secretary—sometimes the cards would be signed by one and sometimes by the other—the money received in the course of the evening would be handed to Mr. Pagden who was the treasurer then and now, he is a permanent officer and is not elected annually—the money would first be handed to the secretary and he would sign the card—there is a treasurer's book—on 6th April, 1870, this resolution was passed: "We depute the secretary to have all useless books, papers, &amp;c., destroyed"—if there were any blank pages in the books of course they would not be useless books—I can't say when a new set of books was first made use of—a summons was taken out against the prisoner calling upon him to give up possession—it was not heard before a Magistrate and dismissed, it was unheard—I did not obtain the summons, the trustees did—I was not present when it was obtained and did not see it afterwards—he was called upon to give up the Contribution pence book, the treasurer's book, and the night book—it was the prisoner's duty to keep the ledger, that was not one of the books which we say is destroyed, that is in existence for 1871—the nightly pence book is the one that is missing, that is the book from which the contribution ledger would be made up—I don't remember the defendant sending out a circular when he was about to resign or had resigned inviting each member if there were any errors in his account to come and point them out, I have no knowledge of that, this is the first time I have heard of it—there "is" a member named McConnell and he was a member in 1872 when the prisoner resigned, so was Rumsey and Mortice—I was an auditor in 1870—there was no a special auditing of the accounts that I am aware of in 1872 when the prisoner resigned—I was secretary from January to March, 1872—I was at the meeting in July when the prisoner's resignation was accepted, it was at the Shakspeare—there had not then been a subscription amongst the members to present a testimonial to him—I was not the chairman at that meeting in July and I did not make a speech—there was a vote of thanks to him and a testimonial was subsequently presented to him, I was not a subscriber to it—I did not go to the police-court in the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If he was absent on a lodge night the nightly pence-book would be there and the address-book; somebody else would do his duty—the materials to make up the books the next day would be the nightly pence book only—a post-office order received at his private address between two lodge meetings would not be any portion of the materials given to him—if he received a post-office order he ought to take it to the lodge at the next meeting—it was his duty to cash post-office orders; they were made payable to him, and all letters sent to his private address would be opened by him—I have seen the nightly pence-book for 1871, when it was in use, but I have not seen it since the prisoner ceased to be secretary, in July, 1872—on quarter nights the two secretaries generally count the money, paid into the box, and they would both do so on other nights if there was a large sum received—sometimes one secretary would take it down to the treasurer, and sometimes the other—the annual secretary kept the treasurer's book, this "balance to next quarter" and the figures, are in the prisoner's writing—he gets the treasurer's receipt on the left side for the amounts which the treasurer receives and puts down, and on the right hand side the prisoner has carried out the balance in his own figures—the contribution pence-book shows the amount received during the whole of the quarter—page 125, is in the prisoner's writing—that book contains a complete list of every member of the lodge, and a page does for six months—the names are all written before the entries were made—that book would show-any arrears.</p>

Emby was elective secretary, and from the 5th April to 28th July, J. Bishop was elective secretary.</p>

I am one of the trustees of this lodge—Davis is now acting as secretary, and the booksare in his custody—I have had a conversation with the prisoner with reference to the absence of the nightly pence-book which was in use during the time he was secretary—I can't remember the date, but I hare asked him about it on two or three occasions—he told me he had destroyed it, and I told him he should not have done so—this is the minute-book of the lodge meetings of 1871; it is in the prisoner's writing. and it was generally written at the time of the meeting—I find his handwriting there on the 4th January, 1871—the book would not give us an account of when he was absent, because he might do the writing at home—I don't see the writing of anyone else between 4th and 15th January—if anyone acted as secretary for him he should make the entries—Mr. Davis has nothing whatever to do with this prosecution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In the absence of the annual secretary some one could take a minute for him on paper, no doubt, and when the secretary returns he would make the entries in the books from the minutes on paper—all the minute-book is in the prisoner's writing—I am one of the trustees under the constitution of the society—there was a resolution that the secretary should be empowered to destroy all useless books—the nightly pence-book would not be a useless book; that was one of the books in use, but it was not included in the resolution—when the resolution was passed the prisoner had the books in his own keeping—I had no conversation with him previous to the destruction of any books as regards their destruction—I am not aware that I had any conversation with him at any time with reference to going to Bow—I never had any conversation with him as to which books</p>

               <p>should be destroyed and which should be preserved—the money was paid into the treasurer's hands by one or other of the secretaries, and the treasurer would hand it to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re examined.</hi> The amount would be ascertained by the two secretaries, and would be signed for by the treasurer the same evening in the book—the annual secretary had the custody of that book.</p>

The resolution as to the destrucion of useless books and papers came to be passed because the box was full of old quarterly reports, old magazines, pence-cards, and many papers, and there was not room to put the necessary things away, and they were understood to be the useless books, not the account books of the society.</p>

I was appointed one of the auditors in 1872, and it was ray business to go through the books with reference to the preceding twelve months, ending December, 1871—my attention has been called to the summary column at page 48 of the Contribution Book—the amount of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on 29th March, is brought forward in that summary—the column at page 47 agreed with that 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., when I audited the accounts—that 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was in the column when I audited the account—I compared the summaries with the totals and they tallied.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live in Beresford Street, Wool<lb/>gone wich—on the night between Friday, the 6th, and Saturday, the 7th, I had to bed, and was awakened by the cry of "Police!" about 1 o'clock—I got up and looked out at the window—I saw one young man on the pavement, and another had hold of a man's arm, and shortly after the others came up—they knocked him down, and were pushing him along—one held on to his legs, and one across his chest with his hands across his mouth, while the man tried to call "Police!" and a third was leaning across his head, and seemed to be robbing him—I called out to them several times that they were villains, and for the police—the tall young man came away first towards my window, and muttered something—I do not know what; and the second one followed him—I recognise Ford—they went up the street towards the arsenal, the others following—the seafaring man got up and went after. them—it was Callaghan—the affair took place facing my window, and I was near enough to see.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the whole thing plainly—two other men came up—at the police-court I said that I did not like to identify the men—I was talking to two young men outside the door, and told them I saw the affair, and that is how I came to go to the police-court—they did not tell me who was charged—I do not know whether they knew anything about it—it was not in consequence of this that I went to the police-court—I never wished to go—the policeman fetched me to the police-court—he told</p>

               <p>me he had heard that I knew about the affair, and called out of the window—he said they had got two; he did not say who they were, nor how they were dressed—I saw them at the police-court, and said I should not like to swear, but I picked them out as near as I could—I do not know Ford at all, I cannot say that I have ever seen him before—the window was the upstairs front room.</p>

I was on duty on Friday night, in Beresford Street, Woolwich, at about 10.15—I saw four men and several others at the corner of Beresford Street—I followed them, and saw Dunn—they were loitering—I told Dunn that if I caught him loitering again I should take him in custody—I again passed through Beresford Street at about 11.15, and saw Dunn and five others—one of them, to the best of my belief, was Ford, but I cannot swear positively—I believe he was wearing a round hat, he had a coat on similar to the one he has now, but a different cap to that he generally wears—all the men ran away—the houses close at 12.30—the Steam Packet closes at that time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 328). On this Saturday morning I saw the prosecutor in Beresford Street, I should think at about 1.15 or 1.30—he gave me a description of persons and I went with him to a house in High Street and found Ford in bed with his clothes on, except his boots, with his mother—no one else was in the room—I asked the prosecutor if he was the man and he said "Yes"—I told him he would have to come with me on a charge of highway robbery with violence—he said that he knew nothing of the highway robbery—his mother and he had some altercation and he threatened to strike her—I took him to the station—I afterwards went to Dunn's lodgings and found him in bed in a common lodging-house—I told him what I had come about, the highway robbery—he said nothing until I got him downstairs and then asked me what I wanted him for—I asked the prosecutor if he was the man and he said "Yes"—Dunn said he was never near the place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor and draper of King.

I turned round to Mrs. Johnson to repeat the words, and before I could get them out he drew the razor across my throat—I recollect no more.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer M</hi>). In consequence of information I took the prisoner on 27th July, in Kent Street—I told him I should take him on suspicion of stabbing a man in White Street, on Monday night—he said "I know nothing at all about it"—I told him I should take him to the station, where he would be placed with other men to be identified—he. said "You b----I will cut your throat before you get to the police-station, as you are always down on me"—Ridgway 133 <hi rend="italic">M</hi> threw him down and searched him to see if he had got a knife, but he had not—we took him to the station, where I told the inspector that he answered the description we had got, he said "Go and fetch the party who can identify him"—the prisoner said "Don't let him go, or they will put it up for me, they are sure to identify me if he goes"—he begged and prayed of me not to go so I remained with the prisoner—several other people were then placed in the library of the station, and the prisoner had the opportunity of standing where he liked, but I stood up with him—I told him I had no animosity against him, and I would not leave him—Watts came in and looked along the row of about a dozen, and touching the prisoner, he said "That is the man who stabbed Wood"—the prisoner then put his hands together and</p>

               <p>said that he wished the heavens would open and swallow him alive to cheat us—he was then charged and locked up for the night—I afterwards took him to Wood's bed side, and the detective said "Which of these two is the man 1" that was me and the prisoner—he said "The little one is the one who stabbed me"—the prisoner then made a similar remark about the heavens opening—I was in the reserve room next morning and there were about 100 persons present who were going to attend cases, and I said to Watts "Go in here and see if you can see any one you saw last night"—he went in and looked round, and identified the woman, and came back to me, and I said "Which woman do you say it was?"—he pointed to her, and said "And the young woman is the other"—that is the woman he calls his wife—I said to Watts "That is the prisoner's mother and his wife, or who he calls his wife"—Wood did not identify the woman.</p>

I am a surgeon of 13, White Street, Borough—I saw Wood on 26th July, he was suffering from two incised wounds on the left thigh, the upper one about an inch and a half long, and an inch deep; the other was about three inches lower down, and more behind, it was under half an inch long and half an inch deep—he had lost a great deal of blood; the wounds are not dangerous now, they are getting well—a knife would cause them—there was danger of erysipelas, and also from loss of blood.</p>

I live at 5, Queen's Gardens, Crosby Row, and am a widow—on the night of 26th July, I was standing at the Coach and Horses, Long Lane, listening to the band, and saw Wood and his friend there dancing on the pavement—Mrs. Noonan was there, carrying some beer—we call her Noolan—they shoved against" her and upset the beer—I may have been 10 yards off them—Mrs. Noonan is a neighbour of mine, and I know her son Stephen—he went up and called the young man a monkey, and asked him why he struck his mother—he said "I did not strike her"—he said "You did"—he said "Go home and get your supper;" the prisoner said "Can you make me get my supper?"—the other said "Go on," and 1 am not sure whether he said that he would eat eight or ten before breakfast—Noonan said "Why, I could do the biggest of you," and with that <hi rend="italic">Steve</hi> Noonan struck the young man twice on the thigh—I know Mrs. Graham and her daughter, Mrs. Israel—she was there at the time and I heard her tell <hi rend="italic">Steve</hi> Noonan to get out of the way as the police were coming down—he stood there and I said "Mrs. Noonan why don't you get your soli away, he will get locked up," but I did not say that he had stabbed him—when he got to the corner of Crosby Row, he ran away, and Mr. Watts</p>

               <p>ran after him down Crosby Row, and into his mother's place—I do not know the prisoner, I never saw him to my knowledge till I saw him before the Magistrate—my son was taken from the Constitution to Mr. Watts, and he said that he was not the man who did it—I did not see Mrs. Ward till a young boy named Matthews brought her down to me—I do not know a man named Jordan—I don't think there is much difference in the height of Noonan and the prisoner, but he is very much darker, almost brown—the prisoner was not with Noonan; I did not see him there at all—I never saw him that I am aware of till I saw him at the police-station.</p>
