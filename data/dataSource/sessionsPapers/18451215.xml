                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Palace-place, Kensing<lb/>ton. I know the prisoner—I met him with a stranger on the 20th of Nov., about ten minutes to five in the afternoon, in Lower North-st., Chelsea, and had some conversation with him and drank with him—the pritoner asked me if hit brother Frederick was at home—I said not—he laid, "I think he is"—I said, "He is not, for I have just come from the tap"—I said, "I don't think be is coming home to-night"—he said, "I hope he is, as I should like to have half an hour with him; I am just right, and I have got two more above North-street to go with me and serve him out"—he said, "These are just two <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> that will go in and do the business rightly"—on hearing this I thought it necessary to wait and see Mr. White, and acquaint him if he came home—I waited till ten o'clock, but he did not come come—that was all that passed that evening—I heard of the robbery next morning, and saw the prisoner at Queen-square—I said, "Well, John, this is a very bad job"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "How came you to do it, John?"—he said, "I don't know; it is a bad job; I was out late that night, and did not like to disturb them tt my lodging"—I asked how he entered—he said through the passage of the next house, over the wall, and in at the parlour window—I saw him write the let<lb/>ter produced.</p>

I held an inquest on the body of the deceased, Eil<lb/>zabeth Mundell, at the Coach and Horses—the prisoner was the first witness examined—I have the notes of the evidence she gave, signed by herself—it was read over to her before she signed it—no medical man was examined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a medical man had tendered himself, or if he had examined the body, should you have considered it your duty to examine him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not as a matter of course—if he had inspected the body after death, I should seek the opinion of the jury whether it waf necessary or not—these are the original notes of the examination—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)</p>
               <p>"Martha Browning, of No. 1, Providence-place, St. Margaret's, servant, being sworn, says, 'I have known the deceased, Elizabeth Mundell, for six months, and have been lodging with her there three weeks to-morrow; she, was the widow of Thomas Mundell; she has been in very good health, and had a very good flow of spirits since I have known her; I have been con<lb/>stantly with the deceased lately, and was with her all day yesterday; she was apparently well and in good spirits; she complained of a curious pain in the head about four o'clock yesterday afternoon, but she did not appear to be suffering; I dined, had tea and supper with her yesterday; she ate, as usual, with a good appetite, and was cheerful; she had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week allowed her, and did not want for anything; she went to bed at eleven o'clock last night; I went to bed at the same time; we slept together always; she was quite well then, and was quite sober; we had only a pint of beer between us at supper, about nine o'clock; she appeared to go to sleep soon, but she awoke me about an hour after we had gone to bed; she was turning about, and wat restless; she was very restless; she did not then speak to me; she awoke me again, about four o'clock in the morning, with a sort of plunge in the bed;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184512150026"/>
               <p>it quite shook the room; I asked her what was the matter; she said, "No. thing but a dream;"I thought she was not well, and asked her if I should get her anything; she said no, she did not want anything, but that I had better get up and go for a walk; I said it was too early to walk; she did not reply, but laid still, as though she was asleep; she told me to go for a walk in a very cross sharp manner, and not in her usual manner; I did not think she knew what she said; I watched her afterwards, and she turned several times, but seemed to sleep; she awoke at seven o'clock this morn<lb/>ing; she seemed to have a fit; she threw her hands up to her face, and screamed; she screamed, "Murder!" and "what are you doing to me?" I got up and washed her face with water, and asked if I should go for her daughter; she said no, she did not want her daughter; I then went to the woman in the next room, and asked her if I had not better go for her daugh<lb/>ter; she said, "By all means;" I asked the woman, if she should hear the deceased, to look to her; this was about a quarter-past seven o'clock; I then went back to deceased's room, and put my bonnet and cloak on; she wai then in bed, lying quite quietly; she asked me where I was going, and said, "Don't go for Ann," meaning her daughter; I told her I was going down stairs; I went to deceased's daughter, in Rochester-row; I came back with the daughter in about a quarter of an hour; when we returned to the de<lb/>ceased's room her daughter went in first, and I was at her heels, and followed her immediately; deceased was then lying on the box, just as she was when the present Jury saw her; she had only her night-clothes on; a cord wai round her neck, tied quite tight to her throat with a hard knot; the ends of the rope were hanging down by her side; there were two ends, and I do not think they had been broken; I tried to undo the knot; her daughter trial also; I ran out of the house, and went to the baker's shop; the baker came and cut the rope—when I left the room the three chairs were on the box; when I returned the chairs were removed, and the box was removed a little way from the table where it used to stand; the room was otherwise is the state in which I left it; a medical man was sent for, and came in about an hour; I believe several were called upon; I was present when he came; he said she was quite gone, and everything was to be left; she was on good terms with her daughter."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was acquainted with the deceased Mrs. Mundell for more than two years during the life-time of her husband—I saw her last alive about a month previous to her death—she never herself had any illness while I knew her—she always appeared cheerful, and in good spirits—during my long attendance on her husband, she appeared uniform in her spirits at all times—her husband has been dead two years, but our acquaintance was for two years, while I was constantly seeing her husband, and since that I have known her nearly four years, but not to much since her husband's death—I was not consulted about anything she had taken at any time—on Monday, the 1st of Dec, I was sent for to her room—she must have been dead some time when I got there—her face was pale, swollen, and livid, her eyes wide open, and staring, blood issuing from her ears and nose, and frothy matter, mixed with blood, coming from the mouth—there was no cord round her neck then—it was on the ground—my atten<lb/>tion was directed to the neck, believing she had died from hanging or stran<lb/>

               <p>gulation—I noticed two deep circular lines passing round from the front to<lb/>wards the back, marked with discolouration, and only one line at the back of the neck—she died from strangulation, in my judgment—the appearances round the neck corresponded with the mark which would be made by the rope produced, tightly pressed round—it appeared very improbable from the marks on the neck that she could have effected her destruction herself—I believe there would have been a greater regularity as regards these lines, if the death had resulted from hanging, or by other means, with the exception of forcible means being employed behind—I could better explain it by the cord itself—it appeared from the marks to have been applied twice round the neck, and that the pressure had been made in this manner, (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>) as the back of the neck had no mark except the one made by this part of the rope, and there were two distinct lines in front—strangulation was caused by the pressure, and pulling it from behind, and towards the right side, supposing the party destroyed to be laying on the left side—the force or pressure must have been greater applied towards the right side in a direct line almost with the back line—I have not heard that the rope was found tied in a knot, on one side, till just at this moment—that might have altered its position in part, in the removal—the body was placed on the box—the whole trunk when I saw it appeared as if it had been so placed after life had left the body—the rope must have been tied round the neck during life-time, from the marks and discolourations following from the pulling—I did not per<lb/>ceive any mark, as if made by a knot—if the knot was pulled back, it would be loose from the neck—there was no mark of the knot on the neck—the rope would be loose after it was let go—I examined her hands—there was nothing amounting to the marks I expected to see, as the consequence of the force used to make the marks on the neck.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In such a case would you expect to find the body in that position? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was found on the box, flat on the back—almost directly over the box, about four feet above the box there were five or six pegs—I tested those pegs with my fore-finger to see if they would bear the body, and I found that I could easily bring them down if I continued very little pressure—they would not bear the body—neither of them appeared to have been disturbed—my attention has not been directed to the bed—neither then or since—I did not perceive anything at the back of the neck beyond the mark—there were no bruises about her person at all, with the exception of that I have already explained—there was no bruise on the head as if a fall had taken place—there was no mark on the back of the head or neck, besides the mark round the neck—there was no mark about the body at all, except round the neck—after death there was a discoloration abont the arm-pits, which is common after violent death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the bed to have been found in a wet state, would you draw any inference from that circumstance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not certain—it is an ordi<lb/>nary thing for the urine to be voided under strangulation or hanging, but of course, as I do not know the precise nature of the fluid, it is impossible for me to say; it is an ordinary circumstance for urine to be voided where death is caused by strangulation.</p>

               <p>up and say, "Aunt, feel my head, the heat of my head"—I have felt it, and have felt it very hot indeed and throbbing—she was constantly complain<lb/>ing of her head, both before she had the child and since—I remember her coming from Mrs. Collard's—she complained of her head a great deal more after she came from Mrs. Collard's than before—when my daughter came in and inquired about the baby, the prisoner appeared like a dis<lb/>tracted person—she lifted up her hands and exclaimed, "Oh my baby! there! there!"—she did not touch her head—she lifted up her hands—except when subject to those pains in her head, her conduct was uniformly very gentle and kind, both before and after she had this child, and particu<lb/>larly so to this child—I have not seen the first child—from all I have heard as to her conduct as a mother, it has been uniformly kind, attentive, and affectionate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Edmonton. I was called up on Thursday morning, the 11th of Dec, about four o'clock, to see the body of a child that had been found in the water—the child was shown to me by Sergeant Harrison at the station-house—the face was swollen, the limbs extremely rigid, and there was the general appearance usually discover<lb/>able in drowned persons—there was a peculiar rosy appearance of the surface—the child's night-clothes were wet—it appeared to have been drowned, and, from the coldness of the body I thought it had been dead several hours—on the following day, Friday, the 12th, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found no external marks of violence on the body—on examining the interior I found nothing indicating an unhealthy state—the lungs and brain were gorged with blood—that is a result which generally follows from death by drowning, and the blood was dark and fluid—I have not the slightest doubt the death was caused by drowning—I attended the prisoner a year and a half ago—I then considered her in a weakened, debilitated state of health—one result of that was her hair falling off—I recommended her head should be shaved in consequence of that—I do not know whether it was shaved—a general state of physical debility would be likely to affect the nervous centres undoubtedly—it might produce functional disturbance of the brain, and would unquestionably at times affect the reasoning powers—it would bring about partial insanity—I have not attended her since that time, a year and a half ago—I attended her for a cold in the spring of 1844—I cannot remem<lb/>ber whether it was before or after that, that I recommended her hair to be shaved off—I have not attended her within the last twelve months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you only attend her once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only once, with the exception of once being asked my opinion relative to her hair.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a subject in the state of general debility in which you found the prisoner had subsequently become a mother, and had suddenly lost her milk, would not that add very materially indeed to the probability that it would affect the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most decidedly so; and if it did affect the brain it would unquestionably produce temporary derangement—I have been in Court during the examination of the witnesses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, having heard the representations made by her family, her com<lb/>plaints constantly of her head, the failure of her milk, and the other circum<lb/>stances, do you not not think it highly probable that she might have had an affection of the brain, attended by temporary derangement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is my decided opinion.</p>

I know Mr. Rentoul; he is a moneyer of the Mint—he called on me on Sunday, the 24th of Aug., at my house, and requested me to look out for a lodging for a foreigner, who wanted them; in consequence of which I saw Mrs. Naylor, of No. 34, Gloucester-street, Queen-square—I afterwards saw the prisoner Bull at Anderton's Hotel—I took him to Mrs. Naylor's house, and arranged for him to lodge there—I think he was to pay 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I saw him there on the Sunday following, the 31st of Aug.—he spoke broken English—I managed to understand him with great difficulty—he said he wanted a frame or some paper made, about 2000 sheets, and asked me to get it for him, and gave me a pattern for the colour—it was red—it was like this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at part of a genuine Norwegian note, marked No.</hi> 1)—he at the same time showed me the piece of white paper produced (No. 15)—he wanted me to get this sort of paper with the word "Lottery" on it—it was to be this colour and these marks—I understood him it was to be a frame formed to produce this water-mark—the water-mark was to be like this, but it was to be the colour of the other paper—I cannot swear this is the very paper he showed me, but it is like it—it is a drawing of the water-mark lines, not having a water-mark on it—I will not swear it is the identical paper, but it closely resembles it—when he gave mo the order about it I did not exactly under<lb/>stand him, and asked whether all these lines were to be in the water-mark, as was in the paper—he said it was to be very exact—I pointed to the wordsin German text, and he said, "Exactly"—I did not under<lb/>stand the words—they are "Norges' Bank"—he said that was his name—there is the word "Lottery" here—it is high up, and might be cut off, if ne<lb/>cessary, leaving "Norges' Bank" in this little square—I was to get the paper if I could—I took the drawing of the water-mark, and the coloured paper, to assist me in inquiring about it—at the time I had this conversation with hitn there were drawing materials on his table, and several papers—this was at No. 34, Gloucester-street—I noticed a piece of coloured paper like this</p>

                  </hi>. I hold a situation in the Mint. I was at Stockholm last Aug.—I left there on Thursday, the 14th of Aug., for Lubeck, by a steam boat—the prisoner Bull was a passenger on board—I had some con<lb/>versation with him, not much—we talked about painting generally—he said he was going to London to paint a large picture for some gentleman there—he said he had painted a picture for king Oscar—we arrived at Lubeck on Sunday, the 17th—I stopped at Lubeck six or seven hours, and then went on to Hamburgh, where I arrived the same night—I saw Bull at Hamburgh several times—I observed that he had about him some English money and a Norwegian note—the colour of the note was pink—I believe the pink colour ia confined to notes of certain value—in consequence of something that passed between me and a gentleman, I asked Bull if he would like to change his Norwegian money for English money, knowing this gentleman, who waa going to Norway, would change with him—he said no, he would keep it till it returned to his own country—I do not know whether he had only one note—it appeared a small pile—I only saw it in his pocket-book—we left Hamburgh for London by the <hi rend="italic">John Bull</hi> steamer on the Tuesday—Bull was a passenger—we had some conversation on the way on different subject—we talked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184512150038"/>
               <p>about painting—nothing was said about the price of pain ting on that voyage, but between Stockholm and Lubeck we had conversation about bis beings artist—he asked about English manufactures in general, and about paper manufacturing in particular—he said he wanted some paper—he asked if there were any paper-manufacturers in London, that he wanted to get some made for a friend, a young man at Stockholm—I asked him what kind of paper, because he could buy any paper in London without having it made, but lie said he wanted it of a particular colour, with what I understood him to meta a particular water-mark—he asked me if I could recommend him to an hotel—we had a very stormy passage indeed—we were obliged to put back to Cuxhaven once—it was at night, and I only know of once—I saw Bull at hi lodging in Gloucester-street after he came to London—he asked me abotf! getting paper made, if I could tell him where to get it—I had sent the witness Smith to him—he said he had seen Smith, but be could not under<lb/>stand what he wished to have done—he said he wanted to have paper made with a particular water-mark—he spoke English—he showed me a piece of white paper with the word "Lottery" on it—it was not either of these (looking at two)—I said I would call on him next day, and take him to some stationers—I did not call, for I was ill, and have not seen him since.</p>

Bull said he expected his friend in England—he afterwards told me he had arrived—I think that was two or three days before the prisoner Smith came—he said he had come from abroad, he did not say where from, and he would be at my lodging in a day or two—I believe Smith called at my house one day before he came to sleep in my house, but I was not at home at the time—he came on Thursday, the 2nd of Oct., and slept that night in the up-stairs room, in the same room with Bull—he came about the middle of the day—Bull came with him—they came in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Smith had ft portmanteau, a carpet bag, and a hat-box—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the things found hy Forrester at the lodging</hi>)—this black portmanteau is Bull's, and this it his carpet bag and blue hat-box—this other portmanteau, carpet bag, and leather hat-box, are Smith's—soon after Smith's arrival I saw this green dressing-case—one morning after Smith came, Bull came down stairs, and asked me to dry a piece of pink paper by the fire—he brought it from his room—I believe I was in the kitchen when I was called—I went up stairs into the passage—three stairs lead from the passage towards the kitchen—Bull was on the first floor stairs when he called me, but he came down to the ground floor, and I met him at the foot of the stairs, in the passage—I do not think</p>

               <p>High Holborn. On the 15th Sept. last, I received an order from the prisoner Bull to make a block—he gave me a pattern from which I was to make it—the first time he gave it me in pencil—the second time he gave me this pat<lb/>tern (No, 16)—that was two or three days after be gave me the first—I did not attempt to make anything till he brought that—the second time he came was on the 15th—he did not care what it was made upon, anything that would make an impression would do—I proposed to him that it should be made on copper—that is the ordinary way—I told him it would be the cheapest way—it would present a difficulty to anybody not acquainted with the print<lb/>ing trade to take an impression from it—I explained to him if it was done on copper it would be necessary to have a press, but it would be about half the price—he said he wanted it so that he could press it down himself, and it was agreed to be engraved on brass—I showed him a block of brass something similar to this, and asked him if that was what he meant—it had an Oriental pattern on it—he said that would do very well—the price agreed on was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit—he threw down 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he wanted it directly—I told him he could not have it under three weeks—I gave him a receipt for the deposit on one of ray master's cards—this is it (No. 17)—I also wrote on this card the price for which the work was to be done, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when this pat<lb/>tern was put into my hand, I was told to be very particular about the number of lines that were to be put—there were to be thirteen lines on the left-hand corner of the note, that is, the right-hand corner of the block—he brought this piece of paper with him (No. 18), and he wrote upon it his name and address in my presence—I did not exactly know whether he said thirteen or thirty lines—I got him to write it down, and he wrote the figures "13"—I did not exactly understand the shading of the border in one particular part, and he made a sketch of it on the paper to make me understand it—it was by means of the sketch that I was able to understand what the border was to be—he made that in my presence—I took particular notice of his writing when he wrote his name and address—I believe the address on this letter, (No. 22) "34, <hi rend="italic">Gloucester-street, Queen-square, Blumsbrey</hi>," to be his hand<lb/>writing—he was to call in eight days to see how far we got on with the block—he waited ten days, and then called—that was the 25th Sept.—I showed him the state in which it was—on Tuesday, the 30th Sept., he called again to see the block—he was alone—I showed it him—it was then in a more forward state—he said he must go to Germany, and pressed me to get on with it—I promised it in a day or two—he did not call again until the Fri<lb/>day, the 3rd Oct., between two and three in the afternoon—I showed him the block—he seemed to approve of it very much—while he was looking at it I saw him beckoning to a person at the door, which person was looking in at the side window—I did not take particular notice of that person till Bull called him in—it was the prisoner Smith—he came and took the block in his band and looked at it—this is the block, and it was in this state on that occasion—Bull put it into Smith's hands—they both together moved to the door, each of them looked at it very minutely, and Smith nodded his head as if he approved of it, and spoke something in their language—Bull was showing it to him—I promised Bull he should have the block in two or three days.</p>

               <p>"London, Aug. 28, 1845.</p>
               <p>No. 22. "My dear Friend,—At last I have the pleasure to be able to inform thee of my safe arrival at this place, which took place on Sunday evening, by the steam-boat <hi rend="italic">John Bull.</hi> My stay at Hamburgh was only two days, very pleasant. I got thy bill immediately paid. The same man inquired if thou wast, or soon wouldst go to Norway; which I answered; and further there was no more said about it. The voyage from Hamburgh to this place was very stormy. Twice we put to sea, and twice we were compelled to put back to Cuxhaven. We in consequence arrived fifty-two hours later than we should have done. It was only a couple of days after which I really could recover myself, and begin to think upon matters and things, of which I have as yet not much to communi<lb/>cate to thee. Nevertheless, I am sure of the result of the case. The drawing for the frame I have worked at for two days. Yesterday I took it to an iron worker, who promised to make it closely after the drawing.</p>
               <p>"It is so precisely measured off that not a hair is wanting thereon. Now I am at work with the drawing for the letters: so soon as it is ready, as well as the stamps, they shall be ordered. Here are plenty of those who make such things when one has only money to pay with; but money must not be spared, then every thing goes. With respect to the paper, I shall no doubt be compelled to go to one of the small manufacturers in one of the minor towns: however, I have found a kind of red paper which is very nearly like. We require only to dissolve it, and put it in the mould. Nevertheless, there is much trouble attending it: at the manufactories they do it immediately. In the meantime I long for and rejoice at, as well as it will be necessary for the progress of the case, that thou without fail comest here as soon as thou canst. Thou must absolutely come, dost thou hear? I have now a private lodging, where my address is No. 34, Gloucester-street, Queen-sq., Blumsbrey.</p>
               <p>"If thou goest to Hull, and thence travellest by the steam-boat, (which is much cheaper than by the steam-carriage,) I will be there to receive thee: thou canst have here a lodging at my landlady's, (a very nice woman,) by the side of me. Thou needest not put up at any hotel, which is so cursedly ex<lb/>pensive; only drive immediately here. I have already spoken of it to my landlady. This part of the town is very quiet; no plays, as in the other part of the town. Thou needest no passport, no one will ask thee about it. As yet I have seen nothing here; everything, however, is dear enough, although I live as economically as I can. When thou arrivest, and everything is in order, then first shall I derive pleasure from it. Here it is very dull; and God knows what the Englishmen, in fact, amuse themselves with. They play seldom at cards, billi? as, or any kind of game. I find it terribly dull. I will now hasten to execute what I have in hand, and then leave here again.</p>
               <p>"A young Englishman who was on board the steam-boat has requested me that I would paint him for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. If I can get time I will; but, however, not before everything is brought in order. Further I have not to communicate to thee, but request of thee to come hither as soon as possible after the receipt of this. Write when and by what opportunity I may expect thee.</p>
               <p>"Be assured that everything shall go well—that nothing is in the way. Live well in the meantime. Write soon, and be heartily greeted by thy friend,</p>

On the night before the robbery, about a quarter to nine o'clock, he came to my house with another man—the other one asked me about some rolls which I had—the prisoner did not say anything in particular—when I heard of the robbery I went in search of the prisoner—I found him in a house in Vine-court, Spitalfields—I asked him whether he had been in Hart's-lane last night after he left our house—he said he had not—I asked who he had with him last night—he said, "No one; what is that to do with you?"—I said, "Was you at Mr. Gar<lb/>ner's last night?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Were you in bed last night?"—he said, "I was"—I said, "You must come with me; I see you will not tell me anything"—directly I lifted up his cloth waistcoat I saw he had a waistcoat on under it which I had seen Garner wear—I took him to Mr. Garner's, and when we got there I said, "Let me see if you have got Gar<lb/>ner's handkerchief in your hat"—I took off his hat, and the handkerchief was in it—Mr. Garner came in then—the waistcoat and handkerchief were given to the police at the station.</p>

The prisoner was there quarrelling and fighting with a woman—I took hold of him, and desired him to go away—he immediately turned round and faced me—I took hold of him by the arm—he struck me two severe blows in the face, knocked me down, and then commenced uavagely beating and kicking me while on the ground—I struggled to get up, to use my staff or rattle, which were in my pocket—I received a blow on my forehead, which stunned me and blinded me with the blood—I received the blow either from the prisoner's foot or fist—I could not say which, in the struggle—a woman screamed out, "Murder!"—the prisoner then left me, my brother constable coming up at the same time—I saw the prisoner hide in a doorway—my brother constable went and took hold of him, and I assisted in securing him—I have been under medical treatment—I went off immediately to the hospital, but having a family I did not wish to stop there, and was sent home—the police-surgeon bus attended me ever since—the blow cut my forehead open, and it bled very much.</p>

I said, "I have no money; and if I had, it would do you no good to have more than you have;" he put up his hand and said, "The sooner you go the better," and struck me with his staff; he put me right before him, and made a violent blow at my bead with his staff; I stooped my head down, and he fell down on his hands and face on the road; I walked away to get clear of him; it is the first time I was ever before a Judge, and I hope it will be the last.</p>

I was leaving a situation at No. 65, Fetter-lane—I just took my wages, and was walking down Leather-lane—there was a Guy Fawkes and some fire-works—while I was there the prisoner Hore came up to me, and I felt his hand in my pocket—I took hold of it, and he made his escape and ran away—I looked at his face when I took hold of his hand—I am sure he is the person—when he ran away I ran after him—I had in my pocket five sovereigns, and twelve shillings and sixpence, and he took it all—I had not a penny-piece more than he took—it was what I had earned for my wages while I was in service—I caught Hore, and charged him with robbing me—I had not been showing my money to anybody, and do not know how he knew I had it—when I caught the prisoner there was no policeman by—there was a postman standing by, and a young woman, who is here—they said I should not part with Hore till they saw a policeman—the prisoner Pocock then came up—he said that Hore had none of my money, he scratched my hands, and I was obliged to let Hore go—I did not see Pocock at the time Hore took my money—it was in a silk glove, inside a leather glove, in my pocket, which was inside two of my pet<lb/>ticoats—the money and the gloves were gone, and none of them have been found since.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Baldwin-street, St. Luke's, and am a carpenter. On the 2nd Dec. I was at the bar of a public-house—Salter and a man were there—I treated them to some gin, and they invited me to their home—they were quite strangers to me, but I went with them—I had had something to drink—I found Barnett in bed in the bed-room to which Salter aud the man took me—after they gave me something to drink, I asked them if they could find me a convenient room to sleep in—they said they could, and told me to go to a room up stairs—I took a light and went up stairs to the top room—I went to bed there—I put my watch, chain, and keys, under the pillow under my head—when I had been in bed a short time Salter came into the room and pretended to be sick, but whether she was or not I cannot tell—she came to the side of the bed, and was standing there—she went away in about five minutes, and when she was gone I felt for my watch and could not find it—I put on my clothes and came down—I found Mrs. Barnett in bed, and the man and Salter were gone away—I went into Goswell-street—I found two policemen, and Salter was taken and discharged—I had left a truss behind me in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, William Reeve, as pawnbrokers, in Gray's Inn-lane. The prisoner was in our service six weeks on liking, as an apprentice—this handkerchief now produced I saw in the warehouse last Saturday night—it is the property of my brother and myself—I missed it on the Sunday, between twelve and one o'clock in the day—the prisoner had had leave to go home to his parents for that day—I directly went after him to his parents'—he opened the door to me—I expected to find him there—I asked him for the shawl-patterned handkerchief which he had—he said, "Master, I have got it, it is on the drawers in the room"—I found it there—I asked if he had got anything else—he denied it at first—I told him to turn out his pockets, and said I should give him into custody—he said, "Master, pray, don't; I will give you all I have"—he took this white handker<lb/>chief from his pocket, and gave it to me—it is my own property—I then took him to the station.</p>

On Monday evening, the 17th of Nov., I went home at six o'clock, and left home about five minutes past six—I fastened up my pigeon-house, and know that the pigeons were in it—I came back about ten, found the pigeon-house broken open, and three pigeons gone.</p>

On Monday afternoon, the 1st of Dec., between four and five o'clock, I hired a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in the Haymarket—I saw a portmanteau and a carpet-bag belonging to me put into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I waited at the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> door a short time while the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> was gone in for more luggage—I then went away for about three or four minutes, and on my return a man came and told me something, and I missed my carpet-bag from the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—it contained the articles stated—I afterwards saw it at the station—this now produced is it—I know the bag, and these things are all my property, and have my name upon them—I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody at the station—he then had on a pair of boots belonging to me—they were made in Canada—I know them to be mine.</p>

I have been acting for the trustees of a charity instituted by Sir John Cass for a free school at Aldgate—Sir Jamet Flower and others are the trustees—the houses Nos. 1 and 2, Nursery-place, Hackney, in the parish of St. John's, Hackney, belong to the trustees—I act there for Sir James Flower and others—I remember seeing coppers in those houses about six weeks ago—I went there on the 3rd of Dec.—I found the coppers of Nos. 1 and 2 were missing—I have seen them since in the possession of the police—I fitted them both to the places, and reversed them—I have no doubt they are the coppers that came from there—one would not fit both apertures—they were set in brickwork—they are of the ordinary size, about eighteen inches, but were not quite circular—when they got into the aper<lb/>ture they fitted exactly—there could be no possible doubt about them—there is a bump on one side of one of them—the prisoner lived very near the houses, and has resided there for eight years, as I learn—he is a marine-store dealer.</p>

Powell took two bars off the track, and went into the shop—I saw these bolts and iron put into the scale in fhe shop by Fairchild—I took Fairchild into custody—when Fairchild took the bolts in he was in three minutes, and then Powell took the bars in—he came out and saw me catch hold of Fairchild, and he drove his horses off—I took Powell that evening—I told him I wanted him on suspicion of stealing some iron from the railway—he said he was very sorry for what he had done—he did not say he had been employed by any one to do it.</p>

I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery—on the 7th Nov. the prisoner came to our barracks at Woolwich—he proposed selling watches—he showed me a watch which he said was a lever watch, worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said it was an excellent good one—I showed my watch to him—he said it was not a nice one—he said the value of his fine lever watch was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would take mine for it, if I would give him 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would not give it him—he then came down to 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him that and my watch for his—here is the watch 1 got from him—I have kept it till now—I got it from him about two o'clock in the day, it was then going, and it went till about one o'clock that night, it then stopped—it would go sometimes for a few minutes after that, and then stop again—it was of no use at all—mine kept good time, and would go very well—I have not seen it since—it was silver, not a leverone—it was rather larger than this that I got of the prisoner—I gave 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for it, and had had it about twelve months.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker, and live in William-street, Woolwich. These watches, which the prisoner sold to Brown and Whealon, are very common indeed, as common as could be made—they will not do the work of a watch in any way—they are of no use—this one is run down now—it would just go while he could sell it, and no more—it would cost about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. making—the valuable part is the case, which would fetck above 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is a pretty neat looking watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Charles Shaw, of No. 11, Terrace, Walworth, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. The prisoner Mary had been in my service for two years, about ten years ago—Caroline Was ten years in my service, and was so in Oct.—I know her family—on the 20th of Oct. Miss Cathcart was expected in town, and I found a box of plate of hers, which was under our bed open, and the plate gone, and asked Caroline for the duplicates—I said she had done very wrong, and insisted on having the duplicates—she brought them to me—I looked at them, and, finding several were run out, I gave her</p>

               <p>the money to redeem them, that the plate should not be lost—I think there were seventeen duplicates, and, besides them, three in paper—among them was one for a silver coffee-pot—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one produced by Morton</hi>)—this is it—I really cannot remember whether this relates to Miss Catheart's coffee-pot or mine, but I believe it is my own, pawned for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I spoke to Caroline on the 20th of Oct., she would not say anything, nor look me in the face—I was very angry with her—she said that was all there was, and there was not a single thing in the house of mine or Mr. Shaw's pledged—(I gave these duplicates to Mr. Shaw at night when he came home)—I told her it was all done, and Mr. Shaw must know, and the consequences must take their course—when Mr. Shaw came home I told him.</p>

On Thursday, the 27th of Nov., about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the neighbourhood of Peacock-street, about thirty or forty yards from the corner of Peacock-street—I turned down Lower Kennington-lane, which nearly faces Peacock-street—it is in an oblique direction—you can see it—I was at the corner of the lane, just at the junc<lb/>tion of the two roads—I had been walking along that side of the road, and when I got near the corner I heard an explosion of fire arms from behind me, which was in the direction of Peacock-street—I looked, and per<lb/>ceived a man running down Kennington-lane—he was followed by several others calling out to stop him—I stood on one side till the man who wai being pursued came up to me, and as he passed me I seized him by the collar—it was the prisoner—some of the others who were pursuing him came up, and one of them attempted to take him by the collar also—that was done rather roughly, and the prisoner said, "One is enough," or "That it enough," I do not exactly know which—he said, "Take me to the station-house"—I went with him to the station—I saw him searched—before he was searched, the officer asked him if he had any knife, or scissors, or pistol—he said no he had not—they were about to search him, when he put his hand in his right hand trowsers pocket and drew out a pistol—the inspector or a policeman seized his hand—I saw something in his hand, and the pistol wai taken from him—I noticed that it had been recently discharged—the cock was down and a portion of the exploded cap on it.</p>

               <p>drawers, or the little devils will be out upon you"—there were some drawers there—he appeared at the moment to be under the delusion that something was coming out of the drawers—that must have been twenty-three or twenty-four years ago—it was before he met with the falls—the prisoner's mother is between fifty and sixty years of age, a little better than fifty I should say, but having been so little at home I knew very little of the family—I have noticed since the prisoner's return from sea, that his conduct and character has changed—I had no intention of discharging him—I had desired him, if an opportunity offered for employment, to take it, because I expected to be slack in the winter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had any supposed representation made by Fitzgerald to you, made you tell him that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nor did I tell him it was on account of anything Fitzgerald had told me that I intended to discharge him—I did not know that Fitzgerald had told my wife anything, till after I had told the prisoner if work offered to take it—when I saw him on the Saturday neither I or my wife conveyed to him in any way that it was in consequence of what Fiti<lb/>gerald had said that I wished him to find employment elsewhere—Fitggerald and he always appeared to be on good terms, and too intimate, according to my wish—I do not mean improperly intimate, but with regard to drink—I have known instances in which my attention has been called to the mode of conduct and behaviour of the prisoner—I first observed the change three or four weeks before this happened—that was before Fitzgerald had communi<lb/>cated anything to my wife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it appear to you, from anything the prisoner said at the time your wife spoke to him about Fitzgerald, that he was harbouring or entertaining any feeling of resentment towards Fitzgerald? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I gave him no reason to suppose that my object, in recommending him to find employment elsewhere, had any reference to what Fitzgerald had said—I have sever seen him bum out into fits of extravagant passion without any apparent cause—I have only heard of it—it was about three or four weeks before this matter happen<lb/>ing that I first observed his conduct to change, and that change was in conse<lb/>quence of no reason—if I saw him doing what was not right I used to tell</p>

On Saturday evening, the 22nd Nov., I was at the shop of Mrs. Tubbs, a general-dealer, in New-cut, Lambeth, and as near eight o'clock as possible the prisoner came up to the shop—he took a pistol in his hand and examined it—I was inside the shop, and he was on the outside—there was a gas-lamp in the shop, shining on him—it is an open-fronted shop, with goods hanging up in front—after he had examined the pistol for a minute or two, he pulled the trigger, and the cock broke—he was obliged to pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the damage he had done to the pistol—he afterwards came into the shop, and walked up to the desk where the shopman was, and I walked up to the desk too—he bought another pistol, for which he paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and took it away—I did not examine it—it was like the one produced.</p>

               <p>"Nov. 19th, 1845. Mr. Green,—Sir,—I fully purposed seeing you this morning, and to endeavour to finally settle with you, but unfortunately I was disappointed of receiving some money a friend promised to advance for me, so as to have nothing left between you and me. I wrote you last night, but I was in such an agitated state of mind that I actually closed it without mentioning anything about Divers' account. I, in July last, purchased a horse of Hockley, of Hull, for the sum of 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which I paid in cash, and the remaining 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be settled upon my next journey. Not going there again, I have thought it best to put it together with the other account, and if you will oblige me with Divers' account of what I received of him, and allow me without any trouble to amicably settle with you, you may depend upon receiving the whole of what I owe you on Saturday, by either appointing some one here to receive the amounts, whatever they are, or I will either send it to you or bring it myself, upon the promise from you that I shall not be molested; and if there should happen to be anything else which I am not aware of, that there possibly can, and you must know of all by this time, as you have written to them, pray let me know of it, as I would, nay more, I have parted with almost every thing that I am worth, which is but little, but enough to settle with you, as merely the idea of being accused of embezzlement is quite biifficicnt to harrow up my feelings; and if you should</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184512150149"/>
               <p>feel disposed to take a harsh view of the case, first of all, Sir, pray consider my poor wife, who is daily expecting to be confined, and what is to become of her if anything should happen to me, and then my poor children, owing to the misfortune of their wretched parent, doomed to poverty and beggary—but, Sir, I cannot think that you could find it in your heart to act thus to me, considering at the same time that if my orders had been executed I should have been in a position quite different to what I am now; instead of begging of you to be lenient, and to receive the money due to you, I should have had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket, and have been comfortable in the good esteem of yourself; but, Sir, it is not to be so, and you deferred building too long, and the consequence is, I am ruined to all intents and purposes; but let it be, I entreat of you, without a blemish on my character, so that I can by assiduity and perseverance again rise to comfort and respect<lb/>ability. I do not ask of you to take anything off either by comraissioa or any other means, neither do I ask of you to take a bill, or to give me time, but I merely ask of you to let me pay you, and at once, all I owe you, and if you do so, unmixed prosperity and plenty, with happiness, must be your lot. I cannot say anything more to you upon the subject, my spirits have quite failed me, and I feel quite undone, although I can appeal with a clear con<lb/>science to a higher tribunal than any earthly one, that I never intended to defraud you of a single shilling, and again, there is plenty to pay you with. I hope, Sir, the manner of my settling with you, and now giving up all, will be sufficient to convince you that I had no idea of owing either of the amounts save Mr. Hackney's, which I proposed going over to refund to him.</p>

               <p>"Broughton-lane, Manchester, Nov. 12th, 1845. Mr. Divers,—Dear Sir,—About the 17th of April last I received some money from you on account of Mr. Green, of Lambeth, London. I at the time omitted to put down the amount and particulars of the settlement, so that I am not able to pay the amount to Mr. Green in regular course; and being about to commence busi<lb/>ness for myself as above, I have taken the liberty of writing to you to be kind enough to forward me the particulars per return of post, and I will return the money to you, so that you can pay it to my successor on the next journey, which I expect will not be long first. Requesting you to keep this strictly private from every one, as Mr. Green, if he knew it, might feel disposed, although I don't think be would, to look at it in a wrong light. I am happy to say that we parted very friendly.</p>

I was in High-street, in the Borough, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, on the 8th of Dec., crossing over opposite St. George's church, towards London-bridge—the prisoner accosted me, and asked me to go home with her—I refused—she pressed me to go down each turning we came to, till we came to King-street—she there hustled me, got her arm round me, and squeezed me fight, and then was about to leave me—I felt three sovereigns and a half safe in my pocket while I was opposite St. George's church, and after she felt in<lb/>clined to leave me I missed my money—she had all the time while walking, a*kcd me to treat her or go home with her, which I refused; but when I missed my money I said, "Come and have something to drink here"—I took</p>

I attended the Police-court for the prisoner—I cross-examined the prosecutor—I asked him whether he would swear he was absolutely sober, and in answer to that he said, "I will not swear I was absolutely sober," but he would not admit he was drunk—I asked the policeman one question and he gave me an answer, and then the Magistrate asked him the question again as to whether one policeman did not walk immediately behind the prisoner, and one have hold of her hand, so that she could not get rid of any<lb/>thing, and his answer was, "No"—to the best of my recollection, that was the only question put—I have mislaid the notes I took.</p>
