On the morning of the 1st of February I began work at six o'clock; I was at farrier's work in the shop - when this happened I was mending the iron step of a cabriolet; it was in a heated state, but not red-hot - the prisoner stood on the left-hand side of me; the step was hot- the prisoner said nothing to me, but took the step out of my hand and struck me with it on my hand; it was then in a hot state - I took it out of his hand and said "George why don't you let me do what I have got to do with it?" I was working on it for about half a minute, and I then received a blow on the head; I do not know how, or by whom it was given - it produced a fractured skull; I have been in the hospital, and have been out of my mind since - Peacock and Carrington were present when the blow was given.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had not the prisoner directed you to strike the step on the crown, as it is called? A. No he did not; William Saunders might be in the shop, but I did not take notice of him; I had not pushed the prisoner at all - I swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not strike him with the hot step on the back of his hand and burn him? A. I did not, I am quite certain; I never asked anybody whether I could get my expences if I prosecuted him only for a common assault; I have known him about twelve months - it all took place in less than five minutes.</p>
               <p>A JUROR. Q. Did you know what instrument you were struck with? A. No.</p>

            . I am a farrier. On the 1st of February I was in Davis's shop with Chalk and Lemon; I was about six or seven feet from Chalk who was altering or mending a step - I saw the prisoner and him twisting together with the step, but whether any blows passed I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand did the step get into at last? A. Chalk's - he got it back, and while he was altering or mending it, this chisel lay by the side, and Lemon took it up; Lemon was holding his hand, whether it was hurt or not I cannot say; he turned and took up the chisel - he stood a minute, till Chalk was leaning over the anvil - he then struck it down on his forehead; he then threw it down and immediately went away, out of the shop: I caught Chalk or he would have fallen - the blow struck him rather above the forehead - it bled.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might elapse between the twisting and when you saw the blow struck? A. About a minute; we led Chalk to a surgeon's - he was taken to a public-house, and in about three hours he was taken to the hospital; he was struck with the cutting part of the instrument.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. They were struggling together about the step? A. Yes; the step was hot; I did not see the prisoner's hand then; but at Hatton Garden on Saturday I saw him with a sear on the back of his hand, but how it was done I cannot say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it a scar? A. Something of a mark - I was not very near him, but I saw a mark; he shewed it to the magistrate; I do not know that I ever saw him before that day - the whole affair might have occupied three or four minutes.</p>

            . I am a farrier. I was in the shop and saw Chalk mending a step; Lemon came and interfered with him - he tried to twist the step out of his hand; after that he stood for a little while - a minute I suppose; then he took up the chisel and struck him with the edge of it over his forehead - it bled; there were two streams of blood - I went with him to Mr. Headlam the surgeon, and in two or three hours he was taken to the hospital; I heard nothing said before it happened - after Lemon struck him he threw the chisel down, and went out saying "That serves you right."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe the back of Lemon's hand? A. No; I heard him complain of his hand as soon as the twist was over; before he struck Chalk he said he had hurt his hand - the step had been heated; Chalk had a fur cap on: William Saunders is a fellow-workman - he was in the shop.</p>

I am a surgeon and live in Featherstone-buildings; I know this shop and believe it is in the parish of St Andrew's, Holborn - it is in Middlesex. On the 1st of February, about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning, the prosecutor was brought to me; he had received a wound on the front and upper part of his head, about two or three inches in length - it appeared to have been produced by an instrument with an obtuse cutting edge, similar to that produced; the sharp edge of it would produce it - the edge is not very sharp, and it might produce such a wound; the blow appeared to have produced a concussion of the brain - he was removed from my house to bed; and in three hours he was bled in the arm at the public-house and taken to the hospital; the witnesses are in error, there was no fracture of the skull - a concussion of the brain is attended with danger of life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by obtuse? A. Not so sharp as a knife or sword; it resembled a wound caused by the joint effect of a blow and a cut.</p>

            . I am a surgeon and live in Jewin-street. On the 14th of February I was called in to the prosecutor - he had then been moved home from the hospital; he seemed at that time to be labouring under symtoms of a secondary nature - of low information in the brain, from the effect of a previous blow; there was a scab formed over the wound - I thought there might be matter in it; I ordered it to be poulticed and found there was no matter - he was not out of danger by any means when I first saw him; I have attended him till within the last fortnight, but he has not taken medicine for the last three weeks or a month; I have no doubt his illness was the result of the wound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I came into the shop, the man struck me over the hand, and burnt my hand; I was in pain from the burn - I caught hold of the chisel and hit him on the head; I did not mean to do him any harm.</p>

            . I was in the shop when this happened; I had the step to alter and took it to Chalk to do, and while he was doing it, when he had done a little of it, Lemon came into the shop and said "It wants a little more doing to it;" I took it again to the smith (Chalk) - Lemon stepped up and said "Charles, give it a blow or two there;" immediately after that Chalk said "D - n your eyes, what have you got to do with it;" and then made a hit at Lemon with the step, and struck him across the back of the hand; Lemon then rubbed his hand where it seemed to be hurt, and immediately laid hold of the chisel and struck Chalk on the head - he threw the chisel down on the ground and walked out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might have elapsed from the time he was rubbing his hand till he walked out? A. Scarcely half a minute; it was his duty to give orders, his father being the employer - he was in the habit of doing so.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. Did you see Peacock the day after the accident? A. Yes - I had no conversation with him then, but I had on the day this happened; I did not tell him I knew nothing of the business - I never told him so, I swear; I was a very short distance from the witnesses - they were at work. There was no scuffle between the prisoner and Chalk, about the step, if there had I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lemon say anything when he dropped the chisel and walked out? A. Not a sentence - I must have heard if he did: the witnesses were about the same distance from him as I was.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hatton-garden. On Sunday morning, the 9th of March, about eight o'clock, I was going up Theobald's-road, with Thompson, of Bow-street; we met the prisoner with three fenders on his shoulder - he was alone: there were two standards inside one fender. I went over to him, and asked where he got them - he rather hesitated, and said at last that he got them from Lincoln's Inn-fields, at a sale - he did not say when he had bought them; I took him into custody, locked him up, and found next morning that the fenders belonged to Sir George Farrant; directly I took him he said a man had given them to him to carry - I searched him, and found a screw-driver in his pocket, a small door key, which would open a room door, and a watch, which I returned him.</p>

These fenders, and several articles of furniture, were left there: Sir George had quitted the house, and it was to be let: I had been in the house on Tuesday, the 4th of March, and am sure all the doors and windows were fastened; I often passed the house; it appeared in the same state whenever I passed it; and on Saturday, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw it perfectly safe. About half-past two o'clock on Sunday, the 9th, I observed the coal-cellar door, in the front area, open; the fan-light over the area door was broken; I am certain it was safe and whole on Saturday. I went into the house, and missed two fenders out of the drawing rooms, and the parlour fender; I missed some stained glass out of a window in the house: the drawing-room shutters had been opened, but closed too - I had left them fastened; I know these fenders to be my master's - there is a knob off one of them, and I have it in my pocket; I am certain of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Sunday morning I got up about half-past seven o'clock, and went in a direction for Waterloo-bridge; on my way home I met a person I had seen twelve months ago; he had this property: I walked with him as far as Lincoln's Inn-fields; in the course of conversation he said he had to call at a place, and asked if I would take the fenders for him, and carry them to the corner of the King's-road, and he would see me there again - he did not think he should stop above three or four minutes; I took them, and as I was going in the direction he stated I was met by the officers - but as to the robbery I am entirely innocent.</p>

Thompson, Sen. had been employed at my house as a laundress during that week; I understood her to be a married woman. The 2d of February was on a Saturday - Thompson had done her employment on the 2d of February; had no other servant. I went out about nine o'clock that morning, leaving my wife and Elizabeth Smith alone, but nobody else; I returned about a quarter before two o'clock- I went up into the second floor front room, which I use as a sitting-room, as a study; I missed from there two coats; I was going to change my coats: I took no notice of it, except that Smith was in the room at the time, and I asked her where the coats were - she said she did not know: I said nothing more to her then; Mrs. Bartholemew was out; she came in a little after two o'clock, and went up stairs in the second floor back room, which was a bed-room; I still remained in the front room - Smith was still in the front room with me. I heard Mrs. Bartholemew call to Smith; the door between the room being open she called to Smith, and asked her if she had been emptying her drawers; Smith said she had not touched the drawers - I then said I missed two coats: my wife opened several drawers, but I was not in the room at that moment; we called in a neighbour or two, and I immediately went to Marlborough-street for an officer; I have never found my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100006"/>coats again - they were worth about 2l. 10s. together: very shortly after I missed some shirts and black stockings, some of which have been found; I saw them in the custody of Phillips, an officer.</p>

            . I am the wife of Valentine Bartholemew. I remember my husband going out on the morning of the 2d of February; I went out at half-past eleven o'clock, and left Elizabeth Smith in the house - nobody else to my knowledge; I believe she let me out, but am not certain: I returned a little after two o'clock; I went up stairs, passed through the front room, spoke to my husband, and then went into the back room - the two rooms communicate; I opened one of the top drawers, and found it empty - I called to Elizabeth Smith, who was in the front room, and said, "Why, Elizabeth, have you been taking any thing out of this drawer, and emptying it?" she said No, she had not touched it; my husband then said he missed two coats: I opened the other drawers, and found them all empty almost, except one; a great many articles were taken away - a few of them have since been found: five or six shawls were taken away; three of which, two good ones, and an old one have been found; one of those missing was worth about 2l. 10s., and the other about 30s.; I afterwards examined, and missed a silver watch from the front room chimney-piece; it was mine, and had been my father's; my husband was not in the habit of wearing it; I had seen it the day before, but do not recollect seeing it that morning; I had put it there to get mended several days before - it has not been found; it was an old silver French watch, worth about 10s. I suppose, but do not know the value; it had a glass on one side - I do not think it had a double case; some work-boxes were gone - two of them have been found. Susannah Thompson, Sen. had been employed in the house as a laundress, in the early part of the week, I think, but forget on what day. I missed some miniature portraits from the drawing-room where the small work-box was taken from - they have not been found- they were worth about 5l. I suppose; there was a snuff-box with my mother's portrait on it; it was my father's box; the box and all was gone - I suppose the whole together was worth 5l.; I missed more linen from the same room, also a gown and silk shawl. I never saw the younger Thompson at our house.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Sepulchre, part of which is in Middlesex. On the 2d of February about nine o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner Thompson, Sen. near the door of Mr. Stafford, a pawnbroker, in St. John's-street, in St. Sepulchre's parish; I did not know her before - she had a bundle in each hand; I asked her what she had got there, she said a box; I said"Who does it belong to?" she said it belonged to her daughter; I asked where her daughter lived; she said in Windmill-street, at the West end of the Town: I asked where she was going with it - she said she had just been and taken it out of pledge for her daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. Speakng of the box? A. Yes; I told her I did not believe that story as I knew she just had been offering to pledge it; I told her so - she said it was a fact and nothing but thetruth; I told her I should take her to the watch-house, she said very well, and I did so: I untied the bundle at the watch-house - one handkerchief contained the largest work-box and nothing else: I asked her what was in that box' she said it was a work-box: I said I saw it was - I turned it to the light to examine it, and finding the lock had been forced, I said "Oh! this ayn't all right." I untied the other bundle and found another smaller work-box on the top and that had been broken open; I found some shawls, and shirts and other things in that bundle; they are all here - I searched her person and found a pawnbroker's duplicate for another shirt, which the pawnbroker has here and belongs to the prosecutor; I found a small bit of soap in her pocket, which appeared to have been used - I asked if she had been at work with it, she said she had not been at work since the Wednesday; I produce the property which I found on her - I am a shoemaker by trade; I have no idea of the value of the work-box - it is fitted up.</p>

               <p>MRS. BARTHOLEMEW. I know this work-box - it is one of the things lost; it is fitted up; there were more things in it when I lost it; there was a gold seal; I know this small work-box and the other things here are three shawls, and this linen is all ours. All these things were missed from the house - I had seen the shawls safe - I had taken two of them off the evening before; part of the linen was in use; I had seen the large work-box that very morning just before I went out - my drawers were not locked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe Smith's box was opened and searched? A. Yes; Clements searched it; I was not present.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street Office. On the 2d of February Mr. Bartholemew came to the office, and I went to his house between two and three o'clock: I saw the prisoner Smith there, and questioned her who had been there, after her master and mistress went out: she said nobody; I said, "Have you been out yourself?" She said not. - I asked her who her acquaintances in London were; she said she had no acquaintances in London - that she came from Salisbury. I said it appeared very singular, for no force had been used, and the robbery must have been done by some person acquainted with the house; I told her so, she still said no one had been there, and she had not been out. I asked if she had lived in any other situation before she lived with Mr. Bartholemew; she said she had lived with Mrs. somebody (whom she named. but which I forget,) in Margaret-street, and that she had been a very short time at that person's house; that before that she lived with Mr. White, a shoemaker, in Oxford-street, and before that at Mr. Porter's, Sidney-street, Mile-end. I went to Sidney-street, and I found no such person; it was a new street, and not finished; I went in company with Mr. Bartholemew to this house in Margaret-street; and found the person she named, but whose name I forget. I left her in the custody of Goddard, and went out to make these enquiries with Mr. Bartholemew; and in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100007"/>consequence of information which I received, I went to No. 44, Windmill-street, and found Susannah Thompson, Jun. there, living by the name of Mrs. Williams; there was a man named William Wood with her; this was near six o'clock in the evening; I asked Susannah where her mother lived - she told me she lived in Noel-street, but that she had sent her to the City to get some money to pay her rent in Windmill-street; I went to Noel-street, leaving Goddard with her - I waited at Noel-street the greatest part of the night, expecting the elder Thompson to come, but she did not; I went back and took Elizabeth Smith to the watch-house - Avis, another officer took Susannah Thomposn, Jun. to the watch-house; I left Mr. Bartholemew at Noel-street while I was absent, and returned there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you told Smith no force was used, were you aware that Mrs. Bartholemew had left her drawers open? A. I was not aware of it then, I have since heard so - I should say I also examined several valuable dressing-cases at the house, which had been unlocked.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street - I went with Clements to Mr. Bartholemew's and heard the conversation he had with Smith - he has related it correctly - I was left with Susannah Thompson, Jun. but had no conversation with her: I should say, that in the absence of Bartholemew and the other witness I was alone with Smith for upwards of an hour; I did not desire her to make any confession, but she said she hoped that if Mr. Bartholemew and Clements had gone to Mrs. Thompson, that Mrs. Thompson would say Mrs. Thompson had not been there that day, for that Mrs. Thompson and her daughter had been there.</p>
               <p>Q. She said they had been there? A. Yes my lord.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she tell you at the same time that she was afraid of letting her master and mistress know these people had been there, as they had been forbidden the house? A. No; I sat down in the kitchen while she got her tea and cleaned herself: I asked her if Mrs. Thompson the charwoman had been there, and she denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not, in the course of the conversation, say that Mrs. Thompson had been denied the house by her mistress, which was her reason for saying at first she had not been there then? A. I recollect nothing of the sort - it could not have passed and I not recollect it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You at first enquired if Mrs. Thompson had been there? A. Yes, and she denied it; she afterwards said if Mr. Bartholemew and Clements were gone to Mrs. Thompson, that she hoped she would say she had not been there, but that she and her daughter had been there.</p>

            . I keep the Duke of Bedford public-house, Golden-lane; the name of the sign was changed on the licensing day, the 13th of March - it was called the Lionand Lamb in February; the prisoner Susannah Thompson, Jun. frequently came to my house with Wood, her husband; I think they have been there about half a dozen times, not more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect on any occasion, Susannah asking whether her mother had been there? A. I have some slight recollection of it; I think it was Wood or the woman, I cannot till who - it was in the evening, but I cannot tell on what day; I attended at Marlborough-street on the 8th, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the substance of the question to enquire whether her mother had been there? A. Yes; I am sure that was asked; that is all I recollect - I did not know her mother; I never saw her till I saw her at Marlborough-street, which was on the 13th of March, I think; Susannah Thompson, Jun. and Wood were at my house perhaps a week of a fortnight before that time - that was the last time that I saw them.</p>


               <p>MRS. BARTHOLEMEW. I went outabout half-past eleven o'clock that morning - Smith either opened the street door for me, and either shut it herself or I shut it myself - I am certain it was shut, it might be opened from without by a latch-key - my kitchen is down stairs in the basement, the house has two rooms on a floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the door was not left open when you left the house? A. I think not; she washed the door - but I think that was after I left. Two of these shawls are India, and worth about 26l. together - I did not buy them, they belong to my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. The two together then are certainly worth more than 10l.? A. O yes - Smith had been ten days in my service; I had her from a person in Margaret-street, where she had lived as a servant about a month, I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you forbidden either of the Thompson's your house? A. Not at all - I never saw the young one, and did not forbid the house to the mother; she was recommended to me by Elizabeth Smith; she came to the house one day as a charwoman - I believe it was the day after Smith came; she was afterwards there two days to wash and iron.</p>
               <p>MR. BARTHOLEMEW. When I came home, I knocked at the door, and rang I believe - Smith opened the door and let me in; it would require a latch-key and a large door key also to open the door from without - for both the latch and the bolt of the lock were kept fastened usually; it is a spring lock - it is possible the latch might not have been down, as it was occasionally propped up with a piece of wood, which we had frobidden - the lock was a good one, I had previously had it repaired.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you been out? A. I went out at nine o'clock and returned a little before two.</p>

            . I have come here in custody from Clerkenwell Prison - I was sent there on the Monday after the officer came and found me and Susannah together; I was taken on a charge of robbing Mr. Bartholemew's house - I know all the three prisoners; the younger Thompson lived with me at No. 44, Windmill-street - she lived there before I knew her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her, or her mother first? A. I knew her first - she came to see her brother in the ship which I came from Bermuda in; I had no connexious in London, and went home with her brother to lodge at her mother's house, at No. 5, Queen-street, which goes out of Windmill-street; I had returned from Bermuda about three months when I was taken up - I and Susannah had lived together from the time I came on shore, which was the 2d of December.</p>
               <p>Q. That would be but two months - did you ever go with Susan, the daughter, to Mr. Bartholemew's? A. Yes, on the Wednesday before the Saturday the robbery was committed, we went there and I lunched in the kitchen with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100008"/>Elizabeth Smith there, that was on the Wednesday before I was taken up; Mrs. Thompson was there ironing at the time - while I was there Smith told me she wished she had known I had been transported before; I had been transported for 14 years, but got the King's pardon after seven years for my good behaviour, and was allowed to return home.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to know you had been transported? A. I suppose Mrs. Thompson must have told her so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give any reason for wishing to have known it before? A. She said she could have loaded me and Mrs. Thompson, and all of us with plate, from where she had lived before; she asked me if I could sell some tea spoons for her that she had in pledge, and which she had taken from the place she was in before; she told me the first opportunity she had, she intended to take some property from Mr. Bartholemew, that there was not much plate there, but she would take what there was, mentioning what there was - she said she was tired of her place, for there was so much work to do; she said Mr. and Mrs. Bartholemew had a present made them a little before of some spoons, and I think a tea pot and fish slice; I do not think she said much more - Mr. Bartholemew came in; he knocked at the door, and before she went up to let him in, she put me and Thompson, Jun. in a kind of coal cupboard, under the stairs, and shut us in; I believe she then went up to let him in - either she or Mrs. Thompson did; I do not know whether he came down stairs - I heard him somewhere, and Smith gave him two letters, which I had seen come in while I was there; she then let us out and told us we had better go home - she said nothing more at that time; she had said that when Mr. and Mrs. Bartholemew were out, she would send for me down to Susannah Thompson; she did not say who she would send for me; I lived about a mile or more from Mr. Bartholemew's, this was on Wednesday, and on Friday evening Mrs. Thompson came to me; I cannot say at what time she told me I was to stop at home the next day, for Betsey (meaning Smith) would come or send down for me, for she wished to see me particularly; I cannot say whether Susannah was with me at this time - Mrs. Thompson slept there that night, and went out about nine o'clock in the morning and said she was going to Mr. Bartholemew's, at Foley-place - I staid at home - she went out alone - her daughter went out about an hour after that, it was before the mother returned; Mrs. Thompson returned first and told me Betsey wanted me; that I was to go with her directly; I went with her to Foley-place; I had not seen Susannah in the mean time; I did not go into the house - Mrs. Thompson said I had better go into the public-house and wait till she went, and told Betsey I was come; I went into the public-house, in Foley-place - I do not know the sign; Mrs. Thompson came to me there alone, in about ten or twenty minutes, and told me Smith wanted me; I went with her into Mr. Bartholemew's house - Betsey let us in; I did not see Susannah there at all - I had not seen her since she went out in the morning; when Betsey let us in there were two large bundles standing against the parlour door, they might be about the size of the bundles produced; she said nothing to me then, but gave Mrs. Thompson a jug and told her to go for some beer or porter and to make haste back; I stood in the passage talking to Elizabeth till Mrs. Thompson returned; she told Mrs. Thompson she had better carry out the two bundles, that people might think they were laundry clothes, she being the washerwoman there; she carried out the two bundles; Elizabeth said, I had better take them to a place which Mrs. Thompson knew of, where they could be disposed of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she then say anything about the tea-pot and plate? A. No. She said she had taken all that was worth having, at least all that she thought she could take without their missing it.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Thompson came back with the beer, did she go down into the kitchen? A. She did, and came back directly; she took out the two bundles and carried them to our lodging at Windmill-street. I did not help to carry them at all; we opened the bundles at our lodging; Susannah had not come home then; the bundles contained shawls and shirts, a silver watch, some miniature pictures, and dressing boxes. I tied the things up in two bundles, gave Mrs. Thompson one, and asked her to meet me at the Lion and Lamb, Golden-lane; I took the other bundle into a little street next to Golden-lane, to a Mrs. Phillip's house; I sold it there; it is a place where they buy stolen property; a young man who came from Bermuda with me had taken me there; that was the way I became acquainted with the people; I do not know whether that property has been found; the goods I sold there came to 2l; I received 1l. 19s. as she sent for 1s. worth of beer and gin out of it, which I drank some of; I then went to the Lion and Lamb alone; I did not find Mrs. Thompson there. I waited there I dare say an hour or two, and then went back to our lodging; Susannah Thompson, Jun. Was at home then, and was cleaning up the room. I asked her if her mother had been there; she said, No; I asked her to go with me to see for her, and told her where I had appointed to meet her; this was about four or five o'clock I suppose, but I cannot be certain; she went with me to the Lion and Lamb; I saw the landlord and landlady, and asked if anybody had been there asking for me; they said No, and I believe Susannah said, If her mother came and brought anything, to keep her there, until we came back; she said that, or words to that effect. We went back to our lodging, and had not been there above and hour or an hour and a half, when Clements, the officer, came; I was not taken into custody myself until Monday; I went away after the officers were gone, leaving Susannah there, and did not return; they found me in Golden-lane on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. - Did you tell the Magistrate what you were transported for? A. Yes; I told him it was about a hat, I was charged with it at the time of the Reform meetings at the Manchester riots.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell them it was for a riot? A. Not merely; I being supposed to be concerned in the riots, carrying the cap of liberty; I was charged with stealing a hat; I was in prison once before that, and only once, and I was acquitted; it was about some notes that were found; a man said they were found, a gentleman said he had lost them; I was never in prison except on those occasions; I had only been to Mr. Bartholemew's house once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what a skeleton key is? A. I do not, on my oath; I never saw one in my life; I was in the house about an hour when we were hid under the stairs; I was never up stairs at all. Smith put us under the stairs, as she said her master would not like to see us in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not greatly shocked at its being proposed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100009"/>to you to rob the house? A. No - I was sorry afterwards that I had been so foolish as to be led into it; I was partly forced into it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not shocked at all? A. I had spent all my money; I gave information, I think, about a week after the robbery. I was then in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give information because you were shocked and sorry, or to save yourself? A. I would have told at first, but I was afraid of myself; I gave information because I was sorry for what I had done, and to save myself - I could not sleep, for I felt I had done wrong, and that was the reason I told - that was my only reason; I would have told before, but I was afraid of other people taking my life, if I had been put among them.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you never say you gave information to save your own neck? A. No, nothing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say that the prisoner Smith was as innocent as a child unborn; and that you had impeached her and the other prisoners to save your neck? A. I never said that; I always said we were all innocent, because I was afraid to say we were guilty; I never said the reason I gave information was because I knew the officers were in search of me. I know Joseph Jones - he was in Clerkenwell prison - he was there for trial for something; I do not know what; I never said any thing to that effect to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner THOMPSON, SEN. Which way did I go with the bundles, or did I fetch them out of any public-house. I deny fetching them; he says I went to a public-house, and that he had a glass of ale, I a glass of gin, and fetched him out, and I did nothing of the kind; the publican was brought forward, and said he never saw me - did I go to you and say Smith sent me for you to come and take away the bundles? Witness. She said Elizabeth or Smith had sent her for me.</p>
               <p>MR. BARTHOLEMEW re-examined. Q. Do you remember going home on the Wednesday, before the Saturday? A. I cannot recollect it - I certainly was at home on the Wednesday; I believe it was on Saturday that Smith gave me the letters, but I do not recollect. We had no silver tea-pot; we had a plated fish-slice, but not a silver one; we had no plated tea-pot.</p>
               <p>- YOUNG. I am a pawnbroker. I took this shirt in pawn, which the witness Walker has produced; it was pawned by a woman, and who I believe, to the best of my recollection to be the prisoner Thompson, Sen. - I had never seen her before to my recollection.</p>
               <p>SMITH'S Defence. I am quite innocent of the charge; I never saw that man.</p>
               <p>THOMPSON, SEN.'s Defence. On the Wednesday I was ironing for Mrs. Bartholemew; I finished all but the servant's things, and she asked me to come on Saturday and finish ironing her things, and to bring my daughter and have a bit of lunch, when she had her dinner. I went according to my promise on the Saturday, to iron her caps- I was there about eleven o'clock; she said her master was gone out, but her mistress was up stairs, but she thought it did not make any difference, as her mistress never came down stairs; my daughter came soon after, and gave me a letter to take into the City, where I go to receive money; before I went with the letter I had half a crown from Elizabeth to fetch some beer for lunch; I left the door ajar, and when I came in with the beer Wood came in, and went up stairs. we all three went and lunched down stairs together, and when I went into the City Elizabeth came up and let me out - Wood was there without his coat; he said he wanted some money, and gave me his coat to pawn, which I did for 4s.; I returned back, and knocked at the door; he came down stairs, and let me in; I went through the the shop, thinking nobody was there, and he asked why I knocked; he gave me a bundle tied in a handkerchief, and told me to go to the Lion and Lamb in some lane, I forget the name - I went to Finsbury-square, and inquired for Mr. Lankston; I had been to Mr. Lankston's before, with a letter for some money. I went to Hill-street, where he gave me a letter to go to one Callaghan; I went there, went into a public-house, and ascertained where Callaghan had lived, and found he was gone away; I came back with the letter again: and on Saturday I could not find Mr. Lankston out, and went to the landlord at the corner of Hill-street, thinking he might tell me, but not finding him I returned to my daughters, and as I was going in I met a person who said the officers were after me, and she thought they were at my daughter's - I returned to St. Martin's-lane, and went into a pawnbroker's, opened the bundle, took out a sheet, and pawned it for 4s. - I then went to Hill-street, Berkley-square, again, thinking I might meet him; I asked a woman to direct me to the pawnbroker's; I went and offered the box - the pawnbroker said I did not get the things honestly; I did not know what was in it, but being in confusion I wished to get rid of the things - the officer took me when I came out- Elizabeth Smith had given me some bundles. A witness said he had seen me with two bundles; I said it was Wood did the robbery, and gave me the bundles; Smith knew nothing of it, nor does my daughter. Wood is the man who did the robbery, and he has Mr. Bartholemew's coat on his back now; as for Mrs. Phillips I know nothing about her.</p>

On the 5th of March, between six and seven, nearer to seven o'clock, I was in my kitchen, after having taken my tea; my servant alarmed me - I went up stairs, found the street door open, which leads to the passage; the shop door is inside of the passage; I am a tailor; in consequence of seeing some persons go from the door, I went into the shop, and discovered a quantity of cloth had been stolen off the shelf in the shop - it was broad cloth, not exceeding thirty-two yards in length and was worth at least 40l.; there had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100010"/>been about forty six yards at first, it cost me 27s. 6d. a yard; I went out in pursuit to several different pawnbroker's; as I went into my shop, I trod on a coat which was on the floor and which coat was mine; it had laid on the cloth in my shop - I afterwards received information from two boys, named Clark and Spencer; I went to Mr. Hartley's, a bellhanger's, in Crown-street, Soho - I first saw his wife and asked if she was proprietor of the house, she referred me to her husband, who was in his working dress; I requested him to endeavour to recover my property, which I told him had been traced into his house; he allowed me to open two rooms in the house, but refused to shew me an upper room because I had not got a search-warrant - I found on the turn of the stairs in his house, two pieces of cloth which formed part of a coat that laid cut out on my board - I claimed it as mine. This was before I asked him to let me search the upper room; I should say he did not refuse to let me go up, but refused to let me go into the front room - the two pieces of cloth I found are in the officer's possession; I sent my apprentice for some officers - some persons came, who represented themselves to be officers, but they refused to proceed; I went to Bow-street, before Mr. Halls and got some officers - we examined Hartley's premises then without a warrant; they came to apprehend Hartley - they found no more of my property there; another piece of cloth was found on the step and brought to me by a lad who is here. Hartley was violent about the matter; I have got back three pieces of cloth - I might call it four as there was a double piece.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's servant. On the 5th of March, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, there was knock at the door; I went to the door and found a man there; I cannot positively swear to him, but believe the prisoner to be the man - I am not sure; he said he came from Mr. Watson's, in Fitzroy-square to take back some patterns: I said "Is it to Mr. Ponder;" he said, Yes - I went down to master leaving him in the passage; master came up - I did not go up with him; the man had dark clothes on, but I am not certain what colour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whether it was black, blue or brown you cannot tell? A. No; master's passage is rather dark - it was dusk.</p>

            . On the night in question, I was near Mr. Ponder's house; I live in King-street - I was in George-yard, which comes into Prince's-street and Macclesfield-street, which is at the bottom of Dean-street; Mr. Ponder's apprentice came to me in George-yard, and after that I saw three men taking a roll of cloth away - they were carrying it away: I saw them take it from right opposite the shop door of Mr. Slater in George-yard, where I work. The prisoner put the cloth on his shoulder - I am sure he is the person; he carried it away - he went up King-street, which leads towards Crown-street; I followed and saw him go into Mr. Hartley's house, the bell-hanger's, in Crown-street: I am certain I saw him go in there; the other two men went away - Hartley's door was open; he shut it when he went in - my little brother and James Herrol were with me; I went back and told Mr. Ponder - I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not rather dusky? A. Yes - but the shops were lighted; I was at play in the yard; Clark and Herrol, two little boys were with me in the yard; they were before the Magistrate, but were too young to be examined; I did not know the prisoner before - I could not see what colour his coat was - I could only see that it was a dark coat with gilt buttons; I am learning the tailor's business.</p>

            . I keep this house; the prisoner came to my house on the 20th of March, 1827, and has lodged there ever since - I do not know what he is, but I always supposed him to be waiter at a gambling house, from his style of dressing; I remember Mr. Ponder coming to the house - I immediately let him into the rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not refuse him admission into any rooms, but the two on the first floor? A. He went to the second floor; I did refuse him admission without a search-warrant; it was through an irritation of mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, you knew the honesty of all your lodgers, and refuse to let him search without a warrant? A. I did. Two pieces of cloth had then been found; I did not directly refuse admission - not till the irritation was produced by the crowd round the door; I did not see the prisoner come in with any thing that evening; the pieces of cloth were found on the first floor stairs, which lead to the prisoner's room; he was not at home at that time to my knowledge; Mr. Ponder went into his room with me at first, and he was not there.</p>

On the evening of the 5th of March, I cannot recollect whether he was in the house at the time Mr. Ponder came - I was at home, and saw him go out about half-past six o'clock, and saw him go out a second time at half-past seven o'clock; Mr. Ponder had been to the house then; he was not there when the prisoner went out.</p>
               <p>Q. He had gone away for an officer, had he? A. He was gone away, I do not know what for; when the prisoner went out the first time, at half-past six o'clock, he was dressed in white stockings and shoes, light breeches, and a dark green coat; I did not see him come in, but saw him go out again at half-past seven o'clock, with a pipe, smoking, in his mouth; he had not changed his coat - he still went out in the dark green coat; he did not light his pipe at my fire; he might have both fire and candle in his own room for what I knew; I never go into his room.</p>

            . I know this piece of cloth; it was cut by me, and wrapped up about three quarters of a yard into the whole piece of cloth, and it is part of the same piece of cloth as was lost - it is black; I have no doubt whatever of it being mine - it is my own cutting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you swear to the cutting or the private mark? A. To the cutting - it is a piece which came out of a coat which I had recently cut, and which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100011"/>laid on the board, and the cloth must be in an uneven shape to produce two such pieces as these; it is very much to the disadvantage of the owner to produce two such pieces of cloth. I not only know it from its extraordinary shape, (for with the thousands of coats I have cut, I do not suppose I ever produced such a piece before, and besides that,) it matched the coat which I cut - I compared it before the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you happen to keep company with Mrs. Archer that day? A. Yes; I saw the prisoner till two o'clock; he went out then, and I understood he was going to his father's; I was backwards and forwards with Mrs. Archer till half-past ten o'clock at night; I was not out of her room five minutes from half-past five till half-past seven or eight; the prisoner did not come into the room during that time; he had not come in at half-past ten o'clock, when I went down stairs to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you in her room? A. She was rather poorly, expecting to lay in; I had engaged to attend her, and was with her.</p>

            . I was servant to Sir Henry Watson in February, 1826; this silver mustard-pot was in my charge, and was usually kept in the plate-chest, or locked up in the pantry, in my possession; I missed it at half-past two o'clock on, (I think,) the 26th of February; I had seen it before one in my bed-room - Lee, one of my fellow-servants had access to my bed-room, but nobody else; I have no knowledge how the mustard-pot went: I made inquiry for it as soon as I missed it, but it was not found; my fellow-servant is in the country. I never saw the prisoner about the house; my bed-room is in front of the house, on the basement; there was no appearance of any one having been into the room.</p>

            . I superintend the press department of the business of Andrew Spottiswoode and another. In February I was informed some paper had been taken - I found this paper at Pullen's, a cheesemonger, in Tabernacle-walk, which I know to have been taken from our premises in New-street-square. The prisoner Thomas was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100012"/>employed on the premises; I have seen his wife there once or twice, but not for some time before: when she came it was only to call for her husband; he had access to the paper; it is worth 10s. or 12s.</p>

Picton had no permission to give anything away; I gave her in charge of an officer, who took her to my house - Jones never visited her niece but once before, to my knowledge - we had not forbidden her having female visitors.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are sure of the table-cloth? A. It is my own marking; her aunt said, he knew nothing of the contents of the bundle; but I have no recollection of Picton saying her aunt did not know the contents.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is this a coffee house, or a coffee shop? A. I call it a coffee-house - I sell no wine, nothing but coffee; I have one lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. I am told the prisoner was to have what he could get? A. No, that I never allow - I was to see what he was capable of, before we came to terms; he had lived at a house of the same description on the opposite side of the way, which was to be pulled down: I charged him before the Alderman with taking money, but the Alderman thought the prints sufficient, as I could not identify the coins.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother. On the 2d of April I was in the coffee-shop, minding the business - a person in the room gave me information; I asked the prisoner to walk into the bar, and remain there while I sent for my brother - he asked what he was there for, and shuffled into the room; I requested a witness to keep his eye on him - my brother did not come; I sent for an officer, and asked him in the officer's presence what money he had on his person - he said 7s. or 8s. - he was searched, and 7s. 6d., I think, found in his pocket; I asked him to take off his shoes - he resolutely refused; the officer insisted on it, but he refused him also; I asked his reason - he said, "I have money in my shoes, but the money is my own;" after a trifling resistance his shoes were taken off, and 18s. or 19s. in shillings and sixpences found in them; I then went to the room where the servants sleep - he refused to give up the key of his box, which the officer asked him for - he ultimately gave it up; there was a left hand drawer in one part of his box, with 16s. in copper in it - I pointed out some drawers under this drawer, and in them we found 3l. 10s. 6d. in shillings and sixpences, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100013"/>cluding half a sovereign; a person in the room produced some prints.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what capacity do you attend this coffee-shop? A. I was merely there during my brother's absence - I have nothing to do with the concern; it is an extensive establishment - my sister could not attend to the whole; she is not here - her duty is in the bar generally: Nathan had given me the information; I was before the Magistrate - he was charged there with stealing the money - the pictures was a second charge; I do not know what the commitment was drawn up for - I told the Magistrate a witness had seen him receive money from customers, and put it into his pocket instead of bringing it to the till.</p>

            . I am a dealer in slippers. I was at Williams's house on the 2d of April - the prisoner was attending the room as a waiter; I observed him take money from the customers two or three times, and put it into his pocket, instead of taking it to the bar - I went and told Williams's brother; he called him to the bar; I went out to fetch the master of the house - when I returned Sargeson gave me information, and I picked up some prints in the box where the prisoner had been sitting - there was a sixpence and a penny-piece on the ground with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a wholesale slipper-dealer? A. Wholesale and retail; I keep no shop, but sell my goods in St. Paul's church-yard; I go to this coffee-shop for refreshment morning and evening; I knew it was not the rule of the house for waiters to put money into their pockets, as I had always seen them put it in the till at the bar; Williams' brother was also acting as waiter - he did not put money into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the prisoner did not intend to return the money to his employer? A. I saw him do this two or three times; and have seen him do it when Mr. Williams was at home, but had no opportunity to tell Mr. Williams. I sometimes sell dozens of slippers at a time, and call that wholesale; I sold twenty pairs last night to the head waiter at the Hummums; I have sold a gross at a time to persons coming to me in St. Paul's church-yard, where I have stood five or six years, and am known.</p>

            . I am a porter. I was at Williams' on the afternoon of the 2d of April, and saw the prisoner there; I heard an officer was sent for - my attention was not directed to him before that: when the officer was sent for I saw him take some papers from his waistcoat pocket, and throw them under the seat; I saw him putting something from his pocket into his shoes; I picked up the papers - they were pictures; I placed them on the bar, and the officer took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then Nathan did not pick them up? A. He went first, and picked some of them up; I am porter at the Angel, Angel-street, St. Martin's-le-grand, kept by Mr. Robinson; I live there still, and use this coffee-shop every evening; other persons like myself go there; I dare say there were twenty people in the room; I do not think they knew what was passing, as Mr. Williams kept it private that the officer was sent for; I do not know that the prisoner knew it; I heard it mentioned, but it was not said loud.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HARRIS. I am an officer. I was fetched to this coffee-house, and found the prisoner standing in the bar; the prints were brought to me by Nathan and Sargeson while I was searching him; I found 8s. 6d. in his waistcoat pocket; I suspected he had more, and asked him to take his shoes off, which he refused - I took them off by force, and in both shoes I found 18s. or 18s. 6d. in shillings and sixpences; I found the key of his box in his possession, and said I suspected it was the key of his box; I put it on the drawers while I proceeded to search; he almost immediately made a spring from where he stood, and seized the key: I told him to give it to me, but he said he would not: I was determined to have it, and took it by force, after two or three minutes' struggle; I then took him up to his bed-room, with Mr. Thomas Williams; the prisoner showed me his box; I opened it with the key, and found at one end of it 16s. 2 1/2d. in copper monies, loose, and in a private drawer which I did not notice on first opening the box, I found 3l. and 6d., consisting of a half-sovereign and silver; there were seventy-eight sixpences among it. I took him in charge. I produced the prints and money before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the Alderman say the only things he could take cognizance of, was the prints? A. I did not hear him say so.</p>
               <p>THEODOSIUS WILLIAMS. These prints are mine; they are stamped "Williams' coffee and reading rooms."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the value of them? A. They are taken from the Gentleman's Magazine; I value them at a penny in the indictment, but the injury done to the work is considerable; I consider them worth much more than the price I have put on them.</p>

On the 2d of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, who was a stranger, came to my shop to purchase some children's boots - she went into the back shop, close to where these boots and shoes hung; I showed her several pairs, but none suited her - she said she would bring a pattern, and have a pair made by Saturday; as she was going out she looked very bulky - I asked her what she had under her shawl - she said nothing; I felt her, and these boots and shoes fell from her shawl; there are three pairs of each children's boots and shoes; they are worth 8s. or 10s. - I sent for a constable.</p>

            . I am a warehouseman, and live in Philip-lane, Aldermanbury. On Sunday, the 23d of March, about seven o'clock, I was walking down Addle-street the witness went and spoke to the officer, who charged me in the King's name to aid and assist - I went with him to Mr. Peckham's house, and tried to enter, but we had no key, and the door was closed. Henman desired me to stay at the front door, till Burgin came, which I did, and in the mean time Henman went to see if he could enter at the back door; I remained at the front door till Burgin came, and took my station - Henman and I then went into the next house, which is a public-house, and we got from there to the top of Mr. Peckham's house, and got in through a trap-door in the roof; we had brought lighted candles from the public-house; we carefully examined every room as we went down - we looked under the beds, and every where; we found nobody up stairs - but there was evident proof that somebody had been there, the things being in disorder; we came down as quick as we could, and had just got on the ground floor stairs when we heard the cry of "here they are, here they are - come in;" I immediately heard Burgin call for assistance; Henman and I were instantly with Burgin, and the two prisoners were between Burgin and us.</p>
               <p>Q. Could there have been anybody in the house beside you? A. Two persons had followed us from the top; I believe they were ostlers - but there was nobody else in the house; the prisoners were secured immediately- the other two persons came down stairs from the top behind us; I did not see the property till somebody gave it to Mr. Peckham - I did not see it found, as I was engaged with Henman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say, that when you came down stairs some persons had not rushed into the house after the officer? A. They had not; there were no persons in the passage expect Burgin and the two prisoners; the door opens inside - it was about half open and half shut; Burgin was forcing it to with his back; I do not think any body outside was trying to get in - but am certain no persons were in the house till the prisoners were secured.</p>
               <p>Prisoner COURT. Q. When we were secured, was there not a whole passage full of people? A. There was nobody till after they were secured - but immediately after there was a rush into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not going to run a sword down my throat? A. No; I had the officer's sword; when the prisoners were secured they were very resolute and called for their friends; they said they would have their friends in - there was nobody but me, Henman and Burgin in the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where the prisoners out of your sight, till they were secured? A. Never. After they were committed from the Mansion-house, I was assisting Henman to take them to prison, and Court said "If I had known what I know now, I would have let the old b-gg-r's guts out;" I am sure the prisoners were secured before any persons came into the house.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At any time when you came down, could anybody have got by Burgin into the street? A. No, they could not.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to Peckham's door with Smith; I did not try to get in, as Peckham said he had tried and could not get in: I left Smith at the door while I went round to the back of the house and found that was fastened; Smith afterwards came to me - we went through the Blue Anchor public-house and entered at the roof; I think another man came in behind us, we were the foremost; we found nobody in the top rooms - we came through a trap-door, which was fastened, I broke it open - I searched every room as I came down stairs; I found a chest of drawers in the second floor front room had been broken open, and the things scattered about the room; I then proceeded down to the first floor staircase - there is a turning about the middle of the staircase; I heard a rush - I jumped and came on a level with the ground floor passage, and saw the two prisoners in front of Burgin; I said "these are the men;" there were no other persons whatever there - I knocked Krelle down and saw Court struggling with Burgin; we secured them and put them in a room - no other persons were in the house till after they were secured; there were some persons in the passage behind Burgin. but not between him and me; those persons were pressing forward, but I pushed them out and shut the door; I am quite certain they had not passed Burgin - no person whatever had passed him; here are two shirts, three pairs of stockings and a silver wine-strainer which Mr. Peckham delivered to me - since that the privy has been searched, and two bags found containing four skeleton keys, and one latch-key - one of the skeleton keys fits the street door and unlocks it - I tried it myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Did you come down stairs immediately after Smith? A. No; I came before him; when I came down stairs, there was me and the two prisoners before Burgin.</p>
               <p>Q. You say a great mob had rushed into the passage? A. They were behind Burgin; I should think the persons had got into the passage when Smith came down, but they had not passed Burgin.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true that nobody was in the passage, except the two prisoners, you and Burgin when Smith came down? A. I should think there were other persons, for the moment I turned my eye, I saw them; they were behind Burgin - there might be six or eight persons, but in the confusion I cannot say; Smith might not have seen them, as I stood before him; the partition might have prevented his seeing them; I was obliged to pass Burgin to put the persons out; the partition might prevent Smith from seeing me till he came forward, which he did after the prisoners were secured.</p>
               <p>Q. If he has sworn nobody whatever had got into the passage, is it true? A. I should think he must have seen the people.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. That was after you had secured the prisoners? A. Yes; there might be persons behind the officer before they were secured - but nobody had passed him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100016"/>- it was impossible for them to pass him, the passage is very narrow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner COURT. Q. You say you pushed one prisoner away, and another the other; I was not secured for four or five minutes, and you picked us out of the mob? A. I pushed Krelle down, Court was struggling with Burgin, and I pushed him towards him. None of the mob could get to Burgin; the prisoners were not among any other people.</p>

            . I am a smith; I searched the privy of the house on the day after the robbery, and found a bag with four skeleton keys; the officer fitted them to the door, but not in my presence - here are four skeleton and one latch key; they were all in this bag, I hooked it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner COURT. He told the Lord Mayor he found only two, and they both opened the door. Witness. The Lord Mayor was gone when I was there; at the Mansion-house I said I found four skeleton and a latch-key - I never mentioned two.</p>
               <p>KRELLE'S Defence. I was going out for a walk, and on coming down Coleman-street I saw a great mob round Peckham's door. I asked what was the matter; they said thieves were in the house - I staid there about ten minutes; the door was opened, a mob rushed in - I rushed in with them, and have witnesses to prove it.</p>
               <p>COURT's Defence. I had been to Westminster, to my aunt's, to see a lady at her house; on my return I saw a mob; this man held the door with the knocker in his hand, and when the door was opened I and another were shoved a - e over head, and went in: at least a dozen of us were shoved in. I was apprenticed to a butcher in Warwick - I should have had witnesses here if I had thought my trial would have come on.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, Prince's-place, White Horse-yard, Coleman-street. On Sunday evening, the 23d of March, I remember seeing a crowd of persons round Mr. Peckham's door; there were not above twenty persons, or not so many. I have known the prisoner Krelle as long as I can recollect myself, ever since he was born; I saw him that night; he was not exactly at Mr. Peckham's door, but nearly at it; I asked him if he had seen my little boy; he said, "No, Mrs. Colley;" I asked him what the confusion was about - he said, "Mrs. Colley, they say there are thieves in the house;" I always understood that he bore an honest character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time was this? A. As near as I can recollect about seven o'clock, or a very few minutes after. I am a widow, and work at the tailoring business, at No. 17, Three Tun-court, Redcross-street, for a person named Thomas Daley - he does not keep a shop, but works at home: he has two rooms there; I believe an Irish gentleman keeps the house - there is no name on the door, to my knowledge, but I am not quite positive; I have worked there for the last three weeks - the door is always open, and I go directly up stairs; I do not think there is any name up - I work in the garret; he rents the garret and the room under it: I went home directly after speaking to Krelle; I did not see him taken. I was quite astonished to hear on Monday that he was taken up; I went before the Lord Mayor, but I was not called. I mentioned to his mother that I knew he was not the boy - she was not at the Mansion-house - I did not mention it at the Mansion-house - I went there on account of his mother coming to me on the Monday morning - I believe it was between eleven and twelve o'clock; I went to the Mansion-house directly: I did not tell any body there that he could not have been the person - I mentioned it to his mother.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought she was not at the Mansion-house? A. Oh, yes, she was there; she did not state that I could prove her son was not in the house - the Lord Mayor left, and another gentleman came in and sat in his seat; and went on with the examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, did you mention it to him, or to any of the officers? A. No; I never spoke at all - I did not speak to Krelle there; his mother spoke to him, but they said nothing about my being able to prove that he was outside the house. I went as far as Peckham's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door open or shut at that time? A. On my word, from the scene of confusion there was, I could not tell, for I was anxious about my son, who is always running about; I saw Krelle near Mr. Peckham's door - he was on the side nearest to Cheapside; I went on towards Cheapside, to go home; Mr. Peckham's door is towards Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any occasion to pass Peckham's door? A. I had been home a little way with a friend, and passed the door to come back; I heard a confusion as I passed - I had not heard that there were thieves in the house before I passed.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the Lord Mayor or the gentlemen who sat in his place, call any witnesses for the prisoner? A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it said there were witnesses to prove anything on the prisoner's behalf? A. No.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see that woman at the Mansion-house? A. I did not; I saw Krelle's mother - I knew her very well; she did not mention to me that she had any body to prove he was outside the house - she had some friends with her.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. I was at the Mansion-house during the prisoner's examination; I saw Krelle's mother there - she told me she found herself very much hurt that no witnesses were called for her son.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she point any witnesses out? A. No; I did not see Colley there, not to know her; if she had been with the mother I think I must have seen her, but I might have seen her and not noticed her; nobody offered themselves as witnesses; only the mother said she had witnesses to prove he was outside the house at the time, and expressed herself much hurt that they were not called; I told her her son was committed - she was then struck with terror, and said, "What! and call no witnesses for the prisoner! I have a person who will prove he was in the mob;" I have seen Krelle about the streets - I never heard anything against him; I only know him by seeing him about as a neighbour; Krelle said at the Mansion-house that he was one of the crowd outside, and was pushed in by the mob - he did not say he had been speaking to a woman.</p>

            . I am sixteen years old. I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100017"/>known Krelle a good many years intimately; I saw a crowd on the Sunday night opposite Mr. Peckham's door - I was coming through Coleman-street, and in the crowd round the door I saw Krelle; he was eating something - his hands were in his pockets; I said, "Ah! Joseph, how do you do?" - he answered me, and asked how I did; I asked him what was the matter - he said there were thieves in the house; some officers came and stood at the door - I should not know them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, what happened? A. The door went open.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What, while the officers stood there? A. Yes; the officers were outside; I do not know whether the door was broken open, or opened from the inside, but I saw it go open - I was close by in the road near the curb.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How does it happen that you could not see whether it was broken open; you are not very tall? A. Because there was a great crowd before me - about one hundred or one hundred and fifty people stood before me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Before the door opened were there one hundred or one hundred and fifty people? A. There were from two hundred to two hundred and thirty before, and behind me; there were from two hundred to three hundred people.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When the door was opened, did you see a rush of any persons towards it to get in? A. Yes; and at that time I missed Krelle; I had been speaking to him up to the time I saw the rush; I saw the prisoners brought out sometime afterwards, but could not tell who they were; I did not hear who they were till after they were taken to the watch-house; I went to the watch-house- a woman there whom I knew by sight, said Krelle was taken into custody; I said "I do not believe he is, for I saw him standing outside the house, just before the rush."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You went to the watch-house - Did you see the officers there? A. No; one person had a drawn sword in his hand; I did not go in - I did not mention to anybody there, except the woman, that Krelle was outside; it was not the woman who has been examined, it was a very young woman; I have not seen her here.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the people who rushed in turned out? A. About four or five of them came out, and then the door closed.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the people turned out and the door closed, did you see Krelle after that? A. No. I live at No. 3, White's-alley, Coleman-street, with my father and mother; my father is a porter. I did not go to the Mansion-house the next day - my mother was not waiting for me to go; I told her of this directly I got home - she knew Krelle - we were play-fellows together; she would not let me go; she said I should come here if I were subpoened. I work for Mr. Eaton, of Crooked-lane, a fishing tackle maker.</p>

On Sunday evening the 23d of March, he came in to tea about seven o'clock; I had not made the tea, and gave him a round of bread and butter, and some cold rice pudding, which we had for dinner - Elizabeth Clementson was in the room, and saw him, and so was my daughter. He staid in the room about ten minutes and then went out. Charles Williams came in in about half an hour and told me he was in custody - I went to the Mansion-house at his examination, and saw Mr. Brand. Witnesses were called for my son, but they were not heard. I told him I had witnesses in attendance; those witnesses were Colley and Williams. -When I was informed my son was in custody I went out as soon as I could find my bonnet. I saw a crowd of people, and made the best of my way to the watch-house: I saw one Lutwich there; he belongs to the watch-house, and is a tax-gatherer; I mentioned that my son had been at home half an hour before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say witnesses were called for your son, what do you mean by that?

            . My husband is a labourer, and lives at Pinner. On the 12th of March, about eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner at Pinner, coming in a direction from Moores' house - he was coming across Mr. Hill's field, and walking quite fast; he was about a quarter of a mile from Moores'; my landlady was with me: we made some observation about the prisoner, which he must have heard; I turned round, and said, "Lord, there is

            . I am a constable of Aylesbury. I saw a paragraph in the New Hue and Cry on the 21st of March, stating this robbery, and that John Short was suspected. I went to the pawnbroker's to make inquiry, and found nothing; I went from there to where the prisoner had lodged for a few days that week - I had seen him near the house on the morning of that day myself, and several times in the course of the week, and while I was in the house, speaking to the landlady, the pawnbroker's boy fetched me; I went to the pawnbroker's, and found the prisoner there, offering a watch in pawn: the shopman produced it in his presence, and said he had come to pawn it; the prisoner said nothing to that - I said to him, "That is Mr. Moores' watch;" he said, "No, it is not - it is my own;" I said, "Where did you get it?" he said he bought it in London; I asked in what street; he said he did not know: I asked what number, and he did not know; I took him to my own house, stripped him, and on his person found this shirt, with the initials W.

            . I live at Turnham-green. I was going by Parson's-green with my husband about half-past eight o'clock on Sunday morning, the 2d of March; I observed something in a ditch - there was very deep water in the ditch; I thought at first there was a dog in the water, but as I was waiting for my husband, who stopped behind for a necessary purpose, I perceived that it was the body of a child; it was entirely covered with water; I went back and called my husband - he came and looked, and thought it was a child: we went up into the road, and saw a man - we got him to look, and he said it was a child.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this was out of the road? A. Yes, a little way from the road, in a field; we had gone out of the road, towards <placeName id="t18280410-17-crimeloc119">Parson's-green</placeName>

               <p>Q. Then when you say you went back to the road, you mean the carriage-road? A. We went forward to the carriage-road, and there met a man who is a glass-cutter - he is not here; he went and called a constable: I saw Levick, the constable take the child out of the water; we went with it to his house, and gave our names - it was taken from there to the White Horse public-house, but I did not go there - Levick himself took it out of the water with a rake- I saw him bring it out of his house to take it to the White Horse, but did not go with him. When I saw it on the Monday, before the Coroner I thought it about six weeks old. I have had ten children myself.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Fulham; I saw this child in the presence of Levick on Monday; I had seen the same child on Sunday; I suppose it was from a month to six weeks old. On the left temple there was a contused wound, not a cut but what is commonly called a bruise - the skin was taken off; I should judge it to be occasioned either by a blow before it was thrown into the water, or by its falling on some stone or hard substance in the water - the injury on the temple was not sufficient, in my judgment, to cause death; the eyes were a good deal suffused with blood, as if they had been very forcibly pressed; in fact the eye-balls were both destroyed in a great measure - I should say they were almost entirely destroyed; I cannot imagine how that could be done unless by the pressure of the hand or fingers - there were no other marks of violence about the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no marks of violence about the neck, as if it had been strangled by squeezing? A. None that I could observe; it might have been killed by strangling, but there was no appearance of it externally; squeezing the neck might have caused the appearance in the eye - it might cause the eye-balls to be disturbed, if not entirely destroyed; the child might have been strangled by pressure about the throat, without leaving any external marks. particularly if it had a blow on the head as well. I opened the body after the inquisition; the internal parts were perfectly healthy, except the vessels of the brain and lungs, being overloaded with blood.</p>
               <p>Q. In your opinion, in what way was the life of that child taken? A. I should imagine it to have been strangled by pressure with the hand - it had evidently been strangled before it was thrown into the water, or there would have been a small quantity of water on the lungs, and there was none; I should conceive the child was nearly dead before it was thrown into the water; I am confident it must have been done by pressure about the throat; the contused wound was certainly given before the child died; I saw the child about two o'clock on Sunday for the first time; I had seen the prisoner at the workhouse at Fulham before I saw the child; the first thing I asked her was, if she had been suckling a child lately; she said she had not for two months; I asked her then to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100019"/>let me look at her breasts; she showed me her breasts - I pressed on both her breasts and milk spirted out of both of them; I asked her then if she had not been suckling a child a shorter time than two months, and if she had had a nurse child; she said, No; that she kept her milk a month after her child died, by drawing her breasts, in hopes that she might get a situation as wet-nurse; I then asked her when her child died - she said two months ago, and that it was about a fortnight old; I asked her where it was buried - she said in Mary-le-bone - that it was born on Saffron-hill, but she did not know the name of the people she lodged with, nor did she know the number of the house: she said he child had been baptized at the Spanish chapel, Spanish-place. I asked her who took it to be buried - she said the woman with whom she lodged; she at first said she took it herself to be buried, and some time after, I said, "What, did you take it to be buried a fortnight after you was confined, yourself;" she said, "No, the woman I lodged with took it;" I asked who made the coffin, who was the undertaker - she said an Irishman who lodged in the same house had nailed some pieces of board together, and made a coffin; I asked if she could find the man who did it; she said No, she did not know his name, nor where he lived. I believe this was the principal of the conversation; I do not recollect anything more. She said she had come to that neighbourhood to seek for work; I should think from the appearance of the child that it had been a very short time in the water; it might have been twelve or twenty-four hours, not longer: putrescense had not at all taken place; it was a male child.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I tell you I took the child to be buried? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not say it was born in Chick-lane, Saffron-hill? A. You said Saffron-hill.</p>

             re-examined. I have a bundle of clothes- I received part of them at the White Horse; part from the prisoner and part from the man who found the child's clothes - here are what I received from the prisoner at the White Horse; there is a gown among it which was on her back when I took her - it was changed afterwards; there is only one gown in the bundle - there are no child's clothes in the bundle I which received from her; I received a part of the bundle from the hands of one of the Jury - William Cook was present at the time; Catherine Bartley lives at what is called Parson's-green- it is about a quarter of a mile from where I found the child. After I had taken the child to the White Horse, I went home towards my own house, which is nearly opposite to where I found the child; I did not see the prisoner then - I saw her about a quarter or half-past nine o'clock - it was some little time after I had been home; I saw her walking by the side of the ditch from which the child had been taken, and nearly at the spot from where I had taken it, she appeared to be looking very minutely into the water; after she had been looking into the water, she came on towards the King's road - I then went up to her and asked if she had lost anything, that she was so minutely examining the ditch, she said No; I said I had found something, and I had every reason to believe it belonged to her; she asked what had I found - I said I had found a child, and asked what she had done with the child that she had been seen with last evening; she said "Me a child, I had no child;" and then went on to say that she had a good character - that she had worked at Mrs. Fitch's and at Mr. Parry's the summer before; and that she was going to work at Mrs. Fitch's on the morrow - this was on Sunday; I know there is a Mrs. Fitch at Parson's-green.</p>
               <p>Q. This conversation passed in the road? A. We stood still all the while; she said if I wanted her, I should find her at Mrs. Fitch's to-morrow morning - Mrs. Fitch is a market gardener; she went on - I let her go a little way; the neighbours, being anxious about what had occurred, said I should not do my duty unless I took her into custody; she did not hear that - I then hastened towards her, she was then making her way towards what is called the London road up Parson's-green-lane; I overtook her, and put my hand on her shoulder, she looked round and said what did I want with her; I told her I only wanted her to go back to where she told me she had lodged the night before - she said she would go back, for she had no child; her child was buried - I asked her where it was buried; if she could prove where it was buried - she said it was buried at Mary-le-bone; I asked if it was registered, she said it was, in the name of Johnny Welch, that it had been buried about two months she thought, but she could not say exactly; I asked her where she was delivered - she said at a house on Saffron-hill, but she did not know the number; I asked the name of the people of the house - she said they were gone away, and she did not know the name; I asked her the name of the person who buried the child - she at first said she took it herself to be buried, but she afterwards prevaricated so much I did not ask her further - this was on our way to the workhouse; before we went to the workhouse - I took her to Catherine Bartley's where she said she had lodged the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him my child had been buried two months, and had lived a fortnight - that I was brought to bed in Chick-lane.</p>

             re-examined. I saw a woman near that place on Saturday evening, about six o'clock - it was the day before I heard of the child being found; I met the woman when I was in the field, and spoke to her - I said it was rather muddy walking there: she said, "Yes, my dear, it is;" she was close to the ditch, and had passed the place where I was told the child was found: she had on the gown which has been produced; I know it again - she had a large cloak on, which covered all the gown except a bit at the bottom; she had her cloak wrapped entirely round her, and seemed as if she had a child or something under it - I did not see any child, nor hear the voice of one. I left her - she went on first, over the plank - I drove my ducks on after her: she was going away from the ditch, and went up towards Sandyend; it was nearly dark then - it was dusk. I am sure the prisoner is the same woman; I saw her again when the Inquest was sitting - she is the woman I saw by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100020"/>Kneel-brook, which is the name of the place - it is near the ditch.

            . I live opposite to where the child was taken out of the ditch; I sat in my own house in King's-road, and saw it taken out on Sunday morning. I am a bricklayer. On the afternoon of the day before that, the prisoner passed me three times - I am certain she is the woman; I was coming home from work - I first passed her on the road - I then stopped, and she passed me; when I got home I stopped opposite my gate, and she passed me, returning towards London; she was going from London the first and second time - she had a large cloak on, and had something under it, which appeared to me to be a child.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear to be a child? A. She nursed it like a child - she carried it in her arms, as a person carries a child, and the second time I think she was suckling it; she appeared to be holding it up to her left breast; after I had seen her the second time I went to my own house, and saw her coming back - I was standing outside, in the King's road, near my own door; she was returning towards London, and looking very auxiously along the ditch, as if she had lost something.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her the third time, had she the same bundle, or whatever it was, under her cloak? A. Yes - I took no more notice, but went into my own house, and did not see her again till the Inquest was held on Monday: the last time I saw her was, I think, a quarter past six o'clock, as near as can be. I had finished my day's work before I saw her the first time; when I saw her at the Inquest she had the same cloak and bonnet on, but not the same gown; I noticed the gown below her cloak on the Saturday evening - it was the same colour as the one produced; I believe that to be the same.</p>

            . I am a gardener, and live at Walham-green; I work for Mrs. Fitch - her garden is not a quarter of a mile from the ditch the child was found in: it joins the King's road, and is further from London than that place. I heard of the child being found on the Sunday; I went to work a little after six o'clock the next morning, at the same place where I had left off work on the Saturday - I had been nailing trees to the wall, inside the garden, and about two yards from the spot where I left off work on the Saturday evening, I found two little petticoats and a child's frock - they were rolled up, and pinned up; I gave them to the beadle of the parish- those are the things which have been produced; they were not there on the Saturday night: I found them exactly in the place where I left off nailing the trees.</p>

            . I live at Parson's-green. The prisoner came to my house about seven o'clock on the Saturday night - she said she had come looking for work- I had seen her before, and given her work last summer: she asked if I had any girls lodging with me - I said I had three or four: I mentioned their names, and asked if she knew them - she said she knew one, for she worked with her last summer; she slept at my house that night - she had the gown on which has been produced, and had some other things wrapped up in a blue gown - it was a small bundle; she wore the same gown in the morning as when she came - she went out about eight o'clock on Sunday morning, as I suppose, by the light, but I have no clock; she was absent about half an hour - the constable came back with her; she fetched her little bundle from the press-bedstead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had nothing but a gown and two caps when I went there. I laid in on Saffron-hill, in Chick-lane; my child was a week old when I got him christened, at Spanish-place - he was a fortnight old when he died; I got him buried at Mary-le-bone church; I was ill for a week after that, and was never out of doors. I told the gentleman I had nobody to look after the woman who took the child to be buried; she moved, and nobody knew where she was gone. My child was buried in High-street, Mary-le-bone, in the old burying-ground- the woman, whose house I laid in at, took it with her son, to be buried; her husband worked out in the country, and she said he only came to his lodgings on Saturday nights. I worked at Mrs. Fitch's last year, till about six weeks before Christmas; I knew a young woman who worked in the garden with me - I inquired of a woman in the road where I could get a lodging - she told me I could at this woman's: I never went into that road on the Saturday. I am as innocent as a baby unborn, and leave it to the gentleman of the Court to look into my case, for I have not a person in the world to do anything for me. I told the gentleman every thing the moment he took me.</p>

I was near the Duke of Devonshire's grounds; before I went down to go there, I met the watchman, and asked what o'clock it was: he said he was going to cry half-past ten o'clock: I parted with him, went on, and put my stick against the pales while I stopped for a necessary purpose; I unbuttoned my small clothes, and while in that situation some person or persons, unknown to me, came up - I cannot say whether there was more than one, but some person or persons, unknown to me, left me for dead, and robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, did they come at the back of you, or by your side? A. I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel any blow? A. I recollect nothing but coming to myself afterwards; I felt nothing that I recollect- I remember nothing whatever that happened; I was senseless of every thing - I had 9s. in one pocket, and 7s. in the other, when I paid for my beer and some seeds:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100021"/>when I came to myself my pockets were turned inside out, except the left hand one, where I had the 7s. and seeds - the 7s. were gone, but the seeds left; all my money was gone, and the change, which I had out of my beer, was taken from my waistcoat pocket; when I came to myself, I scrambled up as well as I could, and went back to the Barley Mow, which is not above two hundred yards; they saw the situation I was in, and took me over to Mr. Cox, the surgeon - two young men, who were at the house, went home with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what hour did you first leave the public-house? A.

               <p>Q. Then you had a watch about you - was it in view? A. No; it was inside my inner trousers.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prosecutor drinking there? A.

            . I am a watchman of Turnham-green. I know the prosecutor very well, and remember seeing him on Saturday, the 22d of March, at the back of the King's-road, near the Duke of Devonshire's new road; I was calling half-past ten o'clock; he said, "Half-past - how much?" I told him half-past ten; he passed me - I was going along by the Barley Mow, and he was going towards Chiswick; I saw the prisoner standing by the Barley Mow door - I knew him very well before, and am sure he is the man - he was smoking his pipe at the door; I left him there, and went by him; I did not see him again till nearly half-past one o'clock the same night, when Reynolds, the officer, brought him to me underneath the gas-light; they showed me his smock-frock which he had got on - there was blood on it - it appeared to me to be wet; I said, "Brown, I think you have done something for yourself," and told him his hands were all over blood, as I saw they were so; he said nothing to that: I went with him to the watch-house; the officer took the smock-frock off his back - it is here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you saw him standing at the door, did he see you? A. Yes; he knew me to be a watchman; I mentioned before the Magistrate about his hands being bloody; when I saw him smoking he had nothing in his hands but his pipe - he called me Joey; I bade him good night, and went round my beat; the prosecutor had been gone three or four minutes when I saw the prisoner at the door - I did not take the prisoner's hand in mine.</p>
               <p>Q. By the gas-light it appeared as if it had blood on it? A. Yes it was blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose there had been blood previously dried, and any beer or water had fallen on his hands, would it not then have the appearance of fresh blood? A. I do not know, but I know it was blood.</p>

            . I was at the public-house on the night in question, and remember seeing the prosecutor there - I knew him before; and I saw the prisoner there; I saw the prosecutor move from his seat, and go out of the tap-room door; the prisoner remained in the house for a few minutes after that, and then I saw him go out; I remained in the house, and the prosecutor came back about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after the prisoner went out - he came back with a large cut in his head, and said somebody had knocked him down and robbed him, but he did not know who.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the prisoner went out, had he anything in his hand? A. No; Galletly had a large stick; I saw nothing in the prisoner's hand - they did not drink together that night; I did not hear them ask each other to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said that they asked each other to drink, and that they did so? A. No, I did not; I was before the Magistrate - I had been drinking myself; I had perhaps two or three pints of half and half, half beer and half ale - I was not at all intoxicated, nor was my memory affected at all, nor my spirits exhilerated in the least; I had been there perhaps two or three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was just two or three minutes after the prosecutor that the prisoner went out? A. Because I took particular notice; old Galletly said good night, the prisoner did not say good night.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Will you swear the prisoner went out about three minutes after him? A. Yes, I have said it might be a minute more or less than three minutes; I never said they went out together - I swear I never did; I drank very little that night, it might be a pint of beer, or a pint and half, that would not affect my head at all; I was before the Magistrate on the Monday, and on the Monday week, but never said they went out together - I have been in this Court before and at the bar.</p>

I turned away and said nothing to him.</p>

            . I am constable and patrol of Chiswick; I heard of this robbery and went to the prisoner's father's house, in consequence of what I heard between twelve and one o'clock on the Saturday night; I found the house shut up - I tried the door first; it was fastened - I knocked, and the prisoner's father came to the window; there was no light in his room - I told him I wished to speak to him; he put his head out of the window; I asked him to come down - he refused; I told him I wanted Russel Brown (the prisoner); I saw the prisoner at the window, and asked him to come down stairs for I wanted to speak to him - he said he was both drunk and cold, and could not come down that night; he came down at last and unlocked the door - I heard his father say to him "You bl - y fool now they will take you to the cage and lock you up;" he had not at that time unlocked the door; when his father said that, he said; so help him God he could not unlock the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew his voice? A. I heard him come down stairs, and I knew him before; I told him he might do as he pleased; if he did not open the door, I must use other means to get in other ways; he at last opened the door, and I took him: he was undressed - he dressed before I brought him away; he put on a pair of breeches, this smock-frock, and a flannel jacket on the top of the smock-frock; when he put the frock on I observed some blood on it; I did not observe his hands till I got him to the watch-house - they were then all over blood; I asked him how that blood came on his smock-frook - he said he could give a very good account how the blood came there - that it was with stabbing a horse in the North-road on the Friday week before the robbery; the blood on the frock was quite wet - it had the appearance of recent blood. On Monday, the 24th of March, I took him from the watch-house to Clerkenwell New prison; I said nothing to induce him to say anything; as we went along he said, had he known that his father and mother could not have settled it with the old man on Sunday morning, that he would have hung himself in the cage; he showed mean old silk handkerchief, and said that was what he had tied round his knee for a gaster, and he could have done it with that, though I had taken two handkerchiefs from him in the cage.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at the cage with the prosecutor and his son on the Sunday? A. Not in the cage, but in the work house yard. I saw the prisoner and young Galletly talking together, but did not hear what passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. From whom did you receive the information which led you to the prisoner's house? A. From those who were in the public-house: I had not seen Lock, the watchman, before I went to the public-house - I did not tell the prisoner why I took two handkerchiefs from him in the watch-house - what he said about regretting that he had not hung himself, was quite of his own accord.</p>
               <p>Q. He produced a third handkerchief, to show you that though you had taken the precaution, he could have hung himself? A. Yes; he was to go to the New prison till the Monday, on this charge; he did not tell the Magistrate he had committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the house he was about to unlock the door, but his father prevented him? A. Yes; I do not know that he knew I was a constable - I was outside, and did not tell him my business till I got in, but I asked him if his name was Brown, when he put his head out of window, and he said it was; I asked the father to come down, for I wanted to speak to him very particularly - he would not come down, but the son did: and was about to unlock the door, when his father called him a fool; he at first refused to open the door, but afterwards he did open it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he dress himself in your presence? A. I was at the front door; Reeves stood with me - he was in the dark when he dressed himself, in the back room - I took the candle when he had the smock-frock on.</p>
               <p>Q. When you spoke to him about the blood being wet, did he not say it was beer that had been spilt on it? A. He said the blood being wet was through beer being spilt upon it at the public-house, and said how the blood had come there; he made no attempt to escape - he could not have escaped, I am certain; the man who was with us stood between the door posts of the back room - there was a window to the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in that room by himself? A. Reeves stood between the door and the door-post, and I was close by; the back room leads out of the front - this room was on the ground floor; I suppose he had an opportunity of getting out of the back window if he liked - his father had looked out of the front room window up stairs.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where does the back window open to? A. I do not know, for I was never in the house before.</p>

               <p>JOHN REYNOLDS re-examined. I found this stick next morning on the ground where the robbery was committed - it stood up the fence, and all on the ground was blood. (Producing a thick stick.)</p>
               <p>MR. HITCHCOCK. The wounds were such as might be occasioned by a stick of that description.</p>

I am quite innocent of the crime.</p>

               <p>Q. That is supposing him to have received a message from a person at the door? A. Exactly so; he opened the drawing-room door - I was sitting near the fire; he crossed the room at the usual place which a servant would to give his master a letter - he presented me with this letter, (producing it;) he said nothing on giving it to me I believe - I immediately opened it, being surprised at a letter coming to me on a Sunday night at that hour; I did not read the letter half through; I got to about the middle of it, and said to my nephew who is in partnership with me in business - "What does this mean? why this is a hoax or an imposition;" it was a complaint of our negligence in not executing an order, which had never been given; while my nephew was just looking at the letter - I said to the prisoner, "Why sure you have not left the man who brought this in the hall?" and upon his appearing to admit that it was so, (I will not say that he said yes, but by his manner I considered that he had; he might have said yes, but I considered that he had; he might have said yes, but I cannot recollect;) we all started up together, I, my nephew and Mrs. Perry; we all ran down, and the prisoner was with us.</p>
               <p>Q. From the bell ringing until you went down into the hall what length of time do you think elapsed? A. From the ringing of the bell I consider it was two or three minutes, but from the time he came into the room until the time we were at the bottom of the stairs was but one minute; I have tried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then would four or five minutes be an extension of the whole time? A. Oh yes; when I got into the hall I observed the street door not wide open, but about 15 or 18 inches open, just sufficient for a person to pass through, and no one standing there; the prisoner immediately looked towards the door of the dining-room, which had no light in it, but it was faintly lighted by the hall lamp, which is exactly opposite that door; it has not a patent but a flat burner - the prisoner, shewing a great deal of alarm in his manner, said, "Oh! the sideboard drawer is open;" I instantly went in and observed the four plated bottle-stands which had been used at dinner, with some figs and oranges, which also had been used at dinner, and put away; remained in the sideboard drawer; the sideboard drawer is immediately on a line with the door - we had dined in that room and left it about an hour; at the back part of the drawer was a sugar-bason to hold white sugar; it had a silver spoon in it, which had been used at dinner - we did not miss it that night, but next day we found the spoon had been removed.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened at this time? A. I turned round and missed the small dial clock which stood on the chimney piece; after carefully examining the parlour, we all immediately went into the back parlour, which is immediately behind the front.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could a stranger who had come into your hall for the first time, have been conducted to the chimney-piece, where the clock was, by the light from the hall? - A. I think he might; we went into the back parlour - the hall lamp does not throw a light into that room - it was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100024"/>perfect darkness, except a small glimmer on going in; we had brought no light down with us - we only had the light the hall lamp afforded; I told the prisoner to get a light instantly, which he did, and on his bringing it, I found the scrutoire, below the book-case, had a drawer open, and a box-coat and another coat gone from it - that drawer was always shut when I went into the room - it was his business to put my coat there; the door of that room opens against the book-case; another great coat was gone, which had hung behind that door; in the drawer were some papers, and a red morocco travelling case, which had not been moved. I said to the prisoner, "Why, good Heavens! I should not wonder if the plate is gone," and said angrily, "I believe you are concerned in this robbery;" he made no reply to that remark, but we all ran down to his pantry, where he kept his plate - it is a room behind the kitchen, and is called the butler's pantry.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then he made no answer to your remark, that you should not wonder if the plate was gone, or to his being concerned? A. I do not recollect that he did; when we got down stairs, close to the pantry door, before we got into the pantry, he exclaimed, "Why, my coat is gone;" my nephew was with me; when we got into the pantry, I immediately looked for the plate, and the whole of the silver plate appeared to have been gone; I cast my eye on the dresser in the first instance, to look for it; my plate consisted of seventy-eight pieces, and was of considerable value: on the first view of the pantry, I considered that it was all cleared away - it was worth about 120l.; the spoons and forks, and small articles, were usually kept in a box, which we had brought up stairs at night - the box was about twelve inches long, and eight wide; on the dresser laid the baize lining, which was intended for the smaller articles - that had been taken out of the box, and laid on the dresser; the box was not there, and has not been found; below the dresser is a closet with folding doors, on the shelf of which is usually deposited four silver candlesticks for the table - not chamber ones; two large plated candlesticks remained, but the four silver ones were gone - I believe the plated ones were usually kept with the silver ones - they had not been used that day; we burn a lamp at dinner; all the candlesticks were used together when we had company; two plated ones, belonging to the other two, were up in the drawing-room: I had a large plated dish and cover, that was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other plated articles remain below? A. Yes; a plated toast-rack hung up, and a plated winestrainer was on the shelf, immediately adjoining it - they were left; in the cupboard adjoining, where the candlesticks stood, was a plated cruet-frame, a plated pickle, and a plated soy-frame - they all remained; the cruet-frame was brought to the dinner table every day, and the soyframe when we had fish; the two small silver tops of the castors had been taken off, and laid close in front of the door-way, and the mustard-spoon was taken out of the mustard-pot, and laid on the dresser; we had drank tea that evening, and the silver spoons and milk-ewer, which had been used that night, were gone. I had dined with Mrs. Perry and my nephew, in the dining-room, and we went into the drawing-room to tea, about eight o'clock; the dinner things were cleared away from the dining-room before we left it, but the dessert things were left when we went up to the drawing-room; some of the things I have named remained in the dining-room when we went up stairs; we used a plated tea-pot at tea - that was not taken; the prisoner had taken down the tea things from the drawing-room - he was the only male servant in the house; we had no house-maid at that time, only a cook, and the nurserymaid, who was up one pair of stairs with the children; upon discovering our loss Mrs. Perry rang the nursery-bell; the cook came down - whether the nursery-maid came down I cannot say; I went up stairs, leaving my nephew in the kitchen with the prisoner; the watchman was passing - I called him in, and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How long, according to your judgment, would it take a person, even well acquainted with the premises, to take these things from the different places? A. A person well acquainted with the premises, and knowing the different articles, I should think would be very quick to do it in a quarter of an hour; I mean if he knew which was plated, and which was silver - if he had to examine them, to see which were plated, and which silver, it would take a much longer time, I should think, but it is a mere matter of opinion. I looked next day into the sideboard drawer, in the dining-room, and found the cut glass sugar-bason, but the silver sugar-ladle was gone, also a child's silver knife and fork, which was usually kept in the sideboard drawer, in a little green case; the linen, I should have said, was taken out of the drawer in the butler's pantry, and scattered on the ground.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You ordered the prisoner to fetch a light, and he brought one - was that in a servant's candlestick? A. Yes; we went down stairs with that candle, and I have no recollection of finding any other light below.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have spoken of different places where the silver was kept - did you, of your own knowledge, know where they were kept at that time? A. No. they were in the charge of the prisoner; I know the candlesticks were usually kept in the same place with the silver ones - I have seen them there, I suppose, within two or three months; when I asked if he had left the person who brought the letter in the hall; I am not sure whether he said Yes or anything, for my going down was so instantaneous.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say that he had left him there, and he had told you so at the time he gave you the letter? A. No, I do not recollect it; I have no recollection of his making any reply, I will not swear he did not say what you have stated, but I have no recollection of it, for when I said what I did, I rose up instantly; it was an action of a quarter of a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say, "I told you, Sir, when I gave you the letter, that the person was waiting?" A. No; I do not recollect one way or the other - I believe nothing passed, but I will not swear it; I did not ask if he had left the person, but said, "Surely you have not left the man in the hall;" I thought the ring at the bell was louder than usual - I noticed that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hand the letter to your nephew, and ask him if you had such a customer? A. I said, "Look at this - this is a hoax." I swear I did not ask him if we had such a customer, because I knew there was no such person - I swear that, to the best of my belief. None of my property has been found - the dish-covers were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100025"/>plated, not silver; I knew what articles I had as well as a gentleman might know; the prisoner had a list of the plate - I knew what was plated, and which were silver, having purchased them; I could recollect what articles were plated, because there were but few: I should be more confused to recollect the silver articles: he had a list of the silver. I do not know the state of the area gate on the night in question, but my nephew does; I tried the kitchen door that night, after the robbery, and found it shut - that was about nine o'clock: I think it was while the watchman was waiting for him, as I had desired him to take his livery off, and put on his own clothes; the watchman came in at the hall door - the ring at the bell was about nine o'clock, and the prisoner was in custody about ten minutes after nine o'clock; the whole transaction did not occupy more than ten minutes - a considerable portion of the property had been used at dinner, and I had seen two-thirds of it in the course of that afternoon. I could give you the items that were on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner was in the house from eight to nine o'clock? A. Yes, for he brought the tea up about eight o'clock, and about twenty minutes to nine took it down; as far as I can say, he was in the house from dinner time, till the note was brought to me - his own great coat, which hung in the servant's hall, was gone.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have been asked if the prisoner was in the house from eight to nine o'clock on Sunday evening - had he been absent on the day preceding? A. Yes, he went out at twelve o'clock, and returned at four; he had out leave to go out. None of the silver plate was left except what was locked in the iron-chest up stairs; I do not recollect any being left except the two castor tops.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The plate which was in daily use you saw frequently? A. Every day; and when we had company I saw what was on the table or sideboard; I knew what number of spoons and articles I had, and should have had no difficulty in pointing out what was plated and what was silver. I bought my plate four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was true. that when the prisoner presented you with the letter, he had left the man who brought it in the hall - could that man by possibility, before you got down stairs, have visited the places you have spoken of? A. No. it was impossible - there was not time for him even to have gone through the various places, without selecting the articles; if there had been three men they could not have made the selection in less than five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>MR. GEORGE JAMES PERRY. I am the prosecutor's nephew. On Sunday, the 17th of February I dined with him in Woburn-place, and recollect about nine o'clock in the evening the prisoner bringing a letter into the drawing-room. On my uncle opening and reading a little of the letter, he threw it down on the table towards me, saying it must be a trick, an imposition, or something of that kind; without my waiting to read the letter through, we all jumped up and ran down stairs - the letter was about ten lines, this is it (looking at it.) On going down stairs I observed the street door apparently open; I immediately looked into the back parlour; I went in at the door, which opens into the hall, and on going in missed my great coat off the back of a chair - we very shortly proceeded down the kitchen stairs to a small room behind the kitchen, which I understand to be the butler's pantry, and there I observed the prisoner's linen scattered about the floor; it was fit for use, clean from the laundress. My uncle very soon said he should send for the watchman, for he was sure the prisoner must be implicated - the prisoner was then close by me and within hearing; I was as near my uncle as him; I am hard of hearing and I heard it; the prisoner made no answer to that remark; the watchman came in at last; I saw the prisoner take his livery coat off, and while he was doing so, he told me that when he let the man in he took the letter, and put it on the end of the bannister rail, while he went down stairs and put on his livery coat, and that when he returned up to take the letter to the drawing-room, the man was still standing on the mat.</p>
               <p>Q. What interval of time in your opinion elapsed from the time the prisoner entered the drawing-room with the letter till your uncle went down stairs? A. It must have been in less than a minute I think; I do not recollect hearing the bell ring - I have been some time acquainted with my uncle's house - a person acquainted with the premises and with the property, I think it would have taken ten minutes to get it, but if not acquainted with the property and premises, if he had a light, which he must have had, I should think it would have taken upwards of twenty minutes - he could not do it without a light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. After your uncle had read the letter, do you remember his observing to the prisoner,"Why, you have not left the man standing in the hall, have you?" A. Yes. I have not the least recollection of the prisoner saying "Yes, Sir, I told you so when I gave you the letter" or of his saying any thing, the time passed so quickly - I do not think any words were uttered - my uncle is a glass-manufacturer: when I went along with the prisoner and watchman to the watch-house, I tried the area gate with my hand, and it was fastened - it cannot be fastened without being locked with a key - there is no catch lock to it, it is necessary to lock it to fasten it, as it appeared to me - I observed no catch lock to it - I will not swear there was none - I merely tried the bars of the gate with my hand - I cannot say whether the back area door was open or shut; I believe it was the first time I was down in that part of the house - not in the kitchen; the door leading from the kitchen to the street appeared closed when I was at it; I cannot say whether any body had previously closed it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you recollect the prisoner taking down the tea things? A. I do; he had his livery coat on then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing a man to have been in the hall when the prisoner left the hall to come up with the letter, in your judgment, was there time enough for him to go into the back parlour, and take your coat, and rush out of the house before you got down; supposing he had nothing else to do? A. I think he might have done that, but he could certainly not have done any thing more; he could not have gone to the chimney-piece for the clock, nor have gone down to the butler's pantry.</p>

            . On Sunday the 17th of February, I was in Mr. Perry's service as cook; I remember going into the butler's pantry during church time - about 12 o'clock; during morning service; the plate was there then, in separate parcles; I went out about eight in the evening to church - the prisoner let me out at the area gate; I had never before gone out at the area gate, on Sunday evening, while the prisoner was in my master's service; he unlocked the gate, and let me out - he kept the key himself; as I went out, he asked, how long I should be out? whether I should be back in time to take the nurse's supper up by nine o'clock; I said Yes - I returned from church about nine, or a few minutes before; I rang the hall bell and the prisoner let me in - he had his livery coat on then; I went in through the hall door - I went into the kitchen; put the nurse's supper on the tray, and then went up with it - and when I had been in the nursery about five minutes, my master made an alarm of a robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after the prisoner had let you in, dressed in his livery? A. I should think about tea minutes and five minutes after I got up stairs with the nurse's supper; I found the nurse in the nursery.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you able to speak accurately to the time which elapsed from when you came in till the alarm? A. I think it was about ten minutes; I remarked then that I had not been ten minutes in the house; I have no recollection of having been into the butler's pantry after master came from church, till after the robbery - the prisoner, the nurse and myself were the only servants; there was nobody in the house the whole of the day to my knowledge.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Orlando Stone, of Fish-street-hill; the prisoner was in Mr. Stone's service, and left about two years ago. On the 26th of February, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, he came into the warehouse, and inquired for Mr. Robinson, who was in Mr. Stone's service at that time - he wished to know if we had any calicoes similar to those he had before - I understood he had bought some before; I told him Mr. Robinson was engaged: I entered into conversation with him for about ten minutes, and then went to the opposite side of the counter, to look out an order, and while there the prisoner walked into the warehouse adjoining; I followed him, and in about a minute discovered that a piece of lawn had been removed from the shelf where I had observed it two hours before: I immediately went forwards to the shop, and informed Mr. Robinson; I detained the prisoner till a constable was fetched - I believe the prisoner was not aware of his being sent for; he came in ten minutes to the door of the house, and when the prisoner left I followed him to the door; I saw the constable lay hold of him: he took him into a court, searched him in my presence, and took from his right hand pocket a piece of lawn done up in paper, with our private mark on it - he was taken into the private house; and before Mr. Stone came down he said, "Hodgson, do you think Mr. Stone will prosecute me?" I think I said I thought he would; he exolaimed, "Oh, Lord! Oh, God!" Mr. Stone came down, and gave charge of him; he implored forgiveness. The lawn is worth 15s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know him before? A. Yes, I lived with him five years ago, and know nothing against him. I am fearful he has fallen into the habit of drinking; he smelled strong of wine at the time; and a bottle of wine was found in his pocket, but he knew very well what he was doing.</p>

I went round to the old iron-shops to inquire, and about a fortnight afterwards I found the property at Guildhall, and was certain of it; the copper was fixed, and the things hungs on a line to dry; I think I have seen the prisoner begging about the streets.</p>

On the 21st of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing in the shop, outside of the counter; my fellowshopman, who is not here, was behind the counter; these handkerchiefs hung over a rail, three yards within the door - I saw them not a moment before they were missed; I was folding up a piece of print, and on looking round I saw two or three men standing at the side of the window; about a minute after that I cast my eye round, and saw the five handkerchiefs being taken away; the prisoner had just got outside the door with them; I went out and saw him rolling them up, and putting them under his coat - the others followed him; I went after him, and had not got three yards before I said, "My man I want you," his accomplices said, run; I said "If you do I'll run after you;" he ran - I followed, and finding he got the better of me, I called, Stop thief! I lost sight of him for about half a minute; as he threw the handkerchiefs over my head - I was going back to the shop, and the witness gave them to me; I took them home knowing other persons were pursuing him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. He was a stranger to you? A. Perfectly so; he is one of the three I saw outside, and he is the one who had the handkerchiefs - the others got away.</p>

            . I keep the King's Head, public-house, Earl-street., about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Toplis. On the evening of the 29th of February the prisoner brought a package to my house, and said he wanted to leave it for a carrier who would call at twenty minutes past six o'clock for it; I looked at my clock, and it was just that time; I told him there was no direction on it - he took a piece of paper out of his pocket, and said he was no scholar, and wished me to write one for him: I wrote "Mr. Hayward, No. 1, Knightsbridge;" he then left the house; no carrier is in the habit of calling at my house, and none called that evening. The prisoner came again in about an hour with a portable desk; I asked where he brought the desk from; he shewed me a piece of paper, with Mr. Toplis name on it in print, and said he was going to leave the desk on his way home: I asked where he had brought the package from; he would give me no answer - I said it was rather an odd time of night to send out packages from any warehouse, and desired Mines and another person who were in my house, to go and-enquire at Mr. Toplis's - I detained him till Mines came back; Mr. Toplis came soon after, and claimed the package - Mines took it away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not carriers call at your house at times? A. Never for goods. The bill he shewed me was folded up with a direction where he was to take the desk: he did not say it was his own name, that he told me to write on the direction; he gave me no Christain name - he heard me send for Mines, and did not attempt to escape; he was in the passage, and several other people were there: I was in the bar.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. He told you he was to leave the desk as he went home; he did not say his home was at Knights-bridge? A. No.</p>

            . I have been two years and a half in Messrs. Toplis employ, and am foreman of the porters; we had some property in our warehouse for Mrs. Bowyer: I saw it stowed in the second floor warehouse, over the sale room, about a fortnight before this; there was a bed, bolster and pillow among other things - I packed them up in Russia matting, at Mrs. Bowyer's house; I never directed anybody to remove them; the prisoner had no authority to remove them without my orders. On the 29th of February, about a quarter to seven o'clock in the evening I delivered him a desk with a cheque order, (stating what was to be done to it) to take with it to Brownlow-street, Holborn; it had Toplis and Son's name on it; he said nothing to me about any package - Earl-street is quite out of his way there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he taken any of these orders out before? A. Certainly; he knew my master's name was printed on them, I suppose, but I do not know whether he can read - I am quite sure I gave him no order about the bed: I had treated him with some ale that night, as he came and told me he was going to leave Mr. Toplis, which I did not know before; he said he had no money in his pocket, and I took him to the next house, which is a public-house - he had a pint of ale with me, and a man, named Underhill, who had been formerly in Mr. Toplis' employ; he had been taking some things away the day before, and for that reason he treated the prisoner as well as me - he paid for one pint of ale, and I for another, as the prisoner said he had no money, and was in distress; I cannot tell where Underhill is - I am not in the habit of treating porters; I have treated the prisoner before when I have met him at any house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite certain you did not tell him to take the bed to Earl-street? A. I swear I did not.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. The sale brought a good many porters to your place? A. Yes; I occasionally drink with the porters.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Had any person, named Hayward, of Knightsbridge, purchased goods at the sale? A. None; I know no such person; I did not then know where the prisoner lodged, but I found out by a direction in Mr. Toplis' book, where he enters all the porters' directions - it was in Exeter-court, Exeter-street, Sloane-street; I went there that evening.</p>

On the 12th of March, I was in Fleet-market, and saw the prisoner and two others following him; and from their manner of walking I went into the road to watch; Mr. Butt walked on a little way, and stopped to look at a jeweller's window; the prisoner and the others walked on. I went up to Mr. Butt and asked if he had lost anything; he felt in his pocket and missed his handkerchief - I pointed out the men, and said they must be the party: I watched them; they turned down Fleet-street; I knew the prisoner before and pointed him out; the officer laid hold of him, and the others got away; I went after them; the bill against one of them was thrown out by the Grand Jury; I was gone after them when the handkerchief was picked up.</p>

On the 1st of April, at two o'clock, I was attending in the shop, and saw the prisoner come in with another woman; the other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100030"/>asked to look at some ribbons to trim a bonnet - the prisoner was close by her; all the shopmen were engaged; I was shewing some handkerchiefs to a person, and the prisoner asked to see them - I was close to them both, only the counter was between us; I put the handkerchiefs away while I took the money to the cashier, and afterwards brought them again for the prisoner to look at - I observed the other woman take the handkerchief out of the basket and lay it down on the counter, close to a box of ribbons; I asked if I should cut one handkerchief off from the piece - the other said, "No, we will see the ribbons first;" I showed them a box of ribbons - they complained that they were too dark; I went to fetch a basket of ribbons, and as I turned round I observed the prisoner stooping - I looked, and saw her stoop a second time, and observed her put something into a basket which she had at her feet, between her and the other woman; she immediately fixed on a ribbon at 8d. per yard, and said, she would take three yards, which I cut off; she laid the money down, saying, she was in great haste, and could not stop; the other had not expressed any hurry - I said to the prisoner, "I thought you came together?" I had seen them come in together, and asked if they had not come together; they said, Yes, and both asked to see some goods. In order to ascertain to whom the basket belonged, I stood till the prisoner took it up, and was going out with it; I called her back, and asked her to allow me to make a bill of the articles - she came back and set down her basket, and sat down herself; I took the ribbon from her which she had bought, and desired our young man not to let her go; I went and told Mr. Hall; I then came down - called her into the counting-house, and in the basket which was at her feet was found 12 yards of French white ribbon; she had bought pale yellow - she said the basket was not hers; the other woman went out while I was gone to Mr. Hall - that was before the charge was made; the prisoner said she knew nothing of her - the basket the ribbons were taken from had been by the side of the prisoner, and was not what I had shown her, but what a young man was showing a customer; the other woman never had the basket in her possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The young man who had produced that basket of ribbons is not here? A. No, there might be six persons serving, and about six customers; I call persons companions if they come together - I saw no bonnet in the prisoner's possession; the one she had on seemed to want a new trimming - the other young men never spoke to them; no other money was found in her possession - I did not state my suspicions to her, till she was taken into the counting-house, up stairs; I considered them to be both concerned, but did not tell the young woman to detain her; as the basket belonged to the prisoner, and I am certain the prisoner put something into the basket.</p>

On Friday night, the 22d of February, I left this gelding in the stable, at twenty minutes to ten o'clock, with other horses - it was tied up with a halter in the usual way; I locked the stable door - there were six horses there in all; I went there again about half-past five o'clock in the morning, found the door open, and this gelding gone - there are two doors to the stable; one was bolted inside, and the other locked - the one which I had bolted inside was wide open; there is a window with a slide to it, which was not fastened - a person could get through the window, open the door, and lead the horse out; I have seen it since - it is in my care; the prisoner is quite a stranger to me.</p>

            . I keep the Angel public-house, at Remneham, in Berkshire - it is near Henley, and twenty-two miles from Uxbridge; this gelding was found at my father's, who keeps the Two Brewers, public-house, at Remneham; the prisoner brought the gelding to my father's on Saturday evening, the 23d of February, about six o'clock; I saw him come to the house - it had a regular bridle and saddle on it; I saw my father take the horse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100031"/>from him, but did not hear what he said; he staid there till Tuesday morning, when he was taken away - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell why he staid so long at your father's house? A. Yes; he said he was sent there with the horse by his master, who was a horse-dealer at Oxford, and he was to wait there till his master came on the Sunday, to go to Abingdon fair; he said his master was to come about the middle of the day on Sunday; he stated this on Sunday morning, that he expected his master that day, and that his master was going to Abingdon fair; that his master was a horse-dealer, and said he lived with Mr. Crab, of Oxford. I heard him, on the Sunday morning, offer a young man, named Nelson, the horse to ride out; he said he had got a horse which Nelson might ride out; this was between nine and ten o'clock, when he was drinking with Nelson and another young man - he said he might ride him out in the afternoon if he chose; I then suspected there was something wrong, and told my father not to let him get the horse out of the stable; I went over to my father's again in the evening, and the prisoner went and helped to take a horse out of a gig, and put it into the same stable as the horse in question was - nothing more happened that night: on Monday I got up, and went to my father's - the prisoner was not up; I went and informed the Magistrate, got a constable, and detained the prisoner and the horse; Joseph Tollitt and the ostler have both seen the same horse, and claimed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down to see Mr. Tollitt, as I was out of service; I stopped just by Hanwellgate, to see a man walking; a man came up and asked if I was out of place - I said Yes; he said if I would take a horse to Uxbridge he would pay me for it; I said I could not take it down for less than 30s., and he offered to pay me for it; I brought a horse for him to London, and next morning he gave me another horse, and told me it belonged to a Mr. Crab, of Oxford, and told me to take it there.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer of Hatton-garden. On the 28th of February, in consequence of information which I received, I went, in company with Edwards and Lee, to Crick's-fields, Paddington; I found a cottage there - it had only two rooms and a kitchen; they were all on the ground floor; the cottage is but one story high, and stood alone - there is a small garden all round it. I entered the house in company with Edwards, at the back door, which was shut, and on the latch; I went through the little kitchen into the parlour, on the right hand, and there I saw the female prisoner, Price, sitting by the fireside, with her back towards the window - she was close to the fire; there was a fire in the grate: on my going in she shrieked out, "Oh, my Lord!" or "Oh, my God!" we seized her and secured her.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you secured her, did you see her do anything? A. I saw Edwards take some money out of her hand; she had this cup in her hand - she tried to throw it into the firs- it hit my hand, which broke the fall, and it did not break - it fell on the fire; I took it off the fire, and found in it the paste which I understand they use to colour base money - it is now in the cup; I saw Edwards try this stuff on a penny-piece, and it gave it the colour of silver.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Edwards went in at the back door? A. Yes; Lee came in at the front; I saw Edwards take some money out of her hand, but what money it was I could not see; we then examined her hands, and her right hand particularly was very much stained with a dark green colour; her right thumb and fingers were stained. I have tried the stuff in the cup, and it turned my own thumb and finger green; we sent for Mr. Powell, and when he came we searched the room - he was at hand, and came almost directly; nothing had been disturbed but the cup before he came; on his coming I found what appeared to be a shilling on the bar of the grate - this is it (producing it) and under the grate I found these two half-crowns and a sixpence, which I produce. I found a saucepan on the floor of the room, close to her side, with three shillings and a half-crown - I produce them; the saucepan at that time had something wet in it; it was some liquid, but nothing that would save; it was a few drops of liquid; I found a piece of sand paper by the side of her; it had the appearance of having been used; I found a glass bottle by the side of her, in a little recess on her left hand, by the fireplace, and there was aquafortis in it; she sat with her left hand to the fire; I found a pair of bellows there, with the appearance of something having been rubbed on it: there is something white - it has been nearly rubbed off; I went into the bed-room, and found a table there; here is the drawer of that table; it has the appearance of a stain on it, and of brass filings. I saw nothing of the male prisoner in the cottage - I went out, and got information from a man outside, and ran in company with him across the fields, as he had directed me: I did not myself come up with the male prisoner, but I saw Edwards bring him back without his coat, in a direction of the premises I had not seen him before. I went on in a direction pointed out to me and found this coat, which the male prisoner afterwards claimed; he desired me to let him have it to put on, and said it was his - he was without a coat when he was brought back, and his breeches were all over mud and wet; he was then secured: the articles found in the house are here.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100032"/>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. When did you receive this information? A. I received several informations.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. A person in Coldbathfields had his liberty given him to give information; the house I believe was not fastened at all. Witness. No, it was only on the latch. I cannot say whether there were curtains to the window of the room in which I found the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. There are very low windows, I believe such as can be seen from the road by anybody passing? A. Yes, but the cottage is some distance from the road: I am sure a person walking in the road could not see into the room; the road is not finished; the footpath in the road is low down, as low as their window nearly; the cottage stands quite back - I had a great deal of trouble to get along the foothpath, by laying hold of the rails, and then I could not see what was doing inside the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe anything particular on my wife's face? A. I did - it appeared to me as if she had had a beating; she had a black eye: she fainted, and struggled a good deal. I seized her the moment I entered the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you assert on your oath that she could throw a cup into the fire? A. Her fainting was after she was handcuffed.</p>

            . I am an officer. I accompanied Limbrick and other officers on the 28th of February, to Crick's fields - I entered the cottage with Limbrick - it is only one story high; we went to the front room - I saw the female prisoner sitting by the side of the fire; I directly laid hold of her, with Limbrick; she was then throwing a tea-cup into the fire; this is the cup, (producing it) and from her hand I took these five sixpences, which were quite wet (producing them) - they were wet, as if they had been put into the pickle, as they call it, and her hand was wet likewise; the sixpences were white, and had the appearance of having been recently coloured; I dried them myself with rag, and since that they have changed their colour; they are a brass colour: we secured her; I was given to understand the male prisoner had run across the fields; I pursued across the field - I did not know the male prisoner before; I saw him crossing one field, and jump into a wide ditch; I then saw him get out of the ditch again - he had a light coloured coat when he was running in the field; he threw it off as he was running, and jumped into the ditch - I saw him get out of the ditch - I saw some men at work in the field, and told them I wanted him for murder; they brought him back to me; I took him back to the cottage again - we secured him and the woman. I then tried this powder or paste in the cup on a penny-piece - here is that penny-piece; it has given it a white colour. The prisoners were put into a coach, and conveyed to the office. I asked the male prisoner how long he had lived there - I did not say anything to induce him to tell me - he said it wanted a month and one week to the half year.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went in pursuit of the man did you examine the person of the female prisoner? A. I did; the finger and thumb of her right hand particularly were stained with a kind of yellow cast. I made a further search after taking them to the office; Limbrick and Mr. Powell had remained in the house; I found them there when I returned. I found nothing particular afterwards, except a brush, which I gave to Lee - it appeared greasy, and I found a brown powder - here it is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. When you brought me back as a prisoner, did you not say to a man who was at work near the house, "I am much obliged to you for giving the office?" A. I did not. When I first went into the house I asked Lee where the man was.</p>
               <p>Q. You had just received information then that I was in the house? A. I expected to find you in the house, and went into the other room to look for you.</p>

I got in at the front door of the cottage; I found a key outside the door - I turned the key, and opened it; I found the female prisoner struggling with Edwards and Limbrick; I assisted in securing her; I had her in my care while Limbrick and Edwards went after the man. I went into the bed-room, but saw nobody there - there was only one bed in the house- Mr. Powell came in in a very few minutes. I saw a half-crown in the ashes, and a shilling on the flat upper bar of the stove - I found on the tea-board eight half-crowns and eight shillings, which are here; I also found a tooth-brush, which had the appearance of some black stuff in it, soot or something, and I found a fire shovel, which I produce - it had the appearance of having been smoked over the fire, and there is a sort of acid, which I suppose to be cream of tartar, on the inside of it; I did not taste it then, but did after I got to the office - it has been in my possession till just now. I also produce the eight half-crowns and toothbrush.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. I believe you searched the place minutely - did you find anything secreted in any of the drawers? A. The things were all open in the room- every thing I found was in one room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all close by the table where my wife was sitting? A. Yes - she was not sitting when I entered, but the things were near the table, which was near the fire, with the breakfast things on it; I think there was only one table in the room.</p>

            . Q. I believe you asked me where the man was when you came in? A. I dare say I did - I went into the bed-room to look for the man; there was a white hat and drab coat on the bed; the man claimed it when he was brought in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. Have you had the contents of the shovel analized? A. No; there was a grate with a fire in it, but whether the grate was set I do not know.</p>

            . I am a plasterer. On the 28th of February I was in Crick's-fields, and on passing the cottage the prisoners live in I saw Limbrick, Edwards and Lee; I saw the male prisoner outside the cottage, at the side of the cottage - I did not know him before; he had on a white rough coat; I think he had a hat, but do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100033"/>know; I did not see what he was doing; he seemed as if he was doing some pales outside; he had a nail box in his hand. I saw the officers go into the house, and when they had gone in I heard a female scream inside the house; the male prisoner then came up to the corner, and looked on one side, towards the front of the house - he then dropped his nail box, and ran across the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. When he looked round could he see the officers? A. No, they were inside: he ran across the fields at the back part of the house - I saw one of the officers run after him; another man stopped him, and brought him back to the officer; I did not run after him: when he ran across the fields I had a view of him, and could see him run right down the field - I saw him pull off his coat, and throw it through a hedge, into another field; I afterwards saw that coat - I picked it up, and brought it to Limbrick. I saw the prisoner brought back, and am sure he is the man who ran from the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. Which way did I leave the house at first? A. You ran down the side of the field, by the cottage; the place you were taken in is behind the cottage; I saw you brought back - I heard no observation made by Edwards. I had not been near the cottage five minutes, when I saw the officers, and did not see you till the officers were there; I did not see you at work outside for those five minutes.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live in Cato-street, Edgware-road. I was employed on Thursday, the 28th of February, in building a cottage near where the prisoners live; I was at work, and saw the male prisoner come out of the cottage, with a few palings under his arm; he was nailing them up to the fence. I saw him in the garden for about a quarter of an hour before I saw the officers - before I got sight of the officers I saw Price running away down the field, without his hat, and in a little time I saw Edwards run down the field, and in a short time I saw him bring the prisoner back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. Did not Edwards say to you, "I am much obliged to you for giving the office?" A. I never heard a word of the sort - I was not dressed in a brown coat, I had a jacket on; I was at labour at the cottage, and was the only labourer there; whether there was anybody there dressed in a brown coat I cannot say.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On the 28th of February I was in Mr. Giblett's field - I saw the male prisoner coming away from his house, running up towards where I was at work - he had a waistcoat on, but no coat when I saw him - a person was pursuing him, who hallooed out, "Stop thief!" and "A murderer!" I stopped the prisoner as he was coming along; I asked him what was the matter - he said nothing - I said, "What have you done?""Nothing," said he; I said he must go back, and took him back to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. Did you not tell the Justice that I sat down on a barrow on coming up to you, apparently exhausted? A. Yes, I did say you sat down on a barrow; Edwards mentioned the words "rogue and murderer."</p>

            . I am assistant to the Solicitor of the Mint. I was at the cottage in Crick's-fields on the 28th of February; it was twenty minutes after one o'clock when the officers entered the cottage; I was close by, and went in in five minutes - when I got into the house I found the female prisoner in the custody of the officers, Limbrick and Lee; the male prisoner not being found in the house, Edwards went out backwards, to look for him; he was soon afterwards brought into the house by Edwards, accompanied by a witness who had secured him; a search then took place by the officers, who found the counterfeit money, produced; the colouring materials in the cup were produced to me - I desired Edwards to try the effect of it on a piece of copper, which he did, and it gave it the colour and appearance of silver. The prisoners were secured and taken away - I remained in the house.</p>

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint, and have been so many years. (Examining three half-crowns, four shillings, and a sixpence, produced by Limbrick) these three half-crowns are counterfeit - the shillings are counterfeit, and the sixpence also - the half-crowns appear to me to have undergone a preparation to fit them for a more regular state for circulation, than when they come from the coiner; by rubbing off the roughness of the die, then re-silvering, and rubbing them with grease, to give them the appearance of having been in circulation; here is the glass-paper produced - it appears to have been used on some sort of metal; the paper is generally used for polishing wood; nothing would rub the half-crowns so well as this paper. [The witness here wetted the contents of the cup produced, with plain water and rubbed it on a piece of copper] this powder has produced an appearance of silver on the copper; the powder is a strong nitrate of silver. Here are the five sixpences produced by Edwards - they are all counterfeit; they are in such a state now that I cannot tell what has been done with them; they appear to have been left in acid; the application of the stuff in the cup would give them the appearance of silver - (rubbing it on) to complete the process, it wants to be washed with a slight acid; I presume these sixpences have been once coloured, but I cannot say so - they are silvered before they are struck in the die, then rubbed, and coloured a fresh, but whether these have been re-coloured a second time I cannot say; but the half-crowns, shillings, and sixpence have undergone all that process.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100034"/>Q. Now examine the eight half crowns and eight shillings produced by Lee? A. These are all counterfeit - they are just in the state in which they came from the original coiner - just as they come from the die; they have not been rubbed nor re-silvered; I have examined all the apparatus produced - it is all the apparatus which is generally used on these occasions; here is the nitrate of silver, aquafortis to be diluted with water, to make the acid, or for the purpose of making the nitrate of silver; here is the paper to rub the money down - a small saucepan, which is very commonly used, to neal it, to heat it to give it a better ring; it is generally done in a fire shovel.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do all the half-crowns appear to have been struck from the same die? A. They do, my Lord, and the shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. There is a brown powder produced, what is that? A. Here is a powder which appears like marble dust, but I cannot say what it is.</p>
               <p>MR. FRANKLYN. I am a moneyer of the Mint. (Looking at the three half-crowns, four shillings, and a sixpence) these are all counterfeit - I cannot say what the metal is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. Are any of them fit for circulation? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. FIELD. I have examined the coins - they are brass, washed with a slight degree of silver before the die is struck.[Here the witness broke a shilling, and produced it to the Court.]</p>
               <p>HAMBRY PRICE'S Defence. I scarcely know how to defend myself, having been, by various circumstances, unable to employ a legal gentleman; but, as far as relates to the articles produced, I have no knowledge of them. About sixteen months ago I became acquainted with one Antonio, an artificial florist; he lodged with a young man, who is since married - a man named Harvey, who has been tried for passing these things and acquitted: as soon as I discovered this I ceased to have any connexion with them. About six months ago I met Antonio, who said he understood Harvey was in Coldbath-fields for passing bad coin; I saw nothing of him for a fortnight or three weeks, when he knocked at my door - I expressed my surprise at seeing him, as I understood he was to have twelve months imprisonment; he said he had got his imprisonment remitted for his good behaviour, and had got a situation with a baker; I knew he was a baker by trade. I begged of him not to come to my place, but he being in a deplorable situation I invited him to dinner (I believe) which I was having when he came; he came again two or three times - I repeatedly begged of him not to come. On the morning in question he came while we were at breakfast - my wife and I had had a quarrel, and we again resumed the quarrel; I went out of the house and never entered it again till I was a prisoner, which was in an hour. Harvey had promised four days before to bring me some seeds to put in my garden, and after I went out of the house it seems he said he had brought me the seeds for the garden, and my wife would have brought them to me, but was fearful of resuming the quarrel; I had previously given her a black eye. When the officers entered the house I heard her exclaim, "Oh, my God!" - a man came and told me to go, for my wife had sent for the officers; I ran away, and hearing a cry of Stop thief and murder! hastened me, for I was fearful I had done my wife a serious injury. I at last sat down on a barrow, reflecting that I could not have done my wife such an injury; I was brought back, and saw Mr. Powell and Edwards in the room examining the papers. I have brought a certificate of my marriage if it will have any effect.</p>
               <p>MARY PRICE'S Defence (written) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I have very little to urge in my defence; for, comparatively speaking, I know nothing of this transaction. The parcel that was found by the officers had been left about twenty minutes before, by a young man with whom my husband was acquainted, of the name of Edward Harvey. I, my Lord and Gentlemen, solemnly protest that I did not know there was such a thing as a counterfeit piece of money of any description in the house; nor did I ever see them at all before they were produced at the Magistrate's, and then, from the state of my feelings, only partially; the saucepan that was shewn I had boiled two eggs in for breakfast, and that only. My Lord and Gentlemen, - Had it not been for an unfortunate quarrel between my husband and me, this calamitous circumstance never could have happened; for, Gentlemen, I should have carried to my husband, or have examined, the supposed parcel of seeds myself, and then the villainy, of this worse than villain, would have been detected. Of the transactions of that day, from the entrance of the officers to my committal at night, I have no recollection; for, on being seized by the officers, I fainted, from the effect of their behaviour and manner, thinking that, seeing me alone, they had entered for murder or plunder. My Lord and Gentlemen, - As I expect Divine Mercy, so do I assure you, that the whole is the contrivance of the villain Harvey, the informer; for purposes that must be obvious; by himself, or, as I firmly believe, with the assistance of others. Should we, or either of us, this day obtain our liberty, I am confident we then shall be enabled to produce the full proof of his or their superior villainy. Confidently relying on your discriminating judgment, my Lord, and on your cool deliberation and reflection, Gentlemen, I cheerfully resign my fate to your keeping; almost certain of the verdict that I anticipate.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my beat is in North-street, City-road, and Pump-row.

            . This is the Minister's plate; I am sure it was all safe when I went to bed on Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was accosted by this man, he asked what I had got; I directly told him I did not know; that my employer was in the coach - he directly called out, "Look out," and another man went to the coach, spoke to the man, searched the coach and came away, letting my employer escape; he then comes to the watch-house, leaving the coach about a mile off, and said he supposed the coach was coming to the watch-house. On my return home from Battle-bridge, where I had been drinking at a public-house with a friend or two till twelve o'clock, and on going home to Molineux-street, Paddington, two gentlemen asked me to get them a coach; they asked me to go to the corner of Old Cavendish-street, to wait and look out for a coach till they came back to me - one of them returned with a bundle under his arm; he called the waterman, who opened the coach door; the coachman took the cloths off his horses, and the gentleman told him to drive him to the Vinegar-yard: he said to me,"I have no money to pay you - will you go in the coach with me?" I got in, and the other man followed me. It is very unlikely that I or any man could go to a house of that description, get in at the window, and go to where the plate was deposited, by themselves; it is evident that some men belonging to the establishment are concerned in it, and have brought me here for it - it is very unlikely that the shutters should be left unfastened unless they had some foresight of it. I was taken at a quarter-past three o'clock; the door must have been open then, and the watchman had seen it safe before that [After his Lordship had recapitulated the evidence to the Jury, the Prisoner added,] After I returned from the Friend-in-Hand public-house, a young man who had fallen out with another fought in the New-road with him - he was taken to the watch-house; two young men and I went into the watch-house and spoke for him; it was one o'clock when I left the watch-house, which was the reason I did not go home - and there is a man here to prove it - his name is Philip Webster.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. What time was this? A. Between two and three o'clock - it was as light as day; I lost sight of them for about a minute, when they went round the end of the house, but they stood at the garden gate when I got out of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he fell, were the other three before him? A. Yes, and they went on.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. When you looked out of window you were undressed, I suppose? A. No; I had my trousers and waistcoat on; I was putting my jacket on at the time: I lost sight of them when I went from the window to go to the door - I only had to go down six stairs, and directly went out; I had only two bolts and a lock to undo; the key was in the door; I unlocked it, and got out in a very little time.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Brentford, which is in Isleworth parish. On Sunday morning, the 30th of March, I heard an alarm of Stop thief! three men came up to me - I tried to stop them all three; Rust then came up, and hit me on the head with this crow-bar (producing it) - I did not let him hit me more than once; I threw him on his back, and took it from him; one of the other two men hit me with a stick across the back of my head and shoulders - they escaped; I kept hold of Rust. I gave the crow-bar to Mr. Roper.</p>

            . I occupy this house, and lived in it on this night - it is in the parish of Isleworth. I went in pursuit with my cousin, and assisted in taking the two prisoners; I went to my premises after they were secured; the watchman (Welch) gave me this crow-bar - I found the sash of the kitchen window thrown up, but the shutters were shut and fastened; I observed a mark on the under part of the shutter - it was the mark of a crow-bar; the crow-bar appeared to have gone through underneath, quite at the further end of the shutter, and there was a mark on the inside ledge of the shutter - it appeared to be the mark of the crow-bar: I applied the end of the crow-bar to it - it corresponded exactly. I found some footmarks under the kitchen window. Gold gave me the stock of a centrebit. I searched Ford, and took a knife from his pocket, also a sixpence and 5d. - it was a very large clasp-knife; a penknife was also found on him. I found nothing else on the premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has any person a right to the dwelling-house besides yourself? A. No - I carry on business there, and have no partner; I have no other Christian name. I am sure the house is in Isleworth parish. I have no lodgers; the fastenings of the shutters were not injured.</p>
               <p>Q. All the security which would arise from the shutters was as complete in the morning as it was at night? A. Yes; the mark inside was just underneath the shutter - there was no hole made through the shutter, but the crow had been introduced underneath; the window was open - the shutters are inside ones.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is the shutter when shut, from the glass of the window? A. I should think two inches or two inches and a half from the glass of the window.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was present at the prisoners' examination before the Magistrate; the pencil-case and comb were produced before them; Ford said they were both his property - Rust made answer, and said the comb was his, but he had lent it to Ford. I confined the prisoners in the cage, and after that went through the garden of Gold, the last witness, and observed that his garden door and the wall were broken all to pieces; those premises join Mr. Roper's. I went to Mr. Roper's kitchen window - there was a number of footmarks about the place- I went to the cage on Sunday morning, about nine o'clock, and took off Rust's shoes, which I compared with the footmarks about the kitchen window; they fitted exactly; one shoe had an iron tip, and the other had none - they both fitted exactly.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday, the 27th of February, in Kingsland-road; I first saw him in Hackney-road with this mare, and another man was on the top of it; I watched them both into a stable in Union-street, Kingsland-road; they looked at me and I had a suspicion of them - they went into the stable; the prisoner came out and went to a corn-chandler's in Kingsland-road, then returned, and both came out of the stable and went in the direction of the Hackney-road, into Austin-street; they kept looking after me - they turned to the right and came up into the same street they had gone down - they went towards Cock-lane; I missed them both for a minute or two - then looked, and saw the other man - I went over to the public-house to enquire if the prisoner had gone in there; I found he had not; I went to the door and saw the prisoner come out of a chandler's shop at the corner of the street the other man had gone down; he looked over at me and came over to the public-house, went in, came out again, and I asked him about the mare which he had taken into the stable; he said, "Why, it is mine. I bought it at Chesham fair, and gave 15l. for it;" I said, "Let us look at it, I doubt whether it is all right;" he went to the stables, and asked for the key; the stables were opened - we went in; he said it was his - I said he should come to the office: he came with me to Worship-street. I looked into the Hue and Cry in his presence, and saw a description of a horse, which led me to write to Mr. Haslewood, who came up and owned it; I am certain the prisoner said it was his own, and that he had bought it at Chesham fair for 15l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The man you saw with the prisoner acted as owner? A. He was on the horse; the prisoner took hold of the bridle, and came to the office with me, and said it was his horse. I had not observed him meddle with it till I questioned him about it. The other man got off while I was following them, and they both went to the stable together; I did not know the other man; I am sure the prisoner said he bought the horse at Chesham fair, not at Chertsey; I am positive of that. I asked him if he knew the person he bought it of; he said that was not a question of mine - and he should answer me no more questions.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he refer you to any other man of whom you could enquire about it? A. Not at all; he said he bought it, and gave 15l. for it.</p>

            . I am a plasterer and stenciller: the prisoner first came to me on Tuesday, the 26th of February; I was not in the way at that time: I was sent for and came over to my stables, and found the prisoner there: he said, "You have got a stable to let" - I said I had; I unlocked the door - he enquired the rent of it - I said 6s. a week: he said it would suit him very well if the rent was lower, and he would let me know the same evening. I saw no more of him till next morning between eleven and twelve o'clock, when he came, and a man with him, on a brown mare; the man was riding and the prisoner walking; the prisoner came to the door and said."I could not come last night, I had other business to do." I said he was in time - he said he would give me 5s. a week for the stable; I said it did not belong to me, and I must have 6s. a week for it; he then said to the man, "Bring the mare in;" it was brought in and tied up to the stall; he then said the loft was of no use to him, and perhaps I might let it for 2s. a week, which would ease the rent - I said I would stick up a bill to say it was to let - he said he would give me 2s. for my trouble if I could let it. He then said to the man,"You must get some litter and put under the horse;" I said he would find plenty of straw, which he did; he said he would give me something to drink for it; I went to the public-house with him and had a glass of liquor; we returned to the stable, and the prisoner said to the man"The young man will give you the key." I gave the man the key, and both bid me good day. I went home to dinner, and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour I was sent for - I came down - saw Tyrrell, the officer, and the prisoner waiting at the stable door; the prisoner asked me to unlock the door; I said "Your man had a key" - he said Yes, but he was not in the way; I had a key and unlocked the door; Tyrrell and the prisoner walked in - I did not hear their conversation; in a short time Tyrrell came and told me to attend at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner refer you to anybody else as the owner of the horse? A. No; he told me it was his own, and he took the stable to put his horse into.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not hear the other man bargain to sell him the mare? A. No; I never heard of his buying it of the other man.</p>

Yes, said I; he said, "Well, you have taken care of my horse very well:" I said, "I have taken as much care as I could, on account of what you ordered - you ordered him to have nothing but hay:" he said, "I am very well satisfied, and I expect a poney to come to-day, and in a day or two I may have two or three horses; and, as you have taken so much care, I will send them here;" he was alone that day, and spoke of the mare as his own - he came again next day, with another man, and said, "Ostler, I wish you would bring that mare out, for I am going to have her shod at the smith's;" I said"What smiths are you going to?" he said, "He is a crosseyed man;" I said it was Etherington; "Yes (said he), stop, don't bring her out with the bridle:" he went away, and took the mare with him - I saw nothing more of him, but in consequence of an advertisement in the Hue and Cry, I attended at Worship-street, at his third examination; I found him in custody, and saw the mare in the possession of Mr. Haslewood's brother, at the office door - I never saw it in the possession of John Haslewood or Tyrrell - the mare I saw in possession of Haslewood's brother is the same as I had in my stable, and which I had this conversation about with the prisoner - I am certain of it; I am sure of the prisoner's person.</p>

Smith, the deceased, frequented the house, and was there on Saturday, the 22d of March, between six and seven o'clock, very much in liquor - he came in about half-past six, and was very disorderly; he kept abusing my mistress and her sister who were in the bar; my master was out, and had asked the prisoner to come home as early as he could to assist mistress in the house - he came between six and seven o'clock, when the deceased was abusing mistress; the prisoner cleaned himself to wait in the tap-room; Smith continued to abuse mistress and her sister till a quarter to ten, when he went into the parlour and rang the bell violently - he was intoxicated, and we would not supply him with liquor; I answered the bell - Smith was standing at the door, and two gentlemen behind him; he asked them to take something, which they refused; he then said, "I shall go and serve Curley out," (the prisoner was called by that name in the house) - he went into the passage, opened the taproom door, and dragged Curley out by the collar with both hands - the prisoner had done nothing to him; two gentlemen who had followed him from the parlour got him away, and to prevent further disturbance I pushed Smith out of doors - he asked me to give him his hat, which I did; he left the house, and in five or ten minutes returned to the bar - he continued abusing us as before; the prisoner was then in the tap-room - mistress called him out, intending to pacify the deceased, who was using words unfit for a female to hear; the prisoner came and stood in the passage outside the tap-room door, and said, "Smith, take my advice, and go home" - Smith answered, "I shall go when I like, and where I like;" he then challenged the prisoner to fight - they both went out of the house together, and when I got to the door I saw Smith rising from the ground; I laid hold of his arm, and begged of him, for Heaven's sake, to come into the house, and not fight any more - he got from me, and struck another blow at the prisoner, who then gave him a push between the shoulders and he fell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he behind him? A. He was coming towards him from the opposite side of the way - he was rather sideways; I went in to get a candle, and when I came out I saw him sitting on the curb on the other side of the way, but he did not appear to be hurt; Mr. Peters came and examined him - the prisoner and three others brought him into the house; he staid there all night, and master sat up with him - he died in our house about nine o'clock the next evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He was very drunk, was he not also in a very great passion? A. Yes- the prisoner and him were very great friends before, and he treated him the day before; it was time for our house to be cleared - the prisoner only pushed him to get him away from him; the prisoner is a very good natured young man.</p>

               <p>Q. Might not his being in liquor and in a passion, have caused the rupture of the blood-vessel? A. Certainly - and his straining when vomiting would produce it.</p>

On the 8th of March I observed a cart coming down Long-lane at a very fast rate; I thought the springs to it were mine before I saw them, from their peculiar rattle; I followed the cart into Smithfield, where it stopped; the prisoner and two or three young lads about fourteen years old, were in it: I went and handled the cart all round; Wells then asked if I would buy it; I asked the price - he asked seven guineas and a half; I said I did not think the springs were strong enough for my purpose - he said they were strong enough for anything, for he had used them a scores of times to bring potatoes to his mother's, with 16 cwt. on them. I said, "Your cart-builders don't live far from Spitafields, and have not far to take them" - he said, "I have to take them to Limehouse-fields," which is about 300 yards from my yard. I went aside and asked a man to fetch an officer, and gave him in charge - I said, "These are my springs on that cart, and I will swear to them" - the officer asked how he came by them - he said, he was not obliged to tell - the officer said, "You must tell; or I must take you into custody." The prisoner then said,"If they are your springs you may have them" - the officer said that would not do, and took him in charge, horse, cart, and all. I examined the springs, and am certain of them - they were separated from the cart, and are here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say he had bought them in the market on the Friday before? A. Yes, I forgot that; the officer and him went round the market for about ten minutes, for him to point out the man - I am certain he said he had bought them on the Friday before, which was before I lost them - I missed them on the Tuesday; I used to drive four days a week, and I knew the rattle of them - I thought they were mine before I saw them; it struck me in a moment they were mine from the rattle - that induced me to look round - it did not convince me at once that they were mine; I swear to the rattle, which is caused by the hole being worn in an oblong way- that would have been prevented by putting new irons to them; they had been fresh painted when I found them - the paint was wet; my son took the dimensions of the holes on the cart, and brought it to Guildhall to match them - I did not alter the plates - the blacksmith scraped them by my son's desire; he scraped them of his own accord - my son did not desire him to do so to my knowledge; the prisoner did not hear me send for the officer.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. My father has made a mistake, the springs were missed on the morning of the 26th; I locked them up in the yard myself between six and seven o'clock on the 25th - they were fastened to an axletree which laid on the ground; I went to the yard between six and seven o'clock next morning, and they were gone - I saw them on the Saturday following at Guildhall, and am certain of their being my father's; I had built the cart myself, and not being a cartwright it took me longer than usual, and I am certain of the springs; I went to the yard on the Saturday afternoon, and measured the holes of the scroll irons - they corresponded with the bolts; I have not the least doubt of them; the prisoner was a stranger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen him near your premises? A. No; I should not know the rattle of the springs as I very seldom ride in the cart; I never remarked their jingling - I have been in the cart; they are not of an uncommon size - there were eight leaves to them, but when we found them one was taken off; the rivet was plainly to be seen, where it had been.</p>

I saw these springs in Burton's possession before the robbery, and saw them at Guildhall; I have no doubt of their being the same springs - an attempt has been made to alter them by taking one of the leaves off; I am confident they are Burton's springs - I had made an alteration in them on the Friday before they were taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you repair them? A. Yes, they had a defect which would cause a jingle - it would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100042"/>cost about a guinea and a half to remedy that - they would then be worth about 5l.; I know them by two or three marks which are very seldom found on springs - I never saw any with such marks; I scraped them to point out where the friction of the leaf was; the prosecutor asked how I could tell about the friction - I had no conversation with him about them; they were painted over, but I should know them if there had been twenty coats of paint - I should know one part of them; I have no doubt whatever of these being the same.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you attend before the Magistrate? A. Yes, and saw the springs in the outer room; I am not a smith; the springs he bought were exactly like these - they had seven plate; they appeared either painted or greased - they looked quite black, and by greasing an old pair they will look quite new.</p>

            . Q. What repairs did you do to them? A. I made a new scroll iron - this is the iron I made, to the best of my recollection, but I will not positively swear it, but I swear to the springs, for I noticed a particular mark on both of them; several of the knobs have holes brust aside, and one of the plates hung over the other, which is common, if they have been made a long time, but in the generality of springs the plates are all alike - these are not so.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 17th of March, in Catherine-street, Strand; I found one duplicate on him; I told him I took him for stealing the pistols; he said, "If he gets them back again, I suppose it will be all right?"

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At what time did you go out? A. Between ten and eleven o'clock; the surgery door is in the hall, and the window looks into a front garden, which is about three yards from the street; I do not usually keep money in that drawer - a person must come through the hall to get to the surgery; that is easily done. I think the elder prisoner's face is familiar to me, but I will not say I have seen him about the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does the hall door open into the street? A. To the garden, the gate of which is always open - it is an open surgery where medicines are sometimes retailed.</p>

On the morning of the 5th of February my shop was broken open, and these things stolen out - I do not remember having seen them since the latter end of November: on the 19th of March I saw the brooch and nutmeg-grater in the possession of Vann; I never saw the prisoner about my shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS? Q. Were not a great many other things stolen at the same time? A. Yes, upwards of 100l. worth; only I and my wife serve in the shop - she does not enter down what she sells; she might sell them, and forget to account for them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you cannot say these articles were stolen when your shop was broken open? A. I only know we had such articles; but cannot say they were in the shop at that time.</p>

            . My husband is a gentleman's butler; I live at Mr. Broxup's. On the 26th of March I was at tea in the room behind the shop; about six o'clock in the evening I heard a noise in the shop; I opened the room door and went into the shop - I saw two persons standing there, one (taller than the prisoner) apparently reaching over the counter - the prisoner who was the other was standing behind him; they could get the combs out of the glass case by reaching over the counter. I went round the counter, and saw the glass case was disturbed; the tall man asked me for something - I paid no attention to that but said to him, "Where is the other man gone? what is he gone for?" (the prisoner had then gone out) - the other man said "What's the matter? Have you lost any thing?" I missed some combs; he picked up his hat immediately, and said he would go after the man - but he took a contrary direction. I went out and caught sight of the prisoner about fifty yards off - secured him myself and brought him back; one comb was found in his pocket and two in his hat.</p>

I went out at a few minutes before three o'clock in the afternoon, to go to Divine service - I left nobody in the house - the house was all properly secured, the window sash was fastened down with a catch and a screw, the glass was all whole, the doors all fastened, and the gate locked. I returned in about an hour, and as I came back was told my house was broken open - I had left every thing safe in it when I went to chapel - on returning I found the window sash thrown up which I had left secure - I found the flap of the bureau, which was in the parlour, turned down, the drawers all open, and the papers and memorandums in great confusion - I had left it locked - it appeared to have been forced with a chisel or something - I had left no money there; I went up into my bed-room on the first floor, and found a chest of drawers broken open - there was the mark of a chisel on them, a small bit of mahogany was cut out: I missed from there a small dark-coloured trunk, containing two purses; there were thirteen sovereigns and three half-sovereigns in one purse, and in the other I believe five sovereigns - I am certain there were sovereigns in both of them - I have a memorandum of my money which I made before this happened - I had spent none of it - there was in all nineteen sovereigns and a half together; the purse which had contained the most sovereigns was left behind in the house: I also lost four small silver tea spoons and one rather larger; they were in the drawer with the trunk - I had left the drawer locked: I found all my drawers open - I also missed two watches, one all silver, and the other an old silver one in a shagreen case. I lost three gold rings, two of them mourning rings, and one large gold ring with the name of Forrest on it, that had been my uncle's. I saw my property next day and knew it; the prisoner was then in custody. I lost some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100045"/>silver coins, a crown piece, and several half-crowns, and one half-crown of the date of 1746, which was a keepsake from my father; I saw that half-crown next day at the Petty Sessions: I also lost a small bit of silver with a ribbon fastened to it: I saw that also at the Sessions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CLARKSON. Q. Have you any other Christian name? A. No. My house is in Fulham parish, in the hamlet of Hammersmith; I pay parish rates for it.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have enquired about the prisoner as to whether he was in distress at this time? A. He made a very poor figure the day he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. I am told you do not wish to hurt him? A. I want Justice, and the law of God and the country to take place. I had not opened my trunk that day, but I swear it was locked up in the drawer. I cannot say whether I had been to the trunk that week, but the last time I went to it there were twenty sovereigns; I took half a sovereign, and crossed out the twenty on this paper, and put down nineteen and a half. I think that was less than a month before; the other things were in the drawer; I was at the drawer that morning and locked it.</p>

            . On Sunday, the 2d of March, I left my father's house with a young man, to take a walk, and as I went out I saw Mrs. Powell and her neice coming out of their gate: I parted with the young man afterwards, and was coming home alone in about an hour; I saw the sash up, and a pane of glass broken, which was not the case before; I went into my father's house; my father sat reading a book - I told him- we came out, and rang the bell at the prosecutrix's gate - it is a low wooden gate, but not very easy to get over; we rang a second time, and then the prisoner came out with his hat in his hand, and said, "The ladies are not at home this afternoon;" he came out, and came to the gate; my father said, "You are a thief, and a d - d thief!" and went to stop him, but he knocked my father down. Nobody lives in the house besides the prosecutrix and her neice. I never saw the prisoner before - he ran off, and I after him; he ran through the foundry - I kept him in sight, but lost sight of him for about a moment, and am quite sure I caught sight of the same person; my father followed him part of the way - there was nobody running but the prisoner and us two; he turned round the foundry, and went down a lane, and just before I got to him he threw down a watch and a purse, with some sovereigns in it - he flung them round, and I being so close to him he struck me on the nose with his arm, as he flung them away - I caught him within a few paces, leaving the watch and sovereigns on the ground; I secured him, and afterwards saw them picked up by Barton. I saw him searched, and some sovereigns, a crown-piece, some half-crowns, and a great quantity of picklock-keys found on him; a silver watch was also found on him; the prosecutrix claimed every thing but the picklock-keys; the prisoner gave no account of himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The blow on the nose did not hurt you? A. No: I cannot say that he meant to strike me - I lost sight of him just for a moment; I was not five minutes in pursuit of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the person who went out with you see the state of the prosecutrix's house? A. Not to my knowledge; we disagreed on the road; I left him, and came home; that was before I had seen the house.</p>

As he advanced to me I looked him very hard in the face, and said, "You are a thief!" and believe I said, "A d - d thief!"

I saw the prisoner put his hand into Greenaway's pocket, and draw a handkerchief out - I was close to him: I turned round, and told Vincent, the constable, who was near - he was not out of my sight; I seized him directly, and the handkerchief was found under his jacket - the other got through the mob, and escaped; I should know him again, if I saw him - it happened at the ruins of the Brunswick Theatre.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYLAND. Q. What were you doing there? A. I went to see the ruins. I saw the prisoner close behind the prosecutor, and directed my attention to him - he was close to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. How then could you see the hand in the pocket? A. I did not see it till he had the handkerchief in his hand - he took it from the pocket; he did not stoop, and could not have picked it: off the ground, for I kept my eye on him: I had seen him attempt several pockets, and had followed him for five minutes or more. The last work I had to do, was for Mr. Colyer. Greenaway swore at Lambeth-street, that his name was James.</p>

On Sunday, the 2d of March, the prisoner's master (who is my son-in-law) came to see me, and brought the prisoner with him - his master is captain of a ship; we had several times found the till open on Monday mornings. I counted the money in the till, a few minutes before two o'clock, and then left it locked - when I returned from chapel, at night, I found the till open: the prisoner had been left at home - I had left there thirteen sixpences, a shilling, and a quantity of copper. I had put the copper in a row, so that I could tell if it was disturbed - I missed four sixpences and a shilling. I called the prisoner from the kitchen, and asked if he had any money about him; he denied it, but four sixpences were found in his waistcoat pocket, and fivepence in his trousers: we stripped him, but could not find the shilling; he at last said, voluntarily, that he had changed it in Tottenham-court-road, and bought a Times Sunday Paper, which we found on him, and had spent the change in nuts and oranges,</p>

On Monday, the 10th of March, I and my boy Liddell, went round the west end of the town to procure orders - Liddell carried two boxes for me; I came home alone, leaving him to bring the boxes, which contained laces, silk, and worsted braids of different colours; the property stated in the indictment was in the boxes; he came home about half an hour after me without the boxes - I went to St. Sepulchre's church with him, but could find nobody; the contents of the boxes were worth 40l.; in consequence of information I went on Wednesday to the house of Venables, in Highstreet, Whitechapel - I went there again on Thursday with Gardner, the constable; Venables then produced some property to me, from which I selected as mine nine gross and a half of silk braid, four gross and three quarters of nine-bobbin, five gross of thirteen-bobbin, a quarter of a gross of twenty-one-bobbin, and a gross of twentynine-bobbin, which were worth about 10l.; before we went to Venables that morning I went with Gardner and found the prisoner at the house of a man named Nichols, in Maiden-lane; Gardner asked if he knew me - he said he did; he asked if he knew I had lost any goods, and I think he said he had not heard of it; he had two boxes with him - Gardner asked what he had in them - he said braid; Gardner asked to see it - he opened his boxes, and I selected sixteen gross of worsted Russia braid, worth 24s., which I can swear is mine; Gardner said he wished to go home with him and search his place - he said he had several houses to call at, and could not conveniently go then; Gardner said he would go with him, or they could have a coach; he said he did not wish to have a coach - he ultimately agreed to go with us to his house, and when we were in Wood-street, he said it was a pity it could not be settled without going to a Magistrate, and all he could say was, that if any of my goods were among them I might have them; Gardner replied, that would not do for him, he must take him before a Magistrate; we proceeded as far as Shoreditch - Gardner then put him into the watchhouse, and we went to his house, No. 82, Sebright-street. Bethnal-green-road; he is a braid manufacturer: I selected from his goods there, eight gross of fine worsted nine-bobbin, four gross of thirteen-bobbin, twenty-two gross of common nine bobbin, and thirteen gross of fine nine-bobbin braid, which is worth about 15l., and which I can swear to; we then went to Venables, and found the pro<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100048"/>perty I named; I am certain the goods are mine, and part of what I lost on the Monday night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You are an extensive manufacturer? A. No - perhaps two or three hundred gross a week pass through my hands; the prisoner is a manufacturer - I cannot say whether his manufactory is in Middlesex or not; I have not indicted him for stealing it - he was admitted to bail at Bow-street; I think that was after a little conversation passed - I cannot say whether the Magistrate did it of his own accord; I found about thirtythree gross at the prisoner's house - he was not charged with stealing the property at Bow-street; the boy was asked if he was the man; but he knew the prisoner before he went there, and said he was not.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What sort of braid does the prisoner make? A. The same as I sell - both worsted and silk.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Marshall's employ. On the 10th of March he left me to bring these boxes home, and when I got opposite St. Sepulchre's church I was looking at a play bill, a man in a white great coat came up, tapped me on the shoulder, and said I was wanted - he pointed to a man in the porch of St. Sepulchre's church; the man in the porch asked me to fetch a coach - I hesitated, and he said he would give me 1s., and would mind my boxes; I put my boxes into the porch, and went to the corner of the Old Bailey and called a coach - I ran before the coach, and when I got to the church the man and boxes were gone; the prisoner is not that man - I went home and told my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you been a servant in the braid business? A.

            . I am a mercer and haberdasher, and live at No. 100, Whitechapel. On the 10th or 11th of March, I bought nineteen gross and a quarter of silk braid of the prisoner, which I have given up to the prosecutor - that produced is the same; I gave him 7l. 14s. 6d. for it; I bought no more except a dozen laces, which I sold for 3s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Have you known the prisoner a long time as a respectable dealer and manufacturer? A. Yes; he dealt in these articles to a considerable extent - it is common for tradesmen, under a temporary difficulty, to carry about goods for sale; I gave him a greater price at times than I should have given to a wholesale house in the City - he employs about twenty men; I never heard his honesty impeached - the goods I bought of him I mixed with about 40 lbs. of the same colour, and very likely what were made by the same person; I have dealt with him two years, and gave him a fair price.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. As a dealer do you mean to say you gave a fair price for those articles - do you believe they were manufactured for that money? A. I cannot exactly say that.</p>
               <p>- GARDNER. I am a Bow-street officer. I was with Smith, another officer; Mr. Marshall was with me in Maiden-lane, and met the prisoner; a boy, who was with him, had two boxes; I asked the prisoner if he had been out and offered any silk braid for sale the day before; he said No, he had not been out all that week; I told him I understood he had, and asked if he objected to my searching his house; he said it was very inconvenient, as he had to go to three or four places: I said we would go in a coach, and I would not delay him longer than necessary: I asked if he knew the prosecutor, who stood on the opposite side he said he did: I said he had goods in those boxes; he said Yes; I asked him to let Mr. Marshall look at them - he did so, and as soon as the boxes were opened, Mr. Marshall claimed a handful of things, and said he was positive about them; I then told the prisoner he must go with me. for I must search his house, and in Wood-street he said,"Well, I don't know, if there is any of your property, you must have it, I suppose; I don't know anything about it:" I said No, he must go before a Magistrate; I asked how he came possessed of it: he said he bought it a bargain: I asked of whom: he said he could not tell: I asked what he gave for it; he said he did not know, he bought it a bargain - I put that question to him more than once: he said,"It is a pity it cannot be settled without going before a Magistrate;" I said it could not, and locked him up in the watch-house; I asked him there if he made any memorandum relative to this transaction; he said No, he kept no books: Smith searched him in my presence, and took from him a pocket-book, which I opened, and took out of it one of his printed bills of parcels; (read) "Bought of J. Peters, silk, cotton, and worsted manufacturer, No. 82, Sebright-street." I then went to his house, and in the first floor back room found a lot of braid; Mr. Marshall selected what belonged to him; I went to Venables, and got some silk braid from him; I then went to the watch-house, and asked the prisoner if he recollected who he bought the property of, as he stood in a very serious situation, and I had found more at his house; he said No, he could not recollect: I asked him the same question in the coach; he said he was not bound to answer that question; I said I did not want him to hurt himself - I produce the braid.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. On what grounds did you suspect the prisoner? A. From information I had received the night before - I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you brought the rest of the goods which were in the boxes? - A. No; I have brought what he selected - there was a great quantity of other goods of the same description; I asked the prosecutor if he could he positive to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they not appear to you as much like each other as water taken out of the same river? A. Certainly so - this is but a small quantity compared to what was in the box; if I had been stopped with property I think I should have told who I bought it of - he seemed in a very large way of business; he had sixteen or eighteen boys at work.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the information you received, from Mr. Marshall? A. It was: I received it on Wednesday afternoon, about four o'clock.</p>

            . I am a braid manufacturer, and know the prisoner; he employs a good many people, and bore a respectable character. On the afternoon of Tuesday, the 11th of March, I was on his premises, when a person came to sell him some braid. I cannot name the quantity - he gave 12l. for it, which I considered a fair price; for it was a very unsaleable commodity. Kendal was present - there was no concealment about it; he asked my opinion about it - it is very common for small manufacturers to go round, and sell to larger ones - it appeared to me a transaction of that nature.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Mr. William Tate. On the 11th of March, the prisoner and another person came to the warehouse - the prisoner acted as interpreter to the other man, and spoke English - they represented themselves as German merchants, purchasing goods in this country, and requested to look at different goods, which I shewed them: they looked at lace, and different goods, but the only article they particularly looked at, was Bandanna handkerchiefs, of which we have a large stock; they offered me 11s. 6d. a piece for 1000 pieces, and represented that the other person had bought goods of us, eight years before - but we had no recollection of him: they looked at two or three hundred pieces - and then stated, that they would call next day, and give final instructions respecting them: they bought nothing - they were going away, but from their appearance and behaviour, I suspected them. As you go out of our door, there is about two yards before you can get to the steps leading to the court-yard. I got between them at the top of the steps, and said "At what hour, to-morrow, shall I expect you, gentlemen?" I looked the prisoner full in the face, he evidently flinched, and wished to pass me. I noticed there was some bulk under his arm; on looking him full in the face, I saw there was something wrong, and on opening his coat I found these three pieces of goods under his arm - he held up his hands and begged for mercy. I called the porter to collar him; he did so - I took them from under his arm; he struggled, and got half-way down the steps; I threw down the goods to assist the porter, and during the scuffle, the other man escaped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Did you see the prisoner when he came in? A. Yes; his coat was a large loose one - our goods have the manufacturer's mark on them, but no private mark; he could not have had them in that place when he came in, for he was very active in unpacking a box himself, and his coat was open - he had them concealed under his arm, supported by his arm; and he used his arms to unpack the box.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any doubt of the property? A. None whatever. While the officer had him in charge, we counted our goods, and missed three pieces: these made up the deficiency - he fell on his knees and begged for mercy; he spoke English very well.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner, who representing that he could not speak English, stated, through the medium of an interpreter, that he had met the other man in the street, who persuaded him to accompany him to the warehouse - that all the English he could speak was to ask and offer a price; that the other man told him he had bought three pieces, and paid for them, and told him to take them and go out, as he had something private to say to the gentleman.</p>
               <p>JAMES HUTCHINSON WAUGH. No money was tendered, and if there had been, the prisoner must have seen it.</p>

On the 20th of March, in the morning, the prisoner came to the warehouse, and purchased a gross of laces, for which he tendered half-a-sovereign. I went into the counting-house to make the entry in the cash-book, and get him change, which I brought him out, and he went away. I went to the desk to enter the transaction in the ready-money book, and Dixon came down, and said, "That fellow has got half-a-dozen of thread in his bag." I went out, found him in the street, and brought him back. I desired him to turn out his goods; he pulled out various parcels from his bag, then took out this 6 lbs. of thread, and handed it to me. Mr. Dimsdale came in, and sent for a constable; the prisoner then touched my arms, and said, "My dear sir! My dear sir!"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was he in the habit of coming to sell articles to you? A.

About eight o'clock on Easter Tuesday evening, after I got home, the prisoner seemed as if he had had a drop of drink, and he seemed to have some money; Mr. Houison came in on Wednesday morning to see the men; master examined us all, and I saw the prisoner in the water-closet playing bo-peep - he was looking about him, and before Mr. Houison got to him I saw him stoop down and make a hole in the earth; he came out of the privy - nobody else went in there before Mr. Houison went up to the prisoner, close to the privy; after he left the privy he stood among the rest of the people - there were about two hundred and forty paupers; Mr. Houison said he was the person, and he would swear to him; I went to the place about ten minutes after, and saw the earth was fresh stirred up - I just pulled it away, and there were two watches under the mould; I gave them to Carter, the master of the workhouse - Mr. Houison claimed them.</p>

On Friday evening, the 11th of April, about ten o'clock at night, I was walking down Ratcliff-highway; I had been drinking with a friend, and was not exactly sober, nor yet much the worse for liquor; I knew what I was about: the prisoner came up to me in Ratcliff-highway, and entered into conversation with me for a little time, and he said he thought I was a little the worse for liquor, and he should be very happy to see me home; I was going to call at Mr. Wardle's, Bell-wharf stairs - I told him so; I meant to sleep on board my ship. I was going in a direction for Wardle's when the prisoner joined me, which was below Wellclose-square - I was walking on when he proposed to see me home; I told him I knew the way very well, and there was no occasion for it - he then pressed me to go and have a glass of something - I refused, saying I had had quite enough: we got further, and he pressed me again, but I still refused, and shortly after that he left me - he had been more than five minutes with me; he joined me again in a few minutes, and said, "Now I will see you home, for I am going past where you are going;" I said, "Very well, I will take your company;" he then took me down a lane: I said, "You are going too soon off Ratcliff-highway;" he said he would take me a nearer road - we walked on; I said, "We are going a long way, and I was never this road before;" he said, "It is quite right." At that time I saw two or three more men along with us - we were along before; I then began to be afraid, and said, "All is not right, and I will go no further;" they all insisted on my going further, as it was the nearest way; more than one of them said so: we moved on a few steps more, and I stopped; they then got all round me - I was going to call out, but they took hold of me, and pulled me down on my back, and I found their hands in my pocket; I am quite sure I had a watch about me at that time; they covered my face; I felt my watch go from me, and then they ran away; I had no money about me. I called out Murder! and Stop thief! I am certain the prisoner is the man who joined me, and kept with me - I should not know the others; the watchman brought the prisoner up to me in a very short time; I said to him, "You are the rascal who has been following me all night down the highway;" I am certain he is the man: which of them took my watch I cannot say, but he was with me till they all ran away together - he was there when I was thrown down. I have not found my watch - it was silver, and worth 4l.; I gave more for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About what time did this happen? A. About ten o'clock - it was dark. I met the prisoner when I was walking down the highway - I had been to the King's Head public-house, in Tower-street, before I met him - that was the last house I was in; it was rather before nine o'clock when I left there - I had been to no other public-house; I went there after I came from 'Change, which was about five o'clock; I had dined on board my ship, and drank a glass of rum and water after dinner, but nothing before dinner; I had two glasses of gin and water at the King's Head; I believe I had a glass of ale when I first went in - I forgot that. I sat a considerable time, and then had a glass of gin and water, and afterwards another glass; I am certain that is all I had: I paid 1s. or 1s. 2d. for it; I went to no other house, and drank nothing else that day. I was not drunk, nor yet so sober as if I had drank nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watchman first brought the prisoner to you, did you say you did not know his person or his dress? A. I never said such a word; I think I told him I had lost my watch and money, but when I came to recollect I had no money - I had some money when I left the King's Head, but lost it in the road; whether it was pulled out of my pocket or not I cannot say, but I found I had no money when the prisoner joined me; I had lost it. The watchman knows I was sober - nobody had been walking with me before the prisoner came up, but people were passing and repassing - nobody was in my company. The money was in my breeches pocket, but when I felt it was gone - I had 17s. or 18s.; I did not feel anybody take it; I missed it some few minutes before I met the prisoner, but I know I had my watch, for I felt for it, and put the ribbon in directly I missed my money; nobody had been near me except people passing; people frequently walked alongside of me, but I felt no hand in my pocket; I cannot say whe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100052"/>ther it was buttoned up; I told the watchman I had lost my money and my watch - I did not say the prisoner had taken my money - they offered me the money they found on the prisoner; I said that was not mine, for I lost it before I met him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the headborough at the watch-house lock you up in the same room with the prisoner? A. He did; I do not recollect his saying he did so that I might gain my senses, and tell my story property; I thought it very strange that he should lock me up; I dare say I was locked up for an hour - I do not know why; I told him it was very strange he should lock me up - I forget what answer he made, but think it was something to the effect that I did not know what I was saying.</p>

            . I live in New Gravel-lane; my father sells things about at public-houses; I live with him, and am going on for twelve years old. (I go to church, and believe there is a God, who will punish wicked people in the next world; people who tell lies or swear false are wicked.) I was coming out of Mr. Randal's public-house, in Gravel-lane, where I had been for my mother, and heard somebody halloo out Murder! I went round the corner to see what it was, and there were four persons round Mr. Clay, who I thought to be thieves: one had hold of his legs, another had hold of his arm; they took his watch out of his pocket; they said, "We have got it all, now let us leave him;" and they ran away - two ran up Milk-yard; I have only seen one of them since. Mr. Peterson and I caught one of them in a corner; that was the prisoner - he had not got far when we caught him, about as far as from here to Newgate. I saw him running, and am sure he is one of the four men who robbed Mr. Clay; he was taken to the watch-house; the robbery was committed in New Gravel-lane, which turns out of Ratcliff-highway. After we took the prisoner, Clay came up, and said what they had done to him; he did not appear very drunk; he appeared to know what he was about. After Peterson and I caught the prisoner he(the prisoner) said, "There is another one run over there, with a white jacket on;" one of the party had a white jacket on; he said, the man in the white jacket was along with him, the man in the white jacket was in sight; the prisoner was not running after him to try to take him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you say your mother was with you? A. No. I was coming out of the Turk's Head public-house; I had been there to my mother, but she did not come out with me; she sells things there. I was very much frightened at the cry; I was afraid something might happen to myself; the prosecutor did not appear to me to be drunk - not much - he was not quite sober; he was locked up in the watch-house - I do not know why; a person belonging to the watch-house locked him up - I do not know whether he is here; I cannot say whether he locked him in the same room as the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured coat had the person on? A. He had a blue dress on; I don't think it was a coat - I am not certain it was a coat; I did not stand behind him; I observed him particularly, though I cannot be sure whether he had a coat on. I did not say at the watch-house, nor any where, that he had a blue coat on. I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long from the time you heard the cry of Murder! did the person go away from Clay? A. Not long; it was a minute or two - that was all the time I had to observe the four men. I noticed a person who had a white coat on, as well as the prisoner - the other three had white jackets on. I was looking at the other three some portion of the minute or two.</p>

            . I go to sea, and am fifteen years old. I know Bell-wharf - I live in New Gravel-lane - you can go that way from Ratcliff-highway to Bell-wharf, but it is out of the way, but not much. On the night this happened I was in doors at my mother's, and heard a man sing out,"Oh, oh! Murder, murder!" I ran out and asked him what was the matter; it was the prosecutor; he said he was knocked down, and had his watch taken - I sang out Stop thief! The last witness was coming up at the time; I just saw a glimmer of somebody running along past the lamp, not very far from the prosecutor; I ran on, and Mangham was behind me. I stopped the watchman, and then went into the opening - I did not see the man after he went past the lamp, till I went into the corner, and saw him up in the corner standing still. I said, "Here he is watchman," and he stepped out, that was the prisoner. The watchman laid hold of him; he had blue clothes on, and a watch-ribbon; he at first said there was a man in the other corner with a white jacket on; the prosecutor came up; the watchman said to him, "Can you swear to this man;" he said, "Yes, this is the man who has followed me all the way down the Highway." I then went to look in the other corner, after the man in a white jacket, but there was nobody there. I had seen nobody running in a white jacket. When the prosecutor said he could swear to the prisoner, he said, "Me! I am not guilty of such a thing." He was taken away. I did not follow to the watch-house. Veale was the watchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You would not swear to the person of the man you saw pass? A. No; he was found in the corner of a field called Fox-field, which turns out of Gravel-lane: there is a ditch in the field, and he was over the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had wanted to escape, there was the ditch between him and the watchman? A. Oh! but there are some palings of an orchard at the back, as high as a man's head - he could not get away; he might get over the paling.</p>
               <p>Q. He stepped out the moment he saw you? A. Yes, because he heard the dogs bark; Mangham was with the watchman, who was a little distance from me when I saw the man - he was about as far off as I am from the back of the Jury-box; I was nearer to the prisoner - he came up to us when I spoke, and said, he was not guilty - I did not see him searched.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been a man running in a white jacket, could Mangham see it and you not? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Friday night about quarter-past ten o'clock, I heard a cry of Murder! I looked down the lane - I stood by the Black-horse public-house in Gravel-lane; I looked and saw three or four people, children and men together, running up the lane, and some going towards Fox-fields - the last witness came up and said, a man had gone that way, pointing to Fox-fields; the prosecutor came up about the same time - I walked down towards the field; I asked the prosecutor what he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100053"/>had lost, he said, his watch; I said, "Have you lost anything else?" he said, "I don't know what I have lost;" I went to the corner, which is sixteen or eighteen yards out of the main-street, I found the prisoner there; it is a waste piece of ground, and leads to no place - it is no thoroughfare at all; Peterson said, "Here he is, here is the man in the corner;" I turned and saw him standing there - he came out to me; it was the prisoner - he asked what was the matter? he pointed and said, he had seen a man run towards that corner in a white dress; but I could see nobody - I put my hand on the prisoner's shoulder, and said to the prosecutor, "Can you swear to anybody?" he said, there was three or four of them. I said, "Look round, is this the man?" he said, "That is the rascal who has been dodging me all down the highway;" I took them both to the watch-house - I know Bellwharf; if the prosecutor had gone down High-street, Shadwell to it, he would have saved a quarter of a mile - Gravel-lane was a quarter of a mile out of his way; the prisoner had on a blue jacket, with a coat collar and blue trousers; as soon as I took them into the watch-house, I left, having delivered them up to Ames - the prosecutor was the worse for liquor, but appeared as if he knew what he was talking about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He appeared to know what he was talking about? A. Yes, he talked rational, but I thought he had had rather too much; I had seen the party go off the main road, but cannot swear the prisoner was one of them - when the boy said, "Here he is," he came out directly; the place is not a thoroughfare - a man might retire there for a certain purpose; he stood quietly by me; I put my hand on his shoulder; but when the prosecutor said, he was the man, I called him, and took him to the watch-house; he said, he could not be guilty of such a thing - the prosecutor said, he had lost his watch; I do not recollect his mentioning money to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the prisoner's clothes any appearance of being in disorder, as if he had retired for the purpose alluded to? A. He did not appear so.</p>

            . I am a constable; I was in the watch-house; the prisoner was brought in by the watchman - the prosecutor was also brought in, and charged the prisoner with knocking him down, and robbing him of his watch; he denied it - the prosecutor appeared flurried, and had been drinking - he spoke rational; I locked up the prisoner and left the prosecutor standing by the fire in the officer's-room, and came away myself - the officer of the night is not here; I found a watch on the prisoner, but the prosecutor does not claim that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there some money found on him? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you afterwards set in the same room with the constable? A. I was let out, and the prisoner kept in the lock-up place; I remained among the officers afterwards in a room with a fire to it - I got on board my ship by twelve o'clock I think; I left the room the officers were in not long after I left the lock-up place - I suppose I was the longest time in the lock-up place.</p>

On the night of Monday, the 10th of March, I went to bed about half-past nine o'clock - the house was secured then, but I was not the last person in bed; my mother and the servant were both up - nobody else was in the house: I know the property in question was safe when I went to bed; there were two silver salt-spoons, two silver cruet-tops, two pairs of plated knife-rests, a pair of plated sugar-tongs, a mahogany tea-caddy, and several trifling things; the salt-spoons and knife-rests were on the sideboard - not locked up; I got up about half-past five o'clock in the morning as usual, to go to business - it was quite day-light; when I came down stairs I fell over a drawer which had been pulled out of the sideboard; I immediately went into the next parlour, and found the window shutters closed, the window sash thrown up, and the hasps, which keep it down, broken; a round hole was bored in the shutter; some phosphorus matches were left on the carpet - my mother and the servant were both in bed; the articles I have named were missing; I saw the prisoner on the Friday following, before the Magistrate at Brentford; two spoons were produced - I knew them to be my mother's; the tops, where the initials had been, were cut off.</p>

No; I am certain my mother has no other Christian name - she rents the house, and is a market-gardener - I am not a partner; I sat in the room the night before; the spoons were opposite to me - I could not sit there without seeing them; I remember seeing them - I did not take them in my hand, but am quite certain I saw them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say the tops were gone from the spoons - did you afterwards see any part of the tons? A. Yes; the top of one spoon was produced before the Magistrate, with the initials on it, and it fitted the spoon.</p>

Mr. Fowler had given me some information, and I apprehended the prisoner in the tap-room of the New Hotel, public-house, at Brentford - I took him and his brother there. I searched the prisoner there, but found nothing on him. I did not, myself, search the tap-room - I was present at his examination before the Magistrate; the examination was taken down. I saw part of two spoons which were produced by Honeybone, and Henderson produced the top of one, which matched with one of those produced by Honeybone. I have them here, and produce them - I have also brought a spoon from Mrs. Goodenough's house.</p>

            . I am a sawyer. I was in the tap of the New Hotel, public-house, on Thursday night the 13th of March, and saw the top of a spoon found there, near the fire-place. I was not present when the prisoner was apprehended, it was afterwards. Swaite picked it up and gave it to me - I gave it to Honeybone next day, and am certain the same was produced before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found part of a spoon when the prisoner was not present? A. Yes; I saw it found. I saw Swaite take it up - I did not see it on the ground; I first saw it in his hand - he is not here; and was not before the Magistrate - he is a journeyman blacksmith. I saw him stoop and pick something up; he gave it to me directly - his face was towards me when he stooped; he was sitting down on the bench; he stooped, and rose up before I saw the spoon - there was several more persons in the house; they were hard working men - how long the prisoner had left the room, I do not know.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HONEYBONE. Here is the spoon which matches the top. I am certain they have formed one spoon - the stamp and letter at the back correspond with the top part and the letter K. - the initials S.F.G. are on it.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL GOODENOUGH. My father's name was Samuel. Here is an entire spoon, which is my mother's, and has the same initials on it; it is one of the same sort - this was not stolen. The curet tops are too much disfigured to be identified - they have been defaced by violence not by wear I have no doubt they are the same; they are exactly the same size, and appearance as my mother's.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST to THOMAS HONEYBONE. Q. How does the top of this spoon fit? A. Silver is of that nature it must be wrenched backwards and forwards, before it can be separated - it has been chopped first with some blunt instrument. I have no doubt of their being parts of the same spoon - I cannot fit them exactly, it would be impossible. I kept them in my possession till morning, and then took them to Mr. Fowler, thinking they were stolen from him.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. From your knowledge of such things are you able to say, they are parts of the same spoon? A. They certainly are.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The first time the property was brought up, it was taken to Mrs. Goodenough's - Cooke brought it back, saying she could not identify it - and at the second examination, Mr. Goodenough said he could only swear to the bit of the spoon, which was marked. I was at home and a bed, at the time of the robbery.</p>

            . I live at Old Brentford, opposite the gas-light - the prisoner and his wife lodge on the same floor as I do. On the night of Sunday, the 10th of March, I saw him come in between ten and eleven o'clock. I saw him go up-stairs, and go out next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday night? A. On the Sunday night - the night of the robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What night do you swear to? A. Sunday night; he did not go out till the morning, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember where he was on the Monday night? A. No.</p>
               <p> - SAUNDERS. I live at Old Brentford, opposite Montgomery's timber yard. When I was at work in Kent with the prisoner, he bought two spoons, very much beat about - they were mustard spoons; this was the middle of last summer. I do not know what he did with them, but he said he thought he might get 1s. by selling them in town. I looked at them, but did not notice whether they were marked; they were not half a minute in my hand - he never told me what he had done with them. I should not know them again - he bought them about a mile and a half from Farningham.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Were you present at the purchase? A. Yes; I was never in trouble myself. I will swear that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The property was taken off to Mrs. Goodenough, and they have been broken off since; they sent over to the witness, to say, if he did not swear my life away, he should not do another day's work.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Chigwell, Essex. On Sunday afternoon, about four o'clock, I saw Mr. Jennings' horse in my field. I think it was on the 27th of January; I know it was on Sunday; the hedges of the field were down, and I think it had strayed in there - I saw Latchford fetch the poney out of the field. I knew him before - he lived at Chigwell, with his father. I told him if he did not keep it out of the field, I should send him to the pound; it was the same horse as Jennings afterwards claimed.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer, and live at Romford, Essex. On the 22d of January, in the afternoon, Latchford came to my stables, where property is generally brought for public sale; he brought the pony and chaise there; I had some conversation with him next morning - he stated to me that he had a chaise brought there for me to sell by auction on market day, for a gentleman named Smith, of Munt - Munt is about seven miles off; the chaise was afterwards claimed by Jennings, and returned to him. I was not present when it was brought.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are quite sure of his person? A. Quite - I saw him again at Bow-street about March - the chaise was sold to Mr. Colyer, and I gave Latchford the produce of it. The same chaise was given up to Mr. Jennings, by the Magistrate's order.</p>

I went to Mr. Carmichael's before this robbery was committed; the horse and chaise were stolen from Mr. Jenning's stable, a little after ten o'clock at night on the 20th of January - I was coming by at the time; Colonel Carmichael had told me to watch them; I saw Oades leading the horse out of Mr. Jennings' yard by the head, and afterwards saw a man resembling Smith come out and shut the gate; I had known Smith two years, but am not positive that it was him; Oades has absconded - I saw him about a week afterwards. I have seen Smith since, but I had no conversation with him about it; I have heard Oades talk about it in Smith's company, a fortnight or three weeks after; he said, "No doubt as they have found the horse and chaise, they will find other things;" when I saw the horse and chaise brought out they were harnessed together. About half-past six o'clock on the evening of the robbery, Smith and Oades came to me, and asked if I would make one of the party to go down and get Mr. Jennings' horse and chaise - I said I would not; this was in the market place - they left me. As soon as Oades brought the horse and chaise into the middle of the road, he said,"I hope you won't take any notice of this - I hope you won't say anything about it;" I told them I thought it was a very bare-faced trick to get it out at that time; I did not promise not to tell. There are watchman at Staines - I gave no alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you suffered them to go away with it? A. I expected Colonel Carmichael would have taken them; it was in a retired part of the street; I do not think I could have got anybody to take them; I gave no alarm. I was not taken up. I have never been confined in my life; I am sure Latchford was not one of the party, and cannot identify Smith as one.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 9th of April, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening I left the room; I locked the door, and left all this property safe. I went to my husband, and we came home together; we have two rooms - one opens into another: the room which opens into the passage was locked; on returning we found the room door broken open by violence - part of the door was cut away, and the lock forced; when I got in I missed the articles stated in the indictment, all of which I had left safe - some of them were airing at the fire. The prisoner was taken that evening, and the property was found outside his sister's door, by Richardson. I had seen the prisoner about seven o'clock that evening, and told him I was going out, and desired him not to fasten the street door; he lived in the house, and was at home when I went away.</p>

            . I keep this house; I am twenty years old; I rent the house myself. Pulleston and his wife lodge with me; I am a smith; the prisoner was in my service, and lived in the house; I sent him out but he came home about half-past eight o'clock. I was out at my sister's, and as I returned I saw the prisoner with a bundle under his arm; I asked where he was going, and what he did out at that time; he said he had been at his sister's, and was going again; I told him he ought not to leave my premises while I was out. The officer afterwards brought the bundle back; the prisoner came back of his own accord. I went to bed, not knowing the prosecutor was out - but when they came home an alarm was given; I got up and found their door broken open. The prisoner lived two months with me, and behaved well; I should give him a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 7th of April I followed the two prisoners in company with another for about an hour - they went into several shops; Crawley went into a batter's and brought out a hat - I took them both into custody, and on Connelly I found this tea: I took them about half a mile from Webber's shop - I had not seen them near there; I took them to the watch-house. and asked Connelly where he got the tea - he said his sister had sent him to buy it; I asked where she lived - he said in Castle-court, Whitechapel; I made enquiry about the Minories, and found Mr. Webber out - I went to Castle-court, but his sister did not live there.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I went to the shop for half an ounce of liquorice; I threw three farthings down - they said it was two-pence an ounce; I took up my money, and the parcel was on the counter when I went out; when the officer took me, a gentleman said, "Let the boy go;" he said, "You ruscal, I will take you."</p>

I was coming down Ratcliff-highway - a decent looking man tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "I have a little tea to sell;" I said, if he went to my mother she would buy it, but I only had got 3s.; he said I seemed a poor lad and should have it for that. I was going to meet my sister to give it her when I was taken.</p>

On the 2d of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I fell in with a strange man coming over Blackfriar's-bridge into Bridge-street; he came up, and asked if I was going far; I said I lived at Hoxton - he said he was going that way, and walked with me as far as Fleet-market - and just by a soup shop there, he met the prisoners and shook hands with them both. Greenwood proposed that we should go in and have some soup; we all went in and had some; they were all strangers to me. Greenwood proposed to toss for two basons - we tossed and I lost: I had been drinking, but was sober; I took half a crown out of my purse and paid for the soup - Greenwood took the half-crown, and gave me the change; he then said he lived at Hoxton New-town, and would walk with me - we went on together arm-in-arm; Dunkley followed behind. When we got to Smithfield, Greenwood asked me if I thought my money was safe; I said I thought it was - Dunkley was close behind us. We went on as far as Beech-street, and Greenwood pressed me very much again to look at my money; he said the other prisoner was going Finsbury-square way, and that we were both going to Hoxton New-town - he said he lived there: he wished me very much to look at my money in <placeName id="t18280410-66-crimeloc375">Beech-street</placeName>

Greenwood snatched the purse out of my hand; Dunkley stood right before me on the left; Greenwood snatched the purse, and took the half-sovereign out - I said, "You have got the half-sovereign?" - he said, "Oh! it is all right; let me look if the silver is right" - I then gave him the silver into his hand; Dunkley said something to him, and Greenwood directly ran up Golden-lane with my money - I followed him, crying Stop thief! I do not know what became of Dunkley; I followed Greenwood; the watchman sprang his rattle; he turned and came into Beech-street; two gentlemen knocked him down on the pavement - I held him until the watchman took him; I do not know whether Dunkley ran away, or whether he had any of the money. He took Greenwood to Gripplegate watch-house; he said a friend outside would tell how every thing happened.

I sent him again about a quarter to two o'clock, and told him if it was a cheque to get it cashed; he returned a few minutes before four, and said that a pretty job had happened - he said, "I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100058"/>have lost the money;" I asked how he received it - he said he received a 5l. and 14l. cheque, and a sovereign; I said, "Where did you put it?" he said he put into in his side coat pocket, and showed me his pocket, which was very deep, and had no holes in it; I said he had not lost it out of that pocket - he said he was certain he had put it there when he received it at the banker's; he said, "I received five sovereigns for the 5l. cheque, and received the 14l. cheque at Lombard-street; I there asked for a bit of paper to put it into, and they gave me a piece; I was detained nearly an hour, and finding I was detained so long, I jumped behind a coach, and the twenty sovereigns must have jumped out of my pocket;" I said they never jumped out of that pocket, it was too deep - he said, "I am certain this is the pocket - I saw it quite safe in the pocket when I left the banker's;" I said, "I cannot believe it - you have not lost it - tell me in what hands you have put it;" he said, "I have lost it, Ma'am." I said, "I must send for an officer, if you won't tell me where you have put it:" he said, "Then you must send for one, and I shall lose my place; and to put an end to it I will go before a Magistrate, and state the same."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever lose anything? A. Yes, several things; he could have run away if he had chosen.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in great distress about losing it, was not he? A. Indeed he was not; I was sorry to see him so hardened - I was astonished to see him so cool and careless; he said I was a liar, he had lost it. I have inquired, and find he has been keeping had company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer to forego this prosecution if his friends would give you 10l.? A. No, they said, "Will you take 10l.? you will never get your money back;" I said I should be glad to see 10l., for it was a great loss to me; I did not wish it from them - I said, "Give me 10l. of my own money" - I asked if it fell as he put it in - he said then he should have dropped it at the banker's. I said I should ask the Magistrate if I should do right in taking the 10l.; I did not have his brother taken up - I went to the brother, and said I had lost twenty sovereigns - he said"I am very sorry - I was in hopes he had got rid of all his had acquaintances; but I will go and see if I can get it out of him."

On the 27th of March, about half-past twelve o'clock in the day, I had some business with Mr. Barnard; I went over and as I was going to enter the passage of his house, I observed a light cart, and a man step from the shaft of it on to the curb - it stood just by Mr. Barnard's door, and on my entering the passage I found the prisoner in the passage, which is fourteen feet long - he was at the further end of it, and had got a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100059"/>sheet full of goods on his right shoulder; he turned round to come out, and hit his left foot against a package of goods, which caused him to stagger forward, and the sheet of goods rolled off his shoulder - they fell down at my feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Then had the prisoner got the wrapper of goods on his shoulder, coming out with it? A. No doubt of it; when they fell at my feet, the man, who stepped off the shaft of the cart, appeared at the door; the prisoner then looked at that man - he took no notice of me, but said to the man at the door, "D-n your soul what did you do that for?" he repeated those words again; I then said, "I am afraid all is not right here;" I then opened the warehouse door, and calling out, asked if Mr. Barnard was within; I was answered by a little boy that he was not within; I turned round as quick as I could, and found the men both gone, and Mr. Barnard standing at my right shoulder, in the passage - all this happened in a very short time indeed; I told him what had happened, and said, "There the men go in that cart; pursue them, and take them if you can, and I will watch your goods;" Mr. Barnard went in pursuit, and took the prisoner, who I am certain is the man who was in the passage as I have described - the other man escaped; I have no doubt of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The goods stood in the passage as if to be removed? A. They were in sheets, to be sent to the west end of the town, I believe - they were tied up in a bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. The other man swore at the prisoner? A. Yes; the prisoner was moving the goods towards the cart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which of them said "D-n your soul,&amp;c.?" A. The prisoner, and that raised my suspicion.</p>

As I was entering the passage, I saw my friend Nelson and some goods, which I had before superintended being tied up in the sheets, and put at the extremity of the passage, I found laying on the threshold of the door - I had seen them within twenty minutes at the end of the passage; the prisoner was pointed out to me, with another man, in a chaise-cart; I pursued down Watling-street - they turned the corner into Sise-lane, galloping as hard as they could; I pursued them to Bucklersbury, and there the cart ran into the wheel of another cart, which stopped them; the other man jumped out, and ran away - the prisoner made a leap out, with the whip in his hand, and brandished it about; I caught hold of him - I imagine that the prisoner drove, as he had the whip; I have the package here - it contains fifteen pieces of calico, and is worth about 15l.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You deliver the materials to him to be made up? A. Yes, to be made into tuggs; he then brings them to my servant at my warehouse, to be marked, and then they are returned to him to finish.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from first to last it is always in a process of manufacture? A. It is; I myself do not know of the delivery of these particular pieces of leather - he is paid by the piece; by the set.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When did you mark them? A. I marked those the pawnbroker had, the week before they were found, I returned them to him to put the bands on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is his job complete until the belly-bands and all are put on? A. No - they are always in the course of manufacture till the bands are put on; he could be paid for making the tuggs, and another man could put the bands on.</p>


               <p>Q. Would his work he finished till he had done it all? A. No, if he takes one part he must do it all; he sometimes brought things home, and sometimes I fetched them - the two in question were brought home by his wife, and I sent them back; I might be two hours marking them - the band could be put on before they are marked, but I always mark them first.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is always in his hands for the purpose of being worked? A. Certainly.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Have not tuggs been often made without the belly-bands? A. Yes - if we had not wanted bands I should not return them; if master had desired me not to return them, I should not - they are sometimes kept without the bands.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the man paid at the end of the week before the work is finished? A. If he had work not finished, he would be paid, but he must finish it before he has more.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did your master give any particular orders about these? A. No - I marked them, and sent them back.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the tuggs are made they are brought to your master, or to you to be marked? A. Yes; that is one prosess - they are always sent back for belly-bands, unless I receive orders not to send them.</p>

Yes; the understanding is, that the workman is to have it, and finish it when wanted - he is paid for it; these particular bands were expected to be made perfect, bands and all before they were brought home, to remain there; his duty was to complete them.</p>
               <p>Mr. ALLEY. Q. Does it at times happen that other workmen put the bands on, and not the one who made the tuggs? A. Sometimes.</p>

The prisoner lived with a lodger named Welch; I fetched an officer and gave her in charge - and in a box in the room she lived in, eight shillings of my money was found; I had marked it before I left it; I found another shilling at a tobacconist's shop.</p>

I had a glass of gin at the bar; I walked on a little way, she followed me and ran past me, as if somebody was running after her - I had no suspicion of her; when I went into the public-house I am certain I had my watch in my fob; a handkerchief in my pocket; my umbrella in my hand; and nine or ten shillings in my trousers' pocket, there was a crown piece among it. I walked on a little further, and was tripped up or slipped down; but believe I was tripped up - I fell right into the middle of the road the male prisoner directly picked me up. I cannot be positive whether I had my property safe then; he said,"Where are you going, you are in liquor; I will take you home; where do you live?" I told him where I lived. I did not see the female with him - he said, "You had better go into the public-house to wash yourself;" he took me to the Ship and Black Horse. I washed myself - I took my handkerchief out of my pocket and wiped myself; it was safe then, and I am certain I put it into my pocket - he called for rum and water, and gave me more drink; he paid for it; he took me out of the public-house and said he would see me home - I walked a little way, and then I thought I could see myself home; but he said, No; he would go with me to my own door - the Black Horse is about a quarter of an hour's walk from my house. I lost my senses after I walked a little further, and do not know what happened after that. I cannot tell what he did with me - this was on Saturday, and on the Wednesday evening following, the officer came to my house, and brought my watch. Dumphy was then in custody, but not Hull; he was taken last Sunday. I saw him that evening in the watch-house; he was sitting down with several persons. I was not certain of him then, for he was so disfigured in his dress, and I did not take particular notice; but when I saw him at the Thames Police-office, I knew him directly - but he had a handkerchief tied round his head at the watch-house; my watch, with the seal and key, were produced at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You did not know him at the watch-house, because his dress was disguised? A. I swear to his features; but at the watch-house he had a handkerchief tied round his head, which altered his appearance - he was sitting down with others, and I did not much notice him.</p>
               <p>Q. You were pretty far gone when the woman followed you into the public-house? A. I had my recollection about me. I know the same woman followed me out, but will not swear it was the prisoner: she looks like the person. I had my property when I went into the house, I am certain; but whether I lost it before or after I was tripped up. I cannot say; but the handkerchief was safe after that. I do not know whether I slipped down, or was tripped up. I found myself at home - I laid abed all day on Sunday; a man, who lived in the house, had taken me home.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police constable. I apprehended the female prisoner on the Sunday afternoon after the robbery. I had been to the house before, on that day, and then saw this watch on the mantelpiece; and in consequence of what I heard afterwards, I went back, and brought it away, there was a bed in the room - the prosecutor described the watch, and gave the number before he saw it - it has two keys, a seal, and ring to it - when I returned to the house, the watch had been moved; I asked her for it, and she gave it to me directly - she appeared to take it from the table behind her.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a watchman. I apprehended the prisoner concealed in the privy of an empty house in Harrison-street, just before eight o'clock in the morning; I collared him - he said, "It was not me;" I had told him he had stolen the boots; I had heard an alarm, and seen him turn from the corner of Cromer-street, up Gray's Inn-lane, into Harrison-street, with one boot under his arm; I saw him throw it over into an area - the last witness saw the boots and trees, and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you lose sight of him? A. Yes, when he turned round the empty house; I believe Mr. Wilson, of Cromer-street, is a friend of his, from what he says - he did not say he was going to breakfast with him; the privy is at the back of No. 43, Cromer-street - Wilson attended at Hatton-garden.</p>

On the 10th of December I received a long letter from him, begging me to take him again into my service, and offering to allow part of his wages to pay me the money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). The boy who committed the offence is my wife's brother, he had been discharged from two situations for committing offences. His mother asked me to allow him to stay at my place till she could get him to sea; I said there was an empty room next to mine, if she would take it, he might work with me; he slept there by himself, and went to his bed on the night of the robbery, after ten o'clock, and I went to mine. I was not out of bed till seven o'clock in the morning; he came into the room, and lighted the fire, as usual; I did not go into his room till the officers came. I said he was not at home, as I thought they had come about some pigeons which his master had lost; I did not wish him to be taken out of my room, as my wife was far advanced in pregnancy.</p>

            . I know this figure to be Mr. Bailey's. I had put it into the drawer of the bench in the study; it was not locked - when it was missed, I asked the prisoner about it, he said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am placed in a very serious situation; I have had a responsible situation, and conducted the business of an eminent man in the City, and no one could say anything against me. I was able to get a sum of money, and intended to go into business, but through good nature to others. I lost it, and went to work again as journeyman. If I had known of these things being stolen. I would not have stood here to vindicate myself, but have pleaded guilty - I have an aged mother, who, though poor, is honest, and never had any of her family placed as I am at this time; I know it will be the breaking of her heart; I have a wife and three children, whom I have brought up with the respectability of a tradesman, and I feel the dreadful idea of being torn from them, and leaving them to the mercy of a world, that will frown on them. I have been in confinement for six weeks, with men, whose characters I detest, with thieves of the worst description - and am forced to hear all kind of language; which has been a punishment more severe than any I ever felt - never having been in confinement in my life. With respect to the image, on the 5th of November, I had occasion to go to a pump which supplies the prosecutor's shop with water; and near there is the rubbish heap, and it frequently happens, that tools are carried out with the rubbish, and thrown there. I saw a chisel of my own there, and took it up - I then turned over the rubbish and saw the image, which I took home, and gave my children to play with - and not only them, but the children at the house I live in, have played with it likewise; they have had it out in the street, where it might have been lost; and should I have shown it, if I had taken it with a guilty knowledge. I did not think it belonged to Mr. Bailey - I never saw it in his shop in my life; one of the witnesses says he put it into a drawer, which is in an open shop, thought he called it a study - there are ten or fifteen men work in the shop - he said before the Magistrate, that Mr. Bailey gave it him to put on a pedestal, and he put it into the drawer, and thought no more of it, till it was asked for, which shows how little they thought of it; one of these tools is my own - and I have used it to work with of an evening, at home: and I can declare I have had it these five years, as my father-in-law can prove, though he cannot identify it. I had left three pair of Louises with Mr. Bailey's foreman. which were worth 3l., with an understanding, that if I had anything of Mr. Bailey it should be returned - when I came for the Louises. I then went to work at King's Palace, in St. James's Park, and found I had this drill-stock, which is Mr. Bailey's; it is a worthless thing - have several of them. I told my wife if they called, to give it to them - a man did call, and brought the Louises, but my wife forgot to give him the drill-stock. I can assure you, I had not the least idea of stealing anything; I have felt much my awful situation - my home is gone to wreck and ruin; I have been forced to part with what little property I had; I have not been able to provide any thing for my family to stand up in, or to rest their bones upon: and if I am torn from them the work-house must take them.</p>

            . I belong to the Coldstream Guards. On the 18th of March I saw Lynn in Chandos-street; he said he was going to get something for supper, and went into a shop to get some bacon; the prosecutor and Lynn then came along; Simmington said, "This is the man for me;" we then went to a house to have half a pint of gin; I said it was time to go home - the prosecutor pulled out his watch, and the chain broke; Simmington then put the watch into the prosecutor's pocket; I then went on with them to the Horse and Groom, and left them there.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long had you been in the crowd? A. Perhaps three minutes - there was a rush made upon me; Paget was as close to me as possible; I could not get rid of him - I had my purse safe when I was in the Minories about ten minutes before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WEST. Q. Were there not a great many people pushing? A. Yes; but no one had hold of my arm but you; I do not know whether you were pushed by others - but I was grasped round my body with considerable violence; I did not see a fire engine coming along.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was near the Theatre about five o'clock, and saw Paget, with five or six others, make a rush on the prosecutor - Paget then came out, and went into the Horn and Horse-shoe, public-house; he called for a glass of porter, which he drank - I took hold of him, and said I wanted him: he took something out from his pocket and threw it behind him - a gentleman took it up; I asked him for it; he would not give it me, but gave it to the landlord - I asked the landlord for it; he counted the money out of this purse and gave it me - I got Paget in the room with some difficulty; he swore he would not be handcuffed; I left him in charge while I went to look for the man who took up the purse, but I had my eye on him - it was not more than half a yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was the settle under which the purse was thrown? A. Close by me; it was a person named Robinson who took it; I have been for him, but he is not there - I do not think he is a very good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WEST. Q. Did you see me at the time Paget went into the house? A. Certainly, but he did not go into the house - he was close to the door; I saw him in the crowd with this stick - he was close to Mr. Robinson.</p>

            . I saw the two prisoners near the Brunswick Theatre, close to the prosecutor - I saw both Paget's hands round him; I said to Judge, "He has got it. follow him" - he went to the public-house, and drank the beer, and there he was taken; I saw him throw something down, hut could not see what it was - it was taken up by a man who has absconded; I saw him give it to the landlord, and he gave to Judge; West was close to Paget in the mob.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you could not see what was thrown away? A. No; the prosecutor was not a dozen yards from the place; there was not a fire-engine coming by - there was a rush among the people - not among all the people.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WEST. Q. How long have you known me? A. A long time - I never knew you charged with theft, but you have been in trouble about cups and balls.</p>

A labourer; I have been for ten months working at a pastry-cook's, in Cannon-street - I was along with Carter at the Theatre; I was going to get a situation; I was about to tell Carter and Judge of it - I am quite sure I saw Paget's right-hand come from Robinson's coat pocket, and just afterwards I saw the purse in his hand; I am quite sure it was not his breeches pocket - I saw the purse before the Magistrate, but I knew before that it was a red silk purse.(Purse produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she had pledged the property by the prosecutor's desire, in order to procure articles for the house; that she could not get her wages, and the prosecutor beat her unmercifully on her asking for them.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDERSON. She got drunk on the Saturday night. I had two ladies at my house, she quarrelled with them and struck them - I said, if she did not be quiet I should give charge of her. I then examined the house and missed the property; she had no authority to pawn any of the things; I did not owe her a farthing for wages - she was paid beforehand; I have reason to believe her father pawned some of them.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police constable. On the 11th of March I stopped these two prisoners, going into the Export Dock, at the west India Docks, between twelve and one o'clock. Jones had this compass under his arm, concealed; I asked how he got it, he said McCarthy gave it him to bring out. I asked McCarthy if he knew anything about it - he said Yes that he gave it to Jones to carry. Jones gave me the furniture of the compass out of his hat; and McCarthy gave me these other articles, which he said he bought of the ship-keeper of the Woodbridge. I went to that ship, but could not find the ship-keeper - I took them to the watch-house, and found a green cloth round McCarthy's body.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 29th of March, about half-past ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the upper end of Crown-street, near Oxford-street, he had something rolled up in his apron. I went and asked him what it was; he said, a pair of shoes, which he had bought of a boy in the street. I looked at them, and said, "They are too large for you;" he said he gave 1s. 3d. for them, and he might get 2s. for them. I took him to several shops in Monmouth-street, and at last took him to Sullivan's, who said, he had lost a pair, and they were his property.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS SULLIVAN. I keep a cellar in Monmouth-street; these are my shoes. I went out on the 28th of March, leaving them at my door; and the next morning the officer brought them to me.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the 29th of March, about five o'clock in the afternoon, he came and brought three hats which were ordered; my brother told me something, and I watched the prisoner; he put down the hats which were ordered, and I saw another hat out of paper, by the side of his box; I went forward, and saw him put the hat into his box - I went and tried to open the box, but he placed both his hands on it; I broke the lid of the box. and opened it; I took the hat out, and he said, "That is a good hat - what would you like to give for a dozen of them?" I said it bore the appearance of one of those which came in in the morning from a maker named Horn; I took one of those hats out of the paper, and compared the lining and every thing, and they appeared to be the same; the prisoner said it was his hat, and I sent for Mr. Horn; I will swear I took this hat from the box, and I saw him put it into it; the paper was partly on it, but in comparing the hats the paper vanished.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What became of the paper? A. I do not know - we searched for it; I was not further from him than I am from you; the constable searched him, but he could not find the paper - our mark was on it; I do not know what he could do with it: I took off the paper, and put it on the counter while I compared the hats, and while I did so it was gone; it was vellum paper. I swear the prisoner did not bring a fourth hat in with him; he brought an empty box in, which has been his custom; the lid was on the box: he put the three hats on the counter, then took this hat from the counter, and put it into the box; I had seen the hat safe ten minutes before he came in; I compared it with the other hats to convince him, for there was no mark upon it - he appeared to have been drinking.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many hats of that kind have you made in the course of your life? A. I cannot tell; I put my initials in those I make, and to the best of my knowledge it is one of those I carried in on the 1st, or on the 29th of March; I never sold one to the prisoner.</p>

On the evening of the 28th of March she went out; the prisoner and I were in the kitchen; after supper the prisoner read the newspaper, and then we both fell asleep - I awoke a little before eleven o'clock, and missed the prisoner - Ferguson had gone out a little after ten o'clock, and I had fastened the door after her; when I missed the prisoner I got up, and saw her coming in at the yard door- I said, "I thought you were gone to bed;" she said,"No, I should not have gone to bed, and left you, till your daughter came home;" we then sat down, and I heard a great noise; I said, "What is that?" I took the candle, went up, and found the watchman in the passage, who said the door was open; I said I was sure I had fastened it, and I begged him to go with us and see if any person was in the house, but there was no one; I never thought of my daughter's dresses till she came home; she said, "I am afraid the work is not safe" - we went, and saw that the work which we had been about was safe; and we went into the kitchen again - she then thought of the dresses; we went and looked, and they were gone; the prisoner said,"I am very much frightened, and cannot sleep by myself"- I said, "My daughter will sleep with you." The next morning another lodger said it was very strange; the prisoner said it was so, but they would never do the person good whoever had taken them; the other lodger then would have an officer sent for, to search her room, as she was going out, and she might be suspected; we sent for the officer who came and searched her room, but nothing was found; the prisoner was at that time dressing, and my daughter, from motives of delicacy, would not let the officer go into her apartment, but she went and looked herself, and there was nothing there; after tea the prisoner went up stairs, and Mrs. Bristow (the other lodger) said, "I have had no peace since this happened;" I said, "I can't help it - I know nothing about them;" Ferguson then went into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100079"/>the yard, and found a tippet belonging to one of the dresses which she brought in; the prisoner was there at that time, and I said to her, "Had you not better write to your brother, as there is an officer sent for to search the house; she said she would write to him, and she took a candle and went up stairs; I then went into the yard, and saw all the air was in a cloud of feathers, and in a tree in a neighbour's garden I saw something suspended - I went and called Mrs. Bristow, and said, "Your eyes are better than mine, come and see what this is;" she came and said, "It is like one of your daughter's dresses;" I said, "How shall we get it down;" we went to the neighbour's, (Mr. Mackinnins) - he got his steps, and got it down, but he said he would not give it to us, but to an officer; I then went into the kitchen, and the prisoner came and said, "I have taken the dresses, but pray forgive me;" I said, "I am afraid it is out of my power - the officer is coming;" I said, "Where is the other dress?" she said, "On the drawers in my room;" I said to Mrs. Bristow, "Go and see if it is there" - she went and found it there, all covered with feathers, and the bed was cut open, as if they had been put in there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who was present when she made this statement the first time? A. No one but me, but she said so again before Mrs. Bristow; Ferguson went out at ten o'clock at night. The prisoner desired some person might sleep with her, and my daughter did sleep with her.</p>

In the evening Mrs. Jobling called me to see what was on the tree; I went into the kitchen - the prisoner was there; she fell on her knees, and said, "I did do it - I hope you will forgive me;" I said, "I have nothing to do with it. but I am glad God Almighty has given you grace to acknowledge it."</p>

On the 12th of March I sent for an officer, about seven o'clock in the evening - the prisoner was called up stairs, and I charged her in his presence with taking a watch-case, a night-cap and a pair of trousers; she said, she knew nothing of either of them - she denied knowing anything about them three or four times; we asked her about them separately, and she denied them all; we said it would be necessary to see what was in her box - she said she had no objection, and we went down for that purpose; in going down she said she believed there was an old pair of trousers in the box - we found this new pair of trousers, and this watch-case in the box; the other articles have not been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you not removed just before? A. Yes; I had given the prisoner directions to pack up the things; I know these trousers had been in my drawers some weeks before, but I do not know where they were the day we were packing up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner ask you whether she should begin to pack up any of the things, and you said Yes? A. She never asked me that question to my knowledge; I cannot swear whether she did or not - she might have done so; we removed on the 29th of February, and on the 12th of March she was taken up - we packed up the day before we removed; I cannot say the prisoner packed up any of the things; I desired her to bring me the things, and I packed them up myself - I did not direct her to pack up anything except the breakfast things; I never ordered her to pack the things that were in the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell her to pack up all the things she saw, and then the things in the desk? A. I cannot tell - I had mentioned to her about these things four or five days before she was taken up; I cannot say that I was present when my wife said anything to her about the watch-case, but there were five or six conversations about it; we did not exactly tax her about it - my wife said, "Mary, I don't think I have lost my watch-case."</p>
               <p>Q. And did not the prisoner say, "We had better look for it - I am very uneasy, let us look in the boxes"? A. I will swear she did not say that in my presence, nor did my wife reply, that it was no use to look, it was too far gone to be recalled; the prisoner did not go the same night and look in a chest belonging to my wife, and find several of her own things, to my knowledge - I went to Mr. Craddock on the Sunday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your wife say that Mr. Craddock had persuaded you to go to the Cannon public-house, and find the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100080"/>man who had moved the goods? A. No; the prisoner was apprehended on the Wednesday following - I did not go after the man who moved the goods, because he was not near the premises when anything could be taken away - he is not here; she did say, "I thought I had put an old pair of trousers into my box out of the cupboard," but that was after she had denied it - she said she put them in in a mistake; I went to the house I removed from on the Sunday morning, because I did not wish to cast a stigma on any one.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you swear you had seen these trousers after having removed? A. No, nor for some weeks before.</p>

I heard the prisoner charged with taking these articles; I asked her if she knew anything at all about them - she said, No; her master said, "Have you any objection to have your box searched" - she said, "Not the least;" in going down stairs she said she believed there was an old pair of trousers in the box, which she had put in in moving - these trousers and this watch-case were found in the box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was not the box very full? A. Yes - she told me many of her things were mixed with some articles of her master's; I do not know whether two gowns of hers were found - I did not find two old dusters in her box.</p>
               <p>MRS. WHINFIELD. I am the prosecutor's wife. I had some conversation with the prisoner some days before the officers came; she did not say she had an objection to my searching her box.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you say in the presence of your husband, that it was no use to look, you thought it too far gone to be recalled? A. I believe I might; there was an apron or two of hers found in a chest of mine - we packed the things rather in a hurry the day before.</p>

            . I am a parish surveyor. On Wednesday, the 20th of February, I saw the prisoner between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, in Earl-street, Seven-dials; he had this coat in a bundle; he said he brought it from Warwick-square; I said I would go with him to see if he said true: as we were going along, he said he got it from Mr. Pearce, a tailor, No. 5, Green-street, Theobald-road - I went there, and Pearce said he had not had such a thing for a fortnight; in going to the office the next day, he said a man gave him the coat to carry to Queen-street, Seven Dials, and he was to have 1s. for his trouble.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he say he was going to show this coat to an aunt of his, to show her the quality? A. I think he might; we went to his aunt's house, but she was not at home; he said he lodged there, but it was no such thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did he first tell you about his aunt? A. When I first took him - I found he had lived there, but had left.</p>

            . I am a tailor. On Tuesday night, the 19th of February, the prisoner slept at my house; he is a stay-maker, but he had been working for me on the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th; on the 19th he came in, to the best of my knowledge, from ten to twelve o'clock at night; he was in at eleven o'clock; he went to bed and did not get up till twelve o'clock the next day; he had not been ill, but when he came in, it was supper-time, and I gave him a little porter; I consider that made him sleep longer than usual.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you live? A. In Green-street. The officer came to me with the coat; he told me a young man said he was employed by me about it.</p>

Yes; he had lived a year or two at the Horse and Groom; my key hung in the bar, and he might have taken it if Mr. Simms was not there - this is the cloth- it would be very difficult for one man to carry it; two rather destitute men, who lived near the premises, have absconded; I understand they slept in Mr. Simm's stable; hand-bills were printed, and I did insert in them that the name of "Mead," maker, was on it, as I thought it was, as many makers do put their name on cloths; I now find that was not the case: one of the men who have absconded worked for me - we took them into custody, but could not bring any evidence against them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When had you seen the cloth safe? A.

I found the prisoner at the door, and said to him, "George, I understand you have got a cloth for sale," and whether he said he had got a cloth, or got one for sale, I am not certain; but he took hold of my horse's head, and drew the cart to the stable-door: I followed him, and saw the cloth there: I said, "Well, George, open it out;" he said, "I can't open it:" I said, "I am not going to buy a pig-in-a-poke;" he said, "Take it, and if it don't suit you, bring it back again." I got it into the cart with the prisoner; I then stepped aside for a minute; Harrold and Mr. Simms came, and said it was Mr. Vorley's: I said, "If it is stolen, I will have nothing to do with it." I threw it out, and went to have a pint of beer; while I was there, they put it into the cart again - I had lost my cloth some time before, and told the prisoner if he heard of one, I should be glad to know of it.</p>

Yes; there was no hay covering it - there was a little hay in the cart; it was about four o'clock in the evening - it could not have been covered with hay without my seeing it; I did not put a single whisp of hay on it; two men were taken up on suspicion; I did not know either of them- I have lived for fourteen or fifteen years within three quarters of a mile of the Horse and Groom.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Vorley. On the 4th of March I saw this cloth safe in the loft; I locked up the stable door about eight o'clock that morning, and hung the key up in the bar; there is a fence round the yard, and a gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could not anybody get into the yard? A. Yes, but not into the stable without the key; when I went on the Wednesday morning the cloth was gone - I do not know whether it could be brought into the public yard without a person seeing it - it is a public yard; the Horse and Groom is an inn, but this stable is at the back of the Horse and Groom. The cloth would take two ablebodied men to lift it; I do not know the two men who went off - it is about five poles from Mr. Vorley's stable to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100083"/>stable of the Horse and Groom; a person could not go therewithout crossing a fence - it is full one hundred yards to go round by the palings.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What hour was it you saw the prisoner on the premises? A. At four o'clock, and again at half-past five; I know the time, because I was expecting the Herald coach, and at that time the prisoner went out to go to Holloway.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The last time you saw him was at half-past five o'clock? A. Yes - he was at his work till then; he went out of my stable - it was not his duty to be there after that time; I did not see him the next morning; he had to take in the horses and chaises; I never saw him from half-past five o'clock that evening till he was at the bar at Hatton-garden.</p>

Eighteen months; our regular wages are 18s. a week, which I paid him, but if he delivered above nine hundred loaves I allowed him a half-penny a loaf for it, for a certain time; there was no agreement or memorandum to that effect - he has not sold eleven or twelve hundred loaves in a week, but he has sold above nine hundred in a week, which have been accounted for, and I paid him the halfpenny a loaf; I never entered into a bond with him - his uncle was answerable to me to the amount of 10l. - I have not made any application to his uncle; he has left the place where he did live - I have my day-book here, in which the accounts are made principally by myself; here is the account of what the prisoner delivered out to customers who had credit.

               <p>The prisoner Power, in his defence, handed in the following extract from the Morning Advertiser, of the 24th of March, 1828."Bow-street - A young man, who said that he had suffered the sentence of the law, for picking a gentleman's pocket in Leicester-square, applied to know how he was to act under the following circumstances: on obtaining his liberty, he determined to amend his life, and retrieve the character he had lost; in pursuance of this design, he had procured an employment, in which he was doing prosperously, until some evil-disposed person disclosed to his master and fellow-workmen, the history of his life. The latter, as might be expected, refused to remain in the shop with a convicted thief; and the former having his own fears, pleaded that as an excuse for discharging him. He was then, he said, again thrown on the town, and unless he could procure some means of getting bread honestly, a return to his former evil courses, must be the inevitable consequence; and a consequence, it was his anxious desire to avoid. - JONES (the gaoler) Were you not brought here by Boston? APPLICANT. Yes; I was. JONES.

               <p>ROBERT BRAXTON. On the 28th of March I was in <placeName id="t18280410-149-crimeloc805">Covent-garden</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me behind you? A. No; he was just opposite me, on my right hand - the handkerchief was partly out of his pocket; I know the handkerchief by the hemming of it - my name is not on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is a handkerchief, which came off the same piece, (producing it) and they are both mine.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister - I hemmed this handkerchief; there are two hems, one on the right side and the other on the wrong. I have not seen it since this charge, (looking at it) here are the bems as I stated - I did it about seven months ago; the one my brother has produced, is the same pattern; but not off the same piece. I know the pattern as well as the work.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BRAXTON re-examined. I had my handkerchief safe in my right hand coat-pocket, just before the prisoner was putting it into his pocket - the prisoner did tell the Magistrate that there was no mark on it: he had not seen it then. I have nobody here who hemmed it - I came from Gloucestershire. I said, myself, that it was not marked before the Magistrate; I know it by the hem being uneven - I would not have it cut even; it is hemmed in the border in some places.</p>

On the morning of the 29th of March, my shopman came to me - I went about half-past ten o'clock, and found the shop and stock in great confusion; I am not certain whether I had been there the day before; I missed a great many umbrellas - and one bundle was tied up ready to be removed. I found some at the office.</p>

            . I am shopwoman to Mr. Foot, and left the shop in Cheapside, rather before nine o'clock in the evening of the 28th of March, leaving Twinch there; I have seen some umbrellas since - here is one very remarkable, which I know well; about one hundred were missing.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Foot, and was the last person in the shop, on the 28th of February, I left some of the stock in the window, and some in the shop - I went again, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, and found the door ajar; I missed a great number of umbrellas - the top lock had been broken open, and the other opened by a false key. Full one hundred umbrellas were gone; here is one I can particularly swear to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Your master is an extensive dealer? A. Yes; I do not know how many agents he has - the one I swear to, has a bone hook, of a description we never had before; it is a black and white bone; we never had one so small as this before - it stood in a corner of the shop the night before; I am certain we never sold it; I had showed it to a customer about seven o'clock that evening.</p>

            . I live in Cable-street, Whitechapel. The prisoner came to my house with these umbrellas on Monday, the 10th of March, with another person who knew me; that person said, "I have brought a person here who has one hundred umbrellas to sell, and has brought one as a sample" - the prisoner had this one in a black bag; I think he said they were 7s. or 8s. each; I told him to leave it till next morning, and I would let him know - he came alone in the morning, and I said the price would not do; he said the lot cost 30l., and I might have them for 35l; I said I would have them - he took me to a house on the other side of Finsbury-square to look at them; before we came to the house he said, "We will go into this public-house and have something to drink" - we went, and had some rum and water; while there he said, "I will go to the house, which is just by, and see if they are all ready;" he went out, stopped some time, and I asked the landlord,(who I had seen him speak to,) where he was gone - I went to Mr. Gray's by his direction, and found the door open; I went in, and saw him and Gray in the parlour - a number of umbrellas were there - I looked at them; the prisoner said, "Are you satisfied" - I said, Yes; he said he would get the remainder - he went and brought down some more, and said, "Here is but seventy, but I will settle that at your house;" I said I had left some rum and water at the public house - we went there, and then to the house again; the officer was then waiting there - I thought I was going to see them at his own house; he did not say he had them to sell for another person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you ever been in this Court before? A. I was tried in the other Court twelve years ago, but acquitted before the trial was half through - it was for fetching some silver spoons out of pawn; I have been very cautious ever since; I was tried at Hick's Hall for a misdemeanor - I have lived where I do for fifteen years; the officer knew me - my house has been searched perhaps twenty times; I gave information of this to the officer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the misdemeanor? A. It was about some articles which I bought; I was admitted to bail - no other charges were ever made against me; I was never charged with stealing a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your house searched about? A. If malicious people will lay informations against me I cannot help it.</p>

            . On Thursday, the 28th of February, the prisoner, who lodges with me, came to me at three o'clock in the afternoon; I saw him there till eleven, and he then went to bed - it was the day the New Brunswick Theatre fell down - he came in and told me of it; I saw him about seven o'clock in the morning - he slept on the ground floor - I sleep up stairs.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Where do you live? A. At No. 17, Carter-street, Brick-lane, Bethnal-green; the prisoner keeps the house, I lodge there, and have done so about two months - we both work at the same shop, and have our meals together; we supped about ten o'clock - his wife and my wife supped with us; I cannot tell what we had - I did not go out to look at the Theatre till the Saturday; we all breakfasted together next morning, and had our meals together - we dined between twelve and one; we drank nothing but porter at supper; we are both weavers, and work for Ellerby, Wilson and Co.</p>
               <p>- DUNCAN. I am the wife of the last witness. On the 28th of February the prisoner came home about three o'clock - he had been to see the Theatre which had fallen down; he was at home all day till about eleven o'clock, when he went to bed; I generally fasten the door- there is no key to it; I saw him again between seven and eight o'clock in the morning - either I or my husband opened the door to let a girl in who nurses my child; I saw the prisoner all the next day - we sleep on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you have for supper? A. I think bread and cheese; I do not recollect any gin being fetched - the prisoner went to bed first; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100086"/>down in the supper room before my husband - I am his daughter.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and have a stable at Hoxton. Two young men came to look at it about the 12th or 13th; the prisoner afterwards came with the person who took it; they called me up at one o'clock in the morning of the 15th; the other said his man could not get in, and the horse was getting cold; I got up, went down, and found the prisoner and the other man; the horse was out of the chaise. I went to take the irons off the gate, but the irons were gone; I forget the name of the man who took the stable - he appeared respectable, and referred me to a person at Shoreditch, but I did not inquire; I did not take notice of the chaise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not a superior looking man to the prisoner? A. Yes, very much so; his name was Brown, now I recollect.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Old-street. Brown applied to me. I think on Monday, the 18th of March, about selling a chaise cart - the prisoner came with him. I went to the stable in Huntingdon-street, Hoxton, to look at the cart, but did not like the appearance of it, and did not buy it - it was all to pieces - every bolt was taken out; he asked 5l. for it; I left the prisoner in the stable when I went away, and next evening he came to me with a message from Brown, saying he wished I would go and buy the cart, as they were very much in want of money - I cannot swear whether he said I or he.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He delivered Brown's message? A. I considered so. Brown was the only active man on the first occasion; I have known Brown for years, and all his family - he is very respectable, and highly connected.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was employed by this man to break the cart up; he came to me on the 14th, I think, and asked me to go with him to put up the horse and chaise; I said I would, as I was up, and went; he called in the morning, and asked me to break it up - when I asked for my money he said he had none, but would pay me in a day or two.</p>

I took him to Bow-street - it was then just eight, and the door was shut; I took him to the watch-house again, and next morning having to go to Marlborough-street on another charge, I took him there, as I could not be at two places.</p>

               <p>JANE BROWN. I am fourteen years old, and live with my mother. On the 31st of March, at seven o'clock in the evening, I was going along with my cousins; the prisoner and three other girls, came up to us; the prisoner left the others, came up, and asked us for a penny; I had none - my cousin had a halfpenny, and I had one; we put them together and gave them to her. I had never seen her before; she then asked for another penny, I said I had no more of our own: she said she knew we had, and that it was to make up three quarterns of gin, and we should have some. I said we never drank gin; she said she would never let us go clear, if we did not give it to her - she put her hand down my bosom and tore the beads off my neck; she threw them at me, and said, "You may have them again." I had a bag of money down my bosom, I took it out, and held it tight in my hand - she took my hand, forced it open, and pulled it out; my cousin asked her for the money, she took and hit her in the eye, and gave her a dreadful blow - she began to run; I called Stop thief! and she was taken; she gave my bag and money to another girl. I am sure she is the girl who took it - there were two half-crowns and two penny pieces in it; they belonged to Elizabeth Wickmill.</p>

Not the small green-handled knives and forks: the prisoner came to me on the 24th of February. and left on the 1st of May, 1824; her sister then came to me and left in August, 1826, and the prisoner came to char for me that year; I never gave the sister anything; but I have given the prisoner some old bed-furniture, baby-linen, and other things; the mark has been picked out of this table-cloth; there was some of the marking cotton on it when I found it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When were the table-cloths marked? A. That I cannot say; the whole of the three were bought in 1825; the mark of the thread cannot be washed out: I missed them in 1825 - the prisoner's sister left me in disgrace in 1826: I should rather suspect her than the prisoner.</p>

            . I am carman to Mr. Emery, of Gun-square; I met Ellis in Whitechapel - I knew him by the name of Bullen; he asked, where I was going? I said, I had nothing to do; he asked if I would go with him to sell some old iron, and he would give me some beer - I went with him to McDowell's, and took the iron; there was a round plate and some other iron.</p>
               <p>Prisoner ELLIS. Q. What day was it? A. I believe it was Wednesday - it was the latter end of February; your mother went by the name of Bullen - I have been in your loft and saw a pair of shafts there, I think you said, you were going to build a van with them in the summer for yourself; that might be three or four weeks ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was it before you went to the Magistrate? A. About a fortnight; I only judge of the time I went with him by master having nothing to do - it was towards the end of February.</p>
               <p>Prisoner ELLIS. Q. Was not the iron sold on the Wednesday week before I was apprehended? A. I think so; I was examined on the 17th of March, and think it was on the Wednesday week before that.</p>
               <p>MR. BUTTLER. I saw the shafts, they are mine, and so is the sweep-plate, and some pieces of the cart I can swear to; I know the shafts by some plates and some hooks on them - I had had the van about two years; I bought it - it has been mended once, and I also had done something to it myself; I had put some plates on the shaft, and there are several parts of my mending which I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner ELLIS. Q. Did you ever take the sweepplate off? A. No, but I have looked at it many times.</p>
               <p>ELLIS'S Defence. He is a false swearing man, it is not his iron; I dealt in iron, and sold some there before - I was first examined on the 29th of February, and then Worgan said it was the Wednesday week before.(See Fifth Day.)</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On the 28th of February I was in company with Bassett and Lloyd, near the house of Linton, at Islington-green; he is a retailer of table-beer, what is called a pinman; I saw the two prisoners about six o'clock in the evening, come there, and Culley had a firkin on his shoulder; they were walking in company together; I should think they were a mile and a half, or two miles from Mr. Harris'; he lives in the Hampstead-road; they went up the gateway to Linton's brewery, and set the cask down at Linton's door - they then went to a workshop in the same yard, next door to Linton's, made some inquiry, and then returned up the yard; I went to them, and asked what they had left the cask there for - they appeared confused, and I said, "What business had you to leave that cask there?" they said they had found it in Smithfield, and were going to take it home- I think it was Fagan who said he picked it up, and Culley said he was assisting him to carry it; it was a small cask, and did not require two men to carry it; I took them in charge, and fetched the cask from Linton's door.</p>

About December Fagan came and sat a cask down - Linton came and asked if I had any money - I gave him 6s.; he gave Fagan 2s. for it - it was marked with Mr. Harris' name; Fagan came to me when I was washing casks in the yard, and said, "Is it not a shame, the old man does not allow more than 2s. for the casks - he sells them for 4s. 6d."</p>

               <p>ROBERT DUKE. On the 28th of February, I went with Bassett and Lloyd to Linton's premises, at Islingtongreen; I found about one hundred and fifty casks there, or more; I took away one barrel, one kilderkin, and two firkins - I took them to the Red Lion public-house, Islingtongreen, and saw them locked up in a coal-cellar - I desired that no person might have them but myself, or Lloyd; when we fetched them away, I found part of the head of the barrel, where the name had been, chipped off - I had made no alteration in it; one head was out when I found it at Linton's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was Linton present when you took them away? A. Yes; I did not ask his leave.</p>

            . I am a cooper. On the 28th or 29th of February, the prisoner came to my shop, and told me to bring my tools; I went with him to the Red Lion, Islington-green; he went into the bar, and spoke to the landlord; the boy got the key, and went into the cellar - the casks were brought out to me in the skittle-ground; he told me to take the two little marks out - they were scratch marks; the same as we mark all our heads with - that makes the wood look clean; I never did a job for him before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at this cask, is it the one out of which you took two marks? A. It is; one head was out then; I asked him if it was his own; he said Yes, and told me to take them down to the shop, and cobble them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you know the cask by? A. By the top; I know no mark on it - I do not swear positively to it; I have known Linton twelve or fourteen years, but did no business for him; he did not ask me to do this privately.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. What time of day was this? A. Between six and seven o'clock in the morning of the 29th of February - he said he had bought them.</p>

               <p>JOB WEST. I am in partnership with James West; the prisoner was never in our employ - I never directed our dray to call at Bateman's - we have lost several casks.</p>

I said I had a house to glaze, and I would look at it - he said if I would call in about half an hour, he would shew it to me; that he had it to sell for a poor man who was in the Bench- he called in about half an hour and we went up to his room over the stable. I saw Matthews in the room, looking over the glass; I did not examine it, for I was afraid of breaking it; it looked very good. Matthews said, if he had all the money in the world, he would not give more than 6l. for it; the prisoner was in the room at that time, I think. I said nothing to him about the price - I never offered him any price; he never asked what I would give for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever propose any price to the prisoner? A. Never; till I left the money in the publican's hands; and said if he would take 5l. or five guineas for it, I would have it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave that message with him? A. I was obliged to go to town - I gave him four sovereigns, and asked him to lend me 25s. I got the glass out of the room on the Sunday morning afterwards; I carried it home, and had it glazed - I bought nothing but plain glass of him; the prisoner had mentioned no price in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did not the prisoner tell you he had it from a person at Kensington, who had it from a man in the Bench? A. No; I had known the prisoner for about a fortnight before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not he in bed? A. No. There had been no rain from the Sunday till the Thursday - I came up at night - there is a border round the shrobbery: the marks were very plain there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did it appear to you that two persons had been there? A. I only saw the footmark of one person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How did you pay him? A. By a commission on every subscriber he obtained; and he was occasionally employed in writing for me; I considered him as my servant; he received the money at the time he obtained the signatures and was then to have his commission, that was, before he delivered the plans - I have no recollection of having described him as my agent; there was not a debtor and creditor account between us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever call on him to become a witness for you at any trial? A. I wished him to become a witness about a fortnight before I made this discovery; which was on the 28th of March, and not before; he was to be witness about a dozen of these plans, which he had delivered to a shopkeeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he refuse to become a witness? A. The case never came on; he refused by engaging to go to Wales - I knew he was going before that - he was examined four times on this charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, after the first examination, apply to make it up? A. No: I should have been glad to have done it, and was applied to about it by Mr. Morley; I advanced him money from time to time, as he stated that he was very poor.</p>

            . I am a carman. On Tuesday night the 11th of March, I was in bed, and was knocked up by some one who said there were thieves in Mr. Dyball's house next door to me; I went with Mr. Bee and examined the premises - we saw a parcel of old sashes broken, which had been taken from the second floor - we went round to Dyball's; he came with us and searched the premises; on coming away, I said, I had seen the prisoner on the Sunday, taking out some at the back premises - Dyball said, "He lives up here;" we went up to his apartment - he was in bed; they went in and I staid outside - they brought out this old frame and glass which we took to the watch-house; I did not hear the prisoner say anything.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Is there not a thoroughfare through the empty house to mine? A. It ought to be kept fastened, but I have seen it open.</p>

            . I went to the prisoner's bed-room and found these parts of sash-frames; he said nothing about them; I took him to the watch-house - I have matched the pieces to the house, they all correspond - I had information, and got up, and saw a light.</p>
               <p>DANIEL DYBALL. I swear these are my property; they were in the fore part of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was there a fire in my room? A. Very little, if any.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There is no yard to my house; I went to bed that night very soon after nine - my wife staid up; she had to go to the cellar, and seeing these pieces thrown down, she brought them up in her apron, and put some on the fire.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ; on the 13th of March, in consequence of information, I marked 26 shillings, and put them into my till, about half-past twelve in the day - I remained in the shop till half-past one, and then went to dinner - on my return, I found one shilling gone - I sent him to his dinner, and then marked two shillings more; and about three o'clock I went out, calling him to mind the shop; I returned in a quarter of an hour, and in that time I found he had taken about 8s. 6d., but on examining the till, there were only twenty-five marked shillings, &amp; seven shillings not marked- I stated to him that I had missed money; he said he knew nothing about it - I said I must send for an officer - he then pointed to where he had concealed some money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you not tell him, it would be better to confess it? A. No; I said I did not wish him to confess it.</p>

To some straw under the counter - I saw Angel examine the straw, and take a shilling out - two officers came, one of whom went up with me to examine the prisoner's box, and on the top of it he found two shillings and some copper; and at the bottom of it two marked shillings, and other monies; here is one of the shillings.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you sober? A.

I was certainly the worse for liquor, but not drunk.</p>

On the 12th of April, at twelve o'clock in the day, I was playing at shuttlecock; I saw the two prisoners go up to Mr. Sears's house; Jones took these brushes off the door-post; Warwick was close by him, and had a basket in his hand; Jones put the brushes into the basket, and they went away - I told Mrs. Sears; she and I went in pursuit; we took them about 100 yards off; the brushes were found in the basket.</p>

               <p>MRS. MOSS. These are my stays.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You saw them searched, did you not? A. Yes; six or seven shillings were found on them - there were no other persons in my shop when the balloon went up: I saw the stays drop - when they came in my counter was quite clear.</p>
               <p>The prisoners all received a good character.</p>

            . I am a gardener; about twenty minutes before eleven o'clock that night, I went into the Castle public-house, to have a pint of beer - I saw the prisoner, the prosecutor, and some others in the tap-room - they made some movement - the prisoner took the bundle, and ran out; the other man went to the prosecutor, and said, "Come, you must go, you can't lodge here tonight." They all rushed out, and the prisoner went quite in a contrary way to the waggon - I told the constable, and went with him to the prisoners.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I keep a butcher's shop in Green-street, Twig-folly, about three quarters of a mile from the prosecutor.

            . I am a cow-keeper, and live in Essex-street, Globe-fields: I have known the prisoner about three years. On Wednesday evening, the 26th of March, I saw him about a quarter before nine o'clock, in his own house; I went out, and thought if he had a bit of beefsteak I would have it for supper; I looked through his window, and saw he had nothing but bits of mutton; I did not go in, but I saw him sitting there with a child on his knee. I had been into Whitechapel, on business; I know it was that Wednesday, because the next morning a gentleman called on me, and I told him I saw the man at home about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What makes you so particular as to time? A. Because it was eight o'clock when I went from my house to Whitechapel, and I looked at Whitechapel-church clock; it was Mr. Fernley called on me next morning; it would take me ten minutes to walk three quarters of a mile; I have driven a pig that distance in a quarter of an hour, but some are more obstinate than others.</p>

            . I am a straw hat-maker. The prosecutor has part of my house: between eight and nine o'clock in the morning of the 14th of April, the shop bell rang; the little boy who generally attends the door, went to it, and soon after called out "shop;" I went into the shop and missed a picture; I looked into the street and saw the prisoner with it, partly concealed under his arm, and just turning into a court; I pursued him, and called Stop thief! he ran pretty sharp, but there were three person on horseback who pursued him, and he was taken; I kept him in view all the time, except when he turned a corner; when I came up to him I asked where the picture was; he said, "I have no picture, this is what I have taken," and he gave me this card - I took him back the same way he had run, and the picture which he had dropped was given to me by of the neighbours. I knew the prisoner before.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I came back, the card was given to the gentleman by another person, not by me; the picture was given me by a man to hold, and when I had it he ran away. <rs id="t18280410-263-verdict1414" type="verdictDescription">

            . I live at Bethnal-green. These two prisoners came to my house on Friday morning, about nine o'clock. Wygold had these fowls and chickens in a baker's basket; he said he had some fowls to sell; I asked what he wanted for them - he said 6s. 6d. or 7s. 6d; I said"I will give you 5s. 6d. for them," which I paid Wygold- they were very common fowls, middling size, and the chickens were but two or three days old.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you in the habit of going to his shop? A. Yes; I go for chips, and see him at work with these tools.

I do not know that Waters is a carpenter; I only know him by his coming to Mrs. Carr's - I was in the room about five minutes; I did not take up the tool.</p>

            . As Davis was going along Gray's Inn-lane, with Conden, on the evening of the 14th, Waters came up to see if he was in custody; and as soon as he saw us, he ran away down Laystall-street - I followed, and took him; when I got him to the watch-house, I asked him where Conden was; he said, what the h - ll was that to him. Conden was then brought to the watch-house, and I said, was it not a shame to rob the poor man of his tools; he said, "You b - r, you may want a tool, before you die."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you an officer? A. No; I am a watch-case maker - Davis asked me to assist him; the tools have not been found.</p>
               <p>WATER's Defence. They were my own tools; I left them there when I went to breakfast.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was going my round about eight minutes past ten o'clock, and I made a stand, as I always do, at one particular corner, I saw the prisoner come out at the wicket gate, with this malt on his shoulder; the gate opens into Brewers'-green, where Mr. Chamber's premises are - I went up to him, and asked what he had there; he said, "Malt." I asked where he was going, he said, "Round there;" I said, I should go with him, and he went round to No. 12; he made a stand, and a little girl came out. I felt the sack - I told him to put it down, and asked if Mr. Chambers knew of it; he said he did - I said I should take him and the malt to the watch-house, till I had authority from Mr. Chambers; he asked me if I knew him - I said, No; he asked if I knew his mother, Mrs. Bunn; I said, I did, by passing through my beat - he asked if I would allow him to send for her; I said Yes: by that little girl, which he did - the mother came, and asked what was the matter, and told me if I would come round the corner, she would explain things to me. I went round, and as soon as I got in at the door, she wished me for God Almighty's sake, to have nothing to do with it; as soon as I found how things were going on, I retreated away; the prisoner had then made his escape. I took the malt to the watch-house, and the prisoner was taken in bed, about twelve o'clock by the patrol.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did you leave him? A. By the wicket; I was not away above five minutes - I am sober now, and have drunk nothing but a pint of porter; I do not recollect whether I have been to more than one public-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The malt was not Mr. Chambers'. I cart malt and ask for the sweepings; I had saved it and meant to brew with it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

            . I am a drover, in the employ of Mr. Gay, who lives in Norfolk. I came up with these sheep, and assisted to put them into the lair - I went on Monday morning, at two o'clock, to take them; I found them in a different lair to the one I left them in: I counted them out of the gate, and there were but one hundred and twenty-seven - I should have had one hundred and twenty-eight; there were fifty-nine which I had from Mr. Barrell, marked with what is called a bounce mark on the shoulder, and forty-four or forty-five marked with an old brand-mark on each side, and three or four with an old mark, that we could not say what it was; they were put altogether on the Sunday evening; when I got them out of the lair I missed one; I was going up Mile-end-road, and met two of Conder's men coming back for another flock; they told me they had got one of mine at Smithfield; this was about half-past two o'clock, while I was driving the sheep to market; I got to Smithfield about four o'clock; I met Mr. Lee in Long-lane, and said to him, "I am one sheep short - I do not know whether it is one of yours;" Conder then told me the sheep was in Mr. French's pens in Smithfield; I parted Mr. Lee's sheep from the others, and found it was one of his that was missing; whether it was branded over, or whether it was the old brand-mark, I cannot say; I did not go to Mr. French's pens, for Mr. Lee said if the sheep was there he would let it be till it was day-light, as it was safe enough - I then went away.</p>

            . I am a drover in the employ of Mr. Lee. On the 25th of February, between two and three o'clock in the morning, I saw Cole lead a sheep across Smithfield-market; it was marked with red-ochre between the shoulders - he took it into the lower alley, nearly opposite the Ram public-house, he put it into the second pen on the left-hand - after the man was gone, I went and looked at it, and saw the mark; I do not know what became of it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. Between one and two; it was dark.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and got my sheep from the Plough by Cole's directions - Reed was by him; it was at Smithfield; they had told me, two or three days before, that they were going to have a few sheep from the country - I agreed to buy them all at 1l. each, whether little or large, and be they worth what they would; on Monday Cole said, "There is one at the Plough, fetch it away, and pay a shilling," which I did - I paid the prisoners fourteen shillings in part of the money, and next week four shillings more; I killed it at the Plough, and took it home in a bag; I live in Dock-street, Commercial-road; it was marked on the shoulder with ochre; I did not take particular notice of the mark; I cut it up and sold it in my shop; I threw the skin in a corner till it was tainted, and then I pulled the wool off - it was taken away three or four days afterwards, with others.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the paper here that was on them? A. No, it had been tucked into the fat of the meat, and was so rumpled, that if we had attempted to dry it, it would have melted almost; but it was a sty hog, which carries the mark with it almost; the man is not here who killed it - they were sent to me to be sold - the paper was put into them by some of my people - I cannot say whose writing it was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could a person acquainted with pork be able to swear to a piece as belonging to a sty hog. A. Yes.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. On Tuesday, the 26th of February, after the market was over, I took in the legs of pork which were not sold - the next morning there was a report that a man was taken up for stealing two legs - I looked into our shop, and two of my master's were gone; this was about half-past seven o'clock; an officer afterwards came to my master's shop - I described the legs of pork to him, and about nine o'clock, I saw what I believe were Mr. Taylor's legs of pork, in his possession - I have not the least doubt of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was your master's name on them? A. No; there was a note on them, and two cuts, which I had made to hang them up by, at the sinew of the legs, and they had a black mark in the thick part of the leg. I have seen this man about the place.</p>

            . I am keeper of the watch-house. I was with Gibson and saw the prisoner stooping down in London-house-yard; I asked him where he got the pork; he said "If you go to the Cap and Salutation tap. they will give you particulars;" Gibson went there, returned, and said the publican said he had been there, but had left about ten o'clock; the prisoner then said if I would go to one Smith, who worked with Mr. Fisher in the market, he would give me another answer; I went there, and they were shut up; I then asked the prisoner where he lived; he said "Go to old Price;" I left them under his care; I went there and he said he had not - I went back and told the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you enquire the next mornign of Fisher? A. Yes; I went and found Smith, his foreman, he told me he never sold him any such thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell Smith you were an officer? A. Not till afterwards, but they pretty well knew it; I said "I am an officer, and if you sold them to Jones you had better come up to the Hall."</p>

            . I am the wife of Henry Harris. We live in Augusta-street, Hampstead-road. On the 22d of March, I met the prisoner coming over Blackfriars' - bridge; she was quite a stranger - she nearly stopped me, by seeming to pick up something under my feet; which appeared to be two seals, a ring, and a chain. She stopped me, and said, I should have half; we walked on till we came to the second street over the bridge - she asked me if I knew where there was a silversmiths, I said, No; we walked on till we met a young man - she asked him if he knew where there was a silversmiths; he said, he worked at one - we walked on, and I asked how far she was going to take me - she then asked him the value of them; he said 30l., but we should not get more than 28l. if we went to sell them; she then told me, if I would go with her into the country, she would give me the half part of it - I said I could not; she then told me to give her my ring, and what money I had, and wait at the end of Fleet-market, and she would come to me in an hour and a half, and bring me 12l. I gave her my ring and 4s. 6d., and waited for her till three or four o'clock, but she did not come - I met her again on the following Monday, near the bridge; she crossed the road when she saw me - I crossed after her, and asked her for my ring and my money; she said she did not know what I meant - but I insisted upon having them, or I would raise the street; she had another young man with her then - she said if I would not make a noise, I should have them; we walked on till we met the young man whom I had seen the first time. I asked her again for my property, and she said if I would hold my tongue, I should have them in a few minutes; and the two young men went for it, but they did not return - I waited twenty minutes or half an hour; then called assistance, and gave her into custody.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received charge of the prisoner on the 24th; she said if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100122"/>would let her go the money and ring would be brought to the watch-house; I said that would not do for me, I must lock her up; a woman came to see her; I inquired what she wanted - she very much wished to see her alone; I said I suspected she was a party to the felony, and I must lock her up; she then handed me this ring, this half-crown, a shilling, and some halfpence, and wanted me to let the prisoner go, but I detained them both. The prisoner gave her name as Burke at the watch-house; I ascertained that the ring had been pawned at a shop in Shoe-lane: I went there, and the pawnbroker described the prisoner's person - he knew her by the name of Clifford; she represented herself as a widow.</p>

No; I have retired for awhile; I left the Hole-in-the-wall last February; a short time before this happened I was indicted with the prisoner through a troublesome neighbour; I did not tell the prisoner that he was to bear the charge of the indictment; I paid 12s. for Mr. Thompson, who had bailed him; while I was gone to the Nore the prisoner absconded from his bail; I did not stop one farthing of his money for that indictment; I have not treated this as a matter of account; I did receive different sums of money to the amount of 1l. 9s., but I did it with a view to apprehend the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you receive these sums as part of payment? A. Yes; in part of the 4l. of silver.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had there not been an indictment against him? A. Yes; he did not abscond on account of that; we went down to the Nore - we heard he had been taken up, and that Mr. Thompson had bailed him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there any servant maid in the house? A. No; no person but me and Conner - he gets his breakfast when Mr. Waylett goes there in the morning; there is no bed in the house but his - I had not touched the door of communication to padlock it, for a month before perhaps; the door is on the second floor - I did not touch it the night before; a person could not have got in there without breaking the door, but that is not where they did get in - I did not see them get in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When were you there again? A. Between eight and nine o'clock next morning: there is a window, on the first staircase, which looks on the sky-light of the empty house, and that window was broken to let in two fingers to undo the button, and when that was open it would make an opening plenty large enough to admit the body of a man; I saw the padlock in the staple next morning.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it a glass door between the two houses? A. No; a wainscoat door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. For ought you know, not having pushed against the door, you cannot say whether it might not have been ajar? A. It is possible; I was up the staircase the night before, and the lock was in the staple - I am not positive of that; my attention was not particularly directed to it.</p>

I am the night officer I went to the house and saw the desk on the floor in the parlour; I waited there to protect the shop and then went to the watch-house with the prisoners - I went to the house again and saw the putty had been chipped round the glass of the door which leads from the show-room, up stairs; and the glass broken as if to admit a hand to get at the lock; I went down to the house again in the morning and saw a window on the staircase standing open; I looked through it and saw the mark of an iron heel, and a chalk mark on the leads which lead over the showroom to the empty house, which is a very short distance; I got out and went through an aperture into the empty house - it appeared to have been a window blocked up with wood; I got through it, and searched over every part of the empty house - I saw the door of communication between the two houses; it is lined with iron - I saw no marks of violence on it; the padlock was hanging in the staple, but not locked - I went into the privy and saw something like a bag on the soil, and we got up a bag containing these articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If a passer by had seen the door of communication as you did, they might have thought it was fast? A. I could not bring my mind to believe it was locked before; I could see nothing to induce me to believe it was locked - the door was open when I saw it, and the lock hanging in the staple; if the door had been ajar and I had not gone against it, or pushed it, and the lock had been in the staple, it might have deceived me.</p>
               <p>COURT to WOLSONCROFT. Q. Can you positively swear you saw that door at all that night - did you not take it for granted it was locked - can you swear it at all? A. Yes; and I saw nothing particular about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you examine the door particularly? A. No; I went within about two yards of it; I did not particlarly give it a thought - I might give a glance at it as I passed I cannot tax my memory.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see the padlock? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there any glass over the shop? A. Yes; the button was turned in the staircase window of Mr. Waylett's house; they had stept over the sky-light over the shop to come to the window - nothing was done to the sky-light - it is but small.</p>
               <p>BARRETT'S Defence. We were coming from Greenwich fair and had had a little drink: we came down Fish-street-hill, and saw the door of the empty house open - we went in and laid down; some person shut the door while we were there, and we could not find our way out again.</p>
               <p>One Witness gave the prisoner Barrett a good character.</p>

I saw the prisoner in my shop on the 13th of March: I was serving a customer at the opposite counter, and I heard McNab say to her, "What have you done with that roll in your hand" - she said, "I had none"- he said "You had," and he came round the counter - she came back from the counter, and I heard this roll of ribbon drop; I took it up; it is mine - she was about two feet from the counter, and I think it impossible that it could fall from the counter.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Reid - the prisoner came in, and asked for some ribbon; I showed her a drawer of ribbons, but there were none to please her - I showed her a second, and she took up a roll of ribbon in her hand - at that instant another customer came into the shop, to whom I spoke without turning aside, and while I did that, I saw the prisoner roll the ribbon up in her handkerchief - she laid down a child on the counter while she did it, and then took it up, and held the ribbon in her hand under the child's clothes - I showed her some other ribbons, and then I charged her with having that - she denied it - I went round the counter - she went back, and I heard the ribbon fall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she express any surprise, as if the ribbon fell from the child? A. Yes, and she appealed to two people in the shop, if they had seen it in her hand; they said they saw it fall, but had not seen it in her hand.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, declaring that she had not touched the ribbon, but that her child must have thrown it on the ground.</p>

            . On Saturday, the 1st of March, I was coming down Beech-street, and saw the prisoner and another young man - I thought they were going to do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100125"/>something; I waited and saw the prisoner leave the other at the corner of Beech-street - and in less than five minutes he came back with these kettles in an apron; the other crossed over to him - they went down King's Head-court; I went to them, and asked them what they had got; the other said he had brought them from his master, in Barbican; I said "It is but a little way, let us go there;" we went on; I said, "Where is it?" - he said he did not know, and I detained them; they had been left somewhere, for they had not them in their possession when I first saw them, and he had not time to go to Holborn.</p>
