                  </hi>. I am an agent, and live in Carnaby-street—on 27th May, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was in Long-acre, going home, and as I crossed over from Covent-garden, the prisoner seemed to come out of a house with two women—Williams placed his hands on my waistcoat pockets—I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him away, saying, "You have made a mistake"—he again in a more determined manner placed his hands upon me a second time, and I more violently shoved him away; I turned to walk away, and received a blow on the back of my neck from McCarthy, and at the same time felt his hand on my coat tail pocket; I turned round and knocked him down—I had a full opportunity of seeing both the prisoners, and am certain of them—I walked away down Long-acre, and when I got into St. Martin's-lane, I heard footsteps running after me, and the two men and two women saying, "That is him"—some of them ran on one side of the street and some on the other—not wishing to go up the dark street, I stood at the corner of St. Martin's-lane, and Williams halloed out to McCarthy, <hi rend="italic">"Jack,</hi> that is him; give it to him," and he <hi rend="italic">squared</hi> up to me—as I was defending myself Williams tried to come to this side and attack me also, and the women were about me—I halloed for the police, and a gentleman came up, Mr. Fichon, who saw all the latter part of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, at 25, Duke-street, Aldgate—the pri<lb/>soner came to work at my house—he was there about the 18th of last month—he was there about two months; not exactly in my employment—he used to be downstairs, to do anything—on 18th May I sent him on an errand—he did not come back—I never saw him again till I saw him in custody—I missed a Crimean medal and a coat—I missed a good many things before that—I did not take any notice of it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the coat I missed—it was hanging on a row in the bedroom when the prisoner went on this errand—that room was not locked up—he could have gone there if he wished—I have not seen the medal; it was in a little tin-box in the drawer, in the same place where the coat was—my wife had the medal in her hand that day—I also saw the coat the same day—I know this to be the coat I lost; I told all the marks that were on it before I looked at it—it is worth about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 371). I was on duty near Victoria-park about half-past 6 on Sunday evening, June the 1st—from information I received I took the prisoner in custody for stealing a coat and Crimean medal—a friend of the prosecutor's saw him in the park, and followed him out—he was wearing the coat—I told him he must go with me to the station for stealing a coat and a medal—he spoke to the party who gave me the information, and said he could not prove it—he gave me an address—I went to his lodging, but he had left there about a fortnight—he lodged there for about two nights, but left about 18th May, the time the robbery was committed—I cannot find the medal.</p>

               <p>at Billingsgate-market, and going through Petticoat-lane, I bought it there.

I broke the bottle, and went down to Billingsgate. I had not been there fire minutes before a man asked me if I would carry some winkles for him to Smithfield; I said I would, and I never went back to the other place any more. I left Cohen's lodging-house because they said it was going to be broken up, and I lodged at 64, Wimpole-street, Spital-fields. When the prosecutor's friend met me I was against a new drinking fountain; he asked me about a medal first, and never about a coat. He asked me if I would walk down as far as some house. I said I would. I had a pipe, and when we got out of the house he said, "Oh! there is the gentleman; I will go over to him." I said, "I will go with you," and then he gave me in charge to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Philip Sharer, of 11, Grange<lb/>crescent, Sunderland, and am staying at 60, Thornhill-square, Islington—on Wednesday, 28th May, I was going to Greenwich with my son—he took the tickets and paid for them, and we were waiting for the boat, on the wooden quay at Upper Thames-street, when I felt my pocket touched very slightly—I turned round and saw the prisoner Davi just turning on his heel away from me—he walked away, and my son came up; he had left me a moment and it was while he was away that I felt my pocket touched—when I felt the touch I put my hand in my pocket and found my purse gone—I said to my son, "My pocket has been picked; that person was close to my side, he must have taken it away"—I pointed Davi out to my son, and said, "We must keep him in view; we must not let him escape"—we walked up the pier and when he saw us following him he turned and went on to a boat that was waiting there—I spoke to an elderly gentleman that was near, and told him, and we went on board the boat—I did not see him on board the boat; I just looked on board and saw he was not there—when I came back the gentle<lb/>man had told the captain of the steamboat of it—when I came back I saw Davi in the cabin looking out of the window—I saw him turn his back and cast a look under his hat, and I saw that it was him—it was the cabin window of the boat I had seen him go into—I pointed him out immediately to the mate, and the mate said there were two persons on board—he was given into custody—the purse contained three sovereigns, one half-sovereign, two florins, and six shillings in silver—I believe there was a penny and a piece of gold beater's skin besides—Davi was the only person near me at the time I felt my pocket touched.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother, and am a private in the 2d Battalion of the Military Train—I have been in the Army about seven years—I have been in China, and arrived in England about 24th March, having been away two years and nine months—I got my leave on 8th April, and saw my brother on 10th—he was living at 24, Queen-street, Pimlico—I met him at my mother's house at Hackney, on 10th—we went to Mr. Scott's, and had some ale—I went home with him to Pimlico, stopped with him all night, and next morning about half-past 6 I left him—he joined me again about half-past 11 in Hackney, and we kept company till half-past 11 at night—I did not lose sight of him for a moment—we were at Mr. Brown's, the Lamb, in the afternoon, playing at skittles—we did not go out of Hackney till half-past 5 o'clock—I will swear he was not out of Hackney till half-past 11—I did not see him on 12th—I wrote to him on 13th, and saw him in the afternoon—I saw him at our house on 15th, in the evening, at my mother's house, at Hackney—on 16th he met me again at my mother's house, at a quarter past 12—we had some dinner, and stopped in till 2 o'clock—we then went to Mr. Scott's, and had some ale—we commenced gambling, and stopped till 4 o'clock—we then went to Shoreditch, and, being without money, my brother went and pledged my father's gold pencil-case for me, in the name of James Smith, Walworth, at Mr. Francis Cotton's—I remained with my brother till half-past 12—the next morning we went to Mr. Brown's, the Lamb, and to Mr. Scott's, both in Hackney, and we also called at the Catherine Wheel—we never went over the water at all, nor did my brother, but he did afterwards, about 24th or 25th, after, a place at the Camberwell Brewery—he did not go over there on any of these dates—he was dressed in a grey coat, dark overalls, and a hat—I did not see him in an Inverness cape; he could not bear to see anybody dressed in one.</p>

               <p>since April for a living to my knowledge—my brother came to our house on 16th, a little before dinner time; that is, 1 o'clock—he partook of dinner, and we went out and went to Mr. Scott's, gambling—I had the money—I had saved it up while I was on a foreign station—we both joined in the gambling—I paid for the prisoner—I first saw in the papers that my brother was in custody—I cannot say what date it was that he was taken in custody, but it was 18th May I saw it in the paper—I afterwards received a letter—I cannot say when it was, but I remember the 11th and 16th by the circumstances which occurred; for instance, pledging my father's gold pencil-case on 16th, and the 11th was the first time I had seen my brother for four years—I saw him on the 10th, but we stopped together till the pawning on the 11th—we slept together in the same bed, at 49, Queen-street, Pimlico; that is the only reason I remember the 11th—I am positive it was not the 12th—on 9th I got my furlough, and on 10th I found out where my mother lived—I went to Tottenham, wrote a letter, and had got the stamp nearly fixed on it, when he came—I cannot say how I came not to see him on 12th—he did not assign any reason for not coming—the 11th and 16th are not the only days I was with him all day; we were together all day on Good Friday and Easter Sunday—on Good Friday, he and his wife and a friend of his stopped at our house the whole day—we were enjoying ourselves in our own house, and he did not leave till 9 o'clock at night—I did not go before the Magistrate to prove what I have proved to-day—to the best of my knowledge, it is six<lb/>teen days since I first heard it was desirable to prove where my brother was on 11th—it was after he was committed for trial—I saw by the newspapers that he had been taken in custody, but did not go before the Magistrate, be<lb/>cause I did not know I should be required—it did not state the whole of the facts—I did not communicate with my brother when I found he was in custody, and have not done so to this moment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Smith, and keep the George public-house, Broadway, Hammersmith—on 10th May, about 11 o'clock, the prisoners came there with a woman—one of these men, I do not know which, called for a pint of beer, and paid for it with a shilling—I do not know which put the shilling down, or whether it was the same man that called for the beer—I put it in the till, and served the beer—they drank it—there was no other shilling in the till—I gave them the change—Leary took it up—they all went out, but they called for a pot of beer before they went out, and had it, and the woman paid for it with another shilling, which I afterwards found was not good—they then went out together, and all came in again afterwards with another man in plain clothes, and Ryan called for a bottle of soda water for Leary to drink—Ryan gave me a two-shilling piece, which I tried in the detector and found bad—I returned it, and said, "This is not good"—he said he thought it was; he had only just taken it from his landlady for his billet-money, and if it was not good, he must take it back again to where he received it; but Leary said, "Give it to me; I will take care of it," and he gave it him—a half-crown was then tendered by Ryan, and I gave him the two shillings I had previously taken—I had put them in the till—Ryan looked at them, and while I was giving the coppers, he said, "Oh! I think I will not change the half-crown;" and the woman said, "Oh! if you say you have no change, I have some small change; I will pay for it for you," and she paid with fourpence in coppers—they parted without drinking the whole of the soda water, and it struck me directly that I had taken two shillings of them, and I thought I would see</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live at 259, Pentonville-road—on Monday evening, 27th May, between 6 and 7 o'clock, I was on the leads at the back of my house, which overlooks the new station—Mr. Smith was with me—my attention was directed by some quarrelling to the ribs, which were from sixty to seventy feet from where I was standing—I could distinctly see what was taking place there—the first I saw was the prisoner hit Driscoll on the side of the face three or four times—Driscoll defended himself with a <hi rend="italic">podger</hi> in his hand, and hit the prisoner with it on the arms, as he struck him, and I heard him tell the prisoner to come below and fight it out—I heard a voice come from the part, but where it came from I cannot my, "I will throw you over," or "pitch you over"—I am not sure of the words, but that was the effect of it—I was almost on a level with them; it came from near where the prisoner was; it came from off the ribs—I would not swear that it did not come from the prisoner, and I would not swear that it did—after hearing that, I saw the prisoner lean forward, and the two were close together—the prisoner raised himself up and held Driscoll by the shoulders, and he was lifted off the girder so that his legs came right up; both legs came above the girder and he dropped so (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>), with his arms out, and his feet down, so that his feet came first to the ground—I saw his feet reach the ground.</p>

               <p>can't say whether he hit him on the face or not—I saw him hit him on the arms, but not anywhere else—I did not see any blood on the prisoner's face—I don't think I was too far off to have seen it—I did not see Driscoll hit him on the head; he might have done so, but I did not see him—I could see the other workmen on the ground below at this time—there were several there—they were calling out to the men, telling them to leave off—the voice that said he would pitch or throw him over came from off the girder—I can undertake to say it did not come from the men below, and that it was not, "he will pitch him over"—I could tell whether a voice came out of the cut<lb/>ting or off the top—I am certain it did not come from the men on the ground—there were men below calling out, one man in particular—I can't exactly say what he called out—I heard him hallo out and tell them to be quiet; the principal thing he said was, "Leave off quarrelling up there;" but I can't tell exactly what the words were.</p>

I am a cheesemonger and grocer, and live in North-road, Highgate—on the afternoon in question I was with Mr. Downton on the leads of his house, and my attention was directed to the girders by some quarrelling—from where I stood I could distinctly see what was going on the girder—when I first came on the leads I saw the deceased and the prisoner struggling together, striking at each other; they were face to face, straddle-legged across—after they had struggled for a second or two they divided, and sundry words passed between them—I could not say what; they were oaths and quarrelsome language—I then saw Gregory strike at Driscoll with his right hand—he then struck him in some part, from the position I was in I could not say where, and then a man who stood at the back of Gregory threw a rope—when the rope was thrown a word was said that they would fall off if they did not desist quarrelling—when the rope was thrown over Driscoll he appeared to be very exhausted—he threw up his arms and threw the rope off as it fell over his shoulders, and then made a thrust at Gregory with an iron bolt or something in his hand; with that Gregory took hold of Driscoll, lifted him off from the girder, and let him fall down—I saw him fell—I should consider that he took hold of him by the collar and under the arm to lift him—I saw it—I saw him take him by the collar and some part of the body.</p>

I am assistant-warder at Millbank Penitentiary—the prisoner was a convict confined there on 19th May—I was going into his cell about 8 o'clock in the evening, as he was in the act of leaving it with his day's work—I went in to remove it, but he was bringing it out into the corridor—I was entering the cell to see that it was safe, when I received a blow from some sharp instrument which the prisoner had in his left hand, and struck me with it on the left temple, inflicting a wound from which the blood gushed out—I then received a clenched-fist blow from the prisoner's right hand, which rendered me insensible for a few seconds—the prisoner closed on me, we fell, and he inflicted several cutting wounds on my neck when I was on the ground, one of which cut through my jacket collar, which was the most severe—I then partly regained my legs, but my right leg became entangled with my key-chain—I fell again, and the prisoner in<lb/>flicted a blow between my eyebrows, which extended nearly to my temple from my nose, and also a slight wound in the corner of my left eye—he also bit my left cheek, and bit the top of my finger, which deprived me of the use of it for some time, and I have lost the nail—the struggle lasted from five to seven minutes, and I received several other wounds not of a serious nature—Minchin, the warder, was there from the beginning—I had said nothing to irritate the prisoner—I spoke to him about an hour before, and said, "Smith, come, get on with your work," and he said, "All right master"—his work was preparing cord for making mats—he had no instru<lb/>ment to do it with—the surgeon dressed my wounds, and I was disabled for sixteen days.</p>

               <p>delivery, and after I had done so, I went to the district office, and the prisoner was brought to me there about 11 o'clock—that allowed time for those letters to reach their destination in the ordinary course—Crocker, who brought him in, produced nine letters to me, all unopened, among which I found two of those which I had made up—I asked the prisoner why he had not delivered them—he said, "Some I do not know, and others were not answered," meaning that some of the ad<lb/>dresses he did not know, and others he could get no answers at the doors—I told him I had seen him go to Mr. Garrett, the butcher's, at the corner of Weston-place, and afterwards saw him go to the top of Brewer-street, or nearly so, and I said, "What became of you after<lb/>wards, did you go into Agar-town?"—he said, "Well, I did not"—Agar-town, is the part of his district in which the letters were to be delivered—I directed Crocker to go and search the prisoner's house, and he returned with nearly 400 letters and a few papers—the prisoner was present—none of them had been opened—three or four of the letters contained money, and some, keys—Crocker told the prisoner that they were found in a box under his bed, and asked how he accounted for it—he made no reply—they bore post-marks of February, March, and April—there was among them a letter addressed, "Mrs. Clements, 4, Perry-street, Old St. Pancras-road," bearing the London post-mark of 6th March—that is, I believe, in the prisoner's district—the contents of it are gone—I opened it at Bow-street; but as I opened three or four I do not recollect what this one contained—here are two addressed to Mrs. Lockie, 23, Weston-street, Somers-town—I do not recollect what this one contained; it bears the post-mark of 9th April, and the other of March 5th—here is a letter addressed, "Mrs. Horley, Duke of Clarence, Old St. Pancras-road," post-mark 15th April, and three addressed, "Miss Kidwell, 10, Aldenham-terrace," post-marks 19th February, 8th April, and 15th April.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier in the employment of the Post-office, and in the tame department at the prisoner—I have observed a peculiarity in his manner for the last few months: I could not help it—he seemed to assist in sorting letters, but he did not do anything; he was more in the way than anything else—I sorted his letters for him, for his district—he was competent to deliver them if I <hi rend="italic">set them in,</hi> but not otherwise; and I did it for him for four months, up to the last day—I had to write on the letters in pencil to show him more minutely which way to go—he appeared to me to have a great failing of memory—I had to put some letters in his right hand, and others in hit left; and I did the same for two more, and among these are letters and papers which I had written on; for instance, I put on one, "Opposite the Great Northern Railway"—he would have a good many letters for the workhouse, but there are none of them among the letters found at his house—I used to put these in one hand, and the work-house letters in the other, which were the bulk of his delivery—the average of his walk would be thirty-five letters, eight or nine of which were for the workhouse, and seven or eight for Cottam's iron foundry, and the others would be for private persons, poor people in the vicinity of Agar-town.</p>

               <p>before, and I went from my seat to his—he did not tell me that he had not been able to find any place the night before—he never told me that he had not delivered letters, merely that he had forgotten the address—I used to write on the letters in pencil, but not on those for the workhouse or Cot<lb/>tam's, though I used to make them into separate bundles—(<hi rend="italic">The witness locked through the 743 letters produced, and picked out several on which he had written in pencil</hi>).</p>

I am the wife of John King, a labourer, of 31, Charles-street, Westminster on Sunday, 13th April, I was in my room with my husband, cleaning myself and putting my things on, when the prisoner, who is my grandson, came in at the door—he had been in before, and left, and he came in again—I saw him coming across the room with something like a knife or a razor in his hand, and I knew it was murder directly—I shouted out, and he struck me across the free directly—I fell, and put the table over me, because I was afraid he would cut my throat—he cut me again across the head, and beat my head with a stick—the doctor came and stopped the blood—the bones of my head are still sore—I bled wonderful—a doctor from Parliament-street came in—I was taken to the hospital, and was these seven weeks—I had had no quarrel with my grandson, but a week or two before, when I was talking about May-day, he said that I should not be alive on May-day, but I did not take any notice of it before he threatened my life—somebody told me that he threatened my life before he tried it—he said so to his mother.</p>

I had no intention of taking her life; if I had wished to do so I would have done it when there was nobody in the room, and I should have locked the door. I did not intend to take her life; I only intended to draw some of her blood. It is evident she is connected with the devil. There have been persons connected with the devil who have done things of witchcraft, though it is not believed in at this day. If you can prove to me that she does not work by devilish arts, I am willing to forfeit my life for her's.</p>

I am a surgeon, and late house-surgeon at West<lb/>minster Hospital—on Sunday, 13th April, Mary King was brought there on a stretcher covered with blood—I immediately admitted her, and found on her face three contusions which must have been caused by some blunt instrument—on the left side was an incision extending across the cheek to past the ear, and another extending from the top of the head down to the same place—those two wounds might have been inflicted by a razor—there was a great collection of blood under the scalp—there was very great danger, in consequence of which I sent to the Magistrate to take her evidence—(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows</hi>)—"The latter part of my grandmother's evidence, about my saying she would not be alive in May, is false; she is a woman not fit to live; she has dealings with, and is connected with, the devil; I am certain of it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Why I did shed her blood, was because she should not have that power over me which she has done with her arts; two hundred years ago I know such a woman would have been put to death without any ceremony about it. The reason I took upon me to revenge my own wrongs, was because I expected I should get very little redress from the law, because people consider themselves so much enlightened in these days that they do not believe in such a crime, but I do believe in it.</p>

"You did steal it, for saw this bow drop from year hand"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him, and a common brass ring—he gave me a false address.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Meacher, a chemist, of 105, Craw<lb/>ford-street, Marylebone—on Thursday, 13th February, the prisoner came; I do not know what she asked for, but she purchased a black draught of me—I do not remember refusing to give her anything, or that she asked for one thing and I gave her another—the black draught I gave her was one of many similar draughts; we keep them all ready made up in a drawer—the bottle in which the draught was, was brought back by a boy the same even<lb/>ing; with a cup or a glass; it was like an egg-cup—I have had experience in mixing medicines; there is nothing in black draught that would burn a person's mouth or a sheet—the result of mixing sulphuric acid with a black draught would be that it would cause it to become very hot about a minute after mixing—if you mix anything with oil of vitriol it becomes hot—it is a matter of common experience that if you mix water with sulphuric acid great heat is generated; it is sometimes almost hot enough to break the glass vessel containing it—I have had no experience of the effect of sulphuric acid on the mouth, but I have seen it on the skin—it burns the skin, and if thrown on linen in a diluted state it causes it to be destroyed; it leaves a kind of dirt-coloured stains, which become quite rotten, so as to leave holes in the place—the black draught that left our shop was one of the ordinary draughts; there was nothing in it to discolour linen or to cause a burning heat in the mouth.</p>

Q.</hi> When, the bottle was brought back to you by the chemist, did you taste it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—it did not burn my mouth—I both compounded and bottled the mixture myself—there is no recognised formula in the Pharmacopeia for black draughts; every chemist makes it up accord<lb/>ing to his own choice—it always contains sulphate of magnesia—I do not think that resembles any other sulphate when in small crystals—I know what sulphate of zinc is—I do net think sulphate of zinc and sulphate of magnesia, in small crystals, could be mistaken by a person who knew them both, but they might by a person who did not understand it—sulphate of zinc is poison—there were about a dozen. bottles of black draught in the drawer when I gave the bottle to the prisoner—they were all made from one</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the <hi rend="italic">D</hi> division of police, and live at 77, Connaught-terrace, Edgeware-road—I have had experience in cases of administering poisons—on 15th February I was consulted by Inspector Burroughs—he was accompanied by Mrs. Carnell—I looked in her mouth; her lips, tongue, and the inside of her cheeks were covered with white patches, the probable cause of which was, in my opinion, sulphuric acid, which is commonly known as oil of vitriol, the effect of which upon the tissues of the mouth would be to produce white patches of the description I saw—they could not be produced by a draught containing sulphate of zinc, nor would that burn holes if brought into contact with linen, but sulphuric acid would, even if very much diluted, and the same if not diluted, only sooner—if sulphuric acid was thrown into a glass containing the ordinary black draught, the result would be that it would get warmer till it became quite hot—that is the result of the chemical combination—the sulphuric acid has a great affinity for the water, and, in the act of com<lb/>bination, heat is evolved—the inspector gave me some pieces of a sheet, which I analysed, and came to the conclusion that they had been rotted by sulphuric acid—I called next day to see Mrs. Carnell, and saw one or two spots on the fire-irons—they had a grayish rust, which, I think, was made by sulphuric acid—it seemed like sulphate of iron, which would be the usual result of throwing sulphuric acid on iron—from the inspection I made of Mrs. Carnell, I have no doubt what was the cause of the appearances she presented, and I thought it was that when I saw the sheets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When the policeman brought Mrs. Carnell, I believe he said that he thought she had taken something deleterious? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he asked me to look at her mouth—I cannot remember whether he showed me the pieces of sheet first, but, to the best of my belief; I saw her mouth first—it was from the appearance of her mouth that I thought the linen might have been burned—I think I might have seen the linen, because he had a bundle of linen in his hand as he came in, a sheet, or something of that sort—I thought it was sulphuric acid from the appearance of her mouth—there are some disorders which will produce white patches on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186206160070"/>
               <p>mouth, but not many—the bowels being out of order would not produces them, though that might produce a very foul tongue and blisters in the mouth, but they would be a transparent white, and not an opaque white—nothing would produce patches like that—I know the disease called thrush, that sometimes appears in persons who are in a very low state of health—they have patches on the mouth—if a person has been greatly suffering from diarrhea, so that the stomach becomes lowered, thrush may ensue—sulphuric acid is colourless, and has no smell when pure—when it is thrown on anything, it smells—when thrown on linen, it decomposes it, and there is a sour smell—the linen brought to me smelt, not of black draught, but of sulphuric acid—I did not examine the whole of the sheets—a piece of a sheet was brought to me, and I saw the remainder of it before the Magis<lb/>trate—my opinion is that the inspector brought the whole sheet, and I took a portion of it, but it might not be so—it was in pieces, because it was rotten—I had never seen Mrs. Carnell before—besides sulphuric acid, there are a hundred things that would produce spots of rust on iron, all the mineral acids—I did not apply any test to those spots; they were of a grayish white.</p>

I am courier to a Russian general, who is now in Paris—I live at 31, Golden-square—on 30th May I called at No. 6, West-street, Golden-square—the prisoner's wife lives there—I knocked at the door—a little girl opened it; then the prisoner struck me with a knife—he tried to strike me in the breast, and I caught his hand and dashed it down, and he struck me on the forehead—he was inside, behind his daughter—I saw some<lb/>thing in his hand, shining like a looking-glass; it was a knife nearly a foot long with a white handle—he did not say anything to me before he struck me, nor I to him—I was sober—I had no time to make any inquiry of the little girl before he struck me—I ran into a little court after I was struck, and I received a blow on the head and I fell to the ground—the blow was from a man, I do not know who, or whether he was an acquaintance of the prisoner's—there were five or six of them kicking me—I had never seen the prisoner before in my life—I lost a great deal of blood—I went to a surgeon—when I took the plaster off next day the point of a knife came out, which I gave to Mr. Guy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and carry on my profession in Golden-square—the prosecutor called on me on 31st May—he was suffering from a wound in the cheek—I examined it—it went from the front part towards the interior; towards the back—I should describe it as an incised vertical wound, likely to have been caused by a knife—it was very deep but not very long—it could scarcely have been pro<lb/>duced by a fall on the kerb, because the part that was injured was in the gums, towards the molar teeth; if it had been a fall it must have struck directly on the part.</p>

I am a boat builder, and live at 4, Mill-place, in the parish of Lime House—on the night of 11th May, I was the last person up in the house—the doors and windows were all safe—I particularly noticed the landing window, because I had an engagement with a friend that evening, and I looked out of the landing window to see whether he had a light in his window—I can swear that it was shut—next morning I found it open, and found a piece of candle, a knife, and a piece of a bolt—I came down about 6 o'clock—my father made the alarm—I missed a neck<lb/>tie from my room—I had hung it across the glass the night before.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>silver—I then looked for the gold and found that it was gone—the prisoner and Mr. Crowther had then left—I then spoke to the bank clerk—there was only one clerk behind the counter though there were other clerks in the bank—with the exception of Mr. Crowther and the prisoner, there were no other persons near me while I was counting the silver—on the Wednesday in the next week I saw the prisoner at Bow-lane station, and selected him from a number of persons.</p>

I am a member of the firm of Rose and Crowther, shipwrights, of Gun Dock, Wapping—on 17th May I was in the Unity Bank, and saw Morris at the counter, counting money—I saw the prisoner speak to Morris—he was close behind him, and said, "Do they change Irish notes here, or can I get change for an Irish note here?"—he repeated the question a second time, and I turned round, thinking it was addressed to me, and said, "What did you say?"—he repeated the question to me—and I said, "I think not, but I will ask the clerk at the counter"—I did so, and he said, "No; but you will get them changed at Spielman's, in Lombard-street"—the prisoner then left the bank, and I followed him, the boy still counting the silver—as I left, I said to the prisoner, "I think you are a stranger; if you will allow me to show you, I am crossing into Lombard-street"—we crossed Cannon-street, side by side—he said, "I will not trouble you now; good morning," and I went about my business—we had only walked across Cannon-street—he went upwards, as if towards London-bridge—I went up Nicholas-lane and Abchurch-lane, one of the lanes opposite the bank—I saw no one but the prisoner near the boy—there were other clerks at the bank besides the one I spoke to—I heard of the robbery the same evening, and went to Bow-street police-station—I was shown ten or twelve persons in a room, and picked the prisoner out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ham dealer, of 239, Shoreditch—on 13th May I went to Smith and Payne's bank to meet Mr. Freeman—he was standing outside when I got there; and I saw a short stout person within</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186206160085"/>
               <p>one or two yards of Freeman, and who was afterwards taken in custody, named Harper—I believe I said to Mr. Freeman, "Hand us over the money, Charley;" and we both went into the bank—they were both standing there with their backs to the wall—inside the bank, Mr. Freeman had a bag containing a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, eight tens, and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—I took that money and went to Mastermans, in Nicholas-lane—I did not notice when I went out whether Harper was outside—I went to the last desk but one to take up a bill—there was no person at all at that part of the counter; I noticed that particularly—I opened my bag, took out the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and eight tens, and was counting out 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, when I received a sharp touch on this shoulder, as if it was a friend, not as a stranger would touch me—I turned rapidly round and saw the prisoner—in his right hand he held a slip of paper and he seemed to cover me with his left, as he was so close to me; his left hand seemed to pass to the back of me—he stood within two or three inches of my face—he spoke in an assumed tone, I think, saying, "Sir, can you tell me where I can change a draft?"—I believe those were the words—it was a sort of drawl—I do not know who he imitated, but it was as if he was trying to speak like a foreigner, I think—I said, "I do not know; the next desk"—I thought he was very rude, and I answered him irritably—I am positive no other persons were near me—there were no clerks behind the counter at that part—I turned fully round, looked at my notes, and missed the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note which I had just placed on the counter—I did not like to charge him immediately—I folded up the other notes, put them in the bag, and went out after him, but he was gone—I immediately gave information to the police—I ascertained the number of the note within a few minutes—on the following Tuesday, 20th May, I was shown fifteen or twenty strangers, and immediately pointed out the prisoner and Harper—I am positive of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>May, about 1 o'clock in the night, I saw Courtney and the prisoner in High-street, Wapping, near the Thames Tunnel, pushing each other and quarrelling—two other men were with them, of whom Henley, who does not appear, was one—they were all intoxicated—the prisoner and the deceased took off their jackets and commenced to fight—Courtney was knocked down twice, and the second time he said that he had lost a sixpence, and would not fight any more till it was found—the prisoner was struck several times by the deceased—he said that the deceased had got the best of it, and the deceased said that the prisoner was bound to fight him—the prisoner knocked him down a second time, and then he went back seventeen paces, struck him in the face, and his teeth were knocked out—he said that his ancle was sprained, and he could not fight any more—the deceased struck him again on the chest and ribs, and his head went against the palings—Courtney tried to defend himself from the blows, and a friend of his got between them, but was pushed away, and then the prisoner drew a knife from his pocket and struck the deceased with it shut, I believe—he struck him several more blows, and how the knife got open I cannot say, but it must have, or he would not have been stabbed—I saw blood flow, and Henley got hold of Cochrane and put him down—he said, "For God's sake, Courtney, I hope you are not dead"—he made several strong observations—I held his hands, and a policeman came and took the knife out of his left hand—I went with them to the station, and as we went along the prisoner seemed very sorry, and he ran with us to get a doctor—at the time the prisoner struck the deceased he said, "If I am to fight you, you b—, I will fight you with this," and I think he showed him the knife to intimidate him—a man came in between them, but was kicked, and was obliged to hop away—the prisoner was endeavouring to avoid the fight for nine or ten minutes—he retreated seventeen paces; I measured it—he was stopped by a paling—the deceased got him against the paling, and struck him and knocked a tooth out—the deceased was a very powerful man, much stronger than the prisoner—he is what they term a <hi rend="italic">rough,</hi> which is a man who can go and beat another man who does not understand the pugilistic system—I saw the commencement of the transaction—I did not see the prisoner struck on the stomach, but I saw him struck on the chest—he said two or three times that his uncle was sprained—the prisoner ran as far as he could, and the deceased was striking him on both sides.</p>

On Wednesday, May 28th, at a quarter to 2, I was in Langham-street—I heard the sound of the breaking of glass in Great Tichfield-street—I ran towards it, and met the prisoner and another man running very fast—I was about to stop the prisoner, and he ran into 35, Langham-street—as I was in the act of taking him he shot across from me—I chased him up Great Tichfield-street, and sprang my rattle—he was stopped by a civilian at the corner of Wells-street—I chased the other man a little way up Wells-street and lost him—I then turned back to the prisoner—I found him in the custody of another policeman—I told him be must go back with me and see what was the matter—I went and examined the houses in Great Tichfield-street, and found the fanlight of No. 84 broken; I roused the landlord—the prisoner said it was not him; he had done nothing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). I went down to Leicester and saw the prisoners—I saw Cotton first—I asked him his name—he said, "Daniel Cotton"—I asked him if he had consigned two quarters of beef to Mrs. H. Matthews, of Newgate-market—he said he had, and had been for the account—I told him the meat had been seized and condemned as unfit for human food, that I was a detective officer of London, and had come to make inquiries for the purposes of the prosecution; that he could give me any explanation he chose, but that if he did do so I should use it against him—he had not been served with a condemnation note; I found it in the office of Messrs. Chaplin and Horne, and handed it to him—he said at first he would not take it, but afterwards he said that I had served it, and he might as well have it—I asked him from whom he had the meat—he refused to tell me—he said he did not have the other side, and refused to say whether it was sold for human food—he said he considered it fit for human food; it had been killed fairly, slaughtered, and that was enough—I saw Hill on Monday—I told him he need not tell me anything unless he liked—he is a jobbing butcher; Cotton is a labourer, but he buys meat at a slaughter-house in Leicester—I took down in writing what Hill said to me, and he signed it afterwards—this is it—he said, "On 27th March, Daniel Cotton, who lives near Russell-square, Leicester, asked me to send a side of beef to H. Matthews, Newgate-market," here showing the tally on the hamper—I pro<lb/>duced this label to him—he said, "I am obliged to go out of town, will you oblige me by giving the beef to Robert Denns, Chaplin and Horne's man?" that he stated it was a young bullock, and looked as if it had been slaughtered—he said he could eat such beef, but he should not like to do so, it was a bit wet on the back—it looked as if it had been cast in the straw-yard, but was stuck in time—sometimes they are cast and cannot get up again, and struggle till they are in a dying state—he said "Robert Denns, one of the porters at the railway, came for the beef, and he let me have it"—the tally was on the hamper when Cotton asked him to send it—he said, "I think I wrote D. Cotton on it?"—I was a butcher originally—"a bit wet" means that it is rotten; but when it is wet on the back it is very bad—he said it was wet on the back—I asked what he meant directly.</p>

Cotton, Leicester," on the bill—I sent it to London by the railway that night—a few days afterwards Cotton came to the office of Chaplin and Horne—I did not see him in the office; I saw</p>

I am a surgeon at Woolwich—on Tuesday morning last, between 12 and 1 o'clock the prosecutor was brought to my surgery, suffering from three clean incised wounds, one on the back of the head and neck, one on the face, and another through the fleshy part of his hand; he was bleeding very freely indeed—they must have been inflicted with some very sharp instrument—a knife I should think would have caused them—the wound at the back of the neck was about four inches long</p>

I am a pupil in Mr. Taylor's establishment, and sleep in the first-floor room of No. 5, the next room to Mr. Taylor's, on the same floor—about 10 minutes or a quarter to 2 on Saturday morning, 17th May, I was awoke by hearing a crash of glass—I turned round and sat up in bed, and saw some one come up to my window and try to open it with his hands—he did not succeed in pushing it up—it was fastened—he then passed on towards No. 6—I was hardly awake—after a time I heard Mr. Taylor's voice, and a strange voice speaking—then I heard a noise of shut<lb/>ting a window or shutters, or something like that, and then I heard a strange voice say, "Oh, my fingers!"—I eventually got out of bed, went to the window, and spoke to Mr. Taylor—I afterwards examined my windows, and found the pane of glass next to the fastening broken, and I found a man's cap in my room, under the window—the window was open from the top—I cannot remember whether it was open from the bottom or not—the window that was fastened is another window—there are three in my room—it was the farthest from my bed that was broken—my bed is close to the window—I picked the cap up, and gave it to Mr. Taylor, and saw him give it to the policeman.</p>

Mr. Kitmer knows I was nearly drunk when he took me; the landlady knows I had nothing to do with the house; she has known me for twenty-five or twenty-six years. I was living near the place where she is now landlady. I got two calendar months unfortunately a little while ago because I did not have a license at Richmond for hawking; I have been trying to get my living.</p>

               <p>I told him I did not know, but I should name it to my master—he said "So help me God, I would run anywhere to put a fire out"—he came a second time to the bell when I had gone to the back of the premises in search a the other watchman—we both answered the gate, and it was the prisoner—he asked if it was all out safe and said, "You had better watch it"—I had been in the finishing-room about three-quarters of an hour before the fire—I only opened the door and looked in—I saw no light, and smelt nothing everything appeared safe; there was no gas alight—I know the prisoner's cottage very well; the front of it faces the finishing room.</p>

On the Sunday morning after the fire, I examined the spot between 9 and 10 o'clock with Mr. McMurray, and saw him find a piece of lucifer under the broken pane of the window at the end of the room next to the machine-room—I went over almost directly, and saw the prisoner at his house—I said, "You first discovered the fire?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Come across with me to Mr. McMurray's; as you were the first to discover the fire, I want to put some questions to you, but be careful what you say, for I do not know how it may turn out"—I asked him where he was last night—he said, "I was at the Old Sergeant at a raffle; I left there at 12 o'clock at night, went home, and went to bed about a quarter to 1. I awoke about twenty minutes to 3, looked out at my bedroom win<lb/>dow to see if it was time to get up, and saw a light on the tumbling weir" (that is at the back of Mr. McMurray's premises, nearly opposite to where the fire was) "I got up, ran round to Mr. McMurray's, and rang the gate bell; Malkham, the watchman, let me in, and gave me a pail, and I fetched two pails of water, and put the fire out"—I asked him what he had in his pockets, if he had any lucifers—he turned out his pockets, and there was a small piece of a lucifer, but not the same sort as that I found inside—I do not think it was like those which Nurse gave him the night before—I saw a fourteen round ladder of about eight or nine inches to a round, lying on some wood at the back of the prisoner's house—I received information and obtained these matches from Mrs. Maxsom, at Wimbledon, which, appear to correspond with this piece picked up by Mr. McMurray—the box is here—Bell's lucifer-match manufactory is not far from there—I enquired at the Old Sergeant, and they sell Bell's matches there—I got these matches (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the prisoner's mother; they are different—I searched the prisoner's</p>

I am the wife of Walter Sprankett, of 2, Herbert's-buildings, Waterloo-road, Southwark—on the 27th of May, I locked up all the house early in the evening, and closed the shutters—they were not fastened, but the window was down—I am positive I closed the door—I and my husband sleep upstairs, and an apprentice sleeps in the parlour—I was awoke about 4 o'clock in the morning by my apprentice, and saw the window wide open; the shutters were shut—I missed a clock off the sideboard, a box with six eggs, two pictures, a jug, and plate—these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—I value them at a sovereign, but my husband gave a sovereign for the clock alone, last winter—I saw the prisoner in custody at the door—I never saw the prisoner before—I did not allow her to take these things away—the prisoner said to the policeman, in, my presence, that another person took them and gave them to her.</p>

I said, "The things you took out of our house;" you said, "What house?" I said, "The pictures;" and then you pushed me away, put the things in the gutter, and ran away—I did not say, "You had better bring the pictures back"—you did not say, "The woman is gone on; I will go and bring her back"—you said that we should miss a chair, and we did miss it when we got home again.</p>

I keep the Flying Horse public house, Blackman-street—on Wednesday night, 7th May, the prisoners came and called for a pint of beer, for which one of them paid twopence; after a short time they called for half a quartern of gin, and one of them, I think it was Ann, gave me a counterfeit shilling—I put it into the till where there was no other shilling, and gave the change—they went away and I took all the money out of the till, there were two florins and the shilling I had received from the females—I put that money on one side, and left the bar in charge of Eliza Case—late in the evening I saw the prisoners again in my bar, and my wife said in their presence, "Here is another shilling, a bad one, which I have taken from these females"—one of them said, "You must not say anything against me"—I went directly to the till and found one counterfeit shilling, and three good sixpences—Miss Case pointed to the prisoner Ann, and said, "That female gave it me"—I went and got a police-constable and gave</p>

                  </hi>. I am a salesman, and live next door to Mr. Nye—on the morning this happened I saw the cart come up, and saw some of the sacks delivered—Mr. Nye passed me that morning while I was on my steps hanging out my goods—that was before the van came to the door—he went up to the Royal Albert public-house—I did not see him go in—I lost sight of him—I saw the cart go away; it passed my door—I did not see him again before it left—he was not there—he could not have been there in the way described by the policeman and Green without my seeing him—I am quite sure I saw it drive away, and two or three minutes after that I saw Nye come—I did not see the policeman come then.</p>

On 23d May, between 4 and 5 in the morning, I went to 33, Little Surrey-street, which is kept by a person named Clark—the prisoner lodges there—in a privy, in the back yards, I found a side of bacon weighing seventy-six pounds—I went upstairs to the</p>
