            . On the 4th of August he went out in the morning, leaving me and Wedgwood at home-Wedgwood went out at ten o'clock, and I went out between twelve and one, leaving no person in the house; I locked the front door, and put the key under the flower-pot in the front window-the house is in a garden-there is a gate, which I bolted, but it could easily be opened. No person saw me put the key under the flower-pot - I was in the habit of putting it there. I had told Wedgwood that I should put it there for her to find it-expecting she would return before me; the window is not very high from the garden, any person could get in at it. I returned in about an hour (before Wedgwood), and found the key in the same window where I had left it, the door was fastened, but the window was a little open-it was the same window where I had left the key. The flower-pot was not exactly in the same situation as I had left it. I went in and missed the watches immediately, I had seen them before I went out, and after my husband and his brother went out. I know the prisoner. I had not seen him about the house.</p>
               <p>JOHN SNOWSEL. I am a constable. I went to look for the prisoner from information which I received, and found him at Putney fair, on the 17th of August, about three o'clock - I knew him before; he lived about a hundred yards from me up to the time of the robbery, and then moved. I took him to the Police-Office - He was discharged. After that I went to Morritt's, the pawnbroker, in York-street, Westminster, and found a silver watch there-there was a duplicate with it; I had no particular reason for going there; Johnson produced it to me. I took the prisoner into custody a second time. I said nothing to indnce him to confess. He told his mother, in my presence, that the duplicates of the two watches were under a tile in the garden. He said the other was pledged at the corner of a court in Princes-street, Soho - I went and found a watch there; next day his mother gave me the duplicate.</p>
               <p>CHARLES JOHNSON. I am shopman to Mr. Morritt, who is a pawnbroker. On the 4th of August, the prisoner pledged a silver watch with me for 25s. about the middle of the day; I have our duplicate, it is in the name of

               <p>JOHN PURDIE. I am shopman to Mr. Bartrum, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in Princes-street. On the 5th of August, about half past seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner pledged a watch with me for 10s. he asked 1l. for it; he gave me the name of James Nash; the duplicate found is the one I gave him, it was written in my presence.</p>

I heard somebody breaking open the door; under the window there is a projection which prevented me from seeing anybody. I called out twice "who is there?" in half a minute three men ran from the back door. I fired and one of them fell, wounded; I immediately went into the garden and found the prisoner lying there, wounded in the back, I heard him cry out i nstantly; there were no other fire-arms discharged at that time. He implored mercy and requested me to send for a surgeon, which I did. A cooper's gimlet and a dark-lanthorn, with a candle in it, a phosphorus box and matches were found on him. I sent for a surgeon. When I suggested searching him, he said, "you find nothing but implements of house-breaking." He was taken to the hospital. He said that want drove him to that method of life, and I should not have shot him.</p>

On the 15th of September, about two o'clock in the morning, I was in bed, the watchman alarmed me by knocking at the door; I got up, went down, and found the cellar window, which goes under the street, open. I had been in the cellar at dusk, about six or seven o'clock. I had a candle with me when I went there - I went to shift the pipe; I locked the door when I came out. The flap had not been open for a week before. I missed nothing when I went into the cellar. I went into the street first, and then went down into the cellar from the house; I opened the cellar door, and then let the prisoner out through the house. Just as I was going to open the door, he said, "don't be alarmed, master, I will make no resistance." I knew him; he had lived about twenty months with me before. The wood-work of the wine-cellar door was cut away round the ock, and we found a large knife lying by the door - I took him to the watch-house-two small picklock keys were found upon him. When I returned from the watch-house, I found a tinder-box, a flint, a steel, and a candle, on one of the butts in the cellar; the candle was not burning; they are not mine, nor were they there the night before. Next morning I found two more skeleton keys in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In what way was the cellar window fastened - A. By a cross-bolt, and another bolt at the bottom. I saw it fastened the night before when I shut up, at half-past ten o'clock - I tried them. I had not seen the prisoner in my house for some days before. He has frequently been at my house, but not latterly; he lodged eight or ten months with me; when he lodged with me I kept my wine in that cellar.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was going down the street, about two o'clock in the morning, and found Mr. Homan's cellar window open; I had been round at half-past one o'clock, and am positive it was not open then - I gave the alarm. While Mr. Homan was coming down stairs I looked into the cellar, and saw one of the butts running, and the prisoner behind one of the casks; I am certain that he is the man. When Homan came down I had sprung my rattle; the other watchman guarded the window. I went into the house, and saw the prisoner come up the cellar stairs, and took him to the watch-house. When we took him there, the constable of the night took two small keys out of his pocket. We returned to the cellar, and found the other things; the winecellar lock was cut away.</p>

            , lodges, the prisoner was not at home when we got there - We only found some grocery there; we came down stairs, and went to No.15, the next house, to watch her return. In about an hour I saw her coming across the yard by herself - She had a basket in one hand and a bundle in the other; it was about three o'clock in the afternoon; she came into the room where we were; she put the basket in the cradle, and the bundle on the table; the officer told her what we had come about, searched her person, and found two Investigator's tickets, a bill of parcels, and a bill of exchange, which were mine, and were in the box when I put it in the cupboard - I saw them there half an hour before. Plank opened the bundle, which contained grocery; he asked her if the basket was her's? she said it was; he took a parcel of bank notes out of it, some cash, and a bill of exchange. I cannot speak to the cash (looks at the notes), they are the same I saw taken out of the basket. Here is a 1l. note which has the name of Mr. Thomas, Berwick-street, Soho; and another with the name of Crankwell, Wardour-street, for 1l.; another 10l. note, with the name of Jender, Berwick-street - they were all in my box at the time, and all have my shopman's handwriting on them. There is another 10l. note which has my own hand-writing on it. All the notes found in her possession are mine, and were in the box at the time. We found the box at Hardcastle's, in Berwick-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR, MARSHAM. I have five shopmen. I am certain that all the notes were in the box at the time. The prisoner is a married woman. She remained in the house until nine o'clock that evening. One of the 10l. notes has my own hand-writing on it.</p>
               <p>Q.When you saw her come into the room, you told her you came to search her - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PLANK. I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 7th of October, I went to the prosecutor's house to search the prisoner. I made a slight search - I did not search her person; I found nothing in her box. The next day I went with the prosecutor to No.16, Great Ormond-yard, where her husband lived. I found nothing there. I then went to No.15, and waited to watch her in-her husband's mother kept that house. In about an hour we saw her coming towards the house. I went out and called her in; I told her I suspected she knew something of the robbery - She knew I was an officer by seeing me the night before. She had a basket and bundle. She said she knew nothing of it. The bundle contained grocery - She came into the house willingly. I searched her person, and desired her to turn her pockets out. I found two Investigator's tickets, a bill of exchange, and a bill of parcels, all of which the prosecutor claimed. She still said she knew nothing of the robbery. I searched the bundle, and went to the basket - I asked her if it was her's? she said, yes. On opening it I found about 26l. in cash, and the notes now produced. The prosecutor immediately recognized the notes as his. The first I pulled out he said was his property - They were in the basket which she had in her hand. She appeared very sorry, and told me where she had left the cash-box; I neither threatened nor promised her - She said it was in Berwick-street, and told me the house - I went there and received it from the person she told me to apply to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What induced her to tell you where the box was - A. I asked her. I said she must know where it was - She told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you search her slightly - A. I knew the property was not about her, as she would not keep it in her possession, and if I had told her she was suspected, the property would not have been recovered. I told Mr. Booth that some stranger must have crept into the house and taken it out.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it probable she would convey it away - A. Yes. I sent a person to watch her home.</p>

While I was in the ditch I told my little boy to scream out, and run home to inform them-it was about four hundred yards from home - I followed my boy home. The prisoner ran the other way.

            . I am the wife of the last witness. He went out, leaving me at home. I went out at half-past ten o'clock, leaving no person at home, and the watch hanging over the mantle-piece. I locked the door-it opens into the sitting-room-there is only one window in it-and put the key into my pocket; I left the window-sash down-it would require great force to open it. When I returned, in about three quarters of an hour, I immediately missed the watch. There are three other houses in our court, all uninhabited. The door was as I had left it, and the window apparently in the same state. There were the prints of four sooty fingers on the window-cill, and on a bason which stood on the window-ledge, there was the mark of a sooty finger and thumb, and a footmark on a box which stood under the window.

            . I live next door to Swan-court. On the 23d of September, I saw two sweeps go up the court - I never saw them before. I knew Mrs. Payne was out. I was looking out of my window. They stood at the top of the court sometime - They went up the court, and returned in about ten minutes; their faces-were blacked. I saw the prisoners at the Office-their faces were clean then. I am certain the prisoners are the men. I was not above half a yard from them while they stood on the step of the court. I did not see them come out with any thing.</p>

On the 23d of September, between one and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, Wilson, pledged a watch with me for 18s. - he was dressed as a sweep; I never saw him before. I am sure he is the man. He asked 1l., for it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290007"/>pulled it out of his fob - He gave the name of Turvey, Great East-street, Lambeth - I wrote the ticket.

               <p>Court. Q. Take care what you are about. Do you mean to state, on your oath, that you stood by, and saw the money given to him, but you do not know by whom - A. I do not know. There is a person who takes in the pledges. I did not hear any person ask him any questions about it.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it you are so sure that he is the man, and cannot tell who gave him the money - A. I cannot tell. I was examined before the magistrate on the Monday.</p>

I had a chest in my bed-room there. I had a 5l. and a 1l. note, and a Spanish dollar, at the bottom of my chest, under my clothes-it was locked. The prisoner saw me put the money there. I asked him if he thought it would be safe there? he said it would be as safe there as in my pocket. I did not sleep there that night. I returned next day at ten o'clock, found my box broken open, and my notes and dollar gone. All the things had been moved to get at them-the 5l. note had my captain's name on it. On the 4th of October, we found the prisoner in Sunalley. I saw Lines find the Spanish dollar and 3l. 13s. on him. I think the dollar is mine. I had no mark on it.</p>

            . I am the beadle of Limehouse. I apprehended the prisoner, searched him and found two 1l. notes and 1l. 13s., in silver on him, and a Spanish dollar; I went to the lodgings and found the box broke open; I found a poker in the room, which fitted the marks in it, exactly.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM RAMSDEN. I lodged with him that night; I had lodged there eight weeks before. On the 3d of October, another man slept in the room - He was asleep when I went to bed; he had been at the house as long as I had. I went to bed at eleven o'clock, and about twelve a coach drove to the door - I heard a knock at the door, somebody got out; the man who sleeps below let him in; it was the prisoner, he came up, got a light, and came into the bed-room; he took a small chissel to force the box open-it would not do, and he forced it open with the poker. I had seen him before that time; he brought his own chest up; I could see plainly, and am positive he is the man; when he came into the room, I asked him who it was that came in the coach - He said it was him, and that he came from East Smithfield; this was while he was breaking the box open; he opened it and took something out and went down stairs, I bid him good-night; he came up again in the dark. I do not know what he took out of the box the second time.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to be quiet all the time? - A. I thought it was his own box; I am sure he is the man - I had a great deal of conversation with him in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say what he meant to do with it - A. He once said he would go to America, and afterwards that he would surrender himself up. On the afternoon of the robbery, the officer searched my box, which alarmed me; I threw the notes into the Thames, at Dowgate, they were loose in a pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had known him about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew he was in no situation to bring 400l. which he came honestly by - A. Yes, I told this story when the officer had searched me; I was liberated on my uncle being bound to answer for my appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him the impropriety of what he was doing - A. Not then - I did before. I am sixteen years old.</p>

On the 14th of October I met them together, in Rosemary-lane, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon; I asked them how they got on-Thompson said they got on very poorly, and they had not broken their fast that day; I took them into a cook-shop in Rosemary-lane, and we had some beef and beer - We had seven or eight pots of porter, and staid there until about half-past six o'clock - We went into the house between two and three o'clock. I walked some way with them before we went in. I told Kelly as it was getting late, I must be going home, he asked where I lived, I told him at the Strong Man, in Lower East Smithfield. Thompson was present. Kelly said he would shew me a short cut to go home - I told him he knew the way better than me. He took me to a place called <placeName id="t18171029-17-crimeloc95">Cooper's-row</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18171029-17-crimeloc95" type="placeName" value="Cooper's-row"/>

They stopped behind talking - I was going forward, it was very dark, Kelly came up to me, put up his fist, and said, "D-n your eyes, let us see what you have got." He knocked me down, put his knee upon my breast, and his hand over my mouth-Thompson was by - I mumbled out, "for God's sake do not use me ill, take what I have got," being afraid of their ill using me. Thompson said he has got some notes about him, feel. He (Thompson) took my notes out of my pocket, with some papers, and a handkerchief - I had more than ten 1l. notes there, I had felt them in my pocket that day, they were all new notes. They ran away as fast as they could. I got up and called out "thieves, murder!" the people opened their doors, and told me to go for a constable-it was near a row of houses. I went to Nathan's, and then went in search of the prisoners, with the officers; we found Thompson about two hours afterwards in Nightingale-lane, with a woman; I told the officer there was Thompson; he seized him, and took him into a house, and found three or four 1l. notes upon him, my papers, and handkerchief - They are new notes. We then went to look for Kelly, and found him about an hour hour afterwards at a public-house, going down to Deptford-the officer found some cash and notes on him. As he was going with the constable, he said, "Is old George here? I would never have done it if Thompson had not encouraged me"-Thompson was not present. I was quite sober. I paid for every thing. I am positive the prisoners are the men.</p>

               <p>KELLY. Q. Did we not advise you to give the money to the landlord to take care of - A. No. We had a pint of gin first in the morning; I did not drink any myself; I took a note out to pay for it. I had not counted my money for a week before.</p>
               <p>KELLY. Q. Did you not give the money to Thompson to keep while you went into a bad house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How did they knock you down - A. Kelly struck me on the head with his fist; my money was taken from me through fear.</p>
               <p>NATHANIEL NATHAN. I am a headborough. On the 14th of October, about a quarter after seven o'clock, Curtis was brought to my house, he told me of the robbery. He said he knew the men; that one was a tall Irishman, and the other a stout man-the prisoners answered the description; he said they were his own shipmates. I got Morris and Fair; we went with the prosecutor to different houses, from half-past seven till nine o'clock. We called at several houses which seamen use. In Ratchiff-highway, Curtis said, "Here is the villian, Thompson, that robbed me!" we immediately secured him, and took him into a public-house; we searched him, and found 17s. in silver. and 1s. 2d. in copper in a new black silk handkerchief. Fair found two 1l. notes, and some papers in his bosom, and a silk handkerchief. We locked him up, and went to several houses, till we came to the King's Arms, in New Gravel-lane, where we found two or three men and a woman standing. Curtis said, "This is Kelly;" we secured him, took him into the house, and handcuffed him. He made a violent resistance - He threw three of us down on the floor. We found 1l. 3s. 6d. in silver, and 3d. in copper on him. He said, "George, I will tell you all about it. It was not me that took your money, it was Thompson; for I only received 2l. 10s. for my share." The prosecutor appeared perfectly sober, but rather agitated by the blows he had received; he had a swelling under his eye.</p>
               <p>JAMES FAIR. I am an officer of Shadwell. I accompanied 
               <persName id="t18171029-17-person171">Nathan.</persName>
             I searched the prisoner, Thompson, and found two 1l. notes on him. I also examined his shirt, and found three certificates and two handkerchiefs, which the prosecutor claimed. I searched Kelly, and found a 1l. note on him. He made a strong resistance, and said he only received 2l. 10s. for his share of the money.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL MORRIS. I am an officer. I was present, and confirm what the witnesses have said.</p>
               <p>(Handkerchief and papers sworn to.)</p>
               <p>KELLY'S Defence. I met the prosecutor in Ship-alley; he kept shewing his money to the people - We got drunk. He gave 
               <persName id="t18171029-17-person172">Thompson</persName>
             the money to take care of, while he went to a bad house. He was to meet me the next morning.</p>

On the 13th of October, about eleven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290011"/>oclock at night, I had been drinking a few pints of beer at a public-house from eight o'clock till eleven; I was sober. I saw the prisoners standing at the corner of the Brown Bear public-house, in Moorfields. I had seen Edgar about Bethnal-green before, but never spoke to him. I asked them if they would have any thing to drink? they refused. I never spoke to them before. They said, "Go and get something yourself." I went into the public-house and had a glass of gin. I came out in about ten minutes, they were still there. West asked where I lived? I said, at Bethnal-green; they both said they lived there, and would see me home. They went as far as Brick-lane with me, which is about a mile and a half. When we got to Spicer-street, they both said, "You had better go down here;" I said I would not, I would go down Bethnalgreen; they said it would cut off a corner, and went down. When I got to George-court, which is near my house, they both said, "You have got money about you, and we will have it." I said, "You shall not." I had told them I had 24l. - when I came out of the house I happened to mention it. One of them held me while the other took it out of my pocket - I was nearly on the ground with the hustling; they did not strike me. I called out murder! they ran away. I called out, Stop thief! Edgar was taken in about an hour. I had received the notes of Mr. Ford, of Wood-street, he is my master. I had taken three of them a fortnight before; the others I received three years ago on board a ship, in which I was near eleven years.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You had 21l. in your pocket, which you had received three years ago - A. Yes; 21l. was brought from sea. The person next door to me had been robbed four nights before, and I put the money into my pocket to secure it. I only had the money in my pocket about three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. The person had been robbed four nights before, why did you not put them in your pocket then.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you married - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q.This is a strange story; the house was broken open four nights before, and on this night you put the money into your pocket for safety - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you see two men, whom you never spoken to before, and tell them you had the money about you - A. I knew one of their faces. I was a little fresh, but not drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not drunk yesterday - A. No. I had kept some of the notes three years. I have heard of a reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not accused a man with a highway robbery before - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. About losing your watch - A. I lost a watch. He was taken up, I did not prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Do you remember a person coming to you about it - A. No; I had no conversation about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Never! - A. Edgar's father offered me 10l.; I said I would not take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you would take it, and swear you was drunk, and did not know one from the other - A.Never. I had two or three pints of porter.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to say you had three or four - A. I said so. I had four, or more. When trade was bad, I used to buy clothes and sell them. I was out of work three months, but never parted with my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid you the money - A. I know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Name him - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Who ever saw the money in your possession - A. Mrs. Agnes. I took it out of my pocket to shew her sometime back.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. On what occasion did you shew it to Mrs. Agnes - A. I do not know. I took it out of my box to shew her.</p>

The surgeon attended her for about a fortnight - He is not here-the wounds were not very dangerous; one of the cuts was very bad, and would have been dangerous if it had been deeper.</p>
               <p>MARIA HERN. I am servant to Mr. Jacobs. On the 28th of September, the family went to church - I was alone in the house. I was in the bed-room on the second floor, and heard a noise down stairs; I went down to my master's dressing-room on the one pair of stairs, and saw the prisoner stooping at my master's portmanteau. I screamed out "Oh!" and instantly went up to him, and said," You villain, how came you in this house?' - He made no reply. He stood still for a minute or two, then came up to me, and took hold of both my arms - I screamed out murder! and immediately said, "Spare my life, spare my life-what is it you want?" He said, "By G-d, if you make any more alarm I will kill you." He said, if I would stop in that room, and not move, he would spare my life. He swore again that if I moved from the room he would kill me. I told him I would stop in the room if he would spare my life. He went out, leaving me in the room - I found he was locking me in; I went to the door, and pulled it from him with both hands, he pulling it from me. I saw a knife open in his hand when I entered the room, he instantly raised it up, and cut both my hands across with it to make me quit the door. In the scuffle I got past him - He cut me quite across both hands - I lost a great deal of blood from each of them; I was under the surgeon's care about a fortnight. Having received these cuts I got out of the room - I went to the front drawing-room on the same floor, and screamed out "Murder! for God's sake come to my assistance!" Mr. Holliday came out from church<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290012"/>at the time, and seeing me at the window, came in-Mr. Blower also came in, and they secured the prisoner. I saw the knife in the prisoner's hand when I first entered the room - We both had hold of the door.</p>
               <p>Q.Could he not have cut you by accident - A. No; I saw his hand directed against me, and felt the cut - He did it designedly.</p>

            . I am a clerk in one of the public offices. On Sunday, the 28th of September, a little before one o'clock, I was passing Mr. Jacobs's house, I was nearly opposite the street - door, and suddenly heard the window on the first floor thrown open, and the last witness call out, "Murder! there is a villain in the house!" I endeavoured to force the street - door, in company with a friend who was with me, but could not. I got over the rails, broke a pane of glass, and pulled the sash-fastening of the window back, opened the sash, and got in. I went towards the stairs-on the landing-place I saw the prisoner without his shoes, and secured him. Mr. Blower came up - I desired the prisoner to put his shoes on. He asked for his hat, which he said he had left up stairs. I took him to Knightsbridge watch-house. In going along, he voluntarily acknowledged that his object was to rob the house. I asked him where the knife was with which he cut the last witness's hands - He said, behind the drawers in the dressing-room - I went back to the house, and found it there-the prosecutrix's hands had been dressed.</p>

            . I was near the house a little before one o'clock, on the 28th of September, and heard the prosecutrix at the window crying murder! I got over the railing with the last witness; we got in, and saw the prisoner on the landing-place, without shoes or hat - He called for his hat, which he said he had left up stairs. I asked him what he had been doing with the servant? he said he had done nothing to her, and that it was her own fault that her hands were cut - We took him out. I sent for a surgeon. Both her hands were cut, and a great deal of blood were on her apron and on the floor.</p>
               <p>MR. HOLLIDAY re-examined. I saw the prosecutrix's hands cut. If I were to judge from the blood, I should conclude that the cuts were very deep-there was a great quantity of blood on her apron and on the floor. The prisoner made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Inhuman barbarity, and the arrogance of pampered expectation has induced the prosecutrix to come forward. I was confused at her finding me there. I allowed her to call out. I said I would kill her if she raised an alarm. I was going away - She changed colour, and seemed determined that I should not go. I begged of her to keep quiet, and keep in the room. I took hold of the key-the knife was open in my hand. She darted at the door, and said she would not be locked in. I seized the key with my left-hand, and held the door with the other hand, in which was the knife - She grasped the key with both hands and cut them with the knife - She got out. I determined to surrender myself. She has sworn falsely - I had no malice against her; I might have escaped if I chose.</p>

I went up stairs to clean myself, and took it with me; I put it in the cupboard in my bed-room, which is on the first floor. I told my girl to lock the bed-room door. I went to church. When I returned I saw the prisoner; he asked leave to go out, which I granted. I went out, and returned about half-past ten o'clock; he had not returned. I went up, and found my bed-room door ajar. Next morning, finding he did not return, I became suspicious, examined my cupboard, and missed my cash-box; it was brought to me on the Saturday following, from the Bull and Mouth Inn, inclosed in paper, and directed to me in the prisoner's hand-writing-the contents were gone. The 50l. note was marked"Mrs. Wells, Broad-court," of whom I had received it, in my hand-writing; I received it from her two days before. The prisoner had often seen me put money in the cash-box.</p>

I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and traced him to Sheffield, and found him lying under a hedge, without his hat, close by Sheffield Park - I took him into custody. He begged I would not hold him as he went through Sheffield, as he was known. I asked him what he had done with the money? he said he had none about him, but had left part of it at his sister's, in Sheffield. I asked him where she lived, and went there. I found his hat, and gloves, there-it had his name in it. The prisoner said he had sent the cash-box, and its contents, to his master. I told him that was false, as I had traced the 50l. note to the Bank. He said he did it himself, was very sorry for it, no person was concerned with him, and he must suffer.</p>

            , the warehouse is in the Old Bailey. On the 2d of June, the prisoner was their carman; it was his business to receive the money for the parcels which he delivered; he took six bags of wool to Mr. Hazard, but never accounted to me for the money; I settle every night with him - He said it was not paid, and returned a bill to me. I saw Mr. Hazard on the 4th of October, and had the prisoner apprehended.</p>
               <p>JAMES SNOW. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner; he said he was very sorry for it, and did not intend to defrand his masters, but to pay it in time. He said his wife had been ill, which made him in distress.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner in charge at his master's house, in the parlour; I asked him if he knew any thing about the robbery of the 10l. note, he said he did not; I told him I was well aware that he did - He denied it again; I examined him about it, but said nothing to induce him to confess; he burst into tears, begged forgiveness of his master, and said he would fetch the note; I told him I must go with him-we went up to the work-shop - He opened the trap-door, I got up - He followed and took a piece of paper from between the spars and tiles, which contained a 10l. note; it was wrapped in two papers; his master said it was his. The prisoner cried very much, and begged for mercy.</p>

            , JUN. I am an officer of Worship-street; the prosecutrix came to the office about an hour after the robbery, and had a description of the man entered in our book. On the 27th of October, I apprehended the prisoner, in consequence of that description; he denied the charge; the prosecutrix was introduced into the tap-room, and immediately picked him out. She did not see me bring him in.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BODEL. I am pot-boy at the Weavers Arms, Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street; the prisoner used our house-he came in at six o'clock that night, as he usually did; it was last Tuesday week; I am certain that was the night - He had a pint of beer, a pipe of tobacco, and a glass of gin and pepper; he had the beer first - He staid there till after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you sure - A. I am kept to wait in the tap-room - He was ill; my mistress asked him how he came to look so ill.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you called upon first about it - A. Saturday morning-his wife enquired about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How do you know what o'clock it was - A. I looked at the clock in the tap-room when he came in; I go out of the room sometimes-my mistress gave him the gin and pepper. Perry was there also - He sat opposite the fire-place; there were seven or eight people in the room. I am positive it was Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER PERRY. I work at Billingsgate. I know the prisoner - last Tuesday week I was at the Weavers Arms, at half-past six o'clock and staid there till nine, the prisoner was there all the time; the prisoner came in a little before seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure he was not there when you first went in - A. Yes: when he came in, he put his hand to his stomach and said it was bad; he had two-pennyworth of pillicotia made into pills; Bodel went out for it - He had nothing to drink - He swallowed the pills without any liquid. A young man applied to me to be a witness here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoner came in about a quarter before seven; there was no clock in the tap-room, by which I could tell the time. I knew the tap-room very well.</p>

On the 24th of October, I was in Fleet-street; I was watching the prisoners, Wells and Buckingham, for a quarter of an hour before, they were going towards Temple-bar and met Spencer by Salisbury-court; they stood talking together for five minutes; Mr. Webster and a gentleman passed on that side of the way going towards Temple-bar; the prisoners, Wells and Buckingham, went after him and beckoned to Spencer - He joined them; Wells went to Mr. Webster's pocket and pulled out the handkerchief about five or six inches - They went on a little farther, and opposite Red Lion-court, Buckingham took it quite out; they all ran across the road together; I informed Mr. Webster, and told him to follow me; I hardly knew which way they turned, but I thought it must be up the court; I went up to the top of Red Lion-court, and found them jostling about; I stopped them and took them to a public-house and found nothing on them; Mr. Webster went out and brought in the handkerchief.

On the 13th of October, I delivered seventy-two sheep at Mr. Kemp's field, at Holloway, in Middlesex; ten of them had a ruddled mark across the shoulder and on each hip. I saw them safe on Thursday, the 16th; I heard of one being lost on the 18th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. I did not count them after the 13th, when they were delivered.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290017"/>WILLIAM FARREN. I am field-keeper to Mr. Kemp. I saw the seventy-two sheep safe on the 17th, between four and five o'clock in the evening; the next morning at half-past seven I went into the field and missed one of them; I went across three fields and found the inside of a sheep at the corner of a lane; I also found the four legs sawed off in the hedge.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WESTLEY. I am an headborough. On the 18th of October, I stopped the prisoner, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, coming across a field, which is three small fields from Mr. Kemp's field; he had a basket on his head. I had not heard of the robbery; the basket contained two hind-quarters, one fore-quarter, of a sheep, and the fat; I asked him what he had got there, he said he had found some meat in a ditch; it was hot. I told him I must take him to a magistrate to know what must be done. I took him to Mr. Wicks, and then to Hatton-garden; the sheep-skin was produced there, and matched with the meat, it corresponded; it was compared about two o'clock, it was not cut up in the usual manner-the meat was sawed; the prisoner gave me the key of his lodgings to search them; he said he lived in Back-alley, Cloth-fair; the key which he gave me fitted the door of some premises in White's-alley, Whitecross-street, where I found a saw, two knives, and a smock-frock, quite bloody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not know that it is the prisoner's lodging; I found 31s. 6d., in silver, and a 1l. note there; I found no knife on the prisoner - the head was in the skin.</p>
               <p>Q. Is meat never cut with a saw - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GOSS. I am a headborough. On the 18th of October, I went to Mr. Kemp's field and found the skin, with the head of a sheep in it, rolled up and put in a water-pipe; I unrolled it, it was warm-the blood had hardly done running from the head; part of the neck was with the head; I looked farther, and just by the place where it was killed I found the lights, covered over with a little hay. I took the skin to the office; the prisoner delivered me a key, and said he lodged in Cloth-fair; I went there with Westley, but could not find his lodgings. I received information, and went to the place where the key unlocked the door, and found the heart and liver of a sheep there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Westley was with me. The person who directed me to the place is not here.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM THISSELTON. I am an officer of Hatton-garden. After the rooms had been searched and the skin was found, the witnesses said in the presence of the prisoner before the magistrate, that they had been to Cloth-fair and afterwards to White's-alley, Whitecross-street, on the ground-floor, and found a 1l. note and 31s. 6d. in silver, which they produced, and the other things; but they did not know whether they were authorized to break open a box; the magistrate sent me there-the prisoner asked for part of the 31s. found there, and received 5s., for his support, out of it; I went to the rooms, and found a key in a table-drawer that opened a mahogany box, which contained 3l.7s.6d., in silver, and a pocket-book with a 1l. note in it; the prisoner claimed it at his second examination and it was given to him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WILKINSON. (Looks at the skin), the marks correspond with those on the sheep I lost.</p>

They all ran away. I saw the watchman immediately after, and he asked me if I had been robbed? - he was about three yards from me. I told him he had seen it, and ought to have gone after them; he said he had not seen it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know any of the prisoners - A. I had seen Daltry before; it was he that came down the lane, and took my watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to speak with certainty to him - A. It was seven o'clock. There was a strong gas-lamp at the corner, I saw him plainly; I saw him at the office three days after the robbery, and pointed him out-the prisoner, Martin, was another of them; he came up the lane after I had been robbed, and asked me if I had been robbed? I told him he knew it. I had seen them standing together before I came up to them, he was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not take hold of him - A. I was afraid of being ill used, as I had a great deal more property about me; the watchman had gone away before this. I had seen four of them standing together under the lamp before I was robbed. I believe the four other prisoners to be the men who robbed me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. The watchman was discharged. I never said it was ten o'clock at night, or any other time than seven. It did not last more than two minutes. The watchman went on his beat; he was nearly under the lamp; the robbery was in the middle of the pavement, about four feet from the lamp. The men immediately ran up Whitechapel-the man who took the watch ran up the lane. I saw them again the same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them afterwards you did not like to go near them - A. No, I walked away. There might only have been five of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see either of them after that night - A. On the 20th, at twelve o'clock. I was sent for-there were seven of them; I picked the five prisoners out from the seven. I am sure they are the men; I knew their faces. I know nothing of a reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know there is 200l. to be paid if the men are convicted - A. I do not. I should be sorry to receive it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who laid hold of your right or left arm - A. The prisoner, Hurley, laid hold of my arms. I met the prisoners at the time of the robbery. I described them at the Office that night.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How soon after the robbery did you see them that night - A. When they were going away, they came back to the spot; I was a little higher up; they were moving about, and appeared to be the same party - I was ten yards from them. The robbery was on the north side of Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GRIFFITHS. I am a police officer. The day after the robbery I received information, and went the next morning, which was Wednesday, to Black Lion-yard, which is lower down the road than Petticoat-lane, nearer to Mile End. I went there between nine and ten o'clock, and found the prisoner, Daltry, up one pair of stairs; Hurley was also in a room there, both with girls, I took them into custody. I received information, and went in pursuit of Martin, and took him in Trumpet-court, just by Black Lion-yard, about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was you present when the prosecutor saw the prisoner - A. There were seven of them at the bar together; the prosecutor was brought in. The magistrate asked him if there was any person there who had robbed him? he immediately pointed out Daltry and the four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290019"/>other prisoners. He said he knew nothing of the other two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He pointed out Daltry immediately. He said that he held him and pushed him about. He could not distinguish which was on one side of him, and which was on the other. I had taken them up on another charge. I never saw them before.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Although he could not distinguish which was on one side, and which was on the other, did he separate them from the others - A. He separated the prisoners, and said he knew nothing of the others. I apprehended them from the description I received at the office.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. I am an officer. I apprehended Rule and Newton, on the 16th of October, at the Black Horse, in George-street, Spitalfields, about eleven o'clock in the morning, by the description which I received at the office.</p>

               <p>DALTRY'S Defence. I am innocent. I was at a public-house at the time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SMITHERS was called to prove this fact, but his evidence referred to the day before the prisoner was taken up, and not to the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>MARTIN'S Defence. I can prove I was at home from six till nine o'clock that night.</p>
               <p>HANNAH ROBINSON and JUDAH BENJAMIN were called to prove the alibi. Their evidence also referred to the night before the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

I accused him of having my watch - He made some resistance; he was overpowered - He denied having it. A person came up with a light. I found the watch at the very spot where he was stopped.

               <p>WILLIAM MARCHANT. I am an officer. On the 11th of October, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the three prisoners coming down <placeName id="t18171029-46-crimeloc244">Newgate-street</placeName>

I had not got many yards before I heard a voice say, "who are you looking at? have you never seen two men before;" I turned round and saw Smith, and took him. I could not find the gentleman-the handkerchief was marked, C.P.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM MARCHANT, re-examined. The magistrate asked him if there was any mark on it-he said none.</p>

I went into St. Paul's Church-yard with him, he pointed out the two prisoners, and said they were the men, I seized one and he the other, and we took them into a house, and searched them - They denied having it - We found it on Crooks. I gave them in charge.</p>
               <p>JOHN CARLISLE. I am an officer. On the 8th of October I was coming down Fleet-street, from Temple-bar, and observed the prisoners following several gentlemen, and feeling their pockets; they went as far as Fleet-market, returned again nearly as far as Chancery-lane, and then went down Fleet-street again; I missed them just by Fleet-market for half an hour; I watched about Ludgate-hill, and saw them behind the prosecutor, who was with a lady, just by St. Paul's Church-yard, Bartlett lifted his pocket up, went a little farther, and pulled the handkerchlef about five inches out, just by Ludgate church, Crooks took it quite out and ran across the way. I told the prosecutor, and desired him to return with me to look for them-they had gone towards St. Pauls. We came up with them in St. Paul's Church-yard, laid hold of them, and took them into a public-house, searched them, and found the handkerchief at the back part of Crooks' breeches. The prosecutor described it before he saw it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Banks. I was in the warehouse, and saw the prisoner in the yard, the people told me to stop him, which I did - He was running about the yard - I brought him back, and gave him in charge. I do not know what parish the house is in. He had some clothes and a waistcoat when the officer took him-the rest of the things were in two bundles, which he dropped in the yard.</p>
               <p>GEORGE READ. I am an officer. On the 18th of October, about twelve o'clock, Mr. Banks sent for me; I found the prisoner in the yard with a large bundle, tied up. I found two shirts, two waistcoats, and a coat on his body, and several things between his shirt and his skin; and a great many things stuffed in his trowsers. When I took the prisoner, he said he committed the robbery to get some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290021"/>money to take him to his own country. I believe it is not Mr. Banks's dwelling-house.</p>

I immediately went and gave information at the office, the next day the officers had taken five men out of that passage and the neighbourhood; I went to look at them, and immediately fixed on Daltry. On the Monday following the prisoner, Rule, was taken; I immediately picked him out from seven others - He was not there the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they with you - A. Not a minute; I saw them for about six yards as they came up - They met me-there was a strong gas light from a butcher's shop, which shone very bright on them. I described Daltry immediately; and the next morning I described Rule, I was more collected in my mind then; I had a better opportunity of observing Daltry than the other - I positively swear to him, but I hesitate about Rule.</p>
               <p>DALTRY. Q. Are you sure I am the man - A. I am.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GRIFFITHS. I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I took Daltry in Black Lion-yard, in a house, up two pair of stairs, with a girl. I took him from the description that I received of him at the office. As soon as the prosecutor came into the office he pointed him out from five others-it was on the Monday.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. I am an officer. I took Rule into custody, on Thursday the 16th of October, at the Black Horse, George-street, Spitalfields. I was present on the Monday, when the prosecutor pointed him out.</p>

On the 18th of October, in the morning, I missed a 5l. and a 2l. note out of my pocket-book, which was locked in a drawer in my parlour; I had put them there on the 14th, with the other notes which was left; I sent for Turner, and called the prisoner down in the evening and told Turner to search him; there were no notes found on him; he tried to get out of the room - I called him back, and while we were counting 19s. 6d., which was found on him, Frischi said he was swallowing the notes - I seized him, and Turner laid hold of his throat and forced a key out of his mouth, which opened the drawer; it is a common lock-he said he found the key in the passage.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM TURNER. I am an officer. I was searching the prisoner, and found 19s. 6d. on him; while I was counting it, Frischi said he was swallowing the notes - I turned round and saw something in his throat, I laid hold of it, forced the key up and took it out of his mouth; I told him to open the drawer with it, which he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had not finished searching him.</p>
               <p>ELIZA FRISCHI. I am housekeeper to the prosecutor. On the 18th of October, the prisoner was being searched, while they were counting the money, he turned from them and put his hand to his mouth; I saw something like paper between his teeth, and told them-it was white; it might not be paper. They took a key out of his mouth-the key was a dull colour.</p>

On the 18th of September, I went out to serve the customers at half-past twelve o'clock, and left my watch hanging between two posts, in the ceiling, in the bakehouse. It had a chain, two seals, and a key to it, all gold-any person could reach it; I returned at half-past one o'clock and missed it; I was in the habit of hanging it there for a year or more. The prisoner came to see my master some months before this-he was in the bakehouse at that time. My watch and appendages were worth ten guineas.</p>

In about five minutes after he asked me if I was not going with the bakings, I told him I did not know whose they were - He said I could see by the book, I told him I was not going out until my master came home; my master came in and I went out, leaving the prisoner in the bakehouse with him. When I returned, I met the prisoner on the bakehouse steps, as I passed him, I said, "What are you going;" he made no answer - I went down and missed. the watch; I am certain that it was there when I went out. I went after the prisoner, but could not find him-my father came in soon afterwards.</p>

            . I am master of the house-it is in the parish of St. John, Hackney; the prosecutor used to hang the watch in the bakehouse. I came in at one o'clock and found the prisoner there - I knew him before; he said he came to Hackney on business, and should remain with me until three o'clock, as he had to call for some money at that hour. I sent the last witness out-the watch was then safe; the prisoner said it was five minutes after one by the watch, which made me send the boy out; I staid in the bakehouse - A person came for a dish and wanted change; I went to the shop steps to give change, while I was doing so, the prisoner followed me up; as soon as the boy came in, he gave the alarm-the prisoner had gone out; I followed him - He ran very hard, and got out of my sight - I lost him. The watch was there when I came in; the prisoner could have taken it while I went to the steps; he had been in my shop and bakehouse once before.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am a constable. I went in pursuit of the prisoner to the Mercers' Arms, at Shadwell, and found him there about five o'clock. He denied the charge.</p>

I told him he had got Hemsley's watch - I neither threatened or promised him; he denied it, and began crying; I was going to search him - He took the watch out of his pocket and gave it to me.

On Saturday morning the 25th of October, about half-past eight o'clock, I met the prisoner - He asked me where I was going - I said I was going down the lane - He said he would go with me; he pulled a watch out of his pocket to see what time it was - I told him it was wrong - He said he did not pull it out above once a month; I opened and regulated it for him; I asked him where he got it? he said he bought it, and laughed; I said, "Yes you have bought it;" he said, "No; it was one that he had boned;" I asked him what he meant by boning? he said it was one that he took out of one of the rooms where he served beer, and that he took it from the room before you come to the Quarter-master's. I knew the prosecutor lived in that room.</p>

The next morning, I met Mulford; he asked me to let him pledge it and he would have half of the money. About an hour after, the constable took me.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MULFORD, re-examined. I never offered to pledge it. I am certain that he said he took it out of the room before you come to the Quarter-master's.</p>

            . I am waterman at the coach-stand in Cheapside. On Sunday morning, the 28th of September, between four and five o'clock, the prisoner, Thomas, drew his coach to the stand, between King-street and Bucklersbury; in about half an hour, the prisoner, Hamilton, came up and spoke to him. As he went away, I heard one of them say, "All is right." I went to get some liquor at the corner of Budge-row, and saw Hamilton walking down Walbrook; he stopped at Mr. Alderman Atkin's door, and scraped his shoes. As I returned, I saw him walking round the back of the Mansion-house - He was within twelve yards of the prosecutor's door. About half-past six o'clock he came up to the stand to Thomas again - He drew his coach up to the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this, had you made any application to Thomas - A. Yes; I told him I had a job for him - He said, he believed he had one already, and I had better take the coach behind him. When Hamilton came up I opened the coach door, he came from Bucklersbury. Thomas said he was the man who spoke to him - He got in; Thomas was going to drive down Bucklersbury-Hamilton put his head out and said, "I told you to go down Pancras-lane"-that would lead them to Bucklersbury. I afterwards saw the coach in Charlotte-row; the glass was up-there appeared to be two men in it, and something like a bag.</p>

               <p>GEORGE BOOTH. I am shopman to Mr. Death. On the 29th of September, about nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came into the shop, with another man, who went to the right-hand counter, the prisoner to the left. The other man asked for some shoe-ribbon-the prisoner asked for nothing, but stood at the counter; there were nine cards of lace on that counter - I was at the other end of the shop; I moved them all into the window, they were still within the prisoner's reach-the gas was lighted - I was going out for a candle. The other man had got his ribbon; the prisoner asked him if he did not want some white? he said, "Yes, I will look at some." The young woman brought the drawer to him. I went out to buy some candles, but seeing the prisoner shift nearer to the counter, I stopped outside in the street, at the corner of the window, to watch him. I had not been there a minute before I saw him take the whole of the nine cards, and put them under his great-coat, which hung on his arm. I immediately ran over to the watch-house, and got a constable. As the constable came out of the watch-house door, the prisoner and his companion came out of the shop - I pointed them out; he secured the prisoner, his companion immediately ran away-the prisoner took the lace. I saw it fall from him immediately as they collared him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. My suspicions were excited by seeing him shift towards the window. I am certain the prisoner took the lace - He was never out of my sight; the watch-house is immediately opposite. I could see the shop all the while. I picked up some of the lace.</p>
               <p>JOHN FORRESTER. I am a constable. Booth came to me - We ran out immediately from the watch-house, saw the prisoner, and collared him. Some person said he was the man. I found nothing on him. I picked up a piece of lace about half a yard from him. Only Love and myself were near him-Hargrave came after.</p>

            . I went with Forrester. The prisoner and another man came out of the shop at the same time - I seized the prisoner. There was some lace scattered about the pavement; no other person was passing-it could not have fallen from any other person. I found 11l.4s. on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoner came out first. I believe the other man had not left the shop when I first saw the lace-my attention was directed to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HARGRAVE. I am a constable. I came up, and picked up six pieces of lace. Booth found the others - I produce them.</p>

I said, I did not like to shew them at night, but they might see them in the morning. Between twelve and one o'clock next day, Watts came, and I shewed them to him; he said they would do very well, and asked if they could come in that evening? We came down to my husband-the prisoner, Watts, said they were carpenters, and had got a job for four months, in the Curtain-road.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the lodging to be taken for the two - A. Yes, it was a joint taking. My husband said he was very particular who he let them to, and asked for a reference - He referred him to George-walk, Vauxhall. My husband said it was Saturday, and he could not go there that day. Watts said, he was going there on Sunday, and they could walk together. He said he would bring a chest of tools in, which would satisfy us for more than a week's rent-my husband agreed to take them in. They came between eleven and twelve o'clock that night, I let them in - They had each a bundle; I gave them a light - They were to pay 5s. a week-my husband was not at home; the windows were all shut. About eight o'clock the next morning, my child was coming from over the way, saw the windows were open, and the curtains blowing about-my husband went up.</p>
               <p>JOHN ALLFORD. I am the husband of the last witness. I saw the prisoner, Watts about the lodgings; he referred me to Vauxhall; we were to go there the next morning together - I agreed to let them. I came home about twelve o'clock, and fastened the door. The next morning I received information, went up stairs, and tapped at the door; no answer was made. I went in, found the window open, the prisoners gone, and the articles stated in the indictment - They never returned. I saw Martin at the watch-house at one o'clock that day. About three weeks after, Watts was taken.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 28th of September, about three o'clock in the morning, I went to the house at the corner of French-alley, and found the water-pipe gone, and the water flowing about the cellar; I went to Rowley's house - They would not let us in; the watchman and I got down through the cellar-window, and found part of the pipe in the middle of the cellar, and the rest at the back; it measured fifty-six feet, and corresponded within one foot, with the place where it had been taken from-it was rolled up. I could not see the full extent of it. While I was in the cellar, I saw the prisoner, Richardson, go across the yard - I got out of the front window and went into the shop, after forcing the door, and found a good fire in the shop; I went into the yard and found Richardson in custody - He was dressed; I found eight tin canisters in the yard, and returned to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290030"/>the shop and found the prisoner, Rowley, in the shop, in her shift, and the prisoner, Wright, in a room adjoining, in her hed, with his clothes on-his shoes were muddy; I found two tin canisters in the shop, covered over with a sack, under the counter, and seven lids of the canisters near a chair by the fire; there was a great deal of water in the pipe. We took them into custody-the next morning I went to the premises and found the lock had been forced; I found another canister-lid and a crow-bar at Rowley's house, which fitted the marks made in the door.</p>

            . I am a copper-plate-printer, in the employ of Mr. Newberry, whose office is in Stonecutter-street, Fleet-market; I lodge there. About the 10th of September, I was at the Key, in Fleet-market, and saw the prisoner, Powell, there; I never saw him before; he had an engraving tool on the table, I took it up - He asked me if I understood engraving - I told him I understood a little of it-but I was a printer; he said he had frequently little jobs of printing to do; I told him if he would bring them to Stonecutter-street, my master would do them for nothing, by way of giving him engraving for printing, if his engraving would suit; he asked me if I could not print on my own account - I told him I did not wish to act clandestinely, and wished him to bring them to Mr. Newberry's; he did not say what he wanted printed. On the 14th, I saw him there again-nothing particular passed. On the 17th, about half-past ten or eleven o'clock at night - I was in bed at Stonecutter-street - it was Wednesday night, there was a ring at the bell; I went down and found Powell at the door, he said he had got a job - He came in, produced paper, and a plate, and said he wanted to get them done the first thing in the morning; the paper was for me to print the notes - He said he wanted 150 of them by the morning. I took the paper and plate out of his hands, I looked at it, and said it was Malton Bank; he said he wanted to send them by the Mail in the evening, and asked me what time he should call for them in the morning, as he must have them by nine o'clock - I told him to make it nearer ten o'clock, as I could not get them done before; he said it would be a satisfaction to him if I wetted the paper before he went - I did so.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he wish you to do it without your master's knowledge - A. Yes; he asked me if I could not do it myself; I said I would not act clandestinely, and that it would be to his advantage to let Mr. Newberry know; the next day I took the plate to my master and told him of it; an officer was placed in the office. I went on with the job-Powell came while I was at work - I had done about 112 of them; he took some up, and said they would do very well, I told him I had done 112, he told me to make haste, as he had them to dry and send by the Mail; I printed about five more and the officer came in, took him, and the notes and plate from me, I went with the officer to the Maze in the Borough, to the Sun and Hat-block, and saw the prisoner, Storr, there.</p>
               <p>DANIEL TURNER. I am an officer. I was called to Mr. Newbery's on the 18th of September-Powell came in, looked at the notes, and said they would do. I took him into custody, and asked him who gave him any order to get the notes printed? he said he had an order from the agent of the Bank to get them printed. I asked him where the agent lived? he said at the Sun and Hat-block, in the Maze, and I had better go with him, as I should find him at home now. I took him before the magistrate. White and I went with him to the Maze. When we got there we received information. I went to the back-room; Hawkins and Reeve went in first, and began to search the prisoner, Storr, who was there. They asked him if he knew Powell? he said he did not, at first; he afterwards said he did knew him, as he had seen him the night before in Petticoat-lane. A pocket-book was found, with nine or ten notes in it. I have the plate which I took from the printing-press, and the notes.</p>
               <p>RICHARD REEVE. I am an officer. I went with Turner and White, to the Maze, and saw Storr there. I searched a trunk which was on the table, and found four guineas and six 1l. notes, all on different banks. One of them was on the Malton Bank-this was in a separate pocket from the others. I found some tracing-paper in the principal book. The notes are all genuine, and not payable in town.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHITE. I was with the officers, and took Storr into custody. I went with Powell-Powell said, "These men are come about the notes." Storr said that he knew nothing about them. I told him I must search him. I found a genuine Doncaster note in one of his pockets, and a Sheffield one. Hawkins found a bag in the trunk, which contained 4l. or 5l. in silver. He said he was with Storr in Petticoat-lane the night before - We went to Guildhall. Powell said he could bring a witness, who was present in Storr's room when he cut the plate. I told him that would serve him materially.</p>
               <p>PETER COWPEN. I live at the Sun and Hat-block, in the Maze. The prisoner, Storr, came to lodge with me in the name of William Henry, only - He lodged six or seven weeks with me, and went by that name. He always wore a brown coat, except for about a fortnight, when he went into the country, and returned in about three weeks, he then dressed like a sailor. I have seen Powell go to his room several times, both before and after he went intothe country.</p>

               <p>MR. SAMUEL NEWBERY. I am a copper-plate printer, and have been so for seven years. Engravers use tracing-paper to get fac-similies. The tracing-paper produced has been used to engrave a plate-it has been traced from a genuine note; the words One Pound correspond exactly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290032"/>On another part of the paper, there are the words Richard Dunn and Peas, which appear to have been traced from a genuine note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He might engrave from the genuine note, but it would destroy it.</p>
               <p>MR. ASHLEY. I am an engraver, and live in Lombard-street - I engrave the plates for the Malton Bank. I never gave the prisoners authority to engrave the plates - I never saw them before. Tracing-paper is used in engraving. It is very evident that the tracing has been done from the genuine note. I cannot say whether the engraving on the plate is done from the tracing-paper, or not.</p>

I asked him what brought him there? he made no answer, but dropped it, and said he was going out with Mr. Chapman's mare, and the master of the stable gave him leave to be there - I secured him; the master said he did not.</p>

               <p>JOHN LANGFIELD. I am a constable. On the 6th of October I went with Mr. Wickham and his wife to the lodgings of Sarah Troup, sen., in Gilbert-street. The prosecutrix charged Troup, jun. with stealing a 20l. note out of her looking-glass drawer. I asked her if she knew any thing about it? she said, No. I searched William Troup, the husband, and found nothing on him. While I was searching him, Troup, sen. threw something into the fire-Wickham said the 20l. note was thrown into the fire - I immediately went to the fire, and took out a piece of brown paper, which contained a key; the looking-glass was brought to the room - I tried the key to the drawer, it opened it. I searched Troup, sen., and found a 1l. note and 9s.6d on her - I found two sixpences on Troup, jun. I searched the apartments-on a shelf I found a tea-caddy. Troup, jun. said there was nothing in it, and I had no occasion to take it down. I took it down, and found a 1l. note and a pair of ear-rings in it; the prosecutrix claimed them, and the 1l. note also. I turned down a bureau bedstead, and found a shift and two pair of stockings, which the prosecutrix also claimed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There were two beds in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that the bureau bedstead belonged to the younger prisoner - A. I do not know - She claimed the tea-caddy.

I called to the watchman, he came up immediately, pursued and took one of them-it was Levy. I am positive he is one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. I was sober. Norris snatched the watch-chain, Levy saw him do it. I was alarmed.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL MORRIS. I am an officer of Shadwell. I took Norris into custody from information which I received, on the 23d, which was the next day.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL GIDEON. I am a fruit-dealer. On Wednesday week, at night, the prisoner, Norris, came to me and asked if I knew a lame gentleman, who lived in Back-lane? I told him I had seen him about. He said he had made a snatch at the gentleman's watch, and the chain broke; Stop thief was called, he ran away, and threw the seals in the mud. I told him it was nothing to me - He went away. I only know him by his buying fruit of me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came he to tell you about it - A. I do not know. He stopped me in Wells-street, and told me, about half-past ten o'clock at night. He came to me again at eight o'clock next night, and said, "You know the concern I shewed you the over-night." He said he sold the chain and seals for 12s. - this was on Thursday night - He then said he only sold it for 8s. He afterwards said to Lewis Cohen," You know the concern I shewed you last night?" Cohen said he should know it again. He said,"Here is a piece of the chain, and here goes." He threw it away. He said, he threw it away because the property should not be found upon him if he was taken.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How long have you known him - A. He used to buy fruit of me.</p>
               <p>LEWIS COHEN. I am a tailor. Last Wednesday week, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was standing at the posts, at the corner of Wellclose-square, the prisoner, Norris, came up to me, and shewed me two seals and three keys, hanging to a piece of chain. He asked me to buy them. He said I might have them for 15s. - I refused; he went away. Next night, I was talking to Gideon, he came up, and asked me if I should know the things which he shewed me the evening before? I said I should - He said he had sold them. He took half the chain out of his pocket, and threw it away. I then searched about Wells-street for it a long while.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS GULLEY. I am a watchman of St. George's in the East. On the 22d of October, about ten minutes after ten at night, I heard the rattle sprung. I ran towards Betsey-street, and saw a party running across Ratcliff-highway, down John's-lane, calling out, Stop thief! I turned round, and ran down Artichoke-hill, and met the prisoner, Levy at the bottom - He ran into my arms. He asked me what I took him for? The people came up, and said he was the man. I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He said he had done nothing.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH SAVAGE. I am a watchman. On the 22d of October, about a quarter after ten o'clock, I heard the alarm, and saw two persons running, I sprang my rattle; I lost sight of them and turned back, thinking they would come round another away. I met Levy in the custody of Gulley.</p>

            . I keep the Red Lion, at Brentford. On the 24th of October, Kilsby was moving his goods which he had left with me; I set the prisoner, Humphries, who is my hostler, to mind them; while Kilsby was gone with one load I ran into the yard to send him out, and saw him, and Baker, at the box; the moment they heard me coming, they shut the box; I drew back, and returned through the gateway into the yard, and secreted myself to watch them; I saw Humphries take a pelilsse out of the box, and run from the coach-house into the stable where I was-it being dark, he did not see me; while he was gone, Baker took a white gown out-on his return, Baker said he should have it, as it would make him some handkerchiefs; Baker put his hand in, and pulled out a gown and waistcoat-my sister came out and asked them if I was there - They said I was not; they hustled up the things that she should not se them - She went in, and they ran into the stable and placed the things with the others; Baker put the gown in the corn-bin. On their return to the coach-house, the cart came back, and took the other things away; I came out and told the prisoners to load the cart; Humphries went and took the things which he had taken, and put them in the hay-loft among the straw, locked the door, and came into the yard. I told him to take out the beer-when he returned, I got the things out of the stable, from behind the straw, and the gown from the corn-bin, and brought them into the kitchen, and asked Humphries if he knew anything of the property - He said he picked them up in the coach-house; I said, "You are a pretty fellow," he said they were not worth more than 1s., altogether. I sent for the prosecutor - he claimed the property; the prisoner said Baker took the gown - We sent for him and he acknowledged it. I gave them both in charge.</p>

When the prisoner came in, I told her I had found it in her box and must take her to the office - She said she knew nothing about it. I enquired for duplicates-she gave me one of a shift, which she took from a drawer in her room; she said it was not the prosecutrix's shift; she told me she had pledged the shift at Mr. Balis's, in Portland-street. I took her there and found it.</p>

I found some sugar-dust in his pocket - He said he sold the sugar to a person of the name of Ward; I took him to Ward's house, and found Ward there; I asked him where the sugar was that the man brought that morning - He brought out about one pound and three ounces of moist, and twelve ounces of lump; he said he gave 6d. for it.

On the 13th of October, my things were under a hedge in a field where I was at work with Wicks; about ten o'clock I saw a man in the field - He went out of the field; we watched him out; in about a quarter of an hour we went to our things to get our victuals, and missed them. The prisoner was taken - He is the man.</p>

On the 21st of October, about twenty minutes after nine o'clock, the bell rang-my wife answered the door - She sent me on the opposite side of the way, I immediately went over, and saw the prisoner untying the hammercloth from Lord Ellenborough's coach, which stood in the front shop - He rolled it up, got off the wheel, and walked away with it, in his arms; I went after him, collared him, and brought him back with it. I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GILES. I am a harness-maker. I was going to breakfast on the 21st of October, and saw the prisoner lurking about Mr. Howe's door, knowing Mr. Howe's men, I suspected him, and went to the corner of Little Queen-street, and saw him turn up the end of the hammercloth of Lord Ellenborough's coach; I rang the bell, and the last witness came across the way to me, I then pointed the prisoner out to him. I saw him roll the cloth up, and get down with it. I assisted in securing him.</p>

               <p>JAMES BAKER. I am an officer. On the 20th of October, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was in company with Wainwright, in Fleet-street, and saw the prosecutor and a gentleman, pass the end of Fetter-lane-the prisoners were close behind them, attempting Mr. Woollam's pocket - They followed them until they got to Wych-street, about four doors from the Angel Inn, when I saw Hughes draw the handkerchief out-the gentlemen gave way, and both the prisoners passed; I immediately passed the gentlemen and seized Hughes-seeing him drop the handkerchief I picked it up, the prosecutor claimed it. Wainwright took Hawkins.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. I saw him drop the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WAINWRIGHT. I am an officer. I was with Baker, and saw the prisoners following the gentlemen through Temple Bar until they came to Wych-street. I seized Hawkings, and found 12s. on him.</p>

On the 5th of October, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was going up Snowhill; the prisoner accosted me, and asked me to go with her. I told her I was going home, and did not want to go with any person - She got in conversation with me. I left her and crossed the way, going across Smithfield, she kept by my side till I got on the pavement in Long-lane. She wanted to pull me aside - I told her it was of no use, and desired her to let me alone. I walked up Long-lane about fourteen yards, she came up to me again, and kept by my side - I told her to go about her business. At the turning by the Pig-market, she took hold of my arm, pulled me towards the market, and exposed herself in a very indecent manner. I got from her, and went up Long-lane-when I came to Charter-house-street, I thought I would go down there to get rid of her; she turned down the street, followed me about twelve yards and wanted me to go with her - I told her I would not. I went towards the square, the watchman said I could not get through, as the gates were shut. I turned back, and passed her at the corner, to go to the top of Long-lane-she still followed me. I crossed into Barbican, and saw her still following me. When I got to the corner of Golden-lane I lost her, and went to the top of Beech-street. About the middle of Beech-street I had occasion to stop - I did not see her near me. In an instant she came round me, and pushed her hand into my breeches, I said, "You wretch, go about your business, and let me alone!" I got away from her, and in turning round to go into <placeName id="t18171029-117-crimeloc627">Whitecross-street</placeName>

I missed my watch, and said, "You b-h, you have robbed me!" ran after her, and caught her-just at that time two men came in front of her; I called out Watch! he came immediately, and I gave her in charge. I could not find my watch. I am positive that it was safe when I stopped.</p>

He looked at it, and next day he sent a person to look over the house and furniture - I shewed him over it, I was living in it at the time. I asked him for a reference - He referred me to Mrs. Gunn, No.33, Lainb's Conduit-street - she gave me a good character of him. I entered into a written agreement with him to take the house, furnished, at 130l. per annum - He brought the agreement with him; he was to enter the house on the Thursday following; he had possession on the 13th of September. On the 12th of September, the day before he entered the house, he came and borrowed some linen of me to take to the house - He said his wife was in the country, and he had no linen until she returned I lent him nine pair of sheets, four napkins, six towels, six small tablecloths, six pair of fine pillow-cases, three servants' pillow-cases, and some chamber-towels. I delivered them into his hands on the 13th, with an inventory of them; he compared them with the inventory, I kept a copy of it. He told me he would bring Mrs. Gunn to say what I should have a week for the use of them-she never came, it was never settled with me as to what I was to have; he signed the agreement for taking the house.</p>

               <p>Q. The linen is distinct from the furniture left in the house - A. Yes. I delivered the key of the cellar to him on the 13th; there was one eight-gallon cask of currant-wine, and a gallon stone bottle there of mine; he said he would take care of them for me. On the 9th of October I called upon him for 5l. which he had agreed to pay me up to Michaelmas. He said he had not got it, but would go into the City and get it of a friend. He said he was sorry I had not asked him for it before, as he had lent a friend a sum of money for ten days, or he could have let me have money to any amount; he said he would send it to me by twelve o'clock - He did not. I received a letter, which I believe to be in his hand-writing. In consequence of information which I received, I suspected him, and applied to him for a reference to a respectable person - He referred me to Mr. Sandall, No.2, Wilson-street, Gray'sinn-lane. He said he was a Special Pleader.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 18th of October, did you go to the house in Smith-street - A. Mr. Paul, the broker, had levied a distress on the premises, and applied to me. I went to the house, and searched for the linen in every place, but could find none of it, except three sheets, three pillow-cases, and a few towels - We never found them. I went to the cellar, found the wine-bottle taken away, and the cask had only<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290040"/>a little wine at the bottom-the prisoner was not then in the house. I saw a boy there. I am not positive when I first went to the house, whether I saw a servant, or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. The 130l. was to be paid for the rent of the house and the use of the furniture - A. The articles stated in the indictment are not in the inventory of the furniture. I did not agree to let the house with the linen-it had nothing to do with the house.</p>
               <p>Q. He was to pay you for the use of the linen - A. He was to have it till his wife returned, for three weeks. When I delivered the linen, I expected Mrs. Gunn to come and say what was to be paid for the use of it. A distress was put into the house about a month after he took it. I asked him for the linen; he said, he would not give it up at so short a notice. Five pounds was to be paid for the house up to Michaelmas. The distress was put in because I could not pay the rent. There was not a basket of clothes in the kitchen.</p>

            . I am a broker. On the 8th of October I levied a distress in the house for rent due to Mr. Foulger, the landlord, and I took an inventory of the goods. I looked over part of the house, and the drawers and closets-the prisoner was on the premises; he refused to open four of the rooms. I told him I would send for a constable if he did not open them - He said he could not, and went away, saying, he would return presently. Finding he did not return I went out for a smith, and when I returned, which was in about an hour, I found him on the premises - I had left a man in possession. The prisoner said he would give up the keys, as he found when the landlord was in possession, it was no use withholding them. I went into these rooms, and took an account of every thing. I was very particular in taking the inventory, as I had received information before I went to the house. I found two sheets upon one bed, two pillow-cases and one sheet on another bed, and thirteen towels in the drawers, among which I reckon dusters, knife-cloths &amp;c.; I found no table-linen at all-there was no more linen in the house. I saw Mrs. Baylis the same day at a neighbour's house where she met me - I left my man in possession. I compared my inventory with Mrs. Baylis's. I did not go into the cellar until six days afterwards, I then found the cask there, with a little wine at the bottom. When I first saw the prisoner, he said, he knew pretty well what it was for, and he expected us there on the Saturday; and that he had a solicitor and counsel, and knew what he was about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prosecutrix desired me to take notice of the linen. I found the prisoner's wife, a girl, a boy, and a man, who was a friend of the female servant's, in the house. A great deal of the furniture was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the boxes under the bed on the second floor-A. There were none. I looked there.</p>
               <p>Q. In the second floor front room - A. There was a box, which the prosecutrix said belonged to her, and contained her clothes. The prisoner said the linen was gone to be washed-it would be home on Tuesday, and if we would come then we should have it-it was not brought home on the Tuesday. The prisoner absconded, and was taken into custody on the Tuesday. If there had been any more boxes I must have seen them. I did not examine the servants' boxes; they were in the back-room on the second floor.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.What passed between you and the prisoner about the linen - A. He said if I would come on Tuesday, and then I should have the linen; I had said nothing to him about linen-it was not brought back all the while I was possession which was six days.</p>

I missed a shirt out of a bundle, but did not suspect her-next week I lost two more, and lost the gentleman's custom; the week after that I lost three wet shirts, and accused the prisoner with taking them; she fell on her knees and called God to witness that she was innocent and knew nothing of them; I told her if she had pledged them, to tell me where, as I should lose my bread, being a widow with three children - She still denied it. I lost a brother, which put me in great trouble-the prisoner left my lodgings that week - I could do nothing with her at that time, until he was buried. I then went to her lodgings, and begged of her, if she had taken them, to own it; she insulted me very much, and said she was innocent. I have had no work since; about a fortnight ago, I received information,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290041"/>went to the pawnbroker's, and found one of my shirts; I had her taken up-five more have since been found at different pawnbrokers'.</p>

            ; our brewhouse is in Portpool-lane, and we have a cellar in John's Mews, Bedford-row; where we deposit store ale in reserve-it was not in the course of delivery at this time.</p>
               <p>JAMES WALKINSHAW. I am a publican, and keep the Surry Arms, in Surry-square, Kent-road. I have dealt with Messrs. Wyatt for four years; I used to pay 4l. per barrel for ale, I always gave the order to the collecting clerk and had it delivered at my house. I used to pay him the money when he came round. The prisoner, Blake, was their drayman; in April last, he brought some ale to my house in the regular way; I was in the cellar, he tapped me on the shoulder, a man named Collins was with him; Blake asked me if I should like to take a barrel or two of him - I asked him what he meant? he said, why I can bring you one or two barrels at half price. I asked him how he got them, he said he could get them from the Firm very well, as he had a good opportunity - I told him I would have nothing to do with it; he begged of me to take no notice - I told him I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. About two months after that-he, and Collins, came with some more ale. He said I was much to blame, as I had such a good opportunity, he could put 4l. or 5l. a week into my pocket regularly, for my house was conveniently situated, as he was passing the house to Greenwich; he then said, "you have got a family, and it will be of great help to you;" I told him it was my family that I considered, and I would have nothing to do with it on any account whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. On the 4th of September, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning; I thought they came for empty casks - They put two barrels of ale down, I asked them what they were.</p>
               <p>Q. We will pass over the 4th of September, in consequence of what passed then; when did you see Blake again - A. On the 10th, Mr. Blew came, I informed him of the conversation we had had together; Mr.

            , Blew, and myself made an arrangement.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, did you see Blake again - A. On the 16th, he brought three barrels of amber in the regular way; a strange man, named Cox, came with him; besides the three barrels of amber, he brought three barrels of ale, which I had not ordered; he put the amber into the alecellar - I was with him; he said it was not convenient to put the ale there, he put them into the porter-cellar. Mr. Blew was secreted in the liquor-cellar, which was only boarded off, to hear what passed. He had marked six 1l. notes of mine. Mears and Friend, two officers, were in the parlour. I asked Blake what was the price of the three barrels which were in the porter-cellar? he said 6l. I asked him how the money was to be divided, saying,"there is just the money." I had in my pocket the same 6l. which Blew had marked - He put them into his pocket. He said, "We draymen all know of it, and we all share alike." I said, "You must get them out from home, without it being known," He said, "We all share alike." Blake then sent me up for some washing tubs, to rack the ale off into porter-butts. He said, there then could be no suspicion; and he never left any casks that he brought on his own account.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the 10th or 16th of September did you see the prisoner Fabb - A. Yes; he brought two barrels in the regular way; he opened the cellar flap, and said, "Ah, Charley was in a hurry when he was here a day or two ago," noticing the flap. I said "what Charley?" he said,"why Blake." I asked him what he meant, he said,"Oh, we all know of it - We all share alike." When he was going away he called me to the door, and said, do not you want some more ale such as Blake brought the other day? I said I had ordered a barrel or two in the regular way; he said that would be just the thing, and went away with the dray - I believe this was on the Saturday before Tuesday the 16th. I went very early to Wyatts' on the Monday morning, and ordered three barrels to come early on the next morning, which was the 16th.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had this conversation about the washing tubs, you fetched the officers down - A. Yes, and they took Blake into custody in the cellar-this was on the 16th of September.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. I have lived seven years in that house; I declined the offer that was made to me in April.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it a very wicked proposal - A. Certainly, and rejected it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell Messrs. Wyatt - A. Because I promised I would not. I advised them to do nothing of the kind again; and I thought they would not make me the offer afterwards. I told the clerk I thought every thing was not going on right in the Firm.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you went to Wyatt's when he proposed it to you again - A. I had no proof, and thought they would not believe me. I never told until the 4th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you always called Walkingshaw - A. I never went by any other name.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you never called Walkingham - A.It was put in the Times newspaper as Walkingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever at Portsmouth - A. I was working very hard there on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Q. What for - A. For setting fire to a field of furze for the sake of the after grass. I was convicted at the Assizes, and received seven years for it-my right name is

               <p>ABRAHAM HUDSON. I am store-clerk to the prosecutors, and have been so six months; the prisoners were their draymen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any application made to you for some ale for Walkingshaw on the 16th of September - A. Yes; three barrels of beer were to go by a regular order, and three barrels was to go to Greenwich; Blake and Collins were the men who drove that dray, but Collins being ill Cox went for him. - I delivered the barrels to Blake. I saw the dray go from the brewhouse with all that was regularly ordered. The key of the storehouse is kept in the counting-house. After Blake had gone out he brought the storehouse key back and hung it up. He told me the day before that he wanted some ale for Walkingshaw, that we might divide the profits among us four-meaning the three prisoners and myself. Six barrels were given out in the regular way-three for Walkingshaw and three to go to Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Q. If nine went out three must have gone wrongfully - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Before I lived with Messrs. Wyatt, I was in business for myself; before that I lived clerk with Mr. Cowell, in the Borough - I left there because he moved. I did not see Blake in the storehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. You stole the ale, and they sold it - A. Yes, and shared the profits; I was taken up, and turned evidence to save myself. The three prisoners, Collins, and myself, were to share the profits.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COX. I am drayman to Messrs. Wyatt - I went out with Blake, because Collins was ill; I never went out with him before; we took six barrels from Port-pool-lane, we then went to the storehouse in St. John's Mews with the dray, and found the prisoners, Fabb and Payne, there; they got three barrels out of the cellar, and put them on the dray, with the six which were brought from Portpool-lane-all assisted in putting them on. I did not know they were doing wrong. Blake and I went on with the nine barrels to Walkingshaw's, and delivered six barrels there. I do not know what passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. I never took out much beer. I was taken into custody myself, but liberated, and am still in the prosecutors' employ. This was the first day I came into their service, as one of the men was ill. The barrels were let down the flap.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HEMMINGS. I take care of horses opposite the storehouse. On the 16th of September I saw the three prisoners taking some beer out of the store-cellar, with Cox, who was a stranger to me; I knew the others before.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BLEW. I am collecting-clerk to the prosecutors. On the 10th of September I called at Walkingshaw's, from what he told me, it was agreed that I should be at his house on the 16th, with two officers, when some beer should be delivered; I got there about six o'clock in the morning, and marked six 1l. notes of his, and gave them to him; I secreted myself in the spirit-cellar, where I could hear all that passed. About eight o'clock Blake came down, the cellar-flap was opened, and three barrels let down at the ale-cellar-three had been ordered regularly-three were put into the porter-cellar, which were not ordered; they were the prosecutors, barrels, and contained store ale-Blake put them there. Walkingshaw told Blake that Fabb was with him on the Friday before, and delivered two barrels of ale to a regular order, and after putting them in the cellar, Fabb asked him if he wanted any in the irregular way, and said he could serve him as well as Blake, and asked him if he could? Blake said he could, for they were both in the business, or to that effect. He then asked him if the storehouse-clerk(Hudson), was in it, he said he was, and that he was a d-d good fellow, and would come and smoke a pipe with him some Sunday. Walkingshaw said he supposed it was the same price as the last, and that was 6l., and put the notes into Blake's hand, who said it was right-the regular price of three barrels of ale is 12l. The officers came down, took Blake, and found the six 1l. notes which I had marked, on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. If the store ale turns out bad, we sell it to the porter brewers. Hudson generally gave directions for the delivery of the ale, and sometimes Mr. Wyatt. The store ale was not fit for immediate use. I heard every thing that passed. The publicans do not give the draymen any thing for bringing ale. I never made Walkingshaw any offer to give evidence.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FRIEND. I am a constable. I was at Walkingshaw's, and took Blake. I tapped him on the shoulder; he immediately called to Cox for a tickler. I produced my staff, and told him there was one. I told him I wanted the six notes he had received from Walkingshaw. He hesitated, and at last said they were in his right-hand pocket. I took them out, and asked him if any other person was concerned with him? he said there was not, and it was a bad job and he must make the best of it.</p>

I afterwards felt a bustle, which I thought was my husband taking his handkerchief out, it did not draw my attention. One of the officers came up, and asked my husband if he had lost any thing? he said he had not, and told me to look - I immediately missed my pocket-book, which contained one 2l. and three 1l. bank notes. The officer shewed me the pocket-book after the prisoners were taken.</p>

               <p>MR. JOHN CAMERON. I was with my wife. I did not see any person near me, in particular. The officers asked me if I had lost any thing? I had observed a bustle just before that between me and my wife, which I attributed to the crowd. When the prisoners were taken, the officers produced my wife's pocket-book.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JEFFERSON. I am an officer. I was in Southampton-street, while the procession was passing - I knew all the prisoners before, and saw them go up to Mr. and Mrs. Cameron - I had seen them in company together about four minutes before. I saw them crowding round Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, and watched them. When they went away, I sent Wilson immediately to ask if they had lost any thing-Mrs. Cameron missed her pocket-book. I followed the prisoners, and came up with Ryland, Barnett, and Ting, at the Carpenters' Arms, behind Exeter-change - I found them there; they were up in a corner together, in company. I said, "I am here as soon as you three." Barnett said, "What is the matter, master?" I told them to come into a private room - I wanted to search them-Pretty was with me; they went in. I do not know whether Ting went in. I found the room very dark - I asked for a candle; a little girl told me she could not give it to me. In the meantime, I observed Barnett putting something from his hand on the table, in the left-hand corner of the room, which was the darkest - I saw it glisten. I said, "That won't do, Bob, take it up again" - I told them to go into the tap-room, and I would search them there. I lit a piece of paper, and found a pocket-book under the cloth which laid on the knife-box. I found a pair of spectacles, a watch, and a handkerchief on Barnett. Mrs. Cameron claimed the pocket-book, with its contents - I secured them. Just as I finished searching them, Wilson brought Pullen in; we found nothing particular on him. I am sure I saw the four prisoners in company together, round Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, with another man, who is not in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Pullen was taken afterwards. There were two other men in the room when I found the prisoners there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I did not see them go into the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. There was a great crowd; they kept together all the way. They did not sell liquor at the house where I found them. The two other men remained in the room after I searched; they did not attempt to go out.</p>

             WILSON. I am an officer. I was in Southampton-street with Jefferson, and saw all the prisoners there; I had seen them together for two or three minutes before I saw Mrs. Cameron - I was on the opposite side of the way. They kept close together, and went close up to Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, another man was with them at the time. I did not see any motion of their hands. I immediately went up to Mrs. Cameron, who complained of losing her pocket-book. We immediately went up the Strand, towards Temple-bar; I went to the other side of Exeter-change, returned back by myself, and went up Burleigh-street - Change-alley comes into that street - I saw Pretty standing at the door of the Carpenters' Arms there. I went in, and saw the prisoners, Ryland, Barnett, and Ting, in custody; I went to look for the others. I found Pullen coming up the Strand, on the same side of the way, and within three doors of Southampton-street, nearer to Temple-bar. I asked him how he did? he said, he was very well, and the procession was very handsome; we talked together. He asked me if I would have any think to drink? I told him I would not, but we were going to a public-house, and there we might drink with him, as there were some people there who would be glad to see him. I kept close to him, and took him into the Carpenters' Arms. Jefferson searched him, and told him what he was charged with.</p>
               <p>ROBERT PRETTY. I was with Jefferson and Wilson in Southampton-street - I knew the prisoners before, and saw them with another man, who is not in custody; they were in company together. I saw them all go up to Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, they staid three or four minutes; I went up with Wilson-Mrs. Cameron missed her pocket-book. I accompanied Jefferson to the Carpenters' Arms, and found Barnett, Ting, and Ryland there. Jefferson said he wanted them, and took them into the next room-Barnett went in first. Jefferson said to Barnett, "that will not do." I saw something done. He got a light, and produced a pocket-book, which Mrs. Cameron afterwards claimed.</p>

I was present when they took two barrels of ale from the storehouse; they told me a publican would take a barrel or two, when they came home at night; Blake told me he had delivered two barrels to Salmon, and was to call another time for the money. Salmon, kept the White Horse, in Brick-lane. Blake told me two or three times that Salmon had not paid him for it - I never was paid for it. After I was taken up I mentioned this to Messrs. Wyatt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. The ale was in the course of regular delivery at this time. I was taken up for robbing my masters.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did they know what was the regular load - A. They did.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SALMON. I am a publican, and keep the White Horse, in Brick-lane. I knew the prisoner, Blake, he delivered two barrels of ale to me in the middle of May - I had not ordered them - I thought Mr. Wyatt had sent them. He said his master ordered him to bring them. I might have seen Collins before. Mr. Wyatt has sent amber to me several times without my ordering it.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you have not often seen the other prisoner at the bar - A. I do not know him. (Go close to him.) - I am certain that I know nothing of him - I have no recollection of him - I have no knowledge of his having been at my house. I knew there was some other person with Blake. Blake applied to me for payment within three weeks or a month afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. About how long ago did he apply to you for payment - A. I cannot exactly say. He said, he came for the money for the beer, as the storehouse clerk wanted his share. I did not see him again till three weeks after.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me all that passed at that time - A. He did not tell me any sum. He said, "Let me have some money." I said, "What money? - I never pay you, I only pay the collecting clerk." He never said what sum he wanted - He met me in the street at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, in your hearing, mention to your wife, or any other person, what sum of money he wanted - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In about six weeks after he applied to you again - A. I met him in the street, he asked me for some drink, and said, "I hope you will pay me the money. I said,"I will pay you no money."</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear he never mentioned any sum of money to you - A. No; I usually paid Mr. Blew every month.</p>
               <p>Q. Six weeks had elapsed between the delivery and his applying to you for payment. Had the collecting clerk applied to you during that time for money - A. He had. My wife always paid. I never got a receipt for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not your wife been subpoened here - A. She is very ill - She is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not say she was ill - A. My boy is ill; she is not ill. My boy is not expected to live. She did not go before the Grand Jury. The beer was afterwards taken away by Mr. Blew. Blake said, the storehouse clerk wanted him to get the money, as he was to have part of it. I told no person of it-that was three weeks after it was put down in the cellar. When beer comes in, either me or my wife signs the book; I never signed for it.</p>

I looked through the window, and saw the prisoner, and another man, in the shop. I went into the shop, and saw the other man leaning over my counter, in the act of taking something. As I came into the shop he ran out with a jar of snuff-the prisoner asked me for a pennyworth of tobacco. I ran after the man - I could not find him; I returned, thinking the prisoner might rob me. I asked him why he let the man go out? he said he wanted a penny worth of tobacco. I had the prisoner taken up as an accomplice. He said he saw the jar under the man's arm, but he had no business with it.</p>

On the 25th of October, about ten o'clock at night, I obscrved the prisoner and two others lurking about the prosecutrix's window - I watched them - I looked very hard at the prisoner; they moved from the window. I went up stairs. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290048"/>had not been up more than a minute before Mrs, Beach gave the alarm. I came down, and saw the prisoner in the shop.

On the 24th of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner hired my truck for an hour or two; he said he had taken a house opposite to me, and was going to remove his goods. The truck not being brought home that night, I enquired, and found he had not taken the house. I went to New Inn-yard, where he said he lived, but could not find him. I have never found the truck.</p>

On the 27th of October, I came home between one and two o'clock and found my door unlocked; I went out a little before eight o'clock. I am certain I had locked the door - I locked it again, and went out at two o'clock; I looked round my room and saw a box open - I thought I might have left it open myself; I did not know that anything had been taken. I returned a little after ten o'clock at night, and saw my landlady, and told her that my door had been opened. I went up stairs without a light, took the key to open it, and found it again unlocked; I struck a light and saw a small mahogany box, where I kept my money, placed on the table - I looked round my room and missed a clean shift, which I had placed on the bed. I went to the landlady and told her what I had missed, and staid with her till her husband came home; we went up stairs, and missed the articles stated in the indictment. The landlady found that the door had been forced-the edge and the door-post had been broken-it had not been forced with any great violence. The next morning, the prisoner, Jones, was taken up.</p>

            . I live on the second floor in the house. On Sunday morning, Mrs. Payne told me she had been robbed, and told me to take notice of anybody who came down; I was sitting in my room and heard a great noise at her door, up stairs; I went out, went up a few stairs, and saw the prisoner, Jones, opening her door with a fork - I ran up and called out, "here is the thief!" he ran into his mother's room - I took him back and shewed him the fork, which he had left in the door; he at first denied having been near the door - He then acknowledged he had been there twice the day before. I sent for Mrs. Payne - She gave him in charge.</p>

            . On Monday morning, the prisoner, Jones, brought me down a pair of stockings, and asked me if I knew where I could go and sell them; I told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290050"/>I thought Mrs. Sullivan would buy them; I took them to her - He said he would wait at the chapel steps, in Peter-street, while I took them to her - She had only got two-pence halfpenny. I came out - He gave me an halfpenny out of it. He went up stairs again and brought down a shift and an apron - I took them to Sullivan, she was going out with her milk pails, she went in doors and took them - She had no halfpence - She was to give me 4d. for the two. He went up stairs again and brought down a pocket-book, we took that down as far as Peter-street, and he waited at the corner of the chapel steps; I came back again to him with the pocket-book, gave it to him, and said I would have nothing more to do with it; I told him I would give him the halfpenny back to-morrow. He went home, and I also went home; Jones threw the pocket-book into the brewer's cellar, at the sign of the Cock, in Cock-court. I took two pair of stockings to Sullivan, the first time.</p>
               <p>EDMUND PEPPER. I am a constable. I was sent for, and took the prisoner, Jones, into custody; he said Manley had encouraged him to rob the prosecutrix - He said Manley asked him if there was anybody, who lodged in the house, that went out to work, and he told him, yes; Manley then said, "what a fool he was that he did not break open the door and rob them," and that Manley said he would bring him a bunch of keys if he would unlock the door-but as he could not procure the keys, he persuaded him to break it open with a fork; and that he brought the things down, and gave them to Manley, who took them to Sullivan's, in Peter-street; he afterwards saw him, and he refused to give him any money for what he had received for them. He described Manley to me, and I took him - He denied it before the magistrate, and afterwards confessed he had carried the thigns. Plank and I went to Sullivan's, and found her husband, intoxicated, by the fire; as soon as we entered the apartment there was a sort of an alarm; young Sullivan was melting some pewter, which we thought were pots - He ran under the bed and hid himself. Plank found a pair of stockings in the room, which was claimed as part of the property; when the prisoner, Sullivan, was brought to the watch-house, the shift was found on her back.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Mrs. Sullivan's, in Peter-street; she placed herself in the door-way - I was under the necessity of forcing myself in; her eldest son ran to the bed and put something into it; I put my hand in, and found it was hot pewter. I searched a box, and found a pair of stockings - I asked her how they came there? she said a boy had left them with her son the day before; I asked her where the shift, apron, and other things were that he had brought; she said she knew nothing about anything, except the stockings, which were left with her youngest son; I found her youngest son, and asked her if that was him, she said, "yes;" he said nobody had left any stockings with him - I took her to the office. I desired the prosecutrix to look at the shift she had on her back; she immediately called out, "she has my shift on her back." I made her take it off.</p>
