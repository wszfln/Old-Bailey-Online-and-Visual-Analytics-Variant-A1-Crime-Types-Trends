On the 8th of March, about a quarter past six o'clock in the afternoon, I saw these eight shirts hanging on a line in my front parlour to dry; they hung near the window, which was open - it was nearly dusk. I missed them about twenty minutes to seven. There is a garden in front of the house, which lays rather back from the road; a person could reach them with a stick, but not with their hands; there were marks of two persons' footsteps on the mould under the window; I cannot say whether they were men's or women's footsteps - I saw nobody about. I sent bills round to the pawnbrokers, and Lloyd produced one of the shirts to me; they belong to different gentlemen who I wash for - I cannot replace them for 6l. - The smallest footmark looked like a woman's shoe.</p>

On Thursday, the 9th of March, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to pawn this shirt, for 5s.; I observed the mark had been picked out, and asked her who it belonged to - she said her husband. She has pawned female apparel with me before. Having been informed of the robbery I gave her in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I left nobody in the shop - I only went a few steps, merely across the avenue, and was talking to a neighbour, when the witness, Woodman, came up, and said something to me; I instantly went back to my shop, and the clock was gone; I have not seen it since - I would have given 20l. for it - it was a large table clock, and very heavy; it was rather antique, had a mahogany pedestal, with a great deal of brass work, and a silver face. The shop is part of my dwelling-house.</p>

I was in the Albany on the morning of the 10th of March, and saw the prisoner there; I first saw him in St. James's-street, with another young man, and followed them in to the Albany - the other young man went into Mr. Porker's shop; the prisoner stopped, and was looking in at the window; I saw the young man come out of the shop with a clock - he put it down at the entrance of the Albany; (the shop is close to the gate) - the prisoner said to him, "Cannot you carry it?" he (the prisoner) put his apron over it, took it up, and went away with it, down Burlington-gardens, and the other down Sackville-street. I asked Mr. Porker if he knew the man who had got the clock - he was inside the next shop. The other person was a young man - I am sure I saw them both together from St. James's-street to the Albany. I saw the prisoner again three or four days after, looking down some areas; and about two days afterwards I saw him in Charlotte-street, and told Bond, who took him.</p>

On the 3d of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I went out with my wife, leaving Ann Thomas, my servant, in charge of the house. We returned about three o'clock in the morning, and found the watchman at the door - he informed me the house had been broken open.</p>
               <p>ANN THOMAS. I am servant to Mr. Hart. I sat up in the front kitchen for my master and mistress till nearly 2 o'clock in the morning, with a light; there is only one window to the kitchen, and that was hasped, and the shutter was closed, and fastened with a wooden bar; it is an inside shutter, lined with tin - I fastened it about eight o'clock; I bolted and locked the front door about ten. I went up stairs to lay down about two, keeping the candle a light; I thought I heard a knock at the front door - I went down, and found the door as I had left it - I opened it, looked about, and saw nobody; I bolted it again, then went to the back parlour door, which I had left nearly closed, and found it wide open - I went into the back parlour; and as I opened the door, between that and the front parlour, this man stood facing me behind the door; he had no light - I had a candle in my hand; I asked what he did there - he said,"I beg your pardon." I asked again what he wanted there; he said nothing more; I shut the door between the two parlours, went about half way up stairs, and cried out, "Murder!" he rushed out of the parlour, and ran down the kitchen stairs; I followed him - he jumped out of the kitchen window, which was then open - it looks into the area - I had left it shut and fastened. I went to the street door, and called the watchman; while I was speaking to him, another watchman and the constable of the night brought the prisoner along; I knew him again, and am sure of his person - I saw sufficient of him in the parlour to know him; they took him away: one of the watchmen remained at the door till they returned; I went into the back parlour, and found a small trinket box was taken off the mantel-piece, and put on a chair, and opened; I had seen it on the shelf before I went up stairs; I missed from it my mistress's scent-box, attached to a chain, seals, and key, also two brooches, and another seal; I had put them into the box that afternoon, after mistress left - a gold pin was also taken from the box. A box of papers had been opned, and the papers strewed about the table. I went into the front parlour, and missed two silver thimbles out of a cotton box on the table, and master's spectacles from the table drawer; the time-piece was taken off the mantel-piece, but not gone. I found a gownpiece taken out of the cupboard, and laid on the same table. I then went into the front kitchen, and found the shutter bar gone, part of the shutter broken away, and a pane of glass was broken near the hasp, which was broken off, and the sash up. I found a pair of men's shoes on the floor of the back kitchen. Price took charge of them. - I found the bar in the coal-hole.</p>

I searched, and found on him two silver thimbles,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060005"/>a gold pin, a small seal, a child's coral, and three kuives. I then went back to Mr. Hart's, and saw the shoes found in the back kitchen - he had no shoes on when I took him.

I took the shoes to the watch-house - the prisoner said, "Those are my shoes;" I gave them to him, and he put them on; we then searched him again, and found a gold chain, seals, and key.

Samuel Rand, my fellow-shopman, was with me- we parted, and went in different directions, and in about twenty minutes I saw the prisoner and another come to the shop window; there were lights in one window, but nobody in the shop; they passed the window two or three times, did something, and went to the adjoining shop, which is a bookseller's, then returned, and looked into both our shop windows; I could not distinctly see what they did, but I saw one of them put his hand to the window - they went away, returned again, and afterwards I saw the prisoner's hand within the window, which was then broken; I am sure it was within, up to his wrist - I am quite sure of that - I did not see him take any thing: I went and seized him - the officer had gone away; I took him to Bow-street. The broken glass laid inside the window; some tortoise-shell combs laid near that glass, and when I took him I observed that a comb laid partly in and partly out of the window, and the ticket, which was on that comb was gone from it - it was found outside the window by somebody. The other man ran away; the prisoner had taken his hand out of the window when I seized him.</p>

I went back to my coach - he wished me to go back, and we again went into the public-house; he laid hold of my collar, and I went back with him; he ordered another quartern of gin - the publican said I had had sufficient, and would not allow them to give me any more, and I refused myself; he laid hold of my watch-chain twice while I was in the house, fumbling, as if he was playing with it- I buttoned up my coat, saying, "I won't give you half a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060006"/>chance;" we went out to the coach again - it was then eleven o'clock; the coach was in the rank alone - the prisoner went out with me, and asked if I could spar any - I said, No, not that night; he immediately struck me in my left breast, and knocked me down; my hat fell off - I found him pulling at my watch-chain; I laid hold of my watch pocket - he pulled me along, knocked my head on the stones, and I became insensible. When I recovered I found myself on the ground; he had then absconded, and my watch was gone; the waterman and two gentlemen helped me up, and I went home in my coach - a man drove me home. I described him at the office, and he was taken on Good Friday. I am sure he is the man.</p>

The prisoner attempted to spar with Hughes, who did not wish him to do it; they left together- Hughes then appeared to know what he was about; I thought him able to drive home; he came next morning, and asked if I knew the man whom he drank with - I had seen him at my house two or three times before.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was at the Gun, and saw Hughes, the prisoner, and another man come in; they had three half quarterns of gin, and then went away- returned in half an hour, and quartern of gin was called for - the prisoner wished Hughes to drink it very much, but he refused; the prisoner tried to pour it down his throat; I stepped up, and took it out of his hand - they went away together; Hughes appeared able to take care of himself; I went away in quite a different direction; I have seen the prisoner many times before. When Hughes came in the second time I saw the prisoner dragging him by the collar, and I thought I heard something jingle when he was pulling him about.</p>

I saw his coach in Smithfield he had nearly a hundred people round him; a person offered to see him home - he said "No, you will rob me;" at last I got on the box with him, and went with him as far as Sutton-street; he fell off the box six times - he would go down Sutton-street, saying it was his way home- he drove to Warburton's mad-house, as he would go there; it was no thoroughfare - he turned back, and drove to Shoreditch church; he was called for a job, and would not go with it; I bid him good night, and went home.</p>

            . I am house-maid to Mr. Tickell. I found a small box under a pair of steps in the passage leading from mistress' bed-room to the spare room, on Friday, the day before the prisoner was apprehended; I had never seen it before I found it there. I took it up to the nurse directly; there were two watch-hooks, two or three beads, and a hair ring in the box; it was given to Foster. Next day (Saturday) master told me to call the prisoner down stairs - I found her in her bed-room; I and two other servants slept in that room; I said, "Martha, if you please you must come down into the dining-room, master wishes to see you; she said, "What for?" I said,"I don't know - master wants to see us all together, in the dining-room;" she said she could not go down, for if she did she should faint; she had not been ill before; I said,"You must, for they are all waiting for you in the dining-room - master, and the rest of the servants; "she said she could not, or she should faint; she went down one pair of stairs with me, and then said she wanted her pocket handkerchief - I went up, and fetched it for her, leaving her there, and when I returned she was gone; I went down another pair of stairs, and saw mistress' bed-room door standing open, which was not usual; I went into the room and said, "Martha, are you here?" I got no answer - I said again, "Martha, are you here?" and then she answered from the closet where I had found the box; the closet has a door to it, and forms a passage. I said, "Come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060007"/>Martha, we must go down stairs;" she said, "Oh! dear! I feel so faint - I must smell mistress' smelling-bottle," which stood on the mantel-piece - she did so. We then went down stairs - I met master and some of the servants on the stairs, with the officers; we then went up into our own bed-room, to have our boxes searched - the prisoner went up with us; I staid till my box was searched, and when the officer was going to search the prisoner's box I told Amy, the laundry-maid, I wanted to speak to her - I went down into the passage by mistress' bed-room with her (my mistress was in the breakfast room), and when I came out of the closet I observed the corner of the counterpane tucked in between the more than usual; I pulled out the corner to put it properly, and out dropped the smelling-bottle; I called Amy back, and shewed it to her- I then lifted up the bed, and there lay all mistress' things together, tucked between the bed and mattress. - Amy called Foster down - he came, and saw them there before I removed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You went up and found her in the bed-room? A. Yes - she was alone- her box stands in that room; she has only one box; I did not leave the bed-room till she came down with me; I do not think she had any thing in her hand when she was coming down, but I did not notice her hands. We have a nurse, nurse-maid, footman, cook, laundry-maid, and several servants; I had been in mistress' room, and helped to make the bed about ten o'clock - it was about three when master sent me up for her. None of the other servants are here; four servants slept in the room up stairs, but the prisoner slept in an adjoining room; she goes through our room to get to her own. We all pass mistress' room to go down.</p>

I found eight duplicates in the box - one was for two shirts, three handkerchiefs, and two pairs of stockings, pawned at Beauchamp's, Holborn-bars - I went there. I produce the things found in the bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search her box entirely the first time? A. No - I was called down; I saw her open it for me to search; she had no opportunity of going down to the bed-room after that - another young woman was in the room with her; she said the keys were hers the instant I produced them.</p>

I know these shirts to be master's, also one pair of stockings, and two handkerchiefs; I do not know who the other stockings belong to. I have seen mistress' watch several times, hanging at the head of the bed, and the necklace and brooch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whether your mistress gave her maid old articles you cannot tell? A. She has frequently - she is very generous. I never knew her give any but silk handkerchiefs away.</p>
               <p>MR. TICKELL. I know the watch to be Mrs. Tickell's; it is worth 10l. - it cost 24l., and is gold. I know the seals - they were attached to the watch - they are gold - also the chain and slide; here is a ring, a vinegaret, and a smelling-bottle, all of which I knew.</p>

I found the screws of the hasp were wrenched; I missed two sovereigns, six half-crowns, five shillings, a blue coat, a black waistcoat, a blue silk handkerchief, and a pair of breeches. I went out that night in search of the prisoners, but could not find them - they did not come home that night. I gave information at the office next morning, and did not see either of them again till the Monday following, when I saw Jobbins in the park - I got Pace, an officer, to take him. I saw Frazer on Sunday, the 12th of March, at Millbank, and said to him, "Ayn't you a pretty fellow?" he said di<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060008"/>rectly, "I know nothing about it;" he then said his mother was waiting at my lodging, with three sovereigns for me; I said I should wait with him till his mother came back - he stood a good bit, and then said he was waiting for a person, and asked me to go round to his mother's - I had him secured; his mother lived about five minutes walk from my lodging.</p>

I know Jobbins by working down the stable yard, and Frazer by seeing him down the yard with him; Calcott's shop is at the corner of the stable yard. I saw them together in the yard about six o'clock on Wednesday evening, the 15th of February - they were at the foot of the stairs where the prosecutor lodged; I lodge in the next house - the foot of master's stairs and Calcott's both come together. Frazier went half way up stairs - Jobbins stood at the foot of the stairs; Frazer said, "Come on Tom - I have got the key - it is all right," and he then followed him. Next morning, at six o'clock, I heard of the robbery.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took both the prisoners into custody. I examined the box - it had been forced open by a blunt instrument. I found a piece of iron in the fire-place on the 21st; the end of it exactly fits the marks on the box, and there is a little paint on the end of it, the same colour as the box. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster.</p>
               <p>FRAZER'S Defence (written). On the night of the 15th of February I got the key of the room from the landlady, and went up stairs, for the purpose of getting my great coat - I then came down, and went to my tea, leaving the key in the door; I returned in an hour - the key was still in the door; I locked it, came down, and went to the theatre. I went home at twelve o'clock, and found the gates closed against me; I was forced to walk the streets all night, and next morning I met two women on Westminster-bridge, who said Fergusson had been robbed, and I was supposed to be concerned; I said I was not. I went home to my mother at night, and found it was true; she told me she could not let me remain there, for the officers were ready to take me up. I went to Gravesend to try for work - my cousin there could not give me work - I returned in about a week to my mother's- I met her in Francis-street; she said she dare not let me into her house, for the officers had been there, I was obliged to sleep in lodging-houses, and next morning I heard Jobbins was in custody. On the Sunday after I saw Furgeson - he asked if I was not ashamed of what I had done; I said I knew nothing of the charge; he gave me a pint of beer, and said if I would tell him who it was he would not hurt me - I said if I knew I would tell him - he then came down to my mother, and told her what I had said, and had me taken - I am innocent.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Your attention was called to three persons? A. Yes; I found my handkerchief in his possession in about half a minute - he was separated from the other two; I did not see him in their company - he produced it himself on my collaring him; it was quite concealed in his breast; the gentleman directed my attention to three persons - two on one side, and one on the other.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. Were there any other persons with Daniel Sullivan? A. There were two or three others. I had not supplied much beer - Bryant went out with the prisoners, or within two or three minutes after them. I remember Sullivan wishing Daniel Collins to pay for a pot of beer - Collins appeared to be the prisoners' friend - he objected to pay; the servant took the beer to them.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH REARDEN. On the 11th of March I was at the Rose and Crown with my father, in company with Daniel Sullivan, who lived at my father's house at Bromley. I know the prisoners and Florance Bryant - they lived between the public-house and our house - we pass their house to go home - I saw the prisoners and Bryant at the public-house between nine and ten o'clock - they went out a good while before us - I left with my father and Sullivan between eleven and twelve o'clock, and passed the prisoner's house in our way home - there is only another house between theirs and the pathway, and as I passed I saw Dennis McCarthy standing outside his door - another person was with him - I do not know who - I saw McCarthy put his head inside the door when he heard my father coming by - he was speaking - I do not know what McCarthy said, but I heard him speak. Florance McCarthy and Florance Bryant then came out with him, and Florance Bryant's wife, and Daniel Collins and a boy;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060012"/>Dennis McCarthy had a stick in his hand - I saw nothing in Florance McCarthy's hand then; he caught hold of my father by the shoulder, and told him he was not going off so easy as he went off before; Dennis McCarthy got behind my father, with a stick, and hit him on the head with it - my father and him struggled for the stick, and Florance McCarthy hit my father with a poker - I do not know where he got it; I was helping my father and he struck me also on the cheek with the poker; I went away for assistance, to get my father from them, and at this time saw Daniel Sullivan leaning against a paling a little distance off - I left him there when I went away for help - I returned soon after without any further help, and found my father laying at the corner of a garden near the spot - I picked him up - he was bleeding very much - Daniel Sullivan was leaning on the same place - I had not been away five minutes - there was a ditch a little distance off from where the fight began - I saw the deceased and Daniel McCarthy in the ditch - they were standing about - I was afraid to go near the ditch, but I saw Dennis McCarthy hitting Sullivan a good many times - I do not know what he had in his hand - I did not see Florance Bryant nor Florance McCarthy when I returned. Dennis McCarthy kept striking him for a quarter of an hour in the ditch - I could not see whether Sullivan resisted - he had nothing in his hand while he was by the paling; there were several women about the ditch - they pulled him out - I and Lyons brought him home; just after I got home I went for a surgeon, as he was all over blood and dirty ditch water - he died on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you been at the public-house? A. From six till between eleven and twelve o'clock - I only had two pints of porter. I have had a few words and blows with Daniel Collins, about Christmas, but it was made up before this. Sullivan made no observation about Collins paying for the beer. It was dark but there were lights brought when he was in the ditch - the ditch is not far from where the fight began.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were fighting? A. Dennis and Florance McCarthy were beating my father - I and my father tried to prevent them as well as we could - McCarthy stood at his door, with his face towards us as we passed. I remember nothing about a challenge; I never swore I did not see them strike the deceased, or that I was not sure McCarthy was the man in the ditch; I could see that he was hitting him; my father was speaking to Sullivan when we came by the prisoner's house.</p>

            . I am a gentleman's servant. I was at the Rose and Crown with my son and Sullivan; we left the house between nine and ten o'clock I think; and when I got into Mann's building my son and another young man were before Sullivan and me - I observed Dennis McCarthy coming with a stick in his hand, and said to Sullivan "Dan, Dan, look out, there is something coming;" I had hardly spoken these words before Dennis McCarthy struck me with the stick on the head; I had had no quarrelling with him at all lately; Florance Mc-Carthy then came after me and struck me with a poker - I put my arm up - I was insensible - the blood spirted out of my arm - I got the sleeve of my coat torn with the point of the poker; I also received a blow with a fist in my right eye, and that brought me to the ground; I lay there some time, and cannot say what happened then to Sullivan; when I recovered my son stood there, calling out "My father is murdered!" The prisoners were at the public-house that evening, and went before us; my son took me home - the blood ran very fast from my head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had had no quarrel with Dennis McCarthy lately? A. No; we had a few words about three weeks before, but no quarrel - there were a good many persons in the public-house, but not drinking with us; Magan, who was with my son, and young Gay, came in; I cannot say whether Gay came out with us; Dennis McCarthy struck me the blow before he spoke a word to me, or I to him; it happened between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you from between nine and ten, when you left the house? A. Going home; I did not hurry myself - I do not think that I live half a mile from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not McCarthy's house shut up when you passed? A. I did not look at the house - I did not see him till he was coming up - nobody told me he was standing at the doorway - I heard nobody call out to the persons in McCarthy's house - I recollect hearing Mrs. Bryant's voice in the road, but not seeing her - I saw her just inside the Rose and Crown.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. Had you passed the house when you were struck? A. No, I was just coming up - we might stop on our way from the public-house and talk - we did not hurry.</p>

            . I am the deceased widow. On the 11th of March, between nine and ten o'clock, I went to fetch him from the Rose and Crown - he spoke to me outside the house, and I went home; a woman came to my house between eleven and twelve, and said something; I went out and found him laying down, and a man jumping on his back, about ten yards from McCarthy's house; I saw his face all over blood; just as I came up I saw Florance Bryant make a run, and leap on my husband's body - just on his side - I took him up and led him towards home; Florance McCarthy came up and hit him three blows with a stick on the back of his head; Jack Magan was with him; Florance Bryant tripped my husband up into a ditch - I cannot say where Florance Mc-Carthy was then - Dennis McCarthy jumped down upon him as he was endeavouring to get from the ditch - he laid hold of his head with one hand, and dipped his head into the ditch, and struck him for a full quarter of an hour he kept beating him - I stood by but could do nothing - when I saw him almost murdered I thought it right to take care of my life for my family. Mrs. McCarthy took my husband out of the ditch by the collar; I took hold of his shoulder, Lyons took hold of his legs, and we got him out of the ditch - got him home, and went for the doctor; he was not quite sensible till the doctor came; we carried him home - he could not walk - he died on Tuesday evening; I said to him on Sunday "Do you think you shall recover?" he said he did not know, but if he did he should never be able to do any thing; on the Tuesday, between twelve and one o'clock, he said "Take me out of bed and make the bed;" I did so; he said "Mary, make haste, for I am almost gone - I am a dead man;" he died about six o'clock; he said Florance Bryant, and his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060013"/>lodgers, were the cause of his death; the prisoners are Bryant's lodgers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Florance Bryant is the man who took a running leap on your husband's body? A. Yes; Magan's son was at the public-house that night; I cannot say whether the father was; Dennis McCarthy is the man who jumped upon my husband in the ditch - I knew him by sight but not by name; he jumped into the ditch, not on my husband; the water in the ditch was as high as my breast, I think.</p>

            . I live at Bromley. On Saturday night, the 11th of March, at twelve o'clock, I heard a noise - I jumped up and came out, and the first I met was Daniel Sullivan, all over blood; I asked who was that - he said it was him; I knew him by his voice; the prisoners were within hearing; I asked him what was the matter - he said Florance Bryant and his lodgers were after killing him - we were three or four yards from the ditch; I turned round to go home, and immediately heard a great plunge in the ditch; I asked who was in the ditch; a woman said it was Daniel Sullivan - Dennis McCarthy was in the ditch hitting Dan Sullivan - there was only a little of his head to be seen; Florance McCarthy was on the bank of the ditch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear any noise before? A. The noise awoke me; I was not a moment getting up- I only put my cloak on; they were a good distance from McCarthy's house - nearer to Sullivan's; they live about 200 yards apart; I was not a yard from the ditch when Dennis McCarthy jumped in.</p>

            . I am constable of Bromley. A watchman applied to me at twelve o'clock on the 11th of March - I went to Rearden's house, where the deceased lay; I afterwards went to Florance Bryant's house - the door was bolted; I knocked two or three times, and at last, after threatening to break it open, somebody opened it; I went in - the first thing I saw was Florance Bryant going up stairs, on seeing me; I and the watchman followed him up; the door of the bed-room was fastened - I threatened to break it open, and a voice within said they would come down as soon as they were dressed; I came down, leaving the watchman at the room door, and heard a voice outside exclaim, "The e is somebody getting out of the window;" I went out - Florance McCarthy dropped from the window; I secured him - he then had a clean shirt and trousers on. Dennis McCarthy was secured in the house; he was also in clean linen. The ditch is very dirty, and had a great deal of water in it at that time. Mrs. Burke gave me a poker on Wednesday, the 15th of March.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On the 11th of March, at midnight, I was called to the deceased - I found him laying on a bed at Rearden's house, much exhausted, but sensible. I found several wounds on his head - one on the back of his head, one on the forehead, and another near the eye; I attended him till death, and afterwards examined his body; the whole of his back was one livid bruise - I opened the body - the small intestines were in a state of great inflammation; it appeared to me to have been occasioned by repeated blows; the inflammation of the intestines was the cause of his death - it became gangrene; he was quite a healthy subject, except a very old complaint in the liver, from which he had recovered - that had nothing to do with his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you discover any disease? A. None whatever; there was inflammation about the kidneys.</p>
               <p>Florance McCarthy, in his Defence, entered into an account of a quarrel between Rearden, and one Collyer, a few weeks previous to this transaction, and stated, that on the 11th of March Collyer and Rearden quarrelled again at the public-house, about a pint of beer, when the deceased was going to strike him with the pot, but was prevented - that they went home, and about 12 o'clock Rearden and his party came to the door, and called Collyer out to fight - when Bryant asked why he made a disturbance at his house at that late hour - they got fighting, and the deceased attacked Bryant's wife, and tore her clothes; she called out Murder! and they went to her assistance, but used no violence to him; they went in doors, and in a few minutes heard a noise and went out, hearing the men were fighting in the ditch, and saw Florance Bryant and a woman helping him out of the ditch.</p>
               <p>DENNIS McCARTHY's Defence. The first of this was Jack Barry and Con Rearden had been to Lambeth-street, about an assault; Collins was a witness, and Rearden said he would serve him out for it. He came to our lodgings once or twice, stripped, called us out to fight, and said he would have blood or something - and on the night this accident happened the deceased and Reardens were drinking at the Rose and Crown; Collins drank out of their pot and they wanted him to pay for a pot - he refused, and the deceased put up a pot, and said he would strike him with it. About twelve o'clock they came to our house, and called him all manner of names; the landlady came out, and was attacked: we went out - Rearden told me to go home to his lodgings with him - I did so, and as I returned I saw Sullivan near the ditch - he struck me and I struck him; we both rolled into the ditch, and I do not know what happened. I was all covered with mud and stuff.</p>

            .

On the 7th of November I told her her mistress would sleep in town next night, and to prepare her room; and at half-past ten o'clock on the 8th of November, I went home with my wife, and my apprentice informed me the prisoner had left - she never returned; I did not see her again till Monday last, when a friend stopped her, and brought her to me; I gave charge of her. My name is on the cloth at full length - it was locked up; the drawer must have been opened by a false key; I had had it some years, but it was seldom used. I think I gave 10l. for it.</p>

I found the prisoner in her bed-room on the 31st of March, at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon - he was a stranger, and must have come in at the top of the house - he could go along the roofs from the prosecutor's to our house. I laid hold of him - he said he was after a pigeon which had flown over the house. These seven handkerchiefs were found on him.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN CLAY. I live with Mr. Curling, a salmon salesman. This salmon was in my care, to be weighed and delivered to master's customers; on the 14th of March - about ten minutes past five o'clock in the morning I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060017"/>missed it from a basket at <placeName id="t18260406-31-crimeloc164">Billingsgate</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there none in the market but what you had? A. None; I did not go round the market to see, but I can tell without that - if any had been left the day before it would not be of this quality; they come from Ireland to master; I had sold a box and a half of salmon that morning to different people- there might be twelve in each box.</p>

            . I am a fellowship porter at Billingsgate. I saw both the prisoners that morning, a few yards from each other. I saw Painter stoop to Curling's basket: he appeared to have a fish in his hand; he went towards the bridge; whether he took the fish away I cannot tell - Benjamin followed him immediately. I heard in two or three minutes that a fish had been stolen and sold. Clay went in pursuit, and in half an hour I saw them standing close together opposite the market; Benjamin then had a tub with a salmon in it; I told Clay they were the men who I supposed had it; Benjamin was stopped first - I saw the kit and salmon at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Benjamin works about the market? A. Yes; he carries fish about sometimes.</p>

            . I am a salmon weigher. I saw the prisoners in the market - they were sometimes together; I saw Stephenson and Clay together, and in consequence of what they said I went round the market - in half an hour I saw the prisoners together - Benjamin had a salmon kit under his arm; I told Clay; Stephenson was close to me; Benjamin held his finger up to me - I saw him pass the salmon kit over to Painter, and, in five minutes, I saw Painter brought into the watch-house, with the kit and salmon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was half an hour after the fish was missed that you saw them? A. Yes; it is not common to see fresh salmon in a kit, I did not take them, as Stephenson did not mention their names; he only described their dress; the prosecutor had all the salmon which came that morning. I have known Benjamin twenty years - he was often in the market buying fish. The prosecutor had sold about twenty-two that morning, but had not delivered them.</p>

On the 3d of April, about one o'clock in the night, I was going home - I got out of a hackney-coach in St. John-street - I had come from Deptford; my sister, whose name is Thompson, came with me as far as Leadenhall-street, and I got into a coach; I got out of the coach in <placeName id="t18260406-34-crimeloc180">St. John-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Why not go all the way in the coach? A. The fare would be 3s. 6d. I dropped a shilling as I was paying the coachman; after I was out I stopped for a moment to pick it up; I saw the prisoner - two men appeared to be in company with her - they seemed to be talking together; one of the men jerked my hand, and insulted me; I was afraid of them, and told them they might pick the money up if they liked, as I was afraid of them - I directly left them; the prisoner followed me about 300 yards from the coach - she walked by my side, all the way talking to me; I wished to avoid her; I never saw her before; she kept calling me names all the way, and asked me at last if I would treat her; I said I did not think there was any place open; she then caught hold of me, and knocked me down; she held me down by force, in a kind of dirty corner on the pavement; I did not know she was taking my money - she then tore off my tippet, and tore my muff from my hand; I struggled to keep them but could not - she ran off as fast as she could, and I after her - I called murder seven or eight times, when the watchman came running up. I picked up my tippet in the way, about fifty steps from the spot; the watchman stopped her in my sight, and picked up my muff. I have no doubt of her person. I said "This woman has knocked me down and robbed me," and gave her in charge - I had 8s. 6d. in my pocket - I had 11s. before I went into the coach; my pocket being nearly behind me the string was broken and my money gone. She was never out of my sight - the lining was torn out of my muff in struggling.</p>

On Wednesday, the 15th of February, between six and seven (nearer seven) o'clock, I went to Mr. Elkins', to spend the evening - it was dark - it is a private house; Mrs. Elkin let me in, and, to the best of my knowledge, the door was shut after me; I went into the kitchen, which is even with the street door - a door leads from the kitchen into the passage, and then into the parlour; Mrs. Elkin went into the back parlour to look for her handkerchief - Mr. Elkin was up stairs - I was alone in the kitchen; Mrs. Elkin left the kitchen door open and I had a view of the passage - I heard a rustling, and, knowing she was gone up stairs, I cast my eye into the passage, and saw a man come out of the front parlour - I called out Stop thief! and got up immediately; I cannot say, in my fright, whether he had to open the door, but he ran out - I ran out, calling Stop thief! but returned without catching him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Jeffery, and took Murray into the tap-room of the public-house; I went into the parlour and asked the prisoner where he had been last night - he said he had slept with Murray - I asked where - he said at Murray's father's, in Shadwell-market; Murray had said something to me, in consequence of which I brought them together, and said to Murray "You told me you had only met Sullivan at the corner of the street, and that you knew nothing of him; Sullivan tells me he slept with you at your father's;" Murray then said "If he did sleep with me I know nothing of what he has got;" we had not told Murray we had found the watch on him. On taking them down to a public-house in Lower Shadwell, which had been robbed, I told Sullivan he had not had the watch the morning before; he said No, he had only had them an hour and an half; he told me on the road that he had found them in Stepney. I had seen them together the morning before the robbery, and searched them both. The bill against Murray has been thrown out by the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you brought them together Murray did not deny having slept with him? A. No; he said he knew nothing of what Sullivan had got, before I told him he had any thing.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw Parish with the prisoner, about three minutes after he was taken - I picked up six skeleton keys, a phosphorus box and matches - I shewed Parish where I picked them up - the keys will open street and room doors - I did not try them to Reeves' door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were about this place? A. Perhaps thirty boys; I cannot say who dropped the keys - a gentleman pointed them out to me.</p>
               <p>PHILIP PARISH. I picked up part of the keys myself, on the very spot where I took him - I saw him throw them away, and saw Goodwin pick the rest up in the same place.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Chick is not the person who snatched your watch? A. No; he pinioned me behind. I am sure he is the man; I saw him in custody, and followed him to the watch-house at Cripplegate; he was a stranger to me before. There was a strong gaslamp near the post.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not taken up one Rossman on this charge? A. I said he was very like the man, and I thought he was the man till I saw him in the watch-house - I described the man - I said he was like a man who went about the streets fiddling - the officer fetched the fidler to the watch-house, and I said immediately he was not the man - he was like him, but too stout - he was immediately discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not detained till it was proved he was in bed at the time? A. Certainly not; his wife came to the watch-house and said he was in bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Your watch was snapped in an instant? A. Yes; I said Rossman, the fidler, was very like Burke, but not that he was the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was your watch? A. Gold, and had a gold key and ring. The first thing that happened was Burke pushing by me very quick - the pinioning of my arms was at the same time as it was snatched, not before; I saw Chick on the road to the watch-house a very few minutes after I lost my watch, and said, in his hearing, "That is the man who pinioned me;" he made no reply. I did not see Burke in custody that night; I described him to Horton, the constable, and, in consequence of that description Brown took me next day to the Salmon and Ball public-house, Bunhill-row - it is a very low house - there were fourteen or fifteen men down in a cellar, playing at skittles; I saw a man there with his coat off - the officer told him to put it on; I looked round and said "It is of no use his putting his coat on, this is the man," (pointing to Burke,) "who took my watch;" he heard me say so. I am quite certain he is the man; he was taken to the watch-house directly; I had described him as being like the fidler - when I saw the fidler at the watch-house I said he was very much like the man in the face but rather stouter.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How soon after the robbery did you see Burke? A. Next morning, before twelve o'clock- this cellar is used as a skittle-ground; Burke is not the man who had his coat off. The man who robbed me had a cap on, I think, but am not certain; I looked him strait in the face, perfectly, to recognize his features. I told the officer he was very much like a man who used to go about the streets fidling - I had known the fidler about ten years; there was a great likeness in the two. When the fidler was brought I said he was very much like him in the face, but stouter.</p>
               <p>Mr. CRESWELL. Q. You told the officer he was like the fidler as a clue for him to know the man? A. Yes; I did not mean to say the fidler was the man.</p>

I was standing close by my lodgings, No. 6, Ropemaker-street; a person ran towards me at a quick pace, but when he came near me he rather loosened his pace, and said, "Do not stop me;" I made way for him to pass down the steps, and immediately after I heard a rush through Crown-court, with a cry of Stop thief! and I pursued him - it was Chick - I saw him in custody, and am certain of him; he had a hat on when I first saw him, but not when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you asked before the Magistrate whether Burke was the man you saw running? A. No - I know nothing about him; I had never seen him till he was before the Magistrate, that I know of; there was another man besides Chick ran by suddenly - I cannot say whether it was Burke or not. A person came in contact with me very suddenly at the corner of White's-court, and d-d my eyes - that was not Burke.</p>

            . I am constable of Cripplegate. On the 7th of March I was at the watch-house - M'Donald brought Chick in without a hat; the prosecutor came to the watch-house, and said, in his presence, that he and another man had robbed him of a gold watch; Chick denied it. I asked if he knew the other man - he said he thought he should know him - he was a man who played a fiddle about, and who he knew very well; I asked where the offence was committed, and was told it was in the County; I asked if he should know the other man if I was to bring him - he said Yes; I went to the fidler's house, and found a man answering the description; he was in bed. I brought him to the watch-house, and asked if he was the man; he said Yes, he was - I told him to look at him and be certain, for I had searched the apartments, and examined his shoes, and found no soil on them; he looked at him for a moment - I asked if he had any doubt of him; he said he had - I said, "Then give him the doubt;" he said,"I will," and I discharged him. I do not recollect any thing being said about his being stouter. Chick declared his innocence as he was going to St. Luke's watch-house; I asked what he ran for - he said because he saw other people run.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. He stated so positively, that he was the man, that if you had not observed his shoes you would have taken him to prison? A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The moment he described the fidler you knew who he meant, and went for him? A. Yes - he is much stouter than Burke, and is the father of two or three children; he said he should know the man very well - it was a man who played the fiddle about the street - that is all the description he gave.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Luke's. I went with the prosecutor to the Salmon and Ball public-house the afternoon after the robbery; it is a house of resort for reputed thieves, and in the Worship-street district - there were about a dozen persons in the skittle-ground; I saw a man with his coat off, and told him to put it on, but Wardle said, "Never mind him - here is the man who took my watch," pointing to Burke, who was looking at the men play. I took him - he heard the charge, and did not say a word. When we came to the watch-house Chick said, "I thought he said it was the fidler?" Wardle said, "No, it was a man a good deal like the fidler."</p>

            . I live with my father, in Union-street, Ratcliff-highway. On the 21st of March, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was playing about, and saw Dove - I think he came out of the Black Horse, public-house - he went to a corner for a necessary purpose; I saw both the prisoners - I knew them before by sight and by name; Munns is a <rs id="t18260406-43-deflabel227" type="occupation">salesman</rs>

I and Bridges went up to them; Munns made a blow at Bridges; I went to the Black Horse, and told Mr. Tavernor; he came out after them - they ran away. When he came back from running after them Dove got up, and went into the Black Horse; he was very drunk. Tavernor sent five of us to watch him home: he went across the Dock-hill - Munns came up there again, and shoved him down; he laid down with him, searched his pockets, and put something into his own pocket; this was half an hour after they first went up to him. I went and told Tavernor, and while I was talking Munns came up the lane; Tavernor came out, and he ran off.</p>

            . My brother keeps the Black Horse - I live there. On the evening of the 21st of March Dove was in the house, very tipsy indeed. I saw neither of the prisoners there - he had his pockets turned inside out; he went out, and did not come into the house again; his right-hand pocket was inside out - his breeches pocket and one side of his flap was unbuttoned; his fob was hanging out, but I felt his watch in it; I followed him to the door; Hagerty and some other boys there said he had been robbed; I sent them to follow him. I went to the door, and saw two men standing by the bricks; I cannot say who they were; they run away when I went towards them - I followed 150 or 200 yards, then returned, as I had left nobody in the bar. The boys came back, and gave me further information - I did not then see either of the prisoners.</p>

I saw Munns, but cannot say who the other man was; they were dividing something; Hagerty and I went towards home - they were going to hit us - we ran away; I saw the shape of Dove's watch in his fob after I had seen them dividing something; he went down the lane; I did not observe whether any body followed him; Munns said to Dove, "This is the way to Old Gravel-lane," directing him down New Gravel-lane.</p>

I put the tray behind the counter: he pointed to another tray - I told him they were ladies' rings; he then asked to see the first tray again; I put it on the counter; he immediately snatched it up, and ran out of the shop with it - it contained between six and seven dozens of dif<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060024"/>ferent kinds of rings - they were worth about 120l. I immediately followed; he went down Pope's Head-alley; our shop is at the corner of the alley: I pursued him across Lombard-street into Sherborne-lane - he was stopped near the bottom; he had not got the tray then; some person, whom I did not know, handed it to me; I had not seen him part with it. There were mourning rings in it then. I recovered about two dozen, which were worth about 16l., not more. He was a perfect stranger - he spoke pretty good English.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. What distance is the shop from Sherborne-lane? A. Two hundred yards or more; it was darkish - we had just lighted the gas. He made three turnings before he was stopped; two or three boys collected; there was not a great crowd. The people appeared to me to be more stooping down than running, as the rings dropped from him as he ran. I have a pretty good recollection of persons; I am certain of him - I cannot be mistaken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever lose sight of him? A. Only as he turned the corner of Sherborne-lane, but I saw him in the middle of the road. He was in the shop nearly ten minutes; there were other persons in the shop; he is a very tall man - I cannot be mistaken in him.</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN GEORGE FEARN. My house is in the parish of St. Michael, Cornhill. The rings were worth more than 120l.; those recovered are worth about 18l. or 20l.</p>

            . I am a coal-dealer, and live at No. 12, Sherborne-lane. I was in my own room, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went to the door, and saw the prisoner running, pursued with a cry of Stop thief! by full twenty persons; when he came nearly opposite my door I crossed over and collared him - another man came up - we took him back; he was charged with stealing Mr. Fearn's rings, and made no answer. I gave him to the patrol.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you not in too much confusion to know whether he gave an answer? A. No. When I took him the people had not come up; they were ten or twelve yards behind him.</p>

On the 28th of February the prisoner was in the warehouse, on business; I observed a quantity of ribbons on his left hand - I watched him a few minutes, seeing him near the box, and when he removed from the spot I saw him take his hand from under his basket, and take a piece of ribbon; when he came down the warehouse I followed him, and at the door I saw him put it into his pocket - I took hold of him, and asked what he had - he replied nothing. I said, "Take the ribbon from your pocket" - but I took it from his pocket myself; he was given in charge.</p>

I have been three years and a quarter in the prosecutors' employ. The prisoner has been in the habit of coming there all the while I have been there; I never heard a blemish in his character. I have been assistant to a linen-draper at Southampton, and had a hawker's licence; I took it out at Winchester. I was never taken up on any charge in my life respecting the licence. I was once subpoenaed as a witness for some midshipmen, who were charged with a disturbance at a Methodist chapel, and they indicted me as a principal; I was in custody in Whitecross-street prison for the costs and fine; I have been arrested for debt. I have had a child sworn to me. The prisoner had a wicker basket, with ribbons in it, which he had bought - it is possible that the ribbon might stick to the outside of the basket.</p>

            . I am an upholsterer, and live next door to the prosecutor. On the 20th of March, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was at my door, and saw the prisoner go along with this glass under his arm; I ran into Mr. Donaldson, and understood they had lost one; I followed, and took him in Greek-street - I took the glass from him - he then ran away, but was pursued, and brought to the prosecutor's house. I never lost sight of him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>JOHN MOULTON. I live at Friern, Barnet. On Saturday, the 11th of March, I was at Colney-hatch - I had been at the Orange Tree public-house, in company, for seven or eight hours, and left about half-past eleven o'clock; I was not drinking all the time - I was perfectly sober - I was going home, and the two prisoners overtook me - I had not seen them at the public house: Neadon accosted me, and said, "We have been at Taff's, to get some beer,(Taff keeps the house I had been to,) but the bar was shut up." I said, "Have you?" he said, "We have been into the country to meet some sheep, and there are none up." I said "Have you?" I was then on the road leading from <placeName id="t18260406-50-crimeloc266">Colney-hatch</placeName>

I said, "For God's sake spare my life, on account of my wife and six children" - one of them pinned me down with his thumb and fingers in my throat - he squeezed my throat - I don't know which of them it was exactly. - he used one hand to do that, and had the other in my left hand pocket - I had from 10s. to 15s. in that pocket; the other man rifled my right hand pocket, in which were two sovereigns, at the same time; Neadon was at my right hand pocket, where I had the sovereigns, and he was fumbling round the waistband of my breeches, and asked for my watch; I was still on the ground flat on my back - I said, I have have no watch;" he said "Let me have none of your lies,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060026"/>if you don't give it up easy I will shoot you;" the other did not speak a word - they left me flat on my back for dead.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they left you for dead? A. They walked away quietly - when I was able to get up, I followed and saw them about one hundred yards before me - they went over a gate into a field, and I lost sight of them; it was not moonlight - there are no lamps there - I returned into Colney-hatch village, and came to Mr. Ely, a carpenter; I described their persons; I was very much bruised about my head - there is a wound there now; I bled a good deal - here is the smock frock which I had on (producing it) - it is covered with blood; on the following day (Sunday) I was going along a private road belonging to Mr. Bensley, on the other side Colney-hatch - I saw the two prisoners there; I could have sworn to them a quarter of a mile off in a straight line; I was within two hundred yards of them - they saw me - my head was bandaged up at the time - when they saw me they turned out of the road and walked across the fields - that was a different direction to what they appeared to be in when they saw me - they appeared to be going across the fields towards the Swan public house, near Whetstone; I went out at the New Road round by the Old North Road to meet them; I had them in my eye within about two fields of the road directly opposite the Swan, and met them exactly at the gate opposite the Swan - they had then two men with them - the two men had each a bundle of turnip tops - one of the two men asked me "Where are you going, are you going to the doctor's?" (I knew those men by name and by sight.) I said, "No, I am not going, but I have more need to be at the doctor's than here; I was stopped last night and robbed by these two men," and asked them to assist me, and we secured them, and took them to the Swan and delivered them to Simmons and Curry, the horse-patrol; I never saw the prisoners before that night to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You had been at the public-house several hours? A. Yes; I drank some porter part of the time; I was dealing there with graziers about taking cattle on my land - that is my business; I tossed up for dry money, not for liquor - that took about three quarters of an hour; I went to the house between twelve and one o'clock, or perhaps later, and left at half-past eleven; I did not dine there - I had some bread and cheese; I took some roast beef about half-past ten, or not quite so late.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you see one hundred yards before you? A. It was star-light - I could see their persons one hundred yards before me, not to distinguish their faces; I was quite sober; I returned to the village and described them by their dress and stature.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not told that Neadon and Leech had been in the house that night at that time? A. Not exactly at that time - I was told so.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them next day did you not ask whether their names were Neadon and Leech? A. Yes; I said they were the men who robbed me before I asked that - Peat and Smith were with them; I wanted no assistance to take them - they said they did not rob me, and would walk quietly to the public-house, and did so - they were searched - about 6s. was found on one, and 4s. 6d. on the other.</p>

In consequence of information I went to the Swan with Currie, and found Moulton there with his head glutted in blood - the prisoners were there - I took them in charge and searched them - they had trousers on - Leech's trousers and coat had several marks of blood - here are marks of blood on the sleeve of his coat, and here are his trousers - there was blood on the wristband of his shirt on the same arm as his coat - both legs of the trousers are bloody near the bottom in the front part; I did not observe any blood on Neadon's clothes; I had seen them several times before - one lives at Whetstone; Neadon's father and mother lives in the village, and Leech's mother lives in the village.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you be positive the stain on the trousers is blood? A. Part of it is blood - some of the stain is oak bark, but there is a stain on the back of the trousers and in the front, with blood and oak bark; I saw these marks about eleven o'clock on the Sunday morning, but did not take their clothes off till we brought them to Bow-street; the shirt was not clean - it had been worn before.</p>

I was acquainted with Elizabeth Lawrence twenty years ago, but had not seen her for sixteen years till the 20th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, when I stood at the corner of Bath-street, City-road, talking to an old lady and she passed; I did not know her till she came back and spoke to me; we walked down the City-road together, and went into a gin shop at the end of Britannia-street, and had a glass of gin - we walked on and had a glass of gin each opposite the Laying-in Hospital - we stood at the door talking, and she asked me to go home to Britannia-street to tea with her; I did not know where she lived till I went; a woman, who she called her servant, opened the door - three or four children came into the room, and her son Joseph - we all drank tea together, and after tea she asked me if I would go to Whitecross-street, as she was going there after a woman who owed her some money, at a house which she let out in lodgings; while we were at tea she looked at her clock, and said it did not go right, and asked me what o'clock it was - I pulled my husband's watch out of my bosom, said it did not go right, and showed it to her - the glass was broken, and I said I was going to Whitecross-street to have one put in; we went out as far as Bath-street, and had a glass of gin at a public-house there - we then went on to Whitecross-street, and met a man named Crossley there; I have seen him before, but never spoke to him - he was a friend of her's - he came up to her - she told me he was the person who gave her away to her husband - he asked me to go and take something to drink - we went, and Mrs. Lawrence and I had a glass each there; I don't know what he drank; then Mrs. Lawrence asked me to stay a few minutes, while she went to speak to Mr. Crossley at the door, for she had something particular to ask him - they went to the door, and after that we three went together to Mrs. Lawrence's house in Whitecross-street, and found Joseph Lawrence standing at the door - he had got there before us - it was then night, but I cannot tell the time - I should think it was near seven o'clock; Elizabeth and Joseph Lawrence then began quarrelling; I don't know what about - Joseph ran away from her at the door - she, Crossley, and I went into the parlour - nobody else was there then, but Roach soon after came in, and Maria Johnson about the same time - they were strangers to me; Johnson went out to fetch more gin and a pot of porter; I tasted the gin - I drank very little, but no porter; Elizabeth Lawrence then went out - she told me she was going to a public-house after a person who owed her some money; Crossley went with her - I waited there; Crossley came back without her - Roach went to the public-house and brought her - the next person who came into the parlour was the witness Gearon - he asked for the key of a door - Crossley asked him if he would be a pot of beer to his pot - that was agreed to - Maria Johnson fetched a pot, and I believe some rum - I drank none; Gearon went and fetched his wife down stairs - she came and sat down with me, and soon after the prisoner Williams came in and sat down by my side, as Mrs. Gearon got up; I sat nearest to the door; some time after they began quarrelling about a bad half-crown - Mrs. Lawrence, her son, Crossley, and Johnson were quarrelling - I felt sick and called

            , and told her I was taken ill - she fetched me a candle to light me up stairs - I went with her, and when I got to the top of the stairs, I turned round and saw Williams close behind - Johnson went down with the light - I went to follow her, but Williams pushed me down directly on the top of the stairs; I was then in the dark - when Williams had pushed me down, he put his hand into my bosom to get my watch - I got hold of it, and he got fast hold of the chain; I held it as long as I could, and felt somebody take my ear-ring out of my ear - that must have been another person; he got the watch; I laid hold of the bottom of his trousers - he went down stairs and I tumbled down after him - he gave me a blow on my head with his hand three or four times up stairs, and when I had tumbled down to the bottom of the stairs, he gave me a blow to make me loose him, and ran out of the street door; I had gone up two pair of stairs with Johnson, and fell down two pair of stairs - it is a house of ill fame; when I cried murder, Johnson came, and put her hand before my mouth, and told me not to make such a noise; Gearon ran out of the room, picked me up, and when I went into the parlour, I found Elizabeth and Joseph Lawrence, Johnson, and Mrs. Gearon; Roach was gone, they were all standing together quarrelling; when I went up stairs I told Mrs. Lawrence I had been robbed of my watch - she came up to me and said if I did not hold my tongue she would give me in charge; I was screaming then; I went to the door to run out - there was two strange young men there, one of whom knocked me down - I was obliged to go back again - two watchmen came, they went up stairs, searched and found my cloak and bonnet which were torn off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a bed-room that you went up to? A. There was a bed in the room - the watchmen took every body in the house; I have not got my watch; part of my ear-ring was found at Bunhill-row watch-house. On Saturday I met a man in this Court with a silk handkerchief, on which was tied inside my cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. After taking all this gin were you sober? A. There was a great while between the times I drank - I was not exactly sober but know all I have stated to be true - I never recollect drinking so much before - I was giddy in the head when I felt sick.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sat nearest to you in the parlour? A. Williams - he was talking to me part of the time, and put his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060028"/>arm on my shoulder for about half an hour, and said he had been acquainted with a son who I had lost at sea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Mr. Wright here? A. No; we were married about nineteen years ago, at St. Pancras; the son I lost at sea was not his - I was never married before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you as too familiar for this man's arm to be round your neck? A. I was in trouble about my son, or I should not have been out; his arm was only on my shoulder; I did not pass a watchmaker's shop in the way to this house. I do not recollect having any liquor at the house in Britannia-street; the house I was robbed in is in Chequer-alley; I believe I had a drop of gin there out of a horn - it went round to every body. I just tasted something sweet - I do not think it was shrub - I only put it to my lips, as I did not like the smell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you that it was time to go home to your husband? A. I ought to have gone home - I had no notion of it being a house of ill-fame when I went there - I do not know how I came to stop - I was rather tipsy - I asked Johnson three times to see me home, and said I would pay her; I only went up stairs as far as the threshold of the door - I did not go into the room till I went with the watchman; I saw no door - I had just got inside where the door ought to be - but not into the middle of the room - my cloak and bonnet were found inside the room - I screamed violently - Mrs. Lawrence came laughing and told me to hold my tongue, for I should say presently I had been robbed of every thing, and there was a bit of my chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man called Charles the baker? A. No, my brother Charles is called

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you never represent that when you got to the bottom of the stairs the sailor young man (meaning Williams) unlocked your ear-ring, then took you round your neck, pushed you down, and took your watch? A. Never; I thought at one time that he had one hand to my ear, and the other to my watch; he came up behind me - I saw no one on the top of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JOHNSON. Q. Did you not ask me to light you up to bed with Williams, and let you have the best bed? A. Never; it is false.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not stay while you took your bonnet and cloak off, and leave the light with you? A. No, my cloak was torn off - it is torn now at the strings.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did they keep you in the watch-house that night? A. Till four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WILLIAMS. Q. Did you ever go by the name of Hill? A. Yes, about three years ago; I used to work for Hill and persons have called me by that name; I was not living with Wright then - we were separated for six years, but have been together again twelve years and a half; my son was not transported; I do not keep a house of ill-fame; I had a room in Chequer-square twelve or thirteen years ago - my husband lived there with me.</p>

            . I am a journeyman carpenter. My wife was in service; I met her on the 20th of February, in the evening, and went to this house about ten or eleven o'clock; I did not know it was a bad house; I asked if we could have a lodging for the night, and was directed to an upper room; finding no key to the door I came down and found Mrs. Lawrence, Johnson, Wright, and Crossly, in the parlour; a man named Crossly came in, and soon after Joseph Lawrence came in, and, some time after, Williams - he drank some beer, and sat down by the prosecutrix - I believe they sat on one chair; he sat with his hands round her neck for half an hour; she did not object to it. Crossly proposed that I should stand a pot of beer - I fetched my wife down, sent for a glass of rum - some spirits were handed round - Johnson lighted a candle - Mrs. Wright and Williams left the room, and I thought they were going to bed together for the night; Crossly left the room in five or six minutes - Johnson came down in five minutes - I cannot say whether she brought the light - I heard nobody fall down stairs - if they had I think I must have heard it; I heard a call of murder, opened the parlour door, and found Wright on the floor; she and Williams appeared very loving together in the room.</p>

            . I live in Paradise-place. Lower-road, Islington. On Wednesday morning, the 22d of March, about half-past six o'clock, I was going towards home from the watch-house - I am the watch-house-keeper - and in the Lower-road the prisoner Smith went by me with a basket on his shoulder, with something very heavy in it; I saw Gurney coming along, within thirty yards of him, with another basket, similarly loaded - I stopped Gurney, and asked what he had in his basket; he said"Meat;" I pulled the basket off his shoulder and found two fore-quarters of mutton; I asked where he was going to take it - he said to Mr. Salter, a salesman in Newgate-market; there was a chopper in the basket; I said it was not usual for men to carry choppers to market with their meat - he made no answer; I told him to carry the basket to the King's Head - I there searched it more particularly, and found a gamble hook, which they hang sheep up with, and half a sheep's head - I found the other half of the head in his pocket, with a liver; I left the basket there for twenty minutes, took him to the watch-house, then pursued and took Smith with his basket, by Sadlerswells; I asked where he was going - he said he did not know; I found in his basket both the hind quarters of a sheep together, and a knife, and in his pocket a piece of lights, and in the other pocket a gamble hook. When we came to turn the two baskets out together, there were two sheeps' heads, two lots of fat, two hearts, and two livers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know whether either of them are butchers? A. No.</p>

            . I am servant to James Coleman, who lives at Upper Holloway, about two miles from the Lower-road. On Tuesday, the 21st of March, my fellow servant,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060029"/>George, put eighty-one sheep into my charge, in a field nearly opposite the Red Caps public-house - one field from the road; I counted them, and saw them safe in the evening, at six o'clock; I shut the gate of the field and locked it - next morning, at eight, I counted them, and found only seventy-nine; I found the skins of the other two in the next field but one, a little after eight that morning, laying in a ditch; I saw Brown afterwards with the parts of two carcases; I compared the two hind-quarters and two forequarters, which he produced to me, with one of the skins - they corresponded with that skin in every point.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were all the eighty-one sheep of one breed? A. No; different, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Sheep of the same year's birth are about the same size? A. They are sometimes, but not always.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hundred thousand sheep would have fitted these skins? A. I should not think they would correspond in every point to fit - the fat left on the skin corresponds with the carcass.</p>

I was informed of this robbery, and met the prisoner on the 10th of March, in Carnaby-market; I told him I wanted him for robbing Mr. Slaughter; I took him to a public-house, and while searching him - (I neither threatened or promised him) - I asked him where the necklace was; after some hesitation he said he had sold it to a walking fence for 1l., and that he had spent the twelve sovereigns; I asked where the purse was - he said he had thrown that away, and was very sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am sorry for it, and hope and trust you will have mercy.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Edmonton. I was with Sawyer in Mr. Smith's meads at Edmonton, and found a white petticoat and bolster in the hedge, about nine o'clock; I watched, and about eleven saw the prisoner Wilson go down to where they were; Bailey was about five yards behind him; they came away, and Wilson had something under his arm; they ran hard - I pursued for a mile, calling Stop thief! I secured Bailey, and under his smock-frock found a pillow-case, containing a black silk cloak, and several things; I locked him up, and returned to Sawyer, who was holding Wilson on the ground - he had six china plates and three basins in a bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You found these things - what prevented their finding them? A. When I first saw the prisoners they were about fifty yards from the place, and they went strait up to where the bolster and petticoat lay.</p>

I instantly looked up, and missed the lamp from the stair-case. I ran after him, calling Stop thief! and overtook him with the lamp on Addle-hill, and secured him.</p>

On the 17th of February I went to meet a coach at the Peacock public-house, Islington, expecting a hare; I went from there to the Bull and Mouth inn, Bull and Mouth-street; I had a watch in my fob with gold seals and a ring - the ring was worth 7s., the seals 30s., and the key 6d.; it was safe when I got to the Bull and Mouth - when I got into <placeName id="t18260406-68-crimeloc365">Beech-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. What time in the evening was this? A. About twenty minutes before twelve o'clock, I had left my employ at eight o'clock in the evening; I went home to supper.</p>
               <p>Q. The four men appeared very much intoxicated? A. Yes; they appeared so - they reeled about - two of them were getting away - they could have got the hare from me if they liked, without holding my hand up - that rather prevented them getting it.</p>
               <p>Q. One of them held up your arm while the other three tried to get the hare? A. Exactly so - they all appeared very much intoxicated; when the watchman came up he asked who did it; I had hold of two men at that time; I really think they were very much intoxicated - I think so now.</p>
               <p>Q. It appeared a drunken frolic? A. More like that than any thing else - I think so now.</p>
               <p>Q. You now think it was, on the part of all of them, a drunken frolic? A. Yes; I was present when the prisoner was searched - nothing of mine was found on him - I was perfectly sober - it appeared to me a drunken frolic altogether; they could easily have got the hare from my hand without holding it up if they choose.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. They did not take the hare but your seals? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. They did their best to snatch the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060034"/>hare from you? A. I told them it would not do, and they could not get it from me - it happened between Whitecross-street and Golden-lane; I am certain the watchman asked me who had done it - he did not at that time say who did it.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have very little doubt that the prisoner was not the person who snatched at your watch? A. I do not think he himself did snatch it, as a hand came round; the watchman came up in two or three minutes - I called out three or four times before he came - I do not recollect whether it was under a light - the street is lighted with gas; when they said it was only a joke, I said"Give me my watch;" I found they still hustled me, and I called Watch! again.</p>
               <p>Q. They might have knocked you down and robbed you if they liked? A. They certainly might.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. They did not take the hare, but some of them did take your seals, ribbon and ring? A. Yes; they used so much violence as to bend the part of the watch, which holds the ribbon. I have had no part of my property returned to me.</p>

            . I am a bookseller and printer, and live at No. 4, East-street, Spitalfields. About half-past eleven o'clock, on Friday evening, I was coming up Chiswell-street, and heard a cry of Stop him! or Stop them! I stood under a gas light; I heard men running in different directions, and saw the prisoner running with all speed - I had a stick in my hand and stood in an attitude to stop him - whether he saw me I cannot tell, but he directly ran down Grub-street - I followed, collared him, and took him back - I gave him to a watchman - a patrol came up, who had been pursuing him, and I accompanied them to the watch-house; the prosecutor came in and stated that he was one of the party who held his hands while he was robbed of his watch; the prisoner said nothing in his defence - he heard this - he seemed surprised that he should be charged with it. I am sure he said the prisoner was one of them - whether he said he snatched the chain I do not know, but I understood him to say he was one of the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the watchman came up he did not find the prosecutor holding two persons? A. This was after the transaction - I know nothing of the robbery; I did not see the prosecutor till I got to the watch-house; I saw no other person in the street - but it is a long-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prosecutor say he did not believe the prisoner was the man who had touched him, or who took his watch? A. I recollect nothing of the sort - whether he said the prisoner was the person who snatched at his chain, or whether he was one that held him; but he described him as one of the party.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prosecutor say he thought they were all drunk together? A. I do not recollect it. I mention all I heard; I heard him say at Guildhall that they were drunk - he thought they were all staggering about; Voll, the watchman, said, at the watch-house, that he saw the prisoner pull at the watch - he said that before the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Scott has been sworn, and I suppose he was as sober as you? A. No doubt of it - he must have as full a recollection of the matter as me.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS to JOHN SCOTT. Q. I think you said the watchman came up to you when you called Watch? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that he did not say he saw any one do it? A. No; he asked me who did it - I should know the watchman if I saw him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you did not see any person do this - will you look at this paper, and tell me whether it is your hand-writing - read it over? A. This is signed by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you looked over it? A. No (he does so).</p>
               <p>Q. You have read that over, and you signed it? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Is that the watchman you mean(pointing to the witness Voll)? A. That is the person.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I came up on hearing what was passing - the spot in question is in the City. I heard a call of Watch! at a quarter before eleven o'clock, and immediately came up to where the noise was - I saw two men standing on the pavement, and one having hold of Mr. Scott's left arm, in which he had a hare, and the prisoner at the bar was lugging at his fob; Mr. Scott had got his arm bent down to keep the watch in - Scott was completely swinging by the chain or ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, it drew him round? A. Yes; they could not get it out, and at last they separated; their pulling swung him round; they could not get it out; Scott was in the road, and the men walked on the pavement - the prisoner was one of the party - Scott said directly to me"I have lost my seals."</p>
               <p>Q. Or his watch, which did he say? A. His seals he told me. I laid hold of the prisoner, and immediately said "Have you got the gentleman's seals?" he said"No, I have not got the seals;" I said</p>
               <p>"Then you must go with me to the watch-house - they were both agreeable to go to the watch-house (the prisoner and the one who had hold of the left arm); we went about three doors, and then he refused to go; I immediately said to Scott"You hold that one, and I will hold the other;" I gave him the man who got away - I had hold of the prisoner - as soon as Scott got hold of the other he immediately made a blow at Scott; I attempted to lay hold of him, and by so doing the prisoner got from me, and I ran after him - he ran very fast - I believe he was a little in liquor, but able to run very fast; I lost sight of him, I think, at the corner of Grub-street, as he turned round the corner, but caught sight of him again, and seeing him stopped by Young I held back, for I was quite out of wind; I came up, and he was taken to the watch-house. I am quite sure he is the person whom I saw tugging at Scott's watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say you are sure this was in the City of London? A. Yes; it is in Beech-street - the spot is about three houses out of the county. I know the boundary of Cripplegate parish, and the boundary of the City - the officers have shewn me the boundaries of the different parishes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the man who had hold of the chain? A. Yes, I had a bull's-eye light - I saw him and know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Scott "I know who it was that was tugging at your watch," when you went up to him? A. No; I caught hold of the prisoner directly I asked Scott what the piece of work was; I had seen the priso<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060035"/>ner tugging at his seals - I was not obliged to tell Scott.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on your oath, and remember Mr. Scott has been examined, instead of your not telling him who did it, did you not ask him who did it? A. I did not ask him that question - I swear that - if he has sworn so it is not true, for I saw the prisoner pulling at the fob. I have been here many times - not as a witness - as a visitor many times, and I have unfortunately stood at that bar.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite sure you saw the prisoner pulling at the fob? A. Yes; I am positive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home; there was a piece of work in the street - the gentleman said he had been robbed - this watchman came up, and said "What is the matter?" the prosecutor said "I have been robbed;" "Who was it?" said the watchman; he said "I don't know;" the watchman laid hold of me, and said"You have robbed the gentleman?" I said "I have not."</p>

The prisoner was formerly in our service, and last Christmas he wrote to us, saying, he wished to commence business for himself, but had rather got his hand out, and wished to be with us a short time without a salary, to make himself more acquainted with the trade. I afterwards saw him, and he came into our employ. A communication was made to me by Mr. Duthoit, a lace merchant, last February, and, on the 24th, I went to the prisoner's lodgings in Old Cavendish-street; he was then taken into custody; we searched his rooms, and found a variety of my articles, which I gave to Schofield - they were in a trunk under the bed - Mr. Duthoit gave me a piece of lace.</p>

            . I am a licensed slaughterer of horses, and keep a slaughter-house in Buck's-row. Whitechapel. On Monday, the 13th of March, between 5 and 6 o'clock, the prisoner came to my premises with a gelding, and asked if I would purchase it; I said, Yes, and asked his price; he said 2l. I walked round the horse, examined it, and put several questions to him, where he got it, and whose it was - he said it was his own, that he had brought it from Brentford that morning. I said it was a long distance to come so early, and this circumstance excited my suspicion, for the horse was cool, and if it had come that distance it would have been warm. I then asked why he wished to part with it, as it did not ail any thing - he said, because it would not draw. I detained him - advertised it, and on the Friday following had it led about Smithfield, with a label on its forehead, stating that the owner might have it. Gunn saw it, and claimed it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I came on shore from Mr. Kates' barge at the Regent's-canal-basin, and in the road to Whitechapel I was accosted by two men, one dressed in a woollen cap, smock-frock, and trousers, and the other in a brown coat and top boots; they asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060036"/>where I was going - I said towards home, Brentford; the one in the brown coat asked where I lived; I said, "With my father, near the Salutation public-house, at Brentford"- he asked if I would assist the other man to dispose of the horse, as he had another to dispose of, and as he was coming towards Brentford he would pay me. I was desired to ask 40s. for it, and say I brought it from the Salutation. I assure you I am totally innocent.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On Saturday, the 18th of February, I went to a stable, No. 5, Warren-mews, Fitzroy square; I found the door fastened, and broke it open. Edwards, of Hatton-garden, and Shepherd, an officer, were with me; we found there thirty-three live sheep, eleven sheep's plucks, and a quantity of sheep skins cut to pieces, and tied up in a bag; I found three knives, two steels, and a chopper - the stable appeared as if sheep had been killed there; there was fresh blood about - it is a two-stall stable. The live sheep were all huddled together in one stall - I could not then see whether there were any marks on them. I left Edwards to mind them while I proceeded to what I was informed was John Shaw's stables, in Osnaburgh-street - I found a horse, cart, and chaise there, which I brought away; on the inside of the cart there was the marks of fat and blood- it was on the side of the cart, where the seat swings. I afterwards shewed the thirty-three sheep to Mr. Wells, at Flying Horse-yard, Lambeth-street, on Monday or Tuesday. I drove them there myself from the stable; I was obliged to carry some of them in the cart, as they were unable to walk. Bennett saw the same sheep.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. How far is Osnaburgh-mews from where you found the sheep? A. About a quarter of a mile. I believe there are livery-stables in that mews; I cannot be certain on what day Bennett saw the sheep, but I shewed them to Mr. Wells first, I think. I took them all at once to Flying Horse-yard, and was two hours getting them there.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. I went with Dalton to Warren-mews on Saturday, the 18th of February; I then went and found the prisoner at a public-house in Norton-street, Fitzroy-square, not far from where the sheep were found; it was between three and four o'clock. The prisoner's brother John was with him there; I spoke to John, and asked him to go up to his stable, and said, "Is that your brother with you?" he said Yes; I then asked him if he would go to his stable, and that his brother had better come with him; they wanted to know what it was for; I said it was respecting the horse that was in his (John's) stable; when we got them to the stable in Osnaburgh-street I and Dalton told them they must consider themselves in custody; they wanted to know what for; I said for some sheep; they said, "What sheep?" we told them the sheep in the stable in Warrenmews - they both said they knew nothing about them; the prisoner said he had let the stable to a man named Vincent, about six weeks or two months before; I asked him who Vincent was - he said he had seen him, and agreed to let it to him at 16s. a week; I will not be positive whether I asked him where Vincent lived - he gave no further account of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. How far is the public-house from Osnaburgh-street? A. About the same distance; they made no objection to go to John's stables; when they got there I told them they must consider themselves in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. On your saying it was about the sheep in Warren-street, he said he had let the stable to Vincent? A. Yes. I did not question him further about Vincent.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did either of you ask who Vincent was? A. No - I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sworn that he was asked, and said he did not know who he was? A. I think he did say so.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. I went with Dalton and Gardner to Warrenmews, No. 5, on the 18th of February, and saw the sheep there. I afterwards went to Osnaburgh-mews, and found a cart - I do not know who it belonged to, but the premises belonged to John Shaw; the cart was chalked on the off side, and the name obliterated; I found the inside of it marked with a quantity of fat and blood; it was fresh. We afterwards went to Warren-mews; I did not see the prisoner there; I heard him say at the office that the stable did not belong to him - I asked him if he could find Vincent - he said he did not know, but he had let the stables to him.</p>

            , a corn-chandler, of No. 15, Warren-street, Fitzroy-square. I know the prisoner very well; he was at our shop, to the best of my knowledge, during the week before he was taken up - he came for a truss of straw and some oats - he did not say where they were to be sent; he dealt with us before - he was going out of the shop, and said to Capel, our shopman, "Do you know where to take them to, my stable in Warren-mews;" Capel said, Yes. I heard of his apprehension on Saturday evening or Sunday.</p>

            . I am a coach-wheel-wright, and live at No. 6, Warren-mews - the prisoner, I believe, occupied No. 5, until I do not know how lately. I do not know for a certainly that he did occupy it; I saw him there about a fortnight before the stable was broken open- I saw him come down the mews many times - I have a workshop opposite to No. 5 - he came to me about ten days before the officers were there, and applied to me to repair the wheels of a cart, which the officers have in their possession; he told me I should find the cart at his brother's, in Osnaburgh-street; he wanted me to repair the wheels, and wished it done well, but as cheap as I could, as it belonged to a poor man. I saw the cart in the possession of Dalton the same day as I took the wheels off(Saturday) - I am sure it was the same cart.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him go into No. 5, Warren-mews last? A. I think it was a fortnight before that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. You did not see the cart till it was in Dalton's possession? A. I took off the wheels that morning, and in the afternoon Dalton had it; he had applied to me about it ten days before - I am always at work at home. I had not seen him at No. 5 for a fortnight before, to my recollection.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You do not recollect seeing him there for a fortnight? A. No, my Lord. I have seen two other men come backwards and forwards there in that fortnight; I do not know who they were; I never saw him do any thing there. The last time I saw one of them was on Thursday or Friday before this time - he brought a saddle on his back. The cart is about the size of a smallish butcher's cart - it would hold several dead sheep laying on each other.</p>

            . I am a hair-dresser, and live in Bear-street, Leicester-square. I saw the prisoner about three times previous to this transaction. On Thursday, the 9th of March, he came to be shaved, and when I had about half shaved him, he said that he had got some articles that would suit me - that they were tortoiseshell combs; I said I was not in the habit of selling them; he said he thought they would suit me, and I said if I saw them very likely I would buy them; after I had shaved him he called me aside, and said "I think they are the property of Mr. Goldsmith, who was robbed the other night - I think they are come by the cross;" he went away for them; I went to Goldsmith and told him of it - he went with me to Bow-street and got Cousins - we went directly to my house, and found the prisoner waiting there for me; I left Cousins outside - he shewed me some combs, and asked 5s. for the large, and the small ones were to be given in - they were worth 12s. or 14s. each; Cousins immediately came in and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he believed they had been the property of Goldsmith, and believed they had come on the cross? A. He said they were the property of Goldsmith; I did not hear the word believe in it; I only knew him by his being occasionally a customer, two or three times.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 9th of March I went with Guest to his house and took the prisoner there; I said "You are in my custody on suspicion of having stolen property in your possession," and at the same time took a parcel of combs from his hand; I collared him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060039"/>- he said "Let me go, I will go quietly;" I let him go - he immediatley put his hand into his waistcoat pocket; I said "What are you going to do?" he said "I am a gas fitter; I have a burner there - I know you will find it;" I said "Keep your hand out;" I took him to a public-house - he put his hand in again; I took it out, and in that pocket I found a small crow-bar; I searched his lodgings and found two large and nine small combs, and two salt spoons; he said they were his lodgings; there was no marks on the prosecutor's fan-lights.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS to GUEST. Q. Had the prisoner shown you the gas-burner that morning? A. Yes, but not the bar.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long address to the Court, protested his innocence, and stated he had obtained the combs in exchange for one dozen of brass bell-pulls and 5l. with a man who came to his shop, representing himself in distress, and that after he had purchased them, the man prevailed on him to buy the salt-spoons, and that the article called by the witnesses a crow-bar, he used as a scraper in his business as a gas-fitter.</p>
               <p>COUSINS re-examined. When I took him he said he bought them of some man he did not know; he said nothing more as to that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you the sum I gave for them? A. No; I never heard of an exchange of bell-pulls for them - he said at the office he bought them of a man- he was going to say something when Sir

On Wednesday the 22d or 23d of February, I called at the prisoner's house and found him extremely ill - he complained of a violent pain in his head; I advised him to apply leeches, and applied them to his head myself, between five and six o'clock in the evening, and stopped there till they were off - till ten; I saw him again between eleven and twelve next morning in bed, and he appeared very ill then; Wilson was there part of the day - he lodges in the house; I sat up in the parlour two nights to attend the prisoner (Thursday and Friday); Wilson used to sleep in the parlour, but slept in the attic those two nights; I went into the Price's room several times in the course of those two nights, and always found him in bed; Wilson took the key of the shop and street-door up stairs; I returned home on Saturday between nine and ten o'clock; I occasionally went home in the day time as I am married.</p>

            . I am in partnership with the prisoner as a brass-founder and gas-fitter; he was taken ill on Tuesday afternoon, about the 21st or 23d of February, with a pain in his head; Mrs. Standing came to visit him; I saw leeches applied on Wednesday night, about seven or eight o'clock; I was there when they were first applied, but went out; I came home and saw his head wrapped up about nine; Standing went home between nine and ten - she sat up in the parlour on Thursday and Friday nights, and I slept in the garret on that account; I took both the street and shop door keys up with me; the prisoner remained ill on Thursday and Friday; I went into his room every morning to see how he was - he was also ill on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Mr. CRESWELL. Q. Do you recollect when he was apprehended? A. Yes; I was taken on this charge myself - I believe Standing or his wife bought the leeches; I am in partnership with him, but my name is not on the card because he is the only person appointed by the gas company; I carry on the business now, but not in the same place.</p>

On the 10th of January, after shewing this ring to a customer, I replaced it on the glass-case - on the following day the prisoner was at work, fitting up the gas apparatus, behind the counter, for two or three hours, and on the 12th a workman, who had made the ring, called about it; I went to the glass-case, and it was gone - the case was not locked - it is but a small shop - people are continually coming in, and my attention was called away while he was there- only my father and myself serve in the shop - I am positive I never sold it; on the Monday following Cousins brought it to our shop (looking at it); I am sure this is it - I have the fellow on my finger - it is chased, and has a carved coral head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did he come to your shop? A. About eleven or twelve o'clock; he was working near the glass-case, which draws out - the ring was in front - I do not think he was left alone in the shop - the ring is a new pattern and quite uncommon - it was made on purpose for us - we had had it but two or three days.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who made it for you? A. One Greswell; it was for a lady; I had not shewn it to her before Greswell called to know if it suited, and it was produced to me on the Monday after the prisoner was taken - not the Monday after I lost it.</p>
               <p>JOHN PEARL. I know this ring to be mine - I never sold it - I have one like it, except that the head is a crysolite.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060040"/>Cross-examined. Q. Did the same man make both? A. Yes; I received it from him as a new pattern - this was made a fortnight or a month after I selected it from his stock, to bring here; I do not recollect seeing any more of the same kind.</p>

            . I live in Bear-street, and have known the prisoner about three months; he offered me that ring, with about two dozen and a half or three dozen more, about six weeks ago, when he came to be shaved; he shewed them to me in a paper, and asked 7s. each for them; I examined them for a minute, then said I did not understand them, and should not buy them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you undertake to swear this ring was among them? A. Yes; for there was no other like it; I picked it out, and it would not go on my little finger; he did not say how he got them.</p>
               <p>GEORGE PEARL. The ring cost us 30s.</p>

            . I searched the prisoner's apartment, and found four rings in a drawer, in the back parlour, and two more in a drawer of the bedstead in the same room; the ring in question is one of the four. When I produced it at Bow-street, the prisoner said it was one out of many others, that he had brought from France some years ago, and that it was French manufacture; this was on the 9th of March, and on the 18th, Mr. PEARL came and claimed it; he described it before he saw it, and picked it out from the rest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the drawers locked? A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, stated, that he had found this ring at the Opera House, and it was not the one he said he had brought from France, and concluded by asserting this prosecution to be a villanous scheme, on the part of Guest, to rain him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to PEARL. Q. Does not the adjoining shop communicate with yours? A. A milliner keeps the shop- I have occasionally got her to mind my shop.</p>

On Sunday morning I always cast up my books, and put my money into a purse; On Sunday, the 5th of March, I put nine sovereigns and nineteen shillings into a red purse, which I put into a bag, and hung it by the mantel piece; he knew I kept my money there; I had got him into employment, and expected he was going to live with me; he went away that day, and I missed my money and purse.

            . I am foreman at the warehouse No. 2, West India Docks.

            . On the 10th of March I was warehouseman to John and Joseph Travers, of Swithen's-lane. On the evening of the 10th of March, at five o'clock, Lake drove a waggon in, with two hogsheads of sugar - he had left the other in Whitechapel, which was correct - one hogshead, at the tail of the waggon, was taken out - he delivered a ticket - No. 196 remained in the waggon; I told him to take that to Holborn-bridge, and gave him a copy of the dock note, with the weight - the original is lost: No. 196, W. L. weighed 14cwt. 2qrs. 23lbs.; he left me about ten minutes past five, to go to Holborn-bridge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know that 196 was in your waggon. A. I know it by the Dock note which he brought, and I saw it there; I gave him a note of the number he was to deliver in Whitechapel. I saw No. 196 at Mr. Blincos', on Holborn-bridge afterwards - I was fetched there at eight o'clock - every man has his own waggon - they do not change them.</p>

            . I live in York-place, Commercial-road, and work at the West India Docks. On the evening of the 10th of March, about five minutes to six o'clock in the evening, I was in Newgate-street, and saw a van enter the street, with a hogshead of sugar in it; "Bailey, Great Trinity-lane," was on the van; Lake drove it; I saw Crutchman come up to him in Newgate-street: they appeared to be in conversation; after they had walked about ten yards Crutchman got into the van - the tilt was partly thrown up, and continued so while in Newgate-street - he laid hold of the cask, as if to move it, came out in a minute and a half, and went to Lake - the van proceeded; Crutchman remained talking with Lake. The van got into Skinner-street, and there James joined them; all three were in conversation; the van stopped about ten yards on this side of Fleet-market, on the left-hand; they were conversing from 5 to 7 minutes - the van then proceeded down the east side of the market, towards Ludgatehill, keeping on the wrong side of the way; nearly opposite the Braziers' public-house it stopped; Crutchman then got into the waggon - James and Lake were present- Crutchman pulled the tilt over himself, and placed the straw against the rails of the van, which prevented my seeing. James then drew into the market; Lake continued by his waggon - it stopped there twelve or fifteen minutes; Lake then drove the van slowly towards Ludgate-hill, keeping on the wrong side. I did not see Crutchman get out; I kept watching the waggon - it turned round, and went on the west side of the market, and on the wrong side; I then saw James walking with Lake. The van stopped nearly opposite the Angel, on the wrong side, for twenty or twenty-five minutes, and when I came up I saw Lake with a pint pot, standing by his horses; he took the pot in, made a motion with his whip on the cover of the waggon, and James came out of the waggon; I had not seen him get in. I had heard a knocking in the van, as if they were hitting tin on wood; a man came by, and spoke to him - the van proceeded to Mr. Blinkos' - James and Lake walked together. When the waggon turned round to go to Blincos' I was on the opposite side, and met Crutchman coming in a direction from Holborn-hill; I was opposite Blincos' door; I had not seen him get out of the van; James and Lake rolled the hogshead into the shop. I went towards Holbornhill; the waggon drove away. I then went into Blincos', and saw the hogshead there - they weighted it in my presence - it weighed 13cwt. 3qrs. 18lbs. or 20lbs. I did not observe the mark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you mention this to nobody? A. I mentioned it to the beadle of St. Andrew's; he would not interfere, but laughed at me. The Lord Mayor repremanded him for it. I suspected they were plundering the cask - I was nearly an hour following them. - When I was on one side of the waggon a man could get out at the other, with any thing, without my seeing him; if the cask had weighed right I should not have accused them. I have known James and Crutchman for years; I was fifteen or twenty yards off when Crutchman got into the waggon. Lake was at the tail of his waggon when he got in; he then went on to his horses - I cannot say whether he saw Crutchman get out. James jumped out, and went on with Lake - he must have seen Crutchman get into the waggon.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Blincos - Smith came in, and gave us information just as Bailey's waggon had left a hogshead of sugar. In consequence of his statement I had it weighed; the weight was 13cwt. 3qrs. 18lbs.; Lake had delivered me a ticket of the weight- it was 3qrs. 5lbs. deficient; it was marked W. L. No. 196.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any particular appearance in it? A. The tin which covered the drawing hole appeared to be raised up - it did not look as they generally do; the nails have been taken out and put in a fresh place; there is a much greater vacancy in the cask than usual - I never knew one so empty - it could not have occurred by anything but by its being taken out; we sometimes omit to weigh casks if we have not sufficient hands, or are in a hurry.</p>
               <p>LAKE's Defence. When I was in Newgate-street a porter asked me to take a job to Fleet-street, which I did; I pitched it at the end of Fleet-market - I had a pint of beer, and delivered the hogshead.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutors. On the 7th of March, at a quarter past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked to see a watch from the window, marked six guineas; I took it from the case, and gave it into his hand; I was alone; he looked at it, and wished to see another, which he described in the window, marked ten guineas; I delivered that into his hand - I had no sooner done that than another person opened the door; the watches lay on the counter; I looked up to see who was coming in when that person threw some snuff in my face. The prisoner snatched up the watches, and both ran away. I ran out immediately; the prisoner crossed the street, towards Threadneedle-street. I ran after him to the corner, but having left nobody in the shop I arose a cry of Stop thief! pointed him out, and returned to take care of the shop; he had been talking with me for about three minutes; I am certain of him. I put a neighbour in care of the shop, then went round, and found him in the charge of Gadbury. I am quite certain he is the person. I saw the watches produced - they are the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When the person came in did you think he came for any sinister motive? A. No. You are the person: I suspected you when you asked for a second watch, and as you made an obervation about having one to go without winding up, I took particular notice of you; this was before I shewed you the second watch; I should not know the other man - he opened the door, and threw the snuff in my eye without speaking; our shop is not more than twenty or thirty yards from Threadneedle-street. I saw you both leave the shop together. I saw you take up the watches the moment the snuff was thrown in my face. I knew you immediately I saw you at the watch-house - you were not pointed out to me; I have not the slightest doubt of you.</p>

            . I am evening patrol of Broad-street ward. I heard a cry of Stop thief! when I was opposite the King's Head public-house, Threadueedle-street, which is about three parts of the street from Bishopsgate-street; I turned, and saw the prisoner running towards me, and a quantity of people after him - he appeared the only person pursued. I laid hold of him, and before I could speak to him I perceived him drop something; I turned round, and desired Crow to pick it up, which he immediately did - it was two watches; I had not moved him from the spot - he stooped down, and dropped them gently; I took him to the watch-house - Sexty came up while I was waiting for the watch-house to be opened, and said, "That is the man, I will swear." The watches were delivered to Jones.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you pursue me? A. No; you ran to me - I was prepared to catch you. I never said I pursued you; I stopped you with my stick. I am confident Sexty said he would swear you was the man; I expeet no benefit from your conviction. I attempted to stop nobody before you came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any persons between you and me in the street before I came up to you? A. None; the street was quite clear of carraiges, and you were in the middle of the road; there might be persons on the pavement - you made no resistance. I have not conversed with Crow on the subject.</p>

            . I am a journeyman shoemaker, and live in Butler's-alley, Grub-street. I was at the corner of the Flower-pot by Bishopsgate-street and Threadneedle-street, I heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running across from Bishopsgate-street; from the side from the Flower-pot - a person was behind him pursuing; the prisoner ran up Threadneedle-street - the person behind returned back - I saw the prisoner go on - I called Stop thief! - and when I came up I found the patrol had hold of him - I did not see him stopped; the patrol desired me to assist to take him - I laid hold of him and was thinking about moving him, when he stooped and dropped something; nobody was near enough to drop it, except the patrol or me - I picked it up, it was two watches; they were afterwards claimed - I had them in my possession till he was taken to the watch-house - I saw Sexty come up to us as we came along Threadneedle-street; but he went away again; the watchhouse is in Threadneedle-street; he was secured there; Sexty claimed the watches - I delivered them to Daniel Jones.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where did the watches appear to come from? A. From your hand - you stooped - with and your right hand dropped them - whether you took them from your pocket I do not know - I never said you took them from your waistcoat pocket - the person pursuing was about five yards behind you - he turned back - I did not pursue directly I heard the cry, but I called Stop thief!- Sexty came up as soon as you were in hold, but he went away and came again to the watchhouse - the watches were not pointed out to me - I saw you drop them - there were several persons round, but nobody near enough to drop them - it was impossible for any of them to drop them- I started in pursuit the moment I heard the alarm - I was only across the street - I do not swear you are the person I first saw running, but it was you who dropped the watches- persons came round to look on, but Gadbury and I were the only persons near you - they did not offer to lay hold of you; your back was to the houses - I saw you drop something - Gadbury did not point it out to me - I did not hear him desire me to pick it up - I saw you run almost to the spot where you were stopped, and came up in a minute after.</p>

I have lately returned from France, my friends are in Dublin, and, relying on my conscious innocence I have not put them to the expense of coming here."</p>

I am a bricklayer; about half-past 10 o'clock in the morning, on the 7th of March, I was in Cromer-street, within twenty-five yards of Reynolds's house, and saw the prisoner with a box on his shoulder - there were two persons behind him; I suspected and watched them; I saw another come and assist the box off his shoulder and put it down on some steps; the prisoner took his handkerchief and wiped his face; two more came up and assisted him to carry it as far as Lee-street. I sent Gerard to make inquiry at Reynolds' - I then went there myself - returned, and saw the prisoner coming down Lee-street with the box - I secured him, and asked where the property was? he said, what property; I said the box he took from Cromer-street; he said, "there it is," pointing to it over the way.</p>

On the 9th of March, at 8 o'clock in the evening, I was going up stairs to the garret with a hay of clothes; the doors and windows were closed; I heard a noise of persons going from one room to the other; I went down stairs, and by the drawing-room door I let the tray fall; my fellow-servant, being in the back parlour, came out - I said somebody was in the garret - I went to the street-door - she followed, and called Watch! - I then stood with my back to the door of the next house, which was uninhabited - and hearing that door open, I turned round and a man came out - Norman came up - I pointed the man out to him - he ran after him - he got out of my sight before he was taken - I did not see his features - Norman and a watchman brought a man back - I went up stairs with two or three other persons and found the wearing apparel and table linen, stated in the indictment, packed up in the back garret in a bag, which did not belong to the house. The property had been taken from the wardrobe in the front attic - the attics join each other - I found the back attic window wide open - I had not seen it after twelve o'clock - it was then open - the bag contained a silk pelisse, worth 5l.; two ladies' dresses, worth 10l.; two cloaks, worth 10l.; an apron, worth 1s.; three bolster-cases, worth 10s.; nine table cloths, worth 5l. Mistress kept her ornaments in a dressing-case on the second floor, which is under the attics - I cannot say whether the room door was shut - I am the only servant who attends in that room - I closed the door in the afternoon - I do not know whether her ornaments were there, they have not been found - I had seen part of them in the room the day before, when I assisted in dressing my mistress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. - Q. At what time did you close your Mistress' door? A. Between twelve and one o'clock - the alarmw as soon after eight o'clock - it was dark - I did not look at the clock, but I had taken in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060044"/>beer, which comes at eight o'clock - I cannot tell whether any body had got in and secreted themselves - I found several phosphorus matches in the house.</p>

Grove called to me - I ran into the street, and saw a man come out of the next house - it was dark, and I cannot identify him; Norman pursued him, and a man was brought back; I was in the back and front garrets at seven o'clock, and shut both the windows down - it was getting dark then.

            . I keep a shop in this neighbourhood. I saw nobody come out of the house; a man was pointed out to me twenty yards from the house; I pursued, and never lost sight of him till Curley, the watchman, stopped him - the prisoner is that man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was dark? A. Yes. I had no opportunity of observing his features, but I never lost sight of him; there was no turning before he was stopped, except the oval railing of the square. I was about twenty yards from him all the time - he was not out of my sight at all; there was no other man in the street, I am certain; there was a young woman who is here.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Can you judge by the footsteps how many persons had been there? A. I should think two or three- I could not compare them with the prisoner's feet, because the marks were wet, and one on another. I do not think it was a wet night - I did not examine his shoes.</p>

               <p>THE HONOURABLE HENRY WILLIAM STANHOPE.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent. The box is what I use of a morning when I get up; the first witness said at the office she was not sure whether I was the man who came out of the house or not.</p>
               <p>JURY to MISS WILKINSON. Q. Can you swear it was the prisoner who threw something away? A. No, but I saw the watchman take the same man as I saw throw it over. I did not lose sight of him till I saw him taken.</p>
               <p>Five witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I am waterman of the coach-stand in Oxford-street, at the corner of Argyle-street, opposite the prosecutor's shop. On Friday morning, the 7th of April, at half-past three o'clock, I saw the prisoner there, and watched him for three-quarters of an hour, walking first on one side, and then on the other, looking at Hammond's shop; I saw him look in at the key-hole twice, as he went by, and give a kind of cough - a waggon went by the last time that he gave the cough; I immediately went and informed a watchman - a watchman came up, crossed Oxford-street, and look him into custody, just as he was coming away from the door - about three yards from the door. I saw no person come out of the house, but saw a person running away on the other side of the way; the watchman called Stop thief! but he got away; I found a bunch of keys and a bag, like a clothes bag, on the step of a door, on the opposite side, a good distance from the house, near Queen-street, and delivered it to the watchman - the keys were under the bag - the prisoner could not have dropped that bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You observed him walking about for three-quarters of an hour? A. Yes; he went to the door and looked through the key-hole - a coachman directed my attention to him - I did not see any one with him - he put his head down to the door and coughed - he walked on one side of the way, and then on another - the bag was found in the direction the other man ran.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. How often do you think he passed the prosecutor's door? A. I suppose twenty times; he did not look through any other key-hole, nor cough, except at this door - it was a kind of short cough, as if for a signal - I cannot find out the coachman.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. James. Wyan called my attention to the prisoner. I noticed him for about five minutes, during which time he went to Hammond's door three times, and stooped down; I was too far off to say whether he made any noise the third time - as he came from the door I collared him within three yards of the door, and two men immediately sprung out of the shop door; when he saw them spring out, he immediately said</p>
               <p>"I have nothing to do with them;" one man went down Argyle-street, and the other ran across by Queen-street; I saw him drop the skeleton keys and bag - the prisoner said nothing more to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see him go into the shop? A. No; I could not hear him cough; I was about three yards off when the men rushed out - nobody else was there; his back was towards the door - one of them rushed by him but he could not see them come out.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. How far was you from him when he went to the door three times? A. Not near enough to hear if he had coughed; I was the width of the street from him - but the third time I was making towards him- within three yards of him - one of the keys opened the shop door - it was quite newly filed; I saw the property found behind the shop door.</p>

            . At the time of the robbery I lived in Quaker-street, Spitalfields. I pawned these things in the name of Trivens, not Trapping; I was at that time living with Trivens, and the people supposed I was his wife; I do not know the prisoner - I was at home, in Quaker's-street, on the 11th of March at seven o'clock - a young man came and asked for Trivens - he spoke to him, but I was cleaning and did not hear what he said - he had a bundle, and when they had done speaking, the young man turned round and said to me, "Will you pledge these" - it was a table-cloth and gown, and by persuasion, I pawned them at Russell's for 2s.; I returne dand put the duplicate on the table with the money- he and Trivens were both there; I did not see him put the duplicate, and money into his pocket; I told the Grand Jury I thought the prisoner was the man - but I do not know whether he is or not.</p>

               <p>JOHNSON.

On the evening of the 11th of October, about half-past seven o'clock, I went to Dalston; I had shut up my shop and left the property safe; I returned about half-past nine o'clock, and found the property stated in the indictment gone, and my wife had eloped; I did not see her again till she appeared before the Magistrate to exhibit articles of peace against me; it struck me she was in the habit of visiting at Calvert's and I went there; I did not see the prisoner then, but I saw him the next morning; I stated what I had lost, and asked if my wife had brought any thing to his premises; he said no - they had not seen her for two months - which I knew to be false, as I had watched her in there on the Sunday morning; it occurred to me that the prisoner had a loft at Mr. Wilkins' premises in Old-street; I went there, and Mr. Wilkins told me to come the next morning at seven o'clock; I did so, and after looking about I found a large canvass bag did under some trusses of hemp; I pulled it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060048"/>out and found some of my property in it; Wilkins' man then came up and knocked me down and took it from me- I fetched the officer, and met Calvert; I said to him,"You have acted the part of a villian towards me in keeping my property;" he said "There was nothing there belonging to me, and nothing should I have;" when I returned with the officer Calvert shut the door against us, and said we should not come in - we got in by force; he and a man were sitting on the bag - they resisted us and pushed us about; we got the property, and took it to the office; the prisoner said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Upon your oath do not you know that in consequence of you and your wife quarrelling, she was forced to take the mattress to sleep on? A. No; I never had but one indictment for assault preferred against my wife - the prisoner then became her bail, and arrested me for her board and lodging; I went to Worship-street, and made a charge of felony against him there - the charge was made before another Magistrate afterwards, but neither of them committed him; I then went before the Grand Jury; I never offered to settle the business if they would give me any money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any proof that this man stole them? A. No; I have no doubt but my wife took them and put them in his care.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Bridges-street, Covent-Garden. The prisoner brought these shoes to me on the 10th of March - he said he brought them from his father, and he lived at a fishmonger's shop in St. Martin-lane - I went with him to the house - he told me to wait, and he went up stairs - I waited some time, when he came down without his hat, and said "You cannot see my father, he is in bed" - I said "Let me see your mother" - he said she was out - I then went into the house and asked a woman if he lived there; she said No - he said he did - we went up stairs, and he knocked at a door, when some respectable people came out, and said they did not know him - we found his hat thrown on the stairs - I then took him back - met the officer and gave charge of him - his mother called the next evening at our shop - she is a widow and appeared very respectable - she has six children, and he is the eldest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went home to my dinner and found my mother and the children starving. I went to pawn these shoes to get some food, and intended to have redeemed them on Saturday evening, when I got my money.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, and live at Chelsea. I saw the prisoner and another man pass my house, which is about twenty doors from Mr. Wilkins'; they walked backward and forward several times, and I suspected them - another person came up to them, and they walked higher up - a man told me that one of them had gone into an ironmonger's shop - I saw the prisoner soon afterwards coming back with the fire-irons in his hand - he ran - I ran to try to catch him, and he threw them down, but I caught them in my hands - I then cried Stop thief! and a man took him, before I lost sight of him.</p>

On the 20th of March the prisoner came to the shop, and asked if a lady had been there, whom he described; I said not - he requested to wait there; he went into the back part of the shop, where he remained about twenty minutes - I did not suspect him - he then came out, and told me if the lady came I was to say he was gone to the Bazaar; the moment afterwards Mrs. Bates told me he had put something in his hat; I followed, and found two muslin dresses in his hat, which I knew to be mine; I brought him back, - he said it was the first time he had stolen any thing, and he hoped I would let him off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. Were you there the whole time he was in the shop? A. Yes; he said he belonged to a respectable family - he did not tell me that he had bought them in the morning, but did not like to carry a bundle through the streets.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he been in the shop that day before? A. No; I had been there all day - many customers had been there that day; I have lived there thirty-four years, and know almost all our customers. I can swear the prisoner never bought any dresses there that day; I never make out the bills - this bill (looking at it) is the writing of Mr. Francis, one of our shopmen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who produced this bill at the Magistrate's? A. I believe the prisoner's attorney; the prisoner said he had bought two dresses that morning, and a bill was delivered to him; it is very frequently the case that one person sells goods, and another makes out the bill.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, who appeared a good deal confused - be begged I would convey him in a coach, in the genteelest way, to the office - he said it was his first offence, and he was very sorry for it. I found eight sovereigns and some shillings upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I deny that I acknowledged any thing of the kind - I bought the goods and paid for them, in two sovereigns and a half, and received the bill at the same time. I left the bill with the servant of the lady, and desired her to call for them - she was not at home, and I went for them myself; I charged the shopman with it, but he would not recollect that I had paid him for them.</p>
               <p>COURT to GEORGE EDWARD WOODHOUSE. Q. Is the lady here who gave you the information? A. No, she is not; no lady called at my house; the dresses are not the price that is put down in that bill; (bill read,) "Bought of Messrs. Woodhouse and Son, two chintz muslin dresses, 2l. 10s."</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

The box was found, and I received it from Sir Richard Birnie.</p>

            . I was coming up Charing-cross on the 6th of March, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running, and stopped him; he said "For God's sake don't stop me;" I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and then put something into the flap of his breeches; I took him into a public-house, and he got the box out somehow, and put it behind him; I took it up and took him to Bow-street. I believe this to be the box- I wrote my name inside of it - Sir Richard Birnie gave it up to Mr. Dickinson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him near Mr. Dickinson? A. No; I saw him near St. Martin's-lane - it was about half-past ten o'clock when I took him.</p>

On this morning on entering master's shop to work, he discharged me for being seen on Sunday in company with two girls of the town; I was standing opposite the Horse Guards, looking at the soldiers, and saw something shining close at my feet - I picked it up, and, feeling pleased with my good luck, I ran off, and was stopped by a cry of Stop thief! - I declare my innocence.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Nightingale. On the 21st of March he sent me to find a piece of cloth, like a piece which he gave me; I went to Mrs. Wilson's, and bought this cloth of her for 12s. - I brought it home, and left it on the counter in the cutting-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. Do you know it by any thing but the colour? A. No; but there never was but one piece made of this colour, and my master had it - I know it by the cuts on the edge.</p>
               <p>MARY WILSON. I keep a shop. I bought this piece of cloth; I believe I bought it for blue, but it is a kind of episopal purple - I did not take notice of it, and I can not tell whether it is it or not - it looks like the colour, but I cannot tell whether it is the same texture; I did not measure it, and bought it between the lights - I believe it was brought by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What day was this? A. I neither know the day, nor the property.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was it you went before the Magistrate? A. About a week after I bought it. I suppose I bought it of the prisoner - I believe he is the man; I had seen him once or twice before. I live in Good win's-court, St. Martin's-lane, where I have lived twelve years; I had been washing at the time, and was rather tired and out of temper, when the cloth was brought.</p>

            . Q. When did you miss this? A. On the 15th of March - I did not say anything to the prisoner, but I sent Burn to make inquiries at different piece-brokers' shops - it being a very peculiar colour - this was the only piece that had been manufactured of the colour. I had the whole of my men examined, and went to Mrs. Wilson's, and requested her attendance the next morning - the prisoner did not work in my house, he had his work home - he was sent for, and Mrs. Wilson identified him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What quantity had you of it at first? A. About twenty-eight yards and a quarter. To the best of my belief, in the whole trade, there was but this one piece of cloth made of this colour - it is possible that some others might have had some of this colour - I will not swear it must have been mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Nightingale visited me in prison on Monday, and said if I would tell him all I could about it he would not do me any harm - it was a sort of compromise.</p>
               <p>COURT to JAMES NIGHTINGALE. Q. Is this true? A. No; before he was committed I went to get information from him; I told him my evidence was not of the consequence that Mrs. Wilson's was - but I wished to know what he could tell me.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Hill, of Limehouse-hole. I saw a barge laden with staves on the 18th of March; they were landed close by our counting-house, and I saw the two prisoners assisting to unload them; I saw Pearce assist to put them into the cart, and in the course of the day I saw him take some and hide them behind a chain cable; I then saw Scott take a long stave and lay it on the ground, and stretch himself upon it; he had before that taken some and laid them behind an enginepipe; I afterwards heard them talking about the division of the staves - one said "You shall not have ten and me eight;" Pearce said "I stole them," and the other said "I watched, and I have as much right to them;" there was then about one truck load to go away, and Mr. Biggs' two little boys were there; the prisoners used to send<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060055"/>them away while they took them; I saw Scott take nine staves which I stopped him with; I then saw Pearce go down to the river at low water, and get up some long and short staves from the mud.</p>
               <p>Prisoner PEARCE. Q. Why did you not report to the owner when you saw me take them? A. I did not know but that he was employed by Mr. Briggs, and I knew they would come back to take them from the place, where they had hidden them.</p>

I received information on the 2d of March, and got a search-warrant - I went to the premises of one Cole, in Rosemary-lane, where I found thirty-three dozen of these combs; I then went to the prisoner Mills', in Elder-street, Spitalfields - he is a bonnet-maker; I asked him if he had any combs - he said he had nothing of the kind in the house - we searched the house, and found thirty-three odd combs in his parlour, in a bag, under some pieces of flannel; from there I went, with the officer, to the prisoner Shaw's, and in a room at Mr. Biggs', where he works I found the chest, with part of the direction on it - I could not speak to it, because I had not seen it before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you known Mills before? A. No. I do not know whether the combs were by themselves, or with other things; I do not know whether Mills uses flannel in his business; Shaw is in the straw bonnet business; as he wanted to go back for a coat I returned with him, and found the combs. I am answerable for the property.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I had a warrant against Cole, who lives in Rosemary-lane, and went there, with Mr. Deacon, about one o'clock on the 2d of March. I found a quantity of combs there; I then got a warrant against Mills; I went there, and his wife called him up - I told him I was an office, and had a warrant to search his house for combs, and I believed he was the man who recommended a person to Mr. Cole, in Rosemary-lane; he said, Yes he was - I asked the name of the person he recommended - he said, Shaw - I asked where he lived - he said he did not know, but Shaw's wife's sister was there at work, and she would tell me; I said I should search his house first; he said, "You may, for I have no combs." I searched the back room, and found nothing there; I then came into the front room, and saw the young woman come down stairs; I left Fortune there, and went with her to Shaw's house; he was not at home; I searched the house, and did not find any thing; I returned back, and asked where he worked - they said, there was a lad there who would tell me, and he took me to a bonnet shop in Bishopsgate-street; the lad went up stairs, and when I heard him coming down I pushed the door open, and went in; I saw Shaw, and said, "I want you;" he said, "What for?" I said I was going to put him into a coach, and I would tell him; I told him it was about some combs - he said, "What, those I found at Cripplegate?" I said, "Where?" - he said, "Near the White Horse;" I said that was near where the robbery was committed; he then said "I did not say I found them there - it was coming from there." I took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went to Mills' house, and found him at his business? A. Yes. I asked if he had recommended a person to Cole's - he said Yes; I then searched his house - he did not say there had been some combs, but his wife had sold them; all he said was true, except that he said he had no combs, and some were found there. Shaw did not say at what time he found the combs.</p>

I then asked his wife if they had any, and she said they had not; she appeared rather uneasy, which caused me to keep my eye upon her; I then saw her open a burean three times, and take something out; I said, "What are you moving there?" she said, "Only a little parcel;" I said, "Let me see what that parcel is?" she put it under a black bag, which I moved, and saw three parcels of combs; I then asked if there were any more - she said, if there were they were in the bureau, which I opened, and found more - there were thirty-three in all; I cannot tell how many of them were in the parcels.</p>

            . I keep a hardware-shop, in Rosemary-lane. Mills came to me about six weeks ago, and asked if I would buy a quantity of combs - he said he had got some which he had taken for a debt, and if I liked to purchase them he would be able to sell them to me cheap; I told him very well - he said he should not be able to send them that day, but he would send them the next, or the day after; two days afterwards Shaw came to my shop, with a sample of combs, which I took and looked at, and asked the price; I did not buy any at that time, but I did afterwards; I paid Shaw 4s. a dozen for them - these are them - they are worth 6s. or 7s. a dozen one with another; he told me he brought them from Mills, and when I offered him the money he said he should go back and ask Mr. Mills. The price which Mills had asked was 5s. a dozen, and I bid him 4s.; he said I should have them for 4s. 6d. I bought thirty-three dozen - these are the combs - they were found by the officer.</p>

I saw Mr. Deacon this morning in the street, and I believe the day before yesterday, at his own house. The bill against Cole was thrown out yesterday.

            . I am Shaw's wife's sister. I have been in the employ of Mills three years last January - Shaw was employed by Mills two years ago but he has not since. In the course of last winter I took a dozen combs to Mr. Mills' shop, and told the work people I had them - I sold one to Smith, and one to Jay - my brother at that time owed some money to Mr. Mills, and he had said he intended to stop my wages if it was not paid - it was a balance of 18s. for some cloth; I mentioned it to my sister, and either two dozen and a half, or three dozen of combs were delivered to him in payment of the debt; I think the whole debt was 27s. - it is not necessary in the straw business to use flannel or silk handkerchiefs, but Mr. Mills had taken some for a bad debt in the City; I was at his house when the search was made - he had no claim to the combs, except the two or three dozen he took of my brother.</p>

On the night of the 18th, or morning of the 19th of February, I lost seven fowls out of one hen-house, and two from another - and, on the morning of the 20th, a constable informed me that a young man was in custody - I went to Uxbridge and gave a statement of the loss - but I did not choose to swear to more than one, which was a very fine cock, though I firmly believe the others were mine - the prisoner was perfectly acquainted with my premises - he had groomed a horse for a son of mine about two years ago - I do not know where the prisoner has lived the last few months.</p>

               <p>COURT to HENRY HEDGES. Q. Where were these fowls? A. In the chicken-houses under a barn, near some cart-pens - they got into the barn from the cart-pens, and then through the floor into the chicken-houses.</p>

            . I live at No. 12, Middleton-square, next door to the prosecutrix. I heard a noise in the new building, No. 13, about eight o'clock in the evening; I went into the back yard, and saw the prisoner and another person, on the parapet wall, at No. 11; I then saw them go into the attic window of No. 13; I laid myself on the garden wall; the prisoner came out of the parlour window - I jumped down and seized him; I said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060060"/>"What are you about here?" he said he came to ease himself; I called for assistance, and Miss Glover sprung a rattle; my wife then called Mr. Vickers, who came to my assistance. As we were taking the prisoner out of No. 13, Vickers stumbled over a box, and I said "You villain, where did you get this - you have been robbing the poor girl of her property;" I called to Miss Glover, and told her she had been robbed - she looked at the box and said it was her property - I then took him to the watch-house.</p>

The prisoner came there on the 16th of March, about nine o'clock in the morning, and asked me for some nails - I gave him about the quantity here produced, of ten-penny and twenty-penny nails - he had no orders to have them - they are allowed to the carpenters for their work.</p>

            . I am a Thames police surveyor. On the 16th of March I saw the prisoner on Saffron-hill, with this basket, and 111/2lbs. of nails in it; I stopped him and asked what he had got there - he told me nails, which were given him by Messrs. Cubits' foreman, of the name of May, and he was going to take them to Hanover-square, to one of the carpenters; I told him he was going out of his way, and he said he meant to call on a friend first: I said I would go back with him to his masters', but when I got within fifty or sixty yards of the house, he said, that what he had stated before was not fact, and that he had taken them; and he told Mr. Cubitt, in my hearing, that Briggs had given them to him; the boy was called, and admitted he had given them to him to be used in the yard.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had he been in your employ? A. About twelve months - I never gave him, or any of my men leave to take bits of wood as fire-wood - I have heard of men doing it, but it is not allowed - I had nearly a sovereign in my hands belonging to him for the time he had worked - he had told me, two or three weeks before, that his daughter was going to be married, and that he would leave 10s. a week in my hands - I went with the officer to his house - I found there a bit of board, about three inches square, which corresponded with some I had at home - there were other pieces there but none I could swear to; I have the fellow-piece to one of these - I cannot swear to any other.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were offered half a crown for this wood would you not take it? A. No; they were in the same state<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060062"/>when on my premises, except this one, which was joined to another - this piece cost me 1s. 2d. a foot - no one was at work there but him.</p>

            . I am coachman to Lord Duncannon. I have known Guinar for two years, by seeing him work near the stable, as a bricklayer's labourer - on the 8th of March he told me he had some pieces of iron lying about, which he wished to take out without the two carpenters knowing it; I understood he worked at Sir Claude Scott's house - he said the trifle he should get for the iron would be so little among them all;" I gave him leave to get it out, and went away directly - the following night I was out with his Lordship, and when I came home, about half-past seven o'clock, I saw the two prisoners - they spoke to me, and said they had been on the premises, and got the iron, out - it was dark and I could not see what it was, but they took it away at three different times - it was bars of iron, they carried it on their shoulders through my stables - they went out each of them loaded first, and then one returned and carried the rest away - they came back in a short time with some liquor, which they pressed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060063"/>me to drink, and I drank with them - there is a low roof adjoining our wall, over which they got the iron; on the following night Hinsby came, and saw some bars and some sash weights were lying there, ready for them to take.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You thought all this an innocent transaction? A. Yes; I went by what Guinar said; two servants besides myself saw them take the iron - they are now in Court. I considered the iron was their own, and the reason they were afraid to take it out, in sight of the two carpenters was, because they should get so little for it; they brought iron twice over the wall out of the premises - there were eleven or twelve bars, and ten sash weights; some of them were sold; I did not see the money, but I had some of the gin; I did not think they were stolen till the second time. I did not tell Lord Duncannon of it, but I sent word to him by the valet the next day. I opened the gates of the stable yard for them - it was between ten minutes after seven o'clock and half-past seven - the men were then gone from Sir Claude Scott's. It did not occur to me that they might have carried it through Sir Claude Scott's without the men seeing them. I did not keep watch, and tell them to be careful, as the watchman was passing by, but as Guinar was going out the first time, there were three watchmen going by, and he stepped back, but I did not give that a thought. I went before Mr. Dwyer. the Magistrate - I did not hear him say it was of no use asking me any more questions, as I had made a liar of myself. I related the transaction as I have here - I did not say I had nothing to say or do in the transaction, nor anything of that kind; I told him I took part of the gin - there had been a person living on the premises of Sir Claude Scott, but I have since heard they had gone away before this transaction. When the prisoners returned the second time, I suspected it was a dishonest transaction, by the time they were gone. The gin was only given once, and we were about ten minutes drinking it; there were the two prisoners, my two fellow-servants, and myself. Upon my oath I did not tell Guinar to step back for fear of the watchmen. I sat up till a little before eleven o'clock - we were four hours there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you help them with any of it into the stable? A. Yes, the second time, because Guinar sat down, and refused to help.</p>

            . I am second coachman to Lord Duncannon. On the evening of the 9th of March some iron was brought into the stable yard by Guinar and the other prisoner - Guinar had spoken to me about it, on the Tuesday before; he asked me where the coachman was; I said he was gone to Rochampton, with the carriage; he said he had a bit of old iron in the stable, which he wished to get away; I had been present the evening before, about seven o'clock, when the two prisoners brought it - I did not help them. I had some of the gin which they brought in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the stable all the time? A. Yes, from seven o'clock till nearly eight - it was all over by that time; I stopped till I had done work - I cannot tell what time it was then, but the prisoners were then gone; they had taken out two lots before I left. I left the stable, and went with Sharp to the public-house, but I did not have above one or two glasses of ale - the two prisoners were there, and paid the money - Sharp drank with them; I was not near the gate when they went out. I do not know how much money they got, nor how much was drank - the prisoners and my two fellow-servants were drinking; I did not ask whose iron it was - I came to the stable door while they were taking the iron over the wall. I asked if they were taking any thing wrong, and they said No. Sharp was not there then. - Lord Duncannon received information of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How high is this wall? A. It is twelve or fourteen feet, and requires a ladder to get over it- they went out with the iron, and brought in the gin; I drank some of it - I only saw them take the iron once. I had been with a note from my master, and when I returned I saw the steward, but I did not tell him of it. I had seen one of them before - I went to the public-house, and they were there; we staid there till about half-past ten o'clock- I never suspected it was a dishonest transaction; I was at the office. I did not hear Sharp say he knew nothing about the transaction. Mr. Dwyer said it was no use to ask him any questions, as he had made a liar of himself.</p>

A man who was with her, said he would give anything if I would take her home, and give her a cup of tea. I took her home, and she recovered herself; the man said he had no money - he then took out one of his brushes, and made me a present of it for my hair; I put it in my bed, and there it was found; he then left eight brushes, and was to call again on the Monday, and pay the shilling which Scott lent him; he did not come, and I took them to pawn; the pawnbroker would not take them of me - I got Griffin to take them, and get a shilling, which was all I wanted. - The other thirty-nine brushes I know nothing about.</p>

My room was never locked - a person came and asked me if I would allow her to put a thing or two in my passage, as the landlady had got a distress in, and she was afraid she should lose every thing she had got - I allowed her to do so - and she said, as the watchman was watching, would I shut the door, which I did.</p>

            . I am a Thames police surveyor. I saw the prisoner in the Strand on the 21st of February, with this type on his shoulder in an apron; I asked him what it was; he said lead; I asked where he got it; he said his aunt, who lived in Buckingham-street, gave it him; I went to the house but the person said he had had nothing from there - I then took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see his aunt that night? A. No; but I have heard she lives there.</p>

               <p>COURT to DAVID SYDNEY. Q. Are you quite sure it is your type? A. Yes, from our having to print part of the act in large letter, and we were forced to take some of another sort to use with it.</p>

            . I am a caulker. On the 23d of March I saw the prisoner in the Dundee Arms yard - he had nothing then - I saw him again in about a quarter of an hour, going towards Hermitage-bridge, with this jacket - I was then on board the Caledonia; I asked him how he came by it, and said I knew the person it belonged to, and said if he would go to our master's I would show him who it belonged to; he went to the door, when I went in, and ran away. I am certain he is the man - a person stopped him and brought him back.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the 25th of February, in the morning, I saw Woodward coming past Shadwell Church with five cheeses and a ham - I asked him where he got them - he said he bought them at a shop, pointing towards Mr. Sayre's - I took him to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060067"/>shop, where I found Reynolds; I asked him if he had sold them to Woodward - he said No, he had not; I then took them from him, and took him to the office - as we were going along he told me Reynolds had given him the cheeses and the ham; I said "For God's sake don't bring an innocent man into trouble, as it is my duty to tell our Magistrate what you say;" he said 'What I tell you is true," and he said the same in the lock-up house; I then went back and told Mr. Sayre what he had said - Reynolds then fell on his knees, and begged Mr. Sayre and God to forgive him - he did not say how he came to take them; I found this handkerchief in his box - he then put a handkerchief round his neck, tied it very tight, and extended his arms - I believe, had it not been for his fellow-servants, he would have destroyed himself.</p>
               <p>WOODWARD'S Defence. I had bought them of the prisoner - I went into the shop, and he said he had them to dispose of, and, situated as I was, I felt bound to do the best I could to get a shilling.</p>
               <p>Thirteen Witnesses gave Reynolds an excellent character.</p>

In 1823 I had a sunk wheel silver watch - it was in June or July that year; the minutehand was broken half off by my thumb nail in opening it, and there was a dent near the handle of it, worn nearly through - I know the prisoner well - I saw him in July 1823, when he robbed me - he used to be at the cook-shop of a night, and I had seen him at Squire Wyard's, at <placeName id="t18260406-165-crimeloc886">Pickler's-hill</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. What time of night was this? A. When he first came I looked at my watch, and it wanted ten minutes to one - I was lying in a sort of shed, where there was hay and straw - there was no window, but some great holes - there was no door, one side of it was open, and that was where we got in - the only opportunity I had of seeing him was in this hovel - I never saw him from that time till about five weeks ago - I had seen him before - Warner, who is here now, came and told me he had got my property, and asked if I knew him - I said Yes - this was about a week before Bedford Assizes; Warner never told me that his brother was accused of horse stealing, nor any thing of the kind - he did not say the prisoner had accused his brother, and a man named Walker, of horse stealing - I never heard that Warner's brother, and a man of the name of Walker, were accused of horse stealing, and were to be tried at the Bedford Assizes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever hear that Warner's brother and Walker were tried for horse stealing? A. No; I heard a man named Monks was tried for horse stealing. but I never heard that Warner's brother and Walker were tried for it till this moment - I did not know the man who came in with the prisoner - upon my oath I have not prosecuted that man for this offence in Hertfordshire; I did not prosecute James Low for this offence; I went to the Hertford Assizes at Christmas, 1823, with this Hertfordshire fellow; but I did not charge him with this offence, as I charge this man now, with stealing my watch, and beating my head against the wall - I mean to stand to that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I caution you, if you do not answer fairly, we will commit you. Did you attend the Hertfordshire Assizes? A. Yes I did, at Christmas 1823 - I was sworn in Court; the man, who was the prisoner there, was James Low; he was accused of bringing this man to rob me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about this watch? A. No; it was not mentioned, neither money nor watch; there was a witness came who went against him and cast him; I did not say he was one of the men who had my watch, but he was the person who brought the man to rob me; that man, who worked with me, was drinking with me, got them to come and rob me, and said what money I had got, and what watch I had got, and said it would be well to part it among them; the gardener put that man in the cage; and his son came out with a blunderbuss and assisted him, but this prisoner had run away then.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did you charge a man of the name of Low with stealing your watch? A. No; I did not; I appeared as a witness against him for bringing this man to rob me of my watch; I cannot tell what happened to him; I heard he had two years' imprisonment; I did not accuse him with stealing my watch, but of bringing this man to rob me; I had not been at a public-house the night before - I always went to a cook-shop, and went to bed at eight o'clock. Low was taken as soon as this man had run away - he was going away after him, and I took him; I never saw my watch afterwards, nor the prisoner till, last Month. I cannot tell whether it was in June or July - it was in hay harvest - Warner never told me to say it was in July - he never told me any thing about it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Whereabouts was this? A. At Pickler's Hill, in Middlesex, just as you turn to East Barnet.</p>

            . I worked with the prisoner - he went to buy a watch-chain; I asked him what he had got, and he said a chain for a watch, which he had won at a mountebank's at Barnet; two or three weeks afterwards he told me that he went to a little place in a garden, and a man took him and one more to rob a person; they waited while he laid down, and they thought he was asleep, and they set upon him, and tried to get his watch and money, that the man was too strong for him, and turned him over twice, but he knocked his head against the wall, and got his watch and money; I saw the watch - the minute-hand was broken off, and there was a dent in it, near the swivel; he said it was at Pickler's Hill, near Barnet, in a shed in a gardener's place; he said the man had a pair of buckskin breeches on, and the chain was off, and he had hard work to get his finger and thumb in, to get the watch out; I had a brother tried for horse stealing, but I never told the prosecutor so - the prisoner and I were brought up under one roof, and while we were sitting in my own house at home, one Sunday, he told me of this; I do not know the prosecutor - the first time I saw him was one Sunday, at St. Neot's - a man who lived at Holloway, pointed him out to me; I was not present when the prosecutor saw the prisoner; when the prisoner told me of what he had done, he said he wished he had such another chance; I know he sold the watch to his brother William, who is now in Newgate; I worked with his brother last wheat hoeing time. I know the prisoner never had a watch before in his life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Was it in 1823 he told you this story? A. It was two years ago last hay time; I went down to where the prosecutor lives, to tell him; the prisoner continued to work in the same neighbourhood till he was taken; I did not go before a Magistrate to tell what he had told me; I think the prisoner was in Bedford gaol last - I am sure he was there last spring; in January or February, I think, he worked for a Mr. Fly, and now and then for a Mr. Goff; Walker and my brother were both charged with horse stealing by the prisoner; they were to be tried at the last Bedford Assizes - it was not till after they were in jail that I went to accuse this man - I was at their trial; another brother of mine contrived to get the prisoner in jail; before that he was at Bedford, committed on this charge, and he was removed here; he was taken on the Monday, as the Assizes were on the Wednesday - he had come down as a witness against my brother - the first time I saw the prosecutor was on the Sunday, as the prisoner was taken on the Monday; I saw the prosecutor at Bedford Assizes; he knew my brother was charged with stealing a horse; I had no conversation with him; the prisoner was to be a witness against my brother - he knew it - he was not in Court but below stairs; he had been in the Court, where my brother and Walker were standing at the bar, but he went away before the trial was over; I am quite sure<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060070"/>about that: I did not go with him - he went away from me out of the Sessions house, while my brother was on his trial - he did not tell me about the watch; I told him I knew the man, and had seen the property. I have been in gaol myself three times - the last time was last Midsummer, for that fellow stealing a watch, about twelve months before; and the first time was seven years ago. I had no spite against the prisoner for being put in gaol last time for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you convicted at any of these times? A. No; the prisoner was in the same gaol with me, on another charge for a watch, but he was acquitted - the man did not know him when he came to the bar - I never shewed the prisoner to the prosecutor at all - I was present when he saw him at the Assizes, and he knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Warner and Day fetched Thomas Butterworth up, and they had me sent to gaol two days before they had their trial.</p>

I saw the prisoner, and another female with her, pass by her, about two or three yards - they then returned, and looked at her reticule; they returned again, and looked at it again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060071"/>- two ladies then came by - the prisoner pushed between them, and took something out of the reticule, but I could not see what - she crossed, and gave something to her companion. I pulled my horse from behind a carriage, went up to Miss Stringer, and asked if she had lost any thing; she said she had that moment lost her purse out of her reticule; I said I could show her the person. Clements then took the prisoner in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Was this in broad day-light? A. Yes - a quarter before one o'clock; there were two ladies not half a yard from Miss Stringer; they had a good opportunity of seeing the prisoner; she rushed between them, and put her hand into the open reticule, but they took no notice of it; they were close by the side of the prosecutrix, and going in the same direction; I do not know whether they saw it or not; I got out of my gig in about ten minutes - the ladies had walked some distance - I did not call to them to stop, nor did not call Stop thief! The prisoner was in the crowd, and a person (who is not here) had seized her - as soon as I got out he let her go, and I took her. I do not know what became of her companion; there was nothing found on the prisoner.</p>

            . I live in Marshall-street, Golden-square. I was in Oxford-street about one o'clock on the 16th of March - I had no servant with me - I had my reticule on my arm, and both my hands were in my muff - the money stated in the indictment was in a beaded purse, and 5d. in halfpence, which I had just received in change. I drew up to a window, and in a moment I felt the bag much lighter. I turned round, and found it was open; I am quite certain I had the money a few minutes before. As I turned, the witness said to me, "Have you lost any thing?" I said, "Oh, dear! I have lost my purse;" he said, "Cross over, and I will show you the girl who put her hand into your bag." I crossed the wide crossing, and stopped the prisoner; I told her I had lost my purse, and from what the young man had said, it must have been her who took it; she was much displeased at my stopping her, and in a moment I was surrounded by a great crowd, and a young man said, "Oh! here is your purse," showing me a beaded purse, which was not mine, and had only some duplicates in it. I have never seen my purse or money since; Bowler's master said he would drive the gig home, and he should go with her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen the purse shortly before? A. Yes - I had been in a shop in Regent-street; I think I must have left my reticule open, as the snap appears to be a very good one. I cannot say whether there were any ladies near me; I had not stopped - I merely drew up to a window; the purse was rather heavy, having the copper in it - I did not feel it taken.</p>

            . I am the officer. On Sunday morning I went to the house and saw the prisoner come out; I stopped him, and said I thought he had something about him not right; he said he had not; I said "What is in your bundle;" he said "Some paper to make caps;" I said I must take him to the watch-house; and as we were going along, I saw him trying to put something into his pocket; I put my hand in and took from him this small parcel of tea in this paper; I then asked where the remainder of the tea was that had been in the drawer; he said it was in another drawer in the manufactory; I desired him to go back with me and show me the drawer; he did so, and pointed out a drawer, in which I understood Palin kept some things; I found there between four and five pounds of tea; I asked who put it there; he said, after some hesitation, that he did; I then asked how far Palin was implicated in it; he said about as much as he was, and they did not intend to take it out of the house, but to make them some breakfasts and save a shilling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say, in addition, that it was at Palin's instigation? A. Yes, and what he said induced me to take Palin into custody - but he was discharged.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Upon your oath did not you ask this poor lad to take some of the tea, that you might have it for your breakfasts, and save 1s.? A. No; I did not - I did not like to go and tell my master - I did not ask him to do it - nor know that he was going to do it - I did not say a word to him till he brought it in - I had a little bit of it. I have been in Newgate myself once for two days, but never any where else.</p>

I asked a gentleman to pick them up, and I followed the prisoner down Stepney-green. I never lost sight of him, except for about a second, while he turned the corner; this knife and stick were thrown upon a shutter, as he ran by, but I did not see him throw them; the trousers appear to have been cut down.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>

I went on Friday morning to pawn a waistcoat, and the pawnbroker said the coat I had brought was stolen - I said I did not steal it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. When were they unpacked and repacked? A.

               <p>MR. LAW. Q. If I rightly understand you, you say you saw them counted, or counted them yourself, and this is the memorandum? A. Yes; I am not aware that sailors are in the habit of making these purchases.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were satisfied with that account, that he got it from the Naples packet? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was this a feather case? A. Yes; I did not take Haynes to the ship, but he gave me the key of his box - he said the other gave him the sugar, and he did not deny it; Hughes had some conversation with Captain Mills, which I did not hear; as we were going to the office he said he could point out the house; I asked him what he got for them - he said he did not know.</p>

            . I am a Thames-police officer. On the 20th of February I was with Hughes in the Surveyor's room at the office - I asked how he got the feathers out of the dock - he said he saw a waggon come in, and he told the waggoner he would give him half-a-crown to lend his great coat, and take a bundle out of the dock for him - that he got the great coat and wrapped the bundle in it, and placed it in the waggon; he followed it as far as the Mint - he then took it to No. 92, Wood-street, Cheapside; I saw a person named Ball the same morning, who produced some feathers in Hughes' presence, which he said he bought of him on the Thursday before - they weighed 41/2lbs. Ball said, but who is to return me my money - I said I could say nothing about that - he said he gave 3l. 5s. for them, but Hughes said it was only three guineas - Ball then said "I believe that was the case;" I afterwards went to No. 21, Bath-street, Hackney - I brought away from there this bundle of feathers, weighing five ounces; and a little more than 1lb. of loaf fine sugar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And so all this was told you that you might find out where they were? A. Yes; he did not tell me the feathers he took to Mr. Ball's were his own, nor any thing like it; I think it my duty to examine a prisoner who is brought under a charge of felony, when there was any property lost - I did not guard him in any way against telling me.</p>

On the 16th of February Hughes came to my house, with a parcel of feathers in a pocket-handkerchief, which he opened out - there were twenty-one bundles, and I considered they would weigh about 6lbs. - he asked but 50s. for them - I said I thought he had come by them wrongfully, as I should think they were worth 30s. a pound, as they appeared very good, and remarkably clean.</p>

            . I have been in the feather trade for fifteen years. I directed some cases of feathers to be shipped on board the Lord Exmouth, and received the bill of lading on the 8th of February. The feathers produced are exactly of the same description - I shipped them at 40s., which was the limit I received them at - I would have given from 35s. to 40s. for them in the market.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why did you ship them? A. Because I could not get 40s. for them - the market was extremely dull, and it is now still worse; I do not affect to say these are the same, but they were of the same description as these - they are particularly clean picked. I offered them at from 46s. to 48s. in bond, but with the duty and expenses, they would have been nearly 60s.</p>

            . I shipped seven cases of nutmegs on board the Lord Exmouth, from No. 1 to 7, marked H. H. and Co., on the 13th of February, on account of Messrs. Stirren and Co. I have seen one of these cases since in the possession of Mr. Fowler; I have compared the nutmegs in that case with those produced - they appear to be the same sort, but those produced by the officer are rather darker, as if the powder had been rubbed off them - but they were as near the quality as possible. I have seen a great many nutmegs.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then these things were not in your possession, but in his, as Captain? A. Yes; as part owner of the ship I considered them in my possession - I had no interest in the cargo except the freight - the Captain had the care and possession of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. Were you answerable for them as well as others? A. Yes; I was, from time to time, in the ship as well as the Captain; I have paid the duty for all the deficiency, to Government, and I have bills of the different articles from the proprietors, who have applied to me.</p>
               <p>HUGHES' Defence.

Trudgett says she received the feathers of me on the 9th of February, but these were not shipped till the 13th. The mate says, it is not a common thing for sailors to make a venture, but I have been various voyages and I know that it is a very common thing for them to do if they can get them on shore.</p>
               <p>HAYNES' Defence. I did not know the feathers were on board the ship - we were cleaning out the forecastle and found the nutmegs lying about - I got them together.</p>
               <p>SPOOR'S Defence. I gave up a parcel to Hughes, but I did not know what was in it.</p>
               <p>Hughes put in a written defence, protesting his innocence, and denying any knowledge of the transaction.</p>

On the 3d of March I was in London, and took a hackney-coach at Hanover-square hotel, about twelve o'clock- the prisoner was the driver, and I directed him to go to Kensington-square; I had a lady with me - I took out my purse at the turnpike gate, at Knightsbridge, to pay the toll, but the man only asked 3d., and I put the purse down on the cushion, to take some halfpence out of my pocket - the purse contained a 10l. note, which had a mark on it, ten sovereigns, and about 12s. in silver - I had seen it all that morning; when we got to <placeName id="t18260406-199-crimeloc1069">Kensington-square</placeName>

(which I had from the lady) and he gave me 6d.; I did not missed the purse for about two or three hours; on my return to town, when I recollected where I had left it, I went to the Hackney-coach-office, and got the address of the driver; I am quite certain the prisoner is the man - I did not see him again till half-past eleven o'clock the same night; I and an officer waited for him to come home to Devonshire-street - the officer told him to come off his box, as he wished to speak with him - he asked him if he recollected that morning having drived a lady and gentleman to Kensington, which he admitted - he then asked him if he had looked in his coach afterwards - he said No [we had been set down at a house, and the prisoner must have known it, because there was some difficulty in finding it]; the officer then asked if he had found any thing in his coach - he said he had not; the officer said I had left my purse there, and he must know something about it - all which he denied - he was asked which was the next fare he took up - he said a lady and gentleman on the road, whom he set down in Piccadilly, near the White-horse cellar, but not at any house - I told him to look at me, and see if he could recognise me, which he did, and said I was the gentleman he drove to Kensington-square, but denied all knowledge of the purse - the officer said he must see what he had about him - he then said he had found a 10l. note about two hours before, tucked under the cushion of the seat - the officer begged to have it, which after some hesitation he gave - it appeared to have been folded up in his right hand - the officer searched his person, and found, in one pocket, nine sovereigns and a half, and about 13s. in silver, and in another pocket 16s. which, he said, belonged to his master, but the gold and silver, in the first pocket, he insisted was his own, and he would give no other account of it; I then gave him in charge; we searched the coach but did not find the purse; (looking at the 10l. note) this is it - it has the name of Burrows on the face in my handwriting.</p>

This is the 10l. note; I accompanied the prosecutor, and heard the prisoner deny that he had got the money; he then said he had found the note two hours before, and the money was his own; I said I suspected it was the gentleman's, but he still said it was his own, and I had no business with it; I found 16s. which he said was his master's - and that was returned to his master; I searched the carriage, but nothing was found in it; I then took him to the watch-house, and next morning I asked if he could account for the sovereigns I found on him - he said it was all nonsense, he took them from the gentleman; I cautioned him that he had made a case of felony of it - but he said it was so, and said he had been drinking part of two pints of ale, which made him so foolish - in taking him to the office he made an excuse to go home to get half a sovereign, to make up the money; he said there had been ten sovereigns and twelve shillings, but he had changed one of the sovereigns.</p>

I said I would inquire if I had left it in mistake at any other place, which I did, but could not find it - I then told him he must know something about it - he cried, and said, if I said so again he would go home - I then went home and told my master; I afterwards saw the watch found on him; he said nothing then.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I let out four rooms ready furnished; the prisoners hired one room furnished of me about four months ago; they came together and passed as husband and wife; they owe me five weeks' rent; on the 24th of February they were taken into custody; I had asked them several times for their rent, and they answered me snappishly, that they would pay me one of these odd days; a number of loose characters came there, which I did not like, and I spoke to them about it; they said they would have who they pleased; I went up into the room when they were not there, and missed these articles stated; I spoke to an officer, who took them while they were at the street door, just going out; they said they should replace the things if I had patience.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Were you the person who let these lodgings? A. Yes; I and my wife together; I brought in a new bed, which cost me 3l. 10s., the same night they said they would replace the things; the man was away nearly all day; I believe he had a good character; he worked for a Mr. Cundy.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Then you did not see Costigani till you saw him in Broad-court? - A. Yes; they were together when the handkerchief was drawn; I did not know him before.</p>

            . I was in company with Bertraun the whole time, and saw all he has described; when we saw them looking at the handkerchief I went and took Costigani, who had then got the handkerchief round his neck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How can you account for his having it round his neck? A. A handkerchief is tied round a neck in a minute; when I first saw it they were looking at it under the gas-light, but before we got to them he had got it on his neck; I suppose they did not see us looking at them - we got up to them in about a minute. Bertraun took it off. I am quite sure I saw Costigani in King-street, perhaps for five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>COURT to ANGELIOUS BERTRAUN. Q. What time elapsed between your seeing the third boy take the handkerchief, and your seeing the three boys looking at it? - A. About a quarter of an hour; I did not lose sight of Costigani, except when he turned the corner. I took the handkerchief, which was tied round his neck; I did not see him tie it round.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>COSTIGANI'S Defence. My mother lets out a room in Wild-court; she sent me to see if the lodger had paid the rent, and when I got to Covent-garden I saw a lad named Smith, who said he was going to Bedfordbury; he went to buy some oranges, and I went on - when I was in King-street a lad came and said, "Is not that William?" I said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060084"/>Yes, and he said he would go with me to Wild-court, and a boy, they call Jack, the plasterer, came and asked him to buy a handkerchief - he said he had no money, but the boy pressed him to buy it; he said, "It is small - I do not think it will go twice round my neck;" I said it would go twice round mine. I then saw the two men coming up the court - when I saw the others run I ran.</p>

On the 17th of March, after I had cried the hour of two, my dog barked a good deal; I then went to Dr. Turner's stable, and there I saw Thomas Simpson with a sack of malt on his back; I took hold of the corner, he threw it down upon another sack and ran away; this was about one hundred yards from the barge; I had known him from a child and have no doubt of his person - I said "I have got you now" - he made no answer but ran away; I sprung my rattle, and a man, named Davy, got up and came to a window to know what was the matter - I said a man had been stealing some malt out of the Ware barge - he got up and took one of the sacks into my house, and came back for the other; I then went down and called to the bargeman, but could not awake him - I met another watchman - he then went down and awoke the bargeman - he said "Get up, you will lose all your malt;" I did not see John Simpson till about twenty minutes after two o'clock, when he and his brother came to the place where the malt had been thrown down; I said "You are the two gentlemen who have been lifting off this malt;" John said "What malt" - I said "You will know in the morning" - he said "If you want me you know where to find me" - I showed the same sacks and malt to Lambert, and they are here now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was past two o'clock in the morning? A. Yes; it was not quite bright moon-light, but light enough for me to distinguish him - we went the next day before a Magistrate; I did not say before him that I could not swear to the man, as I did not see his features - what I said to Thomas Simpson was, "I have got you - but he got away - I had hold of the corner of the sack - it was about one hundred yards from the wharf; I had no lantern; I had seen him in the afternoon - he had a lightish jacket and blue trousers on; I mentioned to the foreman of the brewhouse that I knew the person who had committed the robbery; I heard that John surrendered himself, but I did not know it; I only communicated my intelligence to the watchman - I was at work at the brewhouse when the prisoner was taken - I had not stopped a man with a sack of malt half an hour before - I did not see the first sack of malt before Thomas threw his sack down upon it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You say he endeavoured to take your watch, how did he do that? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. Did he speak when he gave him in charge? A. Yes; he ordered the other watchman to take him down to the watch-house, and said he had been robbing him of his watch.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Williamson come into the watch-house that night? A. Yes; he said nothing about the money being taken - he said, next morning, that he saw the prisoner had got the prosecutor against the iron-rails, with his small-clothes undone, and had got the watch out, but could not get it away, because it was fastened - he did not charge the prisoner with taking the watch that night - he heard what was going forward, and came with this story next morning: I took the silver from the prisoner; he had an opportunity of seeing what I took from him; the prosecutor, or the waiter, might have seen it - I took it out, and counted it on the table, and there was whitening on it; the prosecutor described it as having whitening on it in the morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you refuse to take the charge upon finding the watch? A. Yes; as soon as I saw it on the prosecutor - Williamson did not say why he came in.</p>

At nine o'clock on this night I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor together - the prosecutor took him into the parlour; I saw the prosecutor with a half-crown - I saw no other money - I saw him go away, and immediately heard a cry in the street - I went out and desired them both to come in again; I said "What have you to allege against the man?" he gave no answer, but still insisted upon knowing his number; he ordered a glass of gin and water, and gave me half-a-crown, which I changed - I then desired the prisoner to go, as the man had nothing to allege against him, which he did - the prosecutor stopped about twenty minutes, and then went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He could not make any charge against the man? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the night in question I arrived at my post about twenty minutes before seven o'clock. I walked round my beat, and met the prosecutor at the corner of Beaumont-street and Devonshire-street, accusing a gentleman's servant of throwing water on him from a window - I inquired what house it was, and he pointed to an uninhabited one - I mentioned that to him, and he got quite pacified, and asked me to have something to drink - we went into the Devonshire Arms, and I had a small glass of rum - he took out his watch, and put it down to pay for the liquor; I said it was very strange he should call me in to have liquor and not have money to pay for it - I told him to put his watch into his pocket, and search his pocket, to see if he had got no money - he turned out his pockets, and in his right hand waistcoat pocket he had three half-crowns - he changed one, and I left him there about half-past eight or nine o'clock - I met him again in Devonshire-street, and he urged me to go to the Sun, and drink with him; I said go to the house, and I may call; when I got to the door he met me, and urged me to go in; I drank about two table-spoonsful - he met me again afterwards, and urged me to have more - I said I would not, but he urged me, and said he had some rum and water with some soldiers - I consented to have some, and that was all.</p>

No - there is certainly a great similarity; the a is turned over in the same way, but there is a difference.

I turned round, and saw three bakers standing together, but I did not know Lloyd; he was pointed out to me afterwards. Lloyd is now in Court (pointing him out).

She came there again the following year, and went by the name of Bligh. I have seen her write frequently, and know well the character of her hand-writing. I think her present writing is much better than that in this register, but as far as I can judge, I think this is her writing - I believe this letter to be her writing (looking at one); I believe Bligh was mate of a ship - I was given to understand that after he went to sea, the first time, she was a companion to a lady of the name of Truss, in Claremont-place; she said that she was companion to her, on account of her being deranged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Upon your oath is there not a considerable difference between the hand-writing you have sworn to, and the hand-writing in this book? A. I think her hand considerably improved, but I still think it is her hand-writing. I did not know any thing of her writing till 1822. I do not know whether she did live with a lady of the name of Truss or not; she went by the name of Bligh only when I saw her write.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not her writing a much better hand than that? A. Yes, it is now; the name I saw her write was Bligh - there is no similarity in the names. I had no knowledge of her writing in 1814. I think this name "Thomas Lloyd" is her writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does she write a better hand now than she did at the date of these letters? A. Yes, I think she does - her present hand-writing is much better than this in the book.</p>

I once lived in the prisoner's father's house; I recollect her by the name of Ducket, and Lloyd courting her; I recollect their going out one day and coming back again, after which she went by the name of Mrs. Lloyd; I had before heard her say she was going to be married; they lived together as man and wife in her father's house; I lived in the house for three or four months - I have heard her mention Lloyd as her husband; about three or four years ago she called at my house, very handsomely dressed, and said she had married a gentleman named Truss - this is Lloyd, (pointing him out.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you ever paid her one shilling? A. No; we lived together for two years before we were married, and after we were married, for four years; we lived very comfortably for the two years, but not so afterwards; our acquaintance first commenced in the street - we first lived in Chalton-street, and afterwards at the Polygon in Somers-Town; I did not know but that she was the window of Captain Bligh - I did not know a person of the name of Bligh; I have not taken any proceedings in Doctor's Commons; my object in bringing forward this prosecution is not merely to get rid of the marriage.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. When was the settlement made? A. In the latter end of last year - I had not, till after the deed was executed, the slightest reason to believe that she had deceived me - she conducted herself properly before our marriage, and it was her solicitation that induced me to marry her; she represented herself as the daughter of Mr. Graham, brother of Sir J. Graham, who was first cousin to the Lonsdale family - she mentioned Lady Styles and Mr. Bosanquet as relations on her mother's side - she spoke of a rich aunt of the name of Hearn, but did not say what her expectations were - it was not my proposal, but her urgent request that I should marry her; she frequently went away from me on visits - the trustee for her, under the settlement, was Captain Atkinson, the commander of the schooner St. Helena - he frequently visited at our house after the marriage.</p>

I am brother-in-law to Mr. Truss; I knew the prisoner about ten days after her marriage with him - she represented herself as the widow of Captain Bligh, and neice of Lady Stiles and Mr. Bosanquet; I went down to Bognor with the officer last Saturday four weeks, and found her in bed with Captain Atkinson - the officer drew back the curtain and saw them; I accompanied them to town - she was very free in talking - there was no threat or promise held out to her; she said she was married to Lloyd, and she would not deny it, but she had been sold by him to a sailor of the name of Bligh, for 5s. and a bottle of wine.</p>
               <p>A letter was here read from the prisoner, directed to Thomas Lloyd, Pershore, Worcestershire Signed, Elizabeth Lloyd, dated Feb. 14, 1816. Also the address and signature of a letter read, dated Broadstairs, July 19, 1822, addressed to W. H. Truss, Esq., East India-house, London, Signed, E. W. Truss. The contents of these letters (which are those proved to be the prisoner's hand-writing) did not relate to any matters connected with this case, but were only produced to prove the prisoner had avowed herself by the names signed to them.</p>

It was on the Friday or Saturday; I would not carry it myself; I hired your cart to remove my goods on the 11th of February - you had come to move my goods before the chair was taken home - I live at No. 11, East-street - I asked how he got the things out, and he told me with a crow-bar - the place is in a mews - he took the chair to the door, and I took it in of him - when a person was there they could see what was in the shop.</p>

            . I was taken up about this matter, and examined by the Justice - he told me to say nothing, as it might hurt myself. I was at the Angel public-house, at Isleworth, on Friday evening, about nine o'clock- Harris, Ayres, and White were there; we all said, "Let us get a few turnips;" we walked by the Chaise and Horses public-house, and Harris said, "Let us go and get something worth while;" he took us up to Sion-lane - I did not know what he was going after till we came past Mr. Iron's; Ayres, Harris, and White then got over the pales - I could hardly get over, but Ayres eased me over, and we went on till we came to the cow yard - there are some pales round it, and some persons live in the little house by the side of the barn. Ayres and Harris got over the pales - White lifted me over; I waited there - Harris and Ayres got on the top of the cow shed; I heard them pulling the tiles off, and I ran to the other side of the pales. Harris called to White to ease it off the tiles - I did not then know what it was; I went up, and saw White under the tiles, with the lead on his shoulder. - Ayres and Harris got off the tiles, and carried it through the field, till they came to the hedge - Harris then lifted it on White's back, and they got on the sand heap in the Whale field, where they divided it into three pieces - this is one of them; Ayres sold one piece for 2s. 2d., and I sold one for 2s. 3d., and gave the money to Ayres, who shared it; the third piece was left in the sand house, under the straw; we went away; the next day Ayres, Harris, Rowley, and I, went birds' nesting; Harris and Rowley were a-head of us, and got into the Whale field, about a quarter of an hour before we did. I did not see the witness in the field; I heard Harris say somebody had sprang the plant, and I saw Gardner go and say, "What would you give to know who it was?" he said, "I would not mind two pots of beer and a punch of the head."</p>

Between five and six o'clock on the evening of the 3d of April, I saw two ducks on the river - one was brown and the other white - they were not a quarter of a mile from Sibley's. I saw the prisoner come within about three hundred yards of me, and shoot the brown duck; he waded up to his knees in the water, and got it, put it into his pocket, and went away. I went and told Mr. Sibley, and the prisoner was taken next day - I am certain he is the man there was another man with him, but the prisoner carried the gun, concealed under his coat.</p>

            . I am a broker. I live near Mr. Weller. On the 18th of March I saw a waggon at his door, delivering spirits - I saw the three prisoners and another man with them - they had been waiting about at a distance, while the spirits were delivering; one of them was at the window of a cook's shop, and the other at the corner of Ironmonger-row; when the men were gone in to get their clothes, the fourth man, who is not here, nodded to the other three, and Grady got on the waggon-wheel and handed out the cask (which seemed to me to be a barrel of gin) to Dowty, who was waiting for it; Purdy stood at the door all the time - the other was still at the cook's-shop window, at the corner of New-street - Dowty went along Old-street, and up Ironmonger-row - I went and told the carmen of it - Dowty and Purdy were soon after brought to the watch-house.</p>

Booth, standing at the prosecutor's door - I was stopping to tie my shoe, and saw Grady lifting a cask from the waggon; he put it on the hind-wheel - another person came up, put it on his knot, and walked off with it - it struck me something was wrong, and I watched him; he went up Ironmonger-row; I heard the cry that they had been robbing a waggon; Parker ran up Old-street, and I up Ironmonger-row; Parker seized the man; and I saw him stretch himself up and throw the cask down, as if to throw it on his legs; I have not the least doubt it was Grady who handed the cask out, but I will not swear to him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 10th of March, about half-past two o'clock, I saw Hutton going along Hounslow with a basket. Mrs. Hancock was close behind him - I followed him half a mile, and asked what he had got - he said some lead from Mr. Hancock's house, and he was going to Brentford to sell it - at the further end of Hounslow I got an officer, and we took Hutton - Mr. Emmerson and I went to Hancock, who is a shoemaker, and lives at the end of Hounslow - both the doors were fast - he went to the front door and I to the back; Mrs. Hancock said her husband was gone to Harlington, but a man said he had seen him just before - we then broke the door open and found him. I said to Hancock "You are my prisoner, you must go with me;" Emmerson went up stairs, and brought some lead, which Hancock said had been in Taylor's room; we asked where we could find Taylor; he said "If you go to Crawford-street, you will find him;" Emmerson went there and found him - we got a search-warrant a few days afterwards, and found some more lead in Taylor's box; as we were coming to London on the 11th, Hutton said "If we have taken the lead from Mrs. Canham's gate they can't swear to it now, because it is cut in pieces" - the other two prisoners were close to him, but made no observation. I believe they all lodged in Hancock's house.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. We apprehended Hutton with the lead - we then went to the house, and I found four pieces more, which Hancock said was Taylor's - I found two more pieces in Taylor's box - I took them to the office, and took two or three tradesmen to see where the lead was taken from; the lead here produced matched exactly to the top of the building; I knew that Taylor lived at Hancock's, but I did not know what room he occupied; I heard Taylor say he knew the lead came into the house the same night it was lost off the lodge - there were 87lbs. of it.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. I saw the prisoner in St. John's-wood-lane, about eleven o'clock, with two quart pots. about 190 yards from Mr. Hinton's house - he put them down, took them up again, then walked round to the back of a house, and got in at the window - I heard him beating something - I went up to the place, and saw him beating one of the pots with a brick; I said"What are you beating these pots for?" - he said he was going to take the other pot home; he went out at the front of the house; I called to a person, and had him secured.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been for a pot of beer, and brought it down to the gardener - I went into the building, and put the pots down, but I did not beat them.</p>

One of the witnesses then came to me, and he cut at him in the legs; I tried to get the knife from him, but could not; he then cut at my legs, but with the back of the knife. I seized him by the throat - Ellen Mullins came, and got the knife from him - he was then taken to the watch-house - these articles were found in the manger.</p>

She took me to <placeName id="t18260406-259-crimeloc1405">Bainbridge-street, St. Giles's</placeName>

I undressed, and she took off her gown, but was very slow in getting her things off. I had two purses in my side pocket, containing silver and gold, and to the best of my recollection, I had a watch; I am certain I had had it two hours before. I cannot say but what it might have been extracted from my pocket before - I had come from the City, and had been walking about; I had a blue cotton handkerchief in my pocket. The prisoner then said I should give her the money before we went to bed, but I was quite unwilling to remain, from the appearance of the place, which was very mean and shocking - I said I would go away; she then said she would have some money, but I was unwilling to show where my purses were, as my clothes were off, and on a chair; I therefore declined giving her any at that time; she then sat down on a chair, took up the coat, and searched the hinder pockets; she threw the coat about several times, but did not discover the purses; she arose up again, and said if I would not give her some money she would soon call in some person who should make me - she then went outside the door, and instantly Pritchard came in; I had not heard her say anything outside the door. She came and stood on one side of me, quite close - he stood on the other - she began telling him that I would not give her any money - at that moment Rawlins came in at a window - they both stood by me, but said nothing. Donovan then took up the poker, held it over my head, and said she would dash my brains out, unless she had some money; she then struck me with her first under my right ear; I saw I had better concede to any thing then lose my life. I told her my property was in my waistcoat pocket; she then went back to the table, snatched up the waistcoat, and blew out the candle; they then all three went away with my waistcoat. I put on my clothes as fast as I could, went out, and called the watchman, Ryan - he went with me up to the room, and found nothing there. I described them to him - as we were going up the stairs I found my pocket handkerchief. We then went three or four houses off, up to the second floor - he knocked at the door, and said, "Let me in;" they said, "Who is there?" and I think it was the woman, who said, "We are all in bed;" the watchman said if they did not let him in he would burst the door open - the door was then opened; my waistcoat was laying on the table; the three prisoners were in bed together, and another woman, who is not here - Ryan and the other watchman made them all get up - Donovan was quite dressed, as when she left me; I believe the men had their coats off. I am certain the waistcoat was the one she took from the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner DONOVAN. Q. Did not you tell me I might take the waistcoat, and did I not take two letters and two small keys out of it, and say I would go and get a light? A. No.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 28th of March I saw Donovan come into the street, between one and two o'clock - and in the course of ten minutes afterwards she came out with a candle, and asked me for a light, which I gave her; she then went back into Jones'-court. I was going down Bainbridge-street between two and three o'clock, and the prosecutor said, "I am robbed by a girl and two men;" I went with him to the room, and found nothing there - I told him to be silent, as I had seen the girl come out of No. 6, and he had come out of No. 10. I got the next watchman, and went to No. 6 - I found the handkerchief on the stairs; I went up, and told them to open the door; one said, No, the door was locked, and what did I want - I said they must open the door - some one did so; we entered, and the three prisoners and another woman were in bed together - Donovan was dressed, and the others had their clothes off, except their shifts and shirts. The prosecutor said, "I can swear that is the girl, and these are the men;" he had described them before. I found this waistcoat on the table.</p>

Yes; the prisoner went up to the prosecutor, and pulout his watch - she said "By G-d he has got a good watch," and then put it in again - she then went to his other side, and took out a bag of sovereigns - he awoke, and said "What are you at?" he then pushed it into his pocket again, and she went and sat down on the bed - I then went to sleep, and did not see any more - the candle went out.</p>

I had been in service, and left it to marry him - I had known him from the July before; I had no fortune; he behaved very far from well to me - I was never happy - we had no children; no one told me to bring forward this case, but I heard he had another wife.</p>

On the 15th of March the prisoner Jones came to my shop, with another man, and while they were looking at some ribbed worsted stockings, Barry came in; they did not seem to know one another. Barry asked to look at some caps, gloves, and stockings, which were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060106"/>shown him - he took his hat off, and put it on the counter to try a cap on, I believe - my wife was serving him; Jones and the other were looking at a variety of things. I kept my eye closely upon them; I afterwards saw Barry put his hat upon his head - he had bought one pair of lamb's-wool stockings and a cap, and paid for them; the others agreed for a pair of stockings, paid 6d. on them, and left them - Mr. Davies came in, and told Barry, who was going away, to take off his hat, and two pairs of these stockings were found in it - he first said they must have got in without his knowledge, and then he said one pair was his own, but I knew they were mine; he had what he had bought in his hand. Jones and the other were very near him.</p>

            . I was with the constable. I searched Joseph Dunn on the 25th of March, about eleven o'clock in the morning, at Hackney, and found this bed furniture, quite wet, wrapped round his body, under his clothes. I asked how he came by it, and he said it was his own - that he had had it washed, and was going to sell it to his brother, at Clapton, as he was very much in want of money, and if any body else could own it he must suffer for it. Garton (who was with me) found this piece of print, which appears to be the same furniture, in the hat of Charles Dunn; I did not hear what he said about it.</p>

As I was coming home I met a watchman in the field, and coming over the fields I saw something white in a dry ditch; I took it home, and showed it to my landlady. On the Sunday some persons came in, and said I had better take it to the first public-house, nearest to where I found it; I was going the next morning to take it to the White Horse public-house, and while I was there Mr. Attfield took my brother; I went with them, and at Worship-street I pulled off my hat, and he saw what was in it.</p>

            . I am an assistant to Mr. Lazarus. On Thursday the 21st of March, I was in his shop, which is opposite Mr. Spooner's, and saw the prisoner trying to lift the print from the iron where it hung - he had a companion; he then passed up the street, and in a short time returned and handled it again - I turned round to answer a question, and on turning my head again I saw it was gone - I ran out and pursued the prisoner, who took the right hand turning of Finsbury-square - I called, Stop thief! and he dropped the print from his apron - I took it up, and followed; I lost sight of him, but he was stopped, and I brought him back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me drop the print? A. I did not actually see you, as I stumbled at the time - I was about fifty yards from you.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's service. On the 28th of February I missed something from the door; I went out and saw the prisoner with the cheese under his left arm - I called Stop thief! - he dropped it and ran with all speed; I pursued him till the officer stopped him; I had seen this cheese safe about half an hour before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defences stating that Dodd, at the time, could not identify him, but said he thought him the man.</p>
               <p>JAMES DODD re-examined. I am sure he is the man who dropped the cheese; I lost sight of him as he turned round by the five lamps, and was taken in Fenchurch-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Sawyer? A.

The prisoner came into the room, and asked for some samples of tea - he had six breaks of Hyson tea set before him, and he took samples of them all - it is usual for persons to bring samples of the same sort of tea as they intend to buy; I was so placed in the room, that I could see exactly what he did - he was sampling the tea, that is, taking a small quantity from each, in a little measure like the top of a cannister, which is the limit of the quantity allowed to be taken away; there are rules stuck upon the show-room, that no persons but such as are known are to have samples, and that none of them are to have more than the in measure; as the prisoner was sampling the teas, the man who was attending to him, went to get some more from another break, and I saw the prisoner, in his absence, take some of the tea, and put it loose into his right-hand small clothes pocket - he did this several times; I told Mr. French, the elder, he told me to watch him again, and not to accuse him without good reason; I then saw him put some Hyson tea into his breast-pocket; Mr. French then desired him to walk into the counting-house, and the tea was found on him; Mr. French said, "It is a pity a gentleman like you should act in such a way;" he seemed to be quite cut up about it, and begged Mr. French's pardon, and hoped he would let him off, and not take any further notice. Mr. French said he must tell the warehouse-keeper, and he might do as he thought proper - he said he had been a long while out of work, and was very much distressed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there a number of persons in the sale room? A. Yes; I was kneeling down, your face was towards me, and your back to the corner; I cannot state what breaks of tea you took most out of - you had about sixteen trays handed to you.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw what was going on, and informed the elder? A. Yes - the prisoner was still at the tray - when he had done he got up to go away - he took his bag and went down stairs - the elder was at the bottom, and stopped him.</p>

            . I am assistant elder to the Company.

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you swear you did not come into the room where I was, and say, "Before you go I want to speak to you"? A. No - I never once spoke to you, nor came near to you - the business was never communicated to you till you came down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When people come to buy teas, do they bring samples and leave them there? A. Yes; the prisoner brought six samples, and I counted six samples which he had in his bag - the tea in his pockets was beyound the samples he had brought.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you asked me if I had any tea in my breeches pocket, I said I had - you said I must leave it - and did I not give it out? A. Yes; I took up your coat pocket and turned it out - you made no resistance.</p>

            . I was the Excise officer. I was present when the tea was found in his breeches and his side coat pockets; French took it from him, and said he had understood he had some tea - he trembled very much, and said he had, and he hoped Mr. French would not do any thing in it - he said he came from Messrs. Whitridge and Co., No. 91, Cheapside; I did not hear him say any thing about his own situation.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not in the room when I sampled these teas? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sampling the tea for some friends, having a great many friends, and having been twenty years in the business. I sampled a number of breaks of Hyson, and the sixteenth and seventeenth breaks appeared to me to be of a particular quality, and I took some of it. I do not deny taking it, but I do deny its being with a felonious intent; the last witness was at the end of the table, and twenty or thirty men were nailing down tea chests - and was it likely I should have gone to commit a felony at two o'clock in broad day. When I was asked if I had not tea I immediately gave it up.</p>
               <p>COURT to WILLIAM FRENCH. Q. What did he say? A. I said, "How came you to take this?" and he said, "I am short of samples;" and then he said it was for himself.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it customary to allow the parties to take their samples themselves, or is it given them by the officer of the Company? A. He takes the sample out in a tin measure - it is put into a paper, and the sample they bring is measured in the same measure.</p>

We have a number of stamps for use in our business, and I very frequently missed some. I accordingly put a private mark on those left in my drawer - they were 3s. 6d., 4s. 6d., 5s., 6s., and 8s. 6d. bill stamps. I made a small mark in the stamp, by which I should know them from all others. From five o'clock in the evening of the 13th of March, till nine in the morning of the 16th, I missed a considerable number - on the evening of the 17th I missed some more; Meredith had been at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060116"/>my office that evening, and in consequence of something said by me to his brother, he was sent out, and returned; I saw him in the street, and he was taken to an opposite office - I asked him for the stamps - he denied having any, but I insisted upon having them, and said I had no doubt he had them on his person, and I would search him unless he would give them up - he then gave them up. I took him to my house in Chatham-place, and afterwards to the Mansion House. In consequence of information he gave us we went that evening to Zamira's house, in Duke's-place, but did not go in; we went there again on the evening of the 18th, and part of my stamps were found there. I never sell stamps in any way whatever - here are what I found on the prisoner Meredith when he was taken, and here are those found at Zamira's on the 18th - they are what I had lost on the 13th or 14th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. Then it was not on the evening you took the boy you went to Zamira? A. No; we did not go into the house till the evening of the 18th; I have about six servants; the stamps were not locked up - they were in a private counting-house; Mereditch could have access to it, because he came at eight o'clock in the morning, before the clerks came; we have three porters and two clerks, but the counting-house is never left by myself or Mr. Smith; I think only one clerk or book-keeper knew where the stamps were kept.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Zamira's house, at the corner of Bury-street, St. Mary Axe, on the 17th, and on the 18th I went in with the prisoner Meredith, Mr. Shirley, and a gentleman here - we sent Meredith in, who asked if Zamira was at home; they said Yes; as I went in he was coming down stairs; I said to him "Do you know this young man," (pointing to Meredith) who was standing with his back against the door - he said No; there was no other young man in the shop; I asked what he had done with the stamps he bought of Meredith; he said he knew nothing at all about them; I then told him I was an officer; he said "Don't make a noise, I have got my house full of company;" he then spoke to his wife, or an elderly woman there, and, to the best of my recollection, it was to go up stairs, and bring the stamps down; she brought them down and gave them to Zamira - he gave them to Mr. Shirley, who identified them as his property; here are four for 3s. 6d., four for 4s. 6d., and five for 5s.; they are quite clean, and here is a mark on every one of them; we then came down to the Mansion-house; they were then committed - Meredith did not deny it or say any thing about the stamps produced - it is a kind of grocer's and stationer's shop I understand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did he call to this old lady? A. No; she came without being called - he only said "Go and fetch me the stamps;" I heard all he said - he is not deaf that I know of.</p>

I was in Red-cross-street on the 18th of March, about half-past five o'clock - I saw the prisoner take the hat from a peg - he said to me "Do not say any thing - come along with me;" he went a good way off with it - I did not see him stopped - I told the shopman of it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody - I found him in the shop, and this sack under his arm - the hat was given me by the witness - I took him to the Compter, and found four half-crowns and 4s. 6d. in his pockets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to buy a hat, and a man gave me a push, and told me to go on; I had the hat, and some men came and took me by the collar; I had the bag to go to Billingsgate to get a job - the hat was outside the door.</p>
               <p>JAMES BAYLEY re-examined. The hat was on a stand inside the door - a young man there saw him take it - he followed and brought him back.</p>

On Saturday, the 25th of February, I locked up their iron chest, about six o'clock in the evening; this gold and silver was in it; I had bought the piece of silver, just a week before; two pieces of massy silver I had bought on the 25th of Otton; I had put them into the fire and melted them in the kitchen, by his request - they came out in a particular shape, and I can identify them - the chest stood in the counting-house, which was never locked; I went into the counting-house again on Monday morning, about seven o'clock; it joins the workshop by a passage; part of the workshop is tiled in; I saw a large hole in the tiles of the workshop, enough to admit a man's body; I had not been there on Sunday - I only passed through the passage to go into the house; I then went into the counting house, the door of which was open, and I found the iron chest open which I had left locked, and missed the gold and silver, and the two massy pieces of silver; I then missed a sovereign from the till of the counter in the counting-house, which I had seen there on the Saturday night; I had locked the till, and had the key; the lock had been forced open; the lock of the chest appeared to have been opened with the key which had been in one of the partitions of the till, where the sovereign was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. Was that the only money in the till? A. No, there was 3s. in halfpence, and they were taken too. The surgery business is not carried on under the same roof - they do not live there; one of the prosecutor's brothers went away on the night of the robbery - the other I saw a fortnight ago; I know that he was acquainted with the prisoner, and that he is not now to be found - the counting-house is part of the dwelling-house.</p>

            . I am constable of St. James. Westminster. I went to the prisoner's lodgings on Tuesday, the 28th of February, at No. 5, Bow-yard, Drury-lane, and found him in bed - I told him I wanted him on a charge of felony; he dressed himself, and I searched him- he refused me at first, and I observed him put his hand into his left-hand breeches pocket, and draw out something, which he dropped on the bed. I then tied his hands with a handkerchief, and looked on the bed, where I found three pieces of silver - I took charge of them immediately. I searched the room, and found a pair of shoes - the Magistrate asked at the office if they were his, and he acknowledged that they were. I went two days afterwards to the prosecutor's workshop - I observed the opening, and saw the print of a footstep ont the chimney, within half a yard of the opening; I fitted the right shoe to the footsteps - it appeared to correspond exactly - I found in the prisoner's room one new and some old crucibles, and a basin with some sort of metal in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search his pockets before he dressed himself? A. No. I compared one of the shoes with the footsteps, but I did not mention that at the first examination. Mr. Warwick's brother said he did not know where he was; I took a deal of trouble to find him, but I could not. I found some property of Mr. Warwick's brother's at the prisoner's lodging.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 27th of February Peter,(the prosecutor's brother,) came to my place before breakfast, and gave me 6s. to fetch a coat from the dyer's, that wanted repairing; I repaired it for him - he said he wanted to meet a friend, and he could not go in his fustian jacket - he pulled off the jacket, and put on the coat; I removed the jacket, and the three pieces of silver fell out- he has never been found since.</p>

            . My mother, Sarah Dunn, is in partnership with Robert Harcastle. The prisoners had been in their employ seven or eight months; between five and seven o'clock on the evening of the 4th of March, I gave Goodhall the key of the solder cupboard - I then took it away, and said I had not time to lock to it, but in ten minutes after I gave him the key again to go down to the solder cupboard - he went down, with Dade and Hedley - Goodhall was below, and Dade at the top, and Hedley was handing the solder to the counting-house - I stood over the cellar looking at them - I waited for the key; when they had got it all up, I said, "Is it all up?" they said,"Yes;" I then hung up the key and went to my tea - on my return I found all the men waiting, except those three - I went after them, and found them still in the cellar - I jumped down, then Dade ran from them and I called him, but he would not come - I called Goodhall to give me a light, and I held it to Dade, and said, "Is that you?" I took him into the counting-house - he said "It is my first offence;" I said, "You have been found guilty before, but forgiven;" I sent Goodhall for an officer - he was gone some time, and in the mean time the officer came; they were taken to the watch-house - I was present when they were searched; this new sucker was found on Dade, which I believe to be my mother's - and here are seven wall-books, which I cannot swear to - but we had articles of this description; here is half of a sucker, which was found on Goodhall; this solder was found on Dade, under his coat, when I went into the cellar - it is of the same description as that they handed out of the cellar - these four pieces were secreted away, and found the following morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you know of their being in the cellar? A. Not till I came down; it was necessary to clean the cellar - they went down to get coals and coke up; I found these two bars of solder on Dade - they fit our mould exactly - we make them ourselves; others may have moulds of the same shape; Hedley had the making of the suckers - it should have been hanging up - he ought to have shown it to me, but he had not; it fits the mould on which he was working.</p>
               <p>Prisoner DADE. Q. Will you say the solder was secreted? A. It was carried across his arm.</p>

            . These two men were in our employ - I was in the counting-house when they came up - the witness brought Dade in to me, and said,"I have found out the thieves;" I began to remonstrate with him; he at first said he was going to bring it up stairs, and then he said, he hoped I would forgive him - he said he would make me any amends - I found these other pieces of solder hid upon some old wood where we deposit Coke.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by hid? A. They were in a place where they had no business to be - there was nothing on them; I stood on tip too - the candle glanced on them; Dade said he was going to bring up the solder - Goodhall was not present; it is the custom to keep a certain quantity in the counting house; Dads did not say he had been told to bring that up to the counting-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060119"/>house - what he said was, that he was going to bring it up stairs.</p>
               <p>COURT to JOHN DUNN. You mentioned that these men were gone into the cellar to fetch coals and coke - but is that usual? A. No; the labourers should do it, but they will do as they like - they do fetch them sometimes; they had the coal basket in their hands.</p>

            . I am a constable. I searched the two prisoners at the watch-house; I found on Dade seven wall-hooks and the sucker - and on Goodhall, a little bit of clack.</p>
               <p>DADE's Defence. I had no intention of stealing the solder; I had it given me by Goodhall - and I was bringing it up when Mr. Dunn stopped me.</p>
               <p>GOODHALL'S Defence. This solder I was ordered to get up: I returned the keys, and in the course of the evening Mr. Dunn told us to go and get coals and coke up; when I had delivered the keys to Mr. Dunn, he came running down, and went up to Dade, and said, "What have you got?" he said, "Two bars of metal to take up stais;" he called to me to get the candle, which I did - and when I came up he told me to go and get a constable, which I did.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Saturday evening, the 4th of March, about twenty minutes past eight o'clock, I was in Whitecross-street, and saw the prisoner coming down, with two bundles, one under each arm; this was about half a mile from Cox's-court - I called an officer, named Bradford, and we stopped him, and asked what he had got - he said he had just come from his mother's, in Hare-court, and he met a man, who sad he would give him a shilling to carry these two bundles; I asked where he was - he said at the Merry Carpenters public-house, in Old-street. I told him I would give him every chance to find the man, and went to the house with him, but he was not to be found. I then locked him up, and in consequence of taking another man afterwards, with some kid skins, who told me I might find some more skins in a house in Gloucester-court, Whitecross-street, I went there about ten o'clock that night, and found some more property belonging to the prosecutrix. The whole are not more than one person could carry.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had not he a right to take the woman into custody where the property was found? A. Witness. There was a woman frying some fish there, and I saw a trunk open - I looked at the things in it, and saw some wet mud on them, which excited my suspicion. I took them, but I did not know they were stolen - they are a part of this property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The reason he did not is, because Harris, her brother-in-law, is an officer, who was with him. Witness. Yes - I called him to go with me.</p>

I lost a piece of beef from a book in my shop; I had seen it about ten minutes before it was taken; I saw it with a carcass of lamb which the prisoner had purchased in the morning - he paid 2s. on it; he came in the afternoon to pay the remaing 17s. 6d.; I told my man to have an eye on him - he told me he had taken a shin of beef; I ran out and saw the prisoner with the carcass of lamb, and a cloth wrapped over it - the beef was in the carcass.</p>

The prisoner used my house in January last - one day in that month I wrote a letter at the table, by the fire, and the prisoner was in a box at a short distance from me. I took out my watch, and put it on the table, while I used my seal - I turned round to send my servant with the letter, and in that time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060121"/>the prisoner had gone out, and I immediately missed my watch, with the seal attached to it.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Had not there been some degree of intimacy between you? A. Nothing further than his being a customer. I saw he had plenty of money, and I once asked him to lend me a 5l. note - he showed me an acceptance for 50l., and asked if I could make use of that - I kept it an hour, and then returned it; I never talked about money on any other occasion - he owed me money for eating and drinking at my house; I knew his address, and wrote him two letters, which he answered - the Lord Mayor has them. The letters found him in Bride-lane, Fleet-street; I called there twice, and could not see him; I had not given orders for his apprehension - he was taken in about two months - if I had given instructions for his being taken before there can be no doubt he would have been taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was it before he took the watch that you had talked about the 5l.? A. It might be about a fortnight. I did not see him take the watch, and he did not ask my leave - he never denied having taken it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you give me the snuff-box? A. Yes; I think I did, and you gave it to the waiter, and she returned it; I did not fall asleep in the interim - I got a little drowsy - I was not asleep when you left the room; I saw you go - I made no remark to the waiter about your leaving the room; I waited some time expecting you to return; I never said to the waiter, it would be all right if you had got it; she did not tell me you had it; I went two or three days afterwards to know if you had returned the box, and the answer was you had not called.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did not you put your box into the prisoner's hands? A. Yes; he took it for the purpose of handing it to the waiter, and she went out; I did not afterwards express myself satisfied that it had not been stolen; I had seen him five or six times before, but I did not see him again till Saturday last - I was very angry about it.</p>

I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner there; I was called, and the snuff-box was given me to get some snuff; I did not like to go, as it was wet, and I gave it to our young man to go; when I came back, the prisoner took the box, as I supposed, to pass it to Mr. Lake; the prisoner came a day or two afterwards, and I asked him if he took the box, he said he did; I said, it was not a gentlemanly sort of action; he said I might make myself comfortable, as he would return it; he staid at the house about three hours, and had something to drink to the amount of 3s.; but he went away and did not pay - the money belonged to me.</p>
