"—he let go of me, and I ran into the middle of the field—he ran after me, and again took me by the collar of the coat—he then said, "Let me feel in your pockets?"—it was raining at the time, and I told him if he would come under the tree, I would give him all I had got, as I was fright<lb/>ened—(it was thundering and lightning at the time)—I told him that in consequence of fear—then he dragged me by the collar of my coat under the tree, and when we were under the tree, I gave him three fourpenny-pieces—I put my hands into my pockets—he then said, "Let me feel in your pockets, you have more?"—he did not feel—I put my hand into my pockets, and gave him two more fourpenny-pieces, but before that I asked him, if I gave him two more would he let me go away—he said be would, on his God—then I gave him</p>

I knew the deceased, Hannah Brown, for five years last February—shortly before Christmas I heard she was going to be married—about a day before Christmas, I was, called down from my workshop into the sitting room, and saw Mrs. Brown there, and the male prisoner—he was introduced to me by Mrs. Brown as her beau, as her intend<lb/>ed husband—she was about forty-seven years of age—I think they staid there together about three quarters of an hour at that time—she did not introduce him by any name at that time—the prisoner and I went to the Hand and Shears public-house together, and drank—no conversation passed that evening about his intentions—he had a deal to say about America, and said he bad a large farm there of 1000 acres of land, at Hudson's Bay—he said he had been away from there about four months, and that he was going back three weeks after Christmas—after this we went back to my house, and had supper together, and they left about ten o'clock—on Thurs<lb/>day, the 22nd of December, Greenacre came again to my house, I believe it was between six and seven, o'clock, with Mrs. Brown—they took something at my house, and after that, I and the prisoner went to the Queen's Head and French Horn—he was in conversation about America, the grand place it was, and the rail-loads there, and his farm, which bo described as a beautiful place—after having a pint of ale, he said he was in a hurry to go home to my house, we went back there together, and supped together at nine o'clock—after supper he sat at the right of Mrs. Brown, and Mrs. Brown on his left, on the sofa—I sat opposite to him, and my wife opposite to her—he said, "Well, we may as well tell you our intentions, (as we are not children,) before you, and we intend to get married on Sunday morning at St. Giles's church, and it is agreed that you shall be the man to give her away, and your eldest daughter to be the brides<lb/>maid, and you being kind enough to offer us dinner on that occasion, we shall accept of it"—I had offered to do so—we then began to talk about meeting on Sunday morning, and it was agreed that we. should meet at the Angel public-house, near the church, at ten o'clock—they went away toast a quarter past ten o'clock, and I walked about a hundred yards with them—from that time I never saw Hannah Brown again alive—on good Friday I saw a head at the Paddington Workhouse-the forehead, I observed, was flat, and the eyebrows straight, not so much in a circle as persons generally are—the eye was grey, and the two upper teeth were precisely like Mrs. Brown's—I did not observe any thing peculiar about the ear, for I had never seen her ear when alive.</p>

I knew the deceased, Hannah Brown, quite well, for about seventeen or eighteen years—I should think she could not have had any children—I made observation of such facts which made me think so—she was a tall woman, with a very delicate skin, and very high chested, much more titan most women—and she had a large hand, and long fingers—the ear-ring had been torn out of her left ear by her fellow-servant many years ago, and that had left a slit in her ear—the part next the face hung a little lower than the hind part—the fond was closed up, but still that part hung long—there was a hole bored above its second time—I was not present at any conversation that my husband had with the prisoner in the presence of his mistress—I remember hearing the reports about the body and head being found—my husband made inquiry, and he came and told me, and I went myself to the Pad<lb/>dington workhouse, on the 24th of March—I saw the head, which was preserved there, and I thought by the time I saw it, which was a very small time, that I could draw the visage of her down the nose, and the features about there—from the very short time I had to look at her, it ap<lb/>peared at though I could draw it was the from each side of the nose—she had a very flat nose—her hair was light, and intermixed with grey, like the hair of the head I saw—I noticed the left ear, and it was as my sister-in-law's was.</p>

               <p>Brown—I should be sorry to swear to it—I should think I might do it, from the view I took of her—it was greatly changed, but it appeared at if I could draw the resemblance—her nose was very much flattened, and it was then still more flattened—one of the eyes, I believe, was knocked out—the lower jaw was very much fractured indeed—she had a very nice set of teeth when alive, and it appeared to me as if she had but very few in fat of her mouth—but with all those differences of appearances, I still thought I could draw a likeness—she certainly had teeth out then, and I do not suppose she had a tooth out when I saw her last time—the teeth were very much like hers—she was a tall woman, much taller than I am, and her skin was delicate—I should not say she was a very weak woman—she earned her bread by very hard labour—a mangle requires power—she con<lb/>tinued her daily occupation up to the last time I heard any thing of her, to my knowledge—she was a woman of much more power than I am—a somewhat unusually strong woman, much more than I am; but I should reckon there were many women as strong as her—I cannot tell what strength she had, by her look—her work was very hard—it requires more strength than I have to turn a mangle.</p>

I have prepared copies of plans of the premises in questions; for the purpose of doing so I went to Carpenter-place Windmill-lane, Camberwell—I believe this is a faithful copy of the plan I hold in my hand—I believe these plan faithfully represent the situation of the houses on that side Carpenter's-place on which No. 6 is situated—they are fronted on each aide of the way by strips of gardens—the upper line here denotes she opposite side, Nos. 11 to 17—the red mark denotes the house No. 6—the front door of No. 6 opens from the garden into the room—there is no passage—the distance from the door of the front room to the garden gate is thirty six feet three; the front room is ten feet eight by ten feet nine—I would beg leave to explain, there is a recess underneath the cupboard by the fire on the side, which I have not taken into the measure, that would make it twelve feet four—it is a glass cupboard, but it does not decend to the floor—there is an opening underneath—the cupboard descends to about three feet from, the floor—the depth of the recces is one foot six—the distance from the fire-place to the back of the room opposite the window is exactly four feet; that is the distance from the fire-place to the division of the back room—there is a passage between the houses, on the side, and on the other at the end of the gardens—it varies in size and width—I think the average is about three feet seven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a table to be opposite the fire-place, and a chair on one side of the table where the front door is, and another at the side of the door leading to the back room, would it be possible from the size of the room to overturn a person in a chair on the floor of the room, or would they necessarily come against the wall of the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on the obliquity of the situation in which they sit.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you take this plan yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I did not go into either of the adjoining houses—I cannot say whether they are the same size, but apparently they are—there is a door</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030031"/>
               <p>opening from the front room into the back room—it descends a step into the back room, and lower than the front—the back room is seven feet eight by eight feet a person sitting on the right-head side of the fire-place would have their back towards that room door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A person sitting on the right of the fire-place in a chair facing the front window, if by accident a fall should occur and the back door should be open, would they fall headlong down that step? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on how they fall—it is possible—I cannot say that it is probable a person on the right-hand of the fire-placewould have their back towards the door of the back room if they sat in an oblique diretion—if she sat facing the fire-place, as a person generally does, she would have her chair at sight angles—the fire-place is three feet seven from the partition. which divides the two rooms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far is the side of the door of the back room from the wall where the fire-place is? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four feet—the fire-place projects a very trifle into the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you do not understand the question? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can give you the exact measurement, (<hi rend="italic">looking at a memorandum,</hi>) though the plan may not be in proportion; the length is three feet seven—the back room of No. 6 encroaches a little on the next house, No. 7—a considerable proportion of that room is within the area of what should be No. 7—I think the partition of the front room dividing No. 6 front No. 7 is four and a half inches thick—the back room from the door to the corner is five feet three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It appears to me quite impossible that that part of the partition of the back room which divides it from the front room could be any thing like three feet—the larger proportion you will perceive is in the adjoining house, No. 7? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 0ne foot four only is in the other house—I believe it is not more from the measure I have—the plan may be wrong from the suddenness in which it was done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is one foot four? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That portion of the room which you may call an encroachment on No. 7—the length of the remainder of the partition between the back and front roomis, I believe, three feet seven—the breadth of the door way is two feet four—the length from the left-hand side of the opening of the back door to the staircase it the front room is two feet six—the width of the opening to the staircase is two feet three—that is narrower by an inch than the opening in the back room—a person sitting on the right hand of the fire-place would have their back towards the back room door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it would be more probable than otheiwise that a chair falling back would throw the sitter with her head backwards through the door, and down a step? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say that—towards the opening they would, but I cannot say they would come through the door-it is possible a person falling there might fall down that opening—I should apprehend the door was very old, and it was thin—it has a very imperfect bad latch to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, whether the door was shut or open, was it not such a door, if so fastened, as that any body, say a stout woman, falling backwards in a chair against it would burst it open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—the door open into the front room, and it shuts against the frame, hence there would be greater difficulty—I believe it opens into the front room—if it was open, if is possible a person might fall through it—any great noise in that house, I should think, must be heard in either or both the next house—a conversation such as we are now holding might be heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, in your judgment, a fall with great violence</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030032"/>
               <p>from one room through the door into the other, must have been heard by the next door neighbours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think it would—I should think the force of the fall would have carried away the door casing, against which the door shut, in order to fall into the back room, as the door opens in wards—that must have carried the door casing away, and I should think that could not be done without being heard next door—if the body fell against the door, I should think it must carry the casing away for a person to fall into the back room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing you had been standing in the passage, and the door open, could you have seen a person in the garden very distinctly at night time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could have seen them—I cannot say whether I could recognise them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does not the door open, not only inwards into the front room, but next to the fire-place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the hinges are next to the fire-place—I cannot say that I noticed any appearance of the door, or panel, or casing being broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does not the door, if it opens inwards, open against the partition, and not against the fire-place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It opens towards the fire-place—only the partition divides the two rooms—I never saw the door so exactly open as to say it would fall against the partition, but I should think it would—I believe the back room floor is not stone—I rather think it is wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We understand you to make the width of the back room seven feet eight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on one side—the distance from the left-hand side to the partition of the front room to be one foot four, and from that to where the hinges of the door are, three feet seven, and the doorway itself two feet four—that makes seven feet three—then there is the side of the door not taken in, and that would be about three inches on each side—it is a very old house, and there is a difference in the size of almost every portion of the room—there is a copper in the corner of the back kitechen—the privy is in the front of the house at present—it was formerly it the back—it was in the front when I looked at it, in the shed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. DILLON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> It was in January I took the house, No. 6—I know the door leading from the back room to the front—it opens inwards, towards the fire-place of the front room—when the door is opens, you cannot place a chair in the situation it ought to stand—if I was going to sit by the side of the fire-place, I could not, if the door was open, place it in a proper situation—a table stands in front of the fire, and the door opens within about a foot of meeting the table—I am not very stout, but I must move the table or chair to pass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the door was shut, in order to fall from the front room down the step into the back room, must you not carry away the casing of the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when I sit in a chair to sit down and rock my child, without falling, I can save myself by the wainscot—when I sit by the fire, and the door is shut, I can rock my child to sleep, with the back of the chair striking against the partition between the two rooms—I fall with my head against it—the back room door has no appearance of being broken at all, nor the casing of the door—I never observed it—the floor of the back room is wood—the step is a very little one, about seven inches deep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will not the back room door open against the wall, flat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, quite flat, by moving it—I cannot say it will come quite close—I have always been in the habit of moving it to pass into the kitchen—I believe it will go quite back, flush with the wall—what I call the most</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If two persons choose to sit, not on each side of the fire, but in front of it, of course there will be a considerable degree of space behind then, if they have no table in front of the fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There will—there would not be room for a woman to fall back prostrate on the floor, unless she sat quite in front of the fire—if she did, she might fall back on the floor—I should not think there is room between the side of the fire and the wall to fall back prostrate, for as I sit I can rock my child, and fall back against the partition—I sit in a nursing chair, and it is lower than any other chair in the room—it has a high back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the door was open, would it be possible for a person twinging herself back in a chair to fall into the back kitchen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I should think not—I do not consider she could fall into any place but the front room, if she was sitting by the fire—if she sat in any place, she ought to sit by the fire, aud she would not fall back into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there no place where a person sitting in that room might not, by possibility, fell with part of their person into the back room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Cer<lb/>tainly if she tat near the door of the back room, she might.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you speak of sitting in front of the fire, do you contemplate a table being opposite the fire, between the two chairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—if the table was in front of the fire, and the person, sitting so as to be comfortable, they could not be thrown into the back room—if she was sitting as she ought to sit, with the table in front of the fire, she might, but not if the table was moved from the firt—it if fold and uncom<lb/>fortable to sit with the back to the door, if it is open I cannot sit with the door open even now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then sitting in a chair on either side of the fire-place the table filing its ordinary situation in the room, is it at all probable, a chair being thrown over, she would fall into the back room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think she might if the table was where it is now in the room, and the back door open; the might be thrown into it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Bolingbroke-row, Wilworth. I produce some articles which were pledged at my shop on the 17th of January—I took them in myself, of a female—I have seen the female prisoner before, and have every reason to believe her to be the person I took them in of—I believe her to be the person—she gave me the name of "Mary Stevens, 9, East-lane, Walworth"—I believe I have seen her before, but I have no recollection of her having been a customer—I produce a pair of shoes, two veils, and a handkerchief—they were wrapped up in an old silk handkerchief—I have got that handkerchief—I examined it after the inspector called to see it—in folding it up I perceived several stains of what I think to be blood on it—these holes in it appear to me to burnt—they are where the stains are which I conceive to be blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the T division of police. On Saturday 25th of March I received a warrant for the apprehension of Green<lb/>acre, and proceeded with it to the neighbourhood of Kennington—I went to Carpenter's-place to make inquiry, and on the Sunday I went with the war<lb/>rant to No. 1, St. Alban<lb/>street—I got there about half past ten or a quarter to eleven o'clock at night—the door was opened by the landlord of the house—in consequence of what he told me, I went to the parlour door, which just inside the street door—I knocked at the door, and called "Greenacre"—a voice from within said, "Yes, what do you want?"—it turned out to be Greenacre—I said, "I want to speak with you, open the door"—he said, "Wait a bit while I get the tinder-box and get a light"—I did not wait—I heard him moving in the room, as if he had just got out of bed—I lifted the latch of the door, and, it not being fastened, I went in—the root was dark—I found him standing in the room—the door fell back to<lb/>wards his elbows—he was standing in his shirt in the room—I laid hold of him by the arm, and he said, "What do you want?"—I said, "I have a warrant to take you into custody for the wilful murder of Hannah Brown"—by this time a light was brought from down stairs by the laid-lord—when the light was brought, I read the warrant to him, or partly so—I then said, "Do you know a person of the name of Brown?"—I said, "Do you know Hannah Brown"—he said, "No, I know no Hannah Brown"—I said, "Were you never asked in church to a person of that name?"—he said, "Yes, I was"—he was then putting on his stockings—I said, "Where is she now?"—he said, "I don't know, and you have no right to ask me those questions"—I said, "I don't mean to ask you any more questions, and I caution you what you say to me, for, whatever you do say to me I shall be obliged to repeat elsewhere"—I then searched his trowsers, which laid on a box by the side of the bed—I had not noticed Gale at that moment—just about the time I took the trowsers off the box, I saw the woman Gale in bed in the room, while I was in the act of taking out of his pockets whatever might be in them—I said, "What woman if thay? "—he said, "Why, that is a woman that comes to sleep with me"—I said, "She must get up alto, and dress and go with me"—as I was speaking thus, I saw, or rather heard, the rattling of something in her hand like a watch and I said, "What is that you have in your hand? let me see it," and she handed me this watch—I put my hand towards the bed, and she handed me the watch—in so doing, I saw that she had two rings on her finger, and I took them off at the same time—she then got out of bed and dressed herself—I then turned my attention to Greenacre's trowsers pocket, from which I took this pinchbeck watch in a leather bag—he had this purse with one sovereign in it and a cornelian stone, and there was a half-crown loose in his pocket—the cornelian stone bears a crest and the initials J. G., as it appears to me—I also found this bunch of keys, eight in number, a spectacle-case, and a pencil-case—Gale got up and dressed herself—she had put on her pocket, and I said, "Stop, what have you got in your pocket. I took from her pocket these two duplicates, these two ear-drops, which are cornelian set in gold, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, and these keys—one duplicate is dated 17th January, 1837, for two veils, a handkerchief, and a pair of shoes, pawned at Mr. Knowles's, 19, Boling broke-row, Walworth</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030043"/>
               <p>in the name of Mary Stevens—the other duplicate is for a pair of shoes pawned on the 9th of April, 1830, for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I found a third duplicate in this pocket-book, which I took from Greenacre's coat<lb/>pocket—it is for two silk gowns pawned on the 6th of February, 1837 for 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., At Franklin's, late Harrison, Tottenham-court-road, in the name of William Green—after they both had dressed, I sent for a coach, and as they were both coming away the female prisoner said, "Oh, there is my child in the next room"—I said, "Child?"—"Yes, said she, "I cannot go without my child," and the male prisoner requested to have a great coat out of a box which was corded—I at first refused to open the box for it—he seemed anxious for it, and I uncorded it, and gave him the coat—I did not bring the boxes away then—a coach came, and we got into the coach together—I locked the rooms, and took the keys with me, and drove to Paddington station-house—before we left the lodging, after he was dressed, and had put on his great coat, and while the child was being dressed, he said it was lucky I had come when I had, for he should have been on the quay to morrow, for he was going off to-morrow morning, at nine o'clock—he did not say where he was going—I went to the lodg<lb/>ing again at six o'clock next morning, having kept the key the whole time—I started from Paddington at six o'clock that morning, and went to the lodging—I unlocked the boxes which I found in the room—four of them were locked and corded—one which stood by the side of the bed was not locked nor corded—the bed was on the floor, not on a bedstead—I unlocked the several boxes, and took out such articles as I thought probably belonged to the deceased, and among them was this boa, and this silk cloak—they were both wrapped together in a bundle—this shawl and this white dress I also found, and this saw I found in one of the corded boxes—there were many other things, but I only took what I thought material—I did not find any thing else then—I could not stop longer—I went again on the Tuesday, the day following, in company with the friends of the deceased; her own brother, Mrs. Davis, her sister-in-law, and three or four persons, witnesses, who have been here—I then unlocked the boxes, and found some articles—this handkerchief was in one of the boxes, and this collar laid on a recess, with some glasses, by the side of the fire-place, and this handkerchief I found in one of the boxes—it appears to have a stain of blood on it—it is a handkerchief which females wear on the neck; and this small crape shawl I also found, which was identified—in the back room, (which the male prisoner said was the female's room, on the night of their appre<lb/>hension,) I found in a box this box of cards, and another box with some bits of ribbon and trivial things in it—I also found a trunk in the same room—it is a wooden trunk covered with paper—there are some pieces of huckaback in it—I should say some of the things are new, and some have been used—on the Tuesday, in the box which stood by the side of the bed, I found this pistol, in a till at the end of the box, (the box was not locked,) and the ball was in it—it has a percussion lock—I also found this French knife in the same box, and across the box laid this stick—it was too long to lay along, and it laid corner ways—it is a sword-stick—found some bullets which had been very recently made, and were made very roughly—that was all I found—I brought nothing else away at that time—I have fetched the whole of the property away since that, and it has been lodged in the station-house—the things I found were produced to the friends of the deceased at the next examination, and they pronounced their</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, after having been to St. Alban's-place, did you go back again to Camberwell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I searched the house, in the absence of the pri<lb/>soners, at Carpenter's-place—I had been to Carpenter's-place before, but not to enter the house before—I did not get information that the man had gone to St. Alban's-place, from any body at the house—one of these watches has been identified as the property of the deceased—that is the pinchbeck—I am not aware of the value of that—it is a common, rather old<lb/>fashioned watch—the pistol I have produced has no powder in it now—I had—I cannot tell what quantity there was in it when I found it, for I took off the cap and put it into my pocket—when I first examined it I perceived there was powder in it—that was when I got to the station I discovered a small quantity in it then—I should say one third of a charge—it is a percussion lock—I did not examine my pocket to see if there was any powder there—there was not a full charge in the pistol certainly, when I examined it</p>

               <p>The prisoner Gale, says, "I have nothing to say—I know nothing about it—I was not at Camberwell at that time—those two rings that was taken from me, one of them I gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for in the City, twelve months ago, and the other, my little boy, who was digging in the garden, found, with a half sovereign, two half-crowns, and a five-shilling piece, and six<lb/>pennyworth of halfpence—the ear-drops have been my own for this seven or eight yean—in regard to the shoes, Mrs. Andrews gave me the ticket, and the other ticket I found in the street near our own house—Mr. Greenacre told me I must leave hit house a fortnight before Christmas, but I could not suit myself with lodgings till the Wednesday or Thurs<lb/>day following—I returned back on Monday-week following the Thursday—he said the correspondence was broken off between him and Mrs. Brown, and he wished me to come back again—That is all I have to say."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the eye totally displaced, or did it remain void of its humours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It remained void of its humours—there were several lacerations on the face—one a sort of crescent-like laceration on the cheek, and a contort wound on the lower jaw—the crescent-like wound, I conceive, was pro duced by incision—the one on the lower jaw, by being jammed—both the lower jaws were fractured—my opinion is, all the wounds I have de<lb/>scribed, except on the eye, were inflicted after death—on the top of the head there was a bruise also, which had occurred after death—I did not observe any other wound on the head at the time I am speaking of which was at our workhouse, on the 7th of January—I examined the neck at the dead-house, and found the body of the fifth <hi rend="italic">cervical vertebra</hi> had been sawn through and disarticulated at the transverse processes—that is it had been disjointed about five of the bones of the neck down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would such a saw as the one produced, effect the severance of the head in the manner you have described? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it would—I have seen this saw since applied to the two bones, and it fits exactly—I kept the head in our dead-house until night, and had the key of it my self—I then went over with the policeman, and it was removed to my house, which is opposite the workhouse—I then packed it in a small hamper myself, tied it up, and put my own seal upon it, and gave it to two policemen, a sergeant of the K division and a common policeman—it was taken from my house that night to Paddington workhouse—I saw it again there about half-past ten o'clock next morning—the hamper was then as I had left it, with my seal untouched—I then examined the bead more carefully, in company with Mr. Gird wood—I was present when be ex amined it, and appearances were then made obvious which were not appa rent before—the right ear had a notch in it—I think it was the right ear—the head is here—we examined the wounds which I have described, and, came to the conclusion that the wounds I have said were inflicted after death were so, and that the other, the eye, was inflicted before death—we then proceeded to open the head—there was a wound on the back part of the head—I could perceive that, on opening it—there was no bruise on the outside—it was an effusion of blood—there was no bruise on the outside but an internal wound, which I could only discover by opening the head—it was between the integuments and the skull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you able to judge whether that wound had been inflicted before or after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think, from its appearance, it had been inflicted before death—I cannot say whether it had any necessary union or concurrence with the blow in the eye; but I should think if a blow was struck in the eye, and the back part of the head came in contact with any thing, it would produce it—I applied the head to the body that was at the workhouse, and the one fitted the other exactly—it appeared tome that he throat had been cut—the head was perfectly bloodless—all the blood</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of the parish of Paddington—I am not a member of the College of Surgeons—I passed my examination at Edinburgh—I have been practising as a surgeon twelve years—I examined the head of a female at Paddington workhouse, on Sunday the 8th of January—Mr. Birtwistle was present at the time, alio Mr. Lucas, and some other medical men—there are three published doc* ments, which I drew up at the time—they are copies of my original notes—I have not the original notes with me—they have all been published—the first was made at the inquest—that was before I examined the bed—it had reference to the trunk only—I published an account of the appearances of the head on the very day it was examined, on Monday, the 9th of January; a note of it was given to the churchwardens and to the newspapers—i saw it afterwards in the newspapers—I saw the head on Sunday, the 8th of January, at Mile-end workhouse, and examined it very cursorily—on the 9th, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I went into a more detailed examination—the bead was brought to the work-house during the night—upon examining it on the 9th, the head had the appearance of being that of a female—the nose was slightly flattened about the centre, and it had a slight twist of the tip to the right side—there were several wounds and bruises—there was a large wound on the left cheek, in the shape of a crescent, commencing a short way under the left eye, and terminating on the same level as the mouth, and about a inch or an inch and a half from it—it was an incised wound—it was merely superficial—it entered into the <hi rend="italic">cellular membrane</hi> and the fat underneath-in my judgment that wound was inflicted after death—there was under that wound, a large contused wound over the lower jaw—the jaw was there fractured—that injury, in my judgment, was inflicted after death-on the other side of the face there was another contused wound, at the right angle of the lower jaw; there, too, the bone on that side was broken—on that side, too, there was a wound, partly contused and partly in-incised, and which opened right through into the mouth—(those two lit ter injuries were sustained after death)—it opened right through into the mouth, and by that means made the mouth larger, continuing the moots along the cheek; several of the teeth of the upper jaw were forced out and the tongue was crushed between them—that appeared to me all part of the same injury—the right eye had received a blow—there was a wound in the eye itself, above the pupil, which had entered into the eye, and occasioned the escape of the humours of the eye around the eye, above-below, and there was a mark, a round <hi rend="italic">ecchymosis</hi>, surrounding the eye; presenting the appearance not of an ordinary, but of an extraordinary black eye; as to its severity—it was of the same species—I might call it what would follow a black eye, but to a considerable extent—within the area of this bruised appearance there were three small superficial wounds; was external to the orbit of the eye, one was superior to the orbit of the eye, and the other was situated on the side of the nose, and exposed the bone of the nose.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030057"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, was the injury you have described to the eye, in<lb/>flicted during the life of the party, or after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe the wound in the eye, and the bruise around it, to have been inflicted during life, and I believe also the three small wounds I have alluded to, to have been inflicted after death—the circumstance of the eye being ruptured would imply great force—it might be the result of a blow with the fist of a person—I think it could not be referable to a blow with a dull weapon—there was no mark on the surface of abrasion—abrasion is more likely to follow a blow by a bludgeon than a blow by a hand—I mean abrasion of the skin—it is almost impossible to say whether it was inflicted with a fiat or instrument—I could not form any definite opinion—a blow struck with the violence I judge this to have been inflicted with, would certainly deprive the party so struck of sense for the moment, and at the moment, for a time—the length of time it would do so depends entirely on the individual—one person would bear a blow very differently to another—it depends on the effect produced on the nervous system, on the vital energies of life—this being a female subject, it is very possible the blow would deprive her of senses, so as to enable further injury to be given to her during that period of insensibility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing, on the blow being struck in front, the back of the head was to be driven in contact with any thing, would that tend to increase the period for which insensibility would follow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it very likely—there were two appearances behind, which I have not yet described, on the crows of the head—it was a large contused wound—that is all—it was two wounds together—there were two bruised surfaces coming into one another continuous—they had been done'after death—it was a semilunar wound, having two tail, as I may say—on turning back the scalp, which we cat through from ear to ear, by cutting a little and exposing the upper part of the skull, on the pos—I tenor surface on the left side in the <hi rend="italic">cellular</hi> membrane, underneath the skin, and in those muscular fibres called the <hi rend="italic">occipilo-frontalis</hi> muscle, existed an <hi rend="italic">ecchymose</hi> appearance—I opened the head, and found an internal in<lb/>jury corresponding with the outside—on the outer covering of the brain, called the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, there existed a slight redness, an unnatural redness, not visible any where else—that was opposite to the place where the <hi rend="italic">ecchymosis</hi> appeared—that was so far a serious injury that serous effusion on the dura mater indicated a disturbance within.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, was there, in your judgment, any connexion between the injury in the eye and that at the back of the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not but think that the one was the result of the other—that the appearances behind were the result of the injury in front—that is on the supposition that the head, when struck in front, came in contact with some resisting body—there was this relation between the two injuries, that it was on the opposite side of a round body, and a round body struck on one side, if opposed by striking against something, will show that something has struck there—the external appearance of the skull would not be caused by the blow in front, sup posing it did not strike against any thing at all—the internal derangement which was presented, might have been the result of a blow in front, sup<lb/>posing the back of the head did not come in contact with any thing—by the derangement, I mean the slight redness on the dura mater, as well as the disturbance which that intimated—the appearance in the eye could not possibly be caused by a blow struck at the back of the head—whether that injury was by a "blow, a fall, or any other means, it could not have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030058"/>
               <p>caused the appearances in front—I afterwards proceeded to examine the throat—the head had been separated from the trunk at the fifth bone of the neck, which was sawn through—not entirely, but partly—I have fitted the saw produced, to the bone, and it appeared to me to correspond—the greater part of the anterior portion of the bone was sawn through, and the other part of it appeared to have been broken off—the posterior part—it was sawn nearly through from the front, and then broken off—there was no appearance of discolouration of the neck—the fleshy part of the neck appeared to have been cut with a sharp instrument—such an instrument as this (<hi rend="italic">looking at the knife</hi>) would be adapted to the purpose—it is something in the form of a surgical knife—it has a spring at the back which makes the blade firm—the muscles where they were divided were very much retracted—the muscles do retract for some time after death—as long as warmth continues, or until the rigidity of death begins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person to meet a violent death suddenly, being in good health at the time, how long would that state of the muscles which would cause them to retract, continue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot speak from experience, but I should say it would continue some time of course—in all states after death, this retraction of the muscles will continue some time—certainly some hours—but the retracting power, which is often very strong at the moment of death, gets less and less every hour, and at last ceases—it would be less, too, if much blood was lost at the moment of death—the retracting power would continue for a shorter time, inasmuch as the body would sooner get cold and rigid—I found all the large blood-vessels of the head empty, and the same as to the trunk—there were other wounds about the neck, independent of that which severed it from the body, but they were all part of the same attempt in cutting the neck—the superficial cut was very ragged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We have not yet got to that—independent of the cutting of the neck, did you find some superficial cutting about the neck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the to<lb/>mination of the wounds which were carried round and round the neck—the neck was evidently cut in front at first—the first incision commencing on the left side, in the fold which exists where the bead joins the neck, high up, exactly here (<hi rend="italic">putting his finger uider hit ear</hi>)—it passes along the fold in front of the neck, behind this ear, and terminates on the right side—that cut was not continuous round the neck—the continuation of the cut appears to have been jagged on the right side—the division of the muscles becoming now deeper and deeper, and at the same time lower down the neck, so that the incision which has cut through the windpipe, is full two inches under the first superficial incision which I have already described—this cut through the windpipe has cut also through the carotid arteries, and it is on a level with the division of the vertebra—there is a superficial cut high up in front, not penetrating the windpipe; and two inches below that, there is the main cut, which sepa<lb/>rated the head from the body—there is thus left a flap of skin in front adhering to the trunk—that would have supplied the space between the two cuts, and then the posterior cut of the skin coming round on the right side leaves a flap, about two inches long, adhering to the neck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do these circumstances denote that there was an attempt to cut the throat, and inflict a slight injury, in addition to the main cut which divided the head from the body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot form any opinion positively on that point.</p>
               <p>

               <p>an unskilful man had attempted to separate the head after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The suggestion I formed, having seen a wound in the eye which might or might not prove mortal, was, that the cut in the throat certainly must have proved mortal—the cut above was certainly the first cut; and the cut must have been inflicted during life, or very shortly after death.</p>

               <p>have in the dead body—the <hi rend="italic">ecchymosis</hi> of a bruise or contusion consists in having blood effused in all the tissues which have been interested in the blow—there is also the existence of blood throughout those membranes, in the minutest blood vessel (by membrane, I mean tissue) which in health do not contain this red blood—there is also the existence of swelling—there are some other phenomena, but these three are the important ones—there is at times a yellow colour round the external edge of the <hi rend="italic">ecchmosis</hi> what we call a black eye will sometimes not be apparent at first—then in a black eye which will not assume that appearance, until a considerable time after the blow—I never saw a black eye that did not immeadiately afterwards assume that appearance I mean the puffiness—the outer skin va ries a little in different persons—a blow on the chest of a person who has considerable flesh between the muscles and the cuticle, might not be ecchy<lb/>mosed—if the skin be thin, <hi rend="italic">ecchymosis</hi> may be almost instantaneous, but you are supposing cases which I have not seen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With respect to the neck, I think you have elsewhere described, that the section which removed the head proceeded across the neck ante<lb/>riorly through the skin, immediately under the fold formed by the junction of the chin with the neck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not immediately, but under it—I am the author of the report of the examination of the head of the female, in the medi<lb/>cal Gazette—I do not wish to correct that statement—there is no correction necssary—what I have said here is but a different mode of expressing the same thing—the posterior cut of the neck was exactly on a line with the section of the vertebral column.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long in your opinion will blood generally flow after immediate death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There have been experiments to show that blood will flow for many hours after death—I think blood will flow for several hours from a vessel divided after death—there is an experiment to prove what you wish—I think it is sixteen hours—I am not quite sure; I talk only from memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then during that time, the blood vessels of the head might be emp tied by severing the head from the trunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The large vessels—it might or might not—but that would depend on the death of the party, the ok time the blood coagulates, and a variety of circumstances—I have no experiment to prove in how long the head might be emptied by severance after death; I cannot speak from experience—I cannot say whether the wound which occasioned the division of the head from the trunk, was done in great haste—I really cannot judge of haste.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are quite of opinion that the fifth vertebra was sawn through? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am quite sure of that—I have them to show that fact—I divided the portion of the <hi rend="italic">cervical</hi> column, which was left on the head, the bones called the vertebral column, that is, the <hi rend="italic">cervical</hi> vertebra which is attached to the head, the four and three quarters which is attached to the head—the fifth was sawn through—I did not myself divide it—it was done by my orders, in my presence, and I think I assisted—we took it off at the atlas—I am not certain that that now forms one end of the portion of the column I have here—it may or may not—it may have been removed, but at the time it was severed, 1 think it did—I think the <hi rend="italic">dentatus processus is</hi> still attached to the column—I think that portion of the column was left perfect, but I have not examined it since—I have never taken the trouble to divide the column longitudinally nor transversely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you can give us no account of the state of the spinal marrow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No,</p>

               <p>not in that part of the column—we looked into the spinal marrow—I have the means of knowing if the spine was injured—I saw the marrow at the end of the column where it was sawn across—but I have not traced it through its course—it is now lodged in the column of the body—I do not know whether any thing has been done with it, and the bones that were removed—the <hi rend="italic">cervical</hi> spine has been sawn through—I have examined the bones externally, and had there been any injury inflicted by any external cause, it would have produced some injury in the bone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it possible for the spinal marrow to be injured without leaving appearances on the bone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When you talk of possibility, it is possi<lb/>ble, for instance, a needle might be introduced to the spinal marrow—there was no injury that I am aware of to the spinal marrow—it could not re<lb/>ceive any injury that I am aware of to occasion death—there was not the slightest injury in the parts—an accident creating pressure on the spinal chord would occasion death certainly—T should ascertain that fact by ex<lb/>mining the marrow, but I might not ascertain it by doing so—by ex<lb/>amining, I may perceive an injury, and I may not perceive it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A person might die from injury to the spinal marrow, and leave no trace behind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a locked jaw there is no appearance whatever—there would be an appearance of fixedness—there are no appearances, that I know of, in persons dying of hydrophobia—there might be this injury to the spinal marrow, or nervous system—I mean injury to one of the nerves of the thumb, which sometimes will occasion a locked jaw—a locked jaw is an injury to the nervous system—there might be pressure on the spinal chord, and death not ensue; but it might so happen that death may ensue from it—an injury of the spinal marrow might produce death, or it might not—an injury to the spinal marrow in one part might product instant death; but I do not think it could be produced without producing tome effusion round it, which would be of a bloody character, or of a serous character—I mean around the spinal marrow externally—if the spinal marrow was injured at its juncture with the brain, a small injury might occasion instant death; but if you examine that body after death, I think you will find perhaps a very small blood-vessel, or effusion of blood, or you might have the spinal marrow itself shortened or slackened—I exa mined the neck on Monday the 9th of January—I had seen it before, but I examined it anatomically on the 9th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said that the external appearance would be slight—is it possible that the immersion of the head, and its remaining in the water for eight or ten days, would have rendered the detection of that injury more difficult or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it would make any difference—you are alluding to the injury of the spinal marrow, taking place where I have named—I should think it would be necessary to examine the marrow itself, to be able to say positively that a person died of injury to the spinal marrow—a blow on the back of the neck might be capable of killing, but it depends entirely on what the blow is—any blow may be capable of killing which at all shakes the vital spark; not that shakes the spinal marrow—a blow on the stomach might cause instant death—I have said almost all blows of any great severity may be mortal—it all depends on whe ther they affect a vital part—I think it very possible that a blow disordering he spinal marrow, would occasion death, but I cannot imagine a blow being given in such a case without having external appearances—I cannot imagine a blow to have occasioned such an injury to the spinal marrow as to occasion death, which would not show it after death—I certainly have</p>

               <p>no right to infer things are not possible, because I have not met with them—I am talking generally from what I have observed and experienced—I cannot conceive violent muscular action of the neck, capable of causing death—I do not see where the injury could be effected by the muscular action of the neck—violent muscular action of the neck will not disorder the os <hi rend="italic">coccygis</hi>—I never knew the thigh broken by the action of the nuclei.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will suppose a case of a man balancing on a chair, and losing his equilibrium, might not the muscular operation of the neck in endeavouring to recover itself, inflict an injury on the neck of the person so as to cause death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot imagine such a case—I am not at all aware of any thing likely to produce such a circumstance—I cannot conceive a case of the sort—I know no case at all like what you describe—it might injure a fibre or ligament—the muscle confining the <hi rend="italic">dentatus processes</hi> is a very strong one—if that ligament was ruptured, it might occasion death—if it permitted the spinal marrow to be injured, in all probability it would occasion death—the <hi rend="italic">dentatus processus</hi> is not the next vessel to the spat, it is the axis on which the head turns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing what the learned gentleman has supposed to take place, would it leave any external appearance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the spinal marrow it would, but not on the surface of the skin—that injury had not happened—if it had, I should have detected it in examination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you do not think such an injury could occur, so as to affect or injure the spinal marrow, without leaving an appearance on the external part of the bone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—the termination of the spinal marrow was examined, where it joins the brain, and there was no appearance—I am now speaking of the <hi rend="italic">dentatus processus</hi>—I have been confining myself during the whole examination to that exact part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there not other parts of the spinal marrow from the atlas don to the seventh vertebra, the injury of which might occasion death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have said an injury to the spinal marrow may or may not produce instant death—it is not very likely it would produce instant death, if it was not at the place I have described—many cases are on record where injuries haw been inflicted in that place, where paralysis of the lower parts hare taken place, and where instant death has not followed, where in fact they ban recovered—I have already said I believe all sorts of accidents may be fatal—it depends on the state of the nervous system.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by all sorts of accidents? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Affecting vital parts—injury lower down than the part alluded to, may produce death, as it may so strike the nervous system as that death may immedi-ately follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Even though it should be with reference to that part which, with this particular spine, was still left on the trunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have said there was no injury to that—injury might happen to that portion of spine left on the trunk, it by no means follows that death would ensue; but it might take place by its effect on the general nervous system—pulsa<lb/>tion ceases instantaneously after death—it is one of the three great links that connect life together—death cannot be instantaneously detected—to consti<lb/>tute death there must be no pulsation; but that does not imply that you have discovered that death exists—if I was Called to a dead body, I should not like to decide on that person being dead until I had examined other things than simply pulsation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But may not an ordinary person detect death as soon as it has taken place, and that by detecting the cessation of pulsation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not;</p>

               <p>it would be no proof—I should not myself be satisfied by that symptom alone—I should not be satisfied that the body was dead after the pulsation appeared to have ceased two or three minutes, nor in a week after, by simply examining the pulse—I mean the pulse at the wrist—how I should ascertain pulsation ceasing, would be to apply my ear to the region of the newt—it would be there I should be able to detect the indication of the smallest pulsation—it could not be ascertained by applying the hand to the heart—is a medical man, I should advise no one to be satisfied by applying the hand to the heart—I do not think it right to determine that death has taken place, without applying the ear to the heart—I examined the trunk of the body on Thursday, the last week in December; I think the 29th; the day after it was found—I came to the conclusion that the parts had been cut away shortly after death, by the very great retraction of the muscles of the neck—the bloodless state of the body was one of the causes which led me to conclude that the mutilation had taken place shortly after death—by mutilation I mean the cutting of the neck and legs—I believe nobody mis—I understands the phrase—that would not be applicable to amputation—that applies to a living subject—amputation is a thing done for the advantage of man; mutilation has an adverse signification—but I did not use it with that motive—if a surgeon were said to have mutilated a member, it would found reproachfully to men of science—but it has several signiflcations—it depends on the way in which it is used.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would that appearance in the orbit of the eye be one of the conse quences of a violent blow in the eye, as you have spoken of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Cer<lb/>tainly—the spinal marrow is subject to disease, the same as all other parts of the human body—disease may arise spontaneously, or be occasioned by some powerful effect on the nervous system, as a whole—I vever knew, heard, or read of a case in which sudden death was produced by in-ternal injury to the lower part of the spinal marrow, without some ex-ternal marks accompanying it—on looking at the subject, on the whole there are two facts which immediately struck roe—in the first place, there was a very severe blow inflicted on the eye, during life; and that blow has a corresponding bruise on the back part of the head—there was on the dura mater a little serous fluid or blood existing—this group of facts is such as to lead me to say that such an injury might be mortal; but, certainly, if that had not been so, the cutting of the neck would have been neces-sarily mortal—I allude to the whole group of facts—from the external and internal examinations—I say, the blow in the eye, and the injury behind, the flowing of serous matter, these, together, form such, as would occasion death; but if not, the cutting of the neck would necessarily do it.</p>

I am a medical man, and h've in Sloane-squre, On Friday evening, the 24th of February, the male prisoner came to my house to engage me to attend his daughter Mary Ann, in her confinement, and said it might be that evening—on the following morning I was fetched at nine o'clock, and saw the three prisoners—the child was born lste on the Saturday night—there did not appear any linen, or any preparation for the child, and they made an excuse that she was confined earlier than was expected—in my judgment it was born in its natural time—I inquired who the father was—the grandmother told me he was away in the country, mi he was going to travel into Germany—she said she expected him that night or the next morning—I called again on Sunday, and asked if the father had arrived—the grandmother said he had been there and seen the infant, and he was gone out—I went there again next day, and the younger prisoner seemed to be doing well—she was crying very much, and seemed very much grieved about something—I noticed it, and the grandmother said she could not suckle the infant, and that a medical man in Ireland bid told her she must not, as she had a liver complaint—I said, it was all nonsense, she ought to suckle it—they then said the husband was going abroad, and she could not take it with her—on Wednesday, between three and four o'clock, I went again and saw all the defendants—I asked to see the infant—the grandmother told me it was gone to Wandsworth, to an old servant of theirs—I questioned them, and said I was going to Wandsworth, and if they would give me the name of the nurse and the place, I would call and see it—the grandmother said they did not know the name of tie person, nor the place, as it was a large place—I still pressed to see the child, and they promised it should be brought to my house in two days—I went again on Thursday, the 2nd of March, and repeated my desire an determination to see the child—the male prisoner was not at home then—the grandmother said repeatedly, in the presence of the daughter, that should be brought to me—I called again on Friday, and saw the mother</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brick-maker. On the 4th of March I was in the brick field, near the barn, and about five minutes before one o'clock, I saw Puzey come into the yard with the cart—a little boy was driving it—the cart passed by me—there was no hay in it—I must have seen if there had been any—I remember the day, for the wind blew very rough, and knocked the barn-door against Puzey, and nearly knocked him down.</p>

On the evening of the 7th of February, I was with Forster, at Lambeth-Thompson came up to us, and asked whether we could get a lodging for him—we could not, and we all three staid out of doors all night, together—next day we all three came to Westminster together—Thompson left us about half-past one o'clock, saying he was going to see his aunt, and be told us to stop outside—he came out of his aunt's house, and showed us a gold watch which he said he had picked up, wrapped in three or four pieces of paper—we then went to Catherine-street—Thompson gave the watch to Forster, who gave it to me, and I ran away with it when I got round into Dean-street—I afterwards looked for Forster, but could not find him—</p>

               <p>I went through Dean's yard, and just as I came by the tide of Westmin<lb/>ster-abbey, I taw Cairncross—I told him another boy had stolen a watch from a room, and I had run away from him with it, and I asked him if be could sell it—he told me he could, at the Blue Posts, in Monmouth-street—we went there—when we got to the door he told me to stop outside while he went in and sold it—he went into the back parlour—he came out, and said be could not get but 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he went back, and said he would take 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the landlady pay him, on the counter—he gave me some drink at first, and when he came out he gave me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said he should keep 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for selling the watch—we then went to the Feathers, in Broadway, Westminster, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and had drink there—I went home to my mother's that night, and next morning, when I got up, I had no money—I knew Cairncross before—I had frequently seen him at the Westminster theatre—I first knew him there about two or three months ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Crown-street, Soho, and am in the em<lb/>ploy of Mr. Charles Deacon. On the 6th of March, he had a sale at a private house in Manchester-square, and I was one of the men in charge of the things—in consequence of information, about half-past two o'clock, I went out to the corner of South-street, and saw the prisoner walking very fast—I overtook him, and touched him on the shoulder twice, and told him he was wanted back at the house he had just come out of—he went back with me readily—I asked him if he was particularly cold, and wanted a blanket to wrap himself up—he began to ask forgiveness—I asked him to unbutton his coat, and I found the blanket tied round his body with a piece of string—he said he could make it all right if he could see Mr. Deacon—I asked him where he got the blanket from—he said out of the second-floor back room.</p>

I was driving Williams's Reading coach on Thursday, the 2nd of March—I never saw this parcel—in the way-bill there is a paper parcel entered for Mr. Thwaites, of Reading—that parcel did not arrive—there was a man by the coach, but I do not know him—I drove the coach—at Egham a man asked the horsekeeper for a ride—I let him ride—he rode from there to Oakingham—he gave me nothing, nor the horsekeeper—he said he brought a horse to Reading for my employer—I did not speak to him—I do not know whether it was the prisoner—it might be—he sat on the hind part of the coach.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hayes. On the evening of the 4th of March, between seven and eight o'clock, I heard a ring at my gate—it was not long after I had lighted my candle—I had no watch—it was quite dusk—I opened the door, and went out to the garden door in front of my house, and asked who it was—it is a close gate, so. that I could not see who was outside—the answer was, "A parcel"—I" said, "Where from?"—the answer was, "From the Angel inn"—there is an inn of that name at Hayes—I said, "By what coach?"—the answer was, "I don't know"—I said, "What, carry a parcel from the Angel, and</p>

               <p>not know the name of the coach?"—they at last gave me the name of Tollett's coach—I have heard there is such a coach there—I said "Very well, I will fetch a candle; and if I know the writing I will take the parcel but not else"—I got a light, and opened the gate, and saw Duffin—I just got a sight of him, and knew his voice—Taylor was with him-Duffin put his hand over my mouth, and said, "Your money"—I said, "For God's sake don't hurt me, I have shown you so much lenity; I will give you what I have"—Duffin said, "Now, let us have it"—one of them came near my pocket, and I said, "Don't touch me; upon my soul you shall have it"—Duffin put his hand on my face again, and scratched it, saying, "In your soul"—I said to myself, "God forbid"—Taylor then came towards my pocket, and I said to him, "Dare you touch me?" and put up my hand—I said, "I will give you my word and honour you • hall have it"—Taylor said, "Now, let us have it"—I said I had half a sovereign which I would not part with if I wanted bread, but as I had promised it them they should have it—it had been given to me by a very dear friend—Duffin said, "That is what we want"—Taylor had knocked the candle out of my hand directly I opened the gate—I did not know his name then, but I knew him by sight—I took my purse out of my pocket—I do not know exactly what was in it—I thought there was 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at first, but there was less—there was half a sovereign, two half-crowns, one shill<lb/>ing, and a sixpence—I gave that to Taylor—Duffin held me close, and if it had not been for a tree behind me I should have been thrown down—Duffin held his hand over my mouth, and said, "Don't halloo"—the money was in the purse I gave to them—I was not alarmed in the least, which is most surprising; I am very thankful to my Maker for the pre<lb/>servation of my life—I gave up the purse, as I considered my life was in danger.</p>

I went to Mrs. Pistell's on the morning after the robbery, and found the prisoners there with Godfrey and Lander—the prosecutrix stated it was no use for her to go before a Magis trate, for she could not swear to them, as the candle was knocked out of her hand the instant she opened the door, and she had not any opportunity of seeing their faces—she did not say any thing in my presence about knowing them by their voices—I have lived in that neighbourhood twelve years—I live about 300 yards from her house—I have had conversation with her at different times—she always discoursed in an incoherent man ner, and I considered her deranged.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-bouse and beer-shop in Waterloo-terrace Commercial-road, in. the parish of Stepney. On the night between the 15th and 16th of March, I was the last up in the house—I went to bed about eleven o'clock—all the doors at the back of the bouse were left on the latch—I did not consider anybody could enter the house the back way; but in front, every thing was bolted—there are two doors behind my house, which open into the back yard—they were left dosed, but on the latch, and could be opened from the yard—there is one door in front, that was locked, and the windows were ail fastened, all shut down close—between twelve and one o'clock, I heard a noise which I con sidered was the wind and rain beating against the front of the house—I had not been to sleep—I listened, and heard much the same noise, till I heard a brass candlestick drop into the water-jug in my own room—I had left it carelessly on the end of the wash-hand-stand that night, and thought it had fallen in by itself—the jug was standing on the wash-hand-stand, uiderneath where the basin is usually put, and there was no basin, so that it could fall into the jug—I still listened, and shortly after lost the tick of my watch—I had placed my watch on the corner of a little bracket on my wash-hand-stand—I then looked out of bed, and saw a parcel in the room by the wash-hand-stand, which I knew was not there when I went to bed, but I could not tell what it was—it was up in the further corner of the room where the watch was—I then got out of bed, and put my hand on this parcel, which I did not know was a man; but I put my hand on him, and Dp his back, and then on his face, and found it was a man—I collared him immediately—he was all but lying down, on his hands and knees—I</p>

About seven o'clock on the morning of the 28th of February, I was crossing Cowderoy's-fields, and met the two prisoners and another, who knocked me down and took my waistcoat off—Develin was the biggest—they pulled off my jacket, and took the waistcoat, and left the jacket, as it was not worth so much as the waistcoat—I had known them before—the two prisoners went to school with me—Giles helped—they did not hurt me—they ran across the wooden bridge, into Back-alley—that is not above five minutes' walk from the field—I followed them all the way to Back-alley, and then they shut me in, tod I lost them—there is a door there, they ran in first, and I after them.</p>

I was near Mr. Moore's shop on the 28th of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock—I saw the prisoner come out from the door in Upper Kingsgate-street, with another young man, with a pair of boots—I saw them tearing some large tickets off the boots, which had the prices of them on—the young man came to the door, and looked out—I made inquiry, and then ran and caught the prisoner in Upper Kingsgate-street, with the boots wrapped up in a silk handkerchief—his companion made his escape.</p>

I knew the deceased, Elizabeth Mary Oliver, for two, three, or perhaps four months—I know the prisoner also—On Saturday night, the 12th of March, I was at the Catherine-wheel public-house in Essex-street, Whitechapel, as near twelve o'clock as I can say—the pri<lb/>soner and the deceased were both there—I saw the deceased dancing, and saw her drink some spirits with a man—the prisoner drank some beer—I did not see the deceased leave the public-house—I saw her again, near twelve o'clock, standing outside on the footpath; and about a minute after I saw the prisoner; just at the side of me, making to run—he was one or two yards from her—he put his hand up and gave her a push—I thought it was not with any violence—I thought it was on the back part of her neck—she fell on receiving the push—I went towards Whitechapel, and the prisoner came directly after me—two or three people were round the de<lb/>ceased, picking her up—the prisoner did not say a word when he came up to me, but going along Whitechapel either he or I said, "I think she is hurt with the fall"—she had fallen on her face, and, I thought, more I on her right side than her left—I do not know whether she was drunk or sober—she did not make any struggle—she fell rather heavy on the ground, like people do who are in liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Brick-lane. I examined the body of the deceased on the Wednesday following the Saturday—in my opinion her death was caused by an extensive extravasation of blood in the upper portion of the spinal marrow, in the base of the brain—those symp<lb/>toms might be caused by a blow or fall, or it is possible they might have arisen without violence—when I examined the body it was in a state of decomposition—a general concussion of the body might have caused extra<lb/>vasation, or a blow in any part of the skull might produce it—the body was not in a state to enable me to see whether there was a bruise in that part of the neck—the decomposition would have prevented my seeing it if there was one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Union-street. I examined the body of the deceased in company with Mr. Mean—I have heard him explain the immediate cause of death, and agree with him—I conclude the appearances I saw, arose from a blow—such appearances are not usual from natural causes—a case of apoplexy might produce it—a blow on the nape of the neck I suppose would cause such appearances—there was no external marks perceptible on the back of the body—while Mr. Mears was giving his evidence before the Coroner, I was cleaning the body and sowing it up, and I saw a mark on the nose which had escaped our notice, which I suppose was caused by a fall—the body was in a remarkable state of de<lb/>composition, considering death had happened so recently—that would probably arise from her course of life.</p>

On Tuesday, the 28th of March, I was in Bethnal-green-road, and saw the prisoner coming by the church, towards the Salmon and Ball public-house—he was by himself, at large and at liberty—a little before I came to him I received information, in consequence of which I came in contact with him against the Salmon and Ball, and asked if he was not an escaped convict?—he replied that he was—I then took him to the station-house—he was intoxicated—he was walking by himself, unsupported by any one—he appeared to know what was said to him, and what his answers were—I have no doubt of that whatever—I did not hold out any promise or threat to him.</p>

I did not make him any promise or threat—I asked him if it was true that he had returned from transportation—he said, "Yes; about fourteeu years ago I committed a burglary, for which I was tried at the Old Bailey, and transported for life; about four years since I effected my escape, by <hi rend="italic">slowing</hi> myself away in the hold of a ship, and I have been in England about four months"—I made him no answer, but that the door of the cell, and left him—he was drunk—I have not the least doubt that he knew what I said to him, and what answers he gave—before the Magistrate he admitted the conversation with me, but denied that it was true.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in White Lion-street, Goodman's-fields, and am clerk to George Richard Metzler, of Wardour-street, Westminster. On the 8th of March, I saw a bassoon and clarionet in the shop, at ten o'clock in the morning—there was a broken square of glass in the window, large enough to admit a hand, but I had ordered some music cases to be placed against the hole—I did not mist these articles till the evening—I afterwards saw the clarionet in the possession of Wentworth—it is worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the bassoon 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is the cost price—a person might get them out without breaking the window, but I had had them moved out of reach—they could not be reached by a hand without some instrument being used—they were both missed at the same time—the lowest value of them is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I saw two boys at the Colonnade, in Russell-square, on the 6th of April, from five to six o'clock—I cannot swear to the prisoner; if he is the boy he has not the same countenance—one of them took this hat, and carried it before him into Russell-square—he dropped it on the other side of a cart, and ran into Bedford-place—in my attempting to follow him I slipped—I caught the boy that took the hat—I have no doubt of that, and I gave him to the policeman—I never gave any other boy to the policeman—I cannot say whether he had a cap on or not—no one has been speaking to me about this—I made this mark at the office to this deposition—that is what I swore before the Magistrate—it was read over to me I believe—I have no doubt what I swore was true—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"I was in the Colonnade this afternoon, and saw the prisoner take the hat from the stall in front of the prosecutor's, and ran away with it".</p>

On the 30th of March, 1836, I taw the prisoner at Winborn, in Dorsetshire—I was travelling there for Mr. Cooper—the prisoner resided there, and applied to me to supply him with some goods—I told him I could not take his order without a guarantee, and he offered me Mr. Topp, his brother-in-law, as security—I made inquiry, and found he was a very respectable man, and lived in the neighbourhood—on these terms, and on no other, I supplied the prisoner with goods—these goods were to be paid for in four months—I know they were supplied—I received no guarantee from the prisoner—it was to be sent before the goods were sent off, but it was not—on the 30th of July I applied to him to pay me, either in cash or in Mr. Topp's accep<lb/>tance at one month—he went, as he told me, to Mr. Topp's, and brought me an acceptance of Mr. Topp's, but I discovered it was only on a receipt stamp—I told him that was of no use, he must go and get it upon a regular bill stamp—I gave him the price of the stamp, and as I was getting into my gig he brought me a bill, and told me that was Mr. Topp's acceptance on a regular stamp—I believe this is it—I have no doubt it is the same—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)-"Payable at Glynn and Co.

                  </hi>. I am a wagoner in the employ of Messrs. Kenworthy. On the 1st of April I received from Mattinson a parcel to take to Messrs. Howitt's in Holborn—I placed it between two bags of wool, and a heavy woollen blanket was placed over it to keep the water off—I am certain it could not have got out itself—when I got to Holborn the blanket was turned back and the parcel gone—that could not have happened accidentally—I received the parcel at the bottom of Love-lane—I went up Alderman<lb/>bury, and turned into Cateaton-street, and up Milk-street into Cheapside.</p>

                  </hi>. About eight o'clock at night on the 1st of April I was in Gutter-lane, and saw the prisoner Taylor carrying this bundle under his arm—there were two persons with him that I knew—they might have been about a quarter of a yard from him—not more—I followed him into St. Ann's-lane, near the post-office—James was one of the other persons with him—when I got into St. Ann's-lane I collared Taylor, and he dropped the cloth, struck me right and left as bard as he could, and tried to get away—I called for assistance, and Rawlinson came—he picked up the par<lb/>cel—I was obliged to take Taylor in a coach—I have got the invoice that was under the string of the parcel. On Friday morning the 7th, about half-past seven o'clock, I saw James in Watling-street, in company with two others—I spoke to a man of the name of Jay—I saw that James was watch<lb/>ing me, and I followed him—he ran into St. Paul's churchyard—I over<lb/>took him just by the school—as he went under the piazza he drew this life-preserver, and flourished it about at me, which prevented my getting at him—I ultimately got him into custody by calling out.</p>

The prisoner came and asked for a night's lodging on the 2nd of April—(he had called three weeks before, when he was quite lame with the gout, and had half a pint of beer)—he went away in the morning about half-past seven o'clock—he paid sixpence—I suspected something, and went up stairs—my wife missed two gowns and part of a silk dress—I pursued—he had not got above 400 yards from the house—the patrol found these things on him—there was this petticoat, which we had not missed before.</p>

On the 28th of December I had been at home the whole day, and for a fortnight before, as I was very ill—about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock that night, as I was reading the newspaper in the bar parlour, I heard a strange noise in my house, and Mrs. Ivory rushed in, and ran through the shop, into our parlour—she tried the door at the bottom of the stairs, and Mrs. Spicer, who was in the bar, said, "Your husband is not here"—she replied, "You are a d—d liar"—she then went against the street door, and opened the half-door to go out, and when she got her back against the door, she turned round, and abused me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030201"/>
               <p>in very bad language—I was inside the bar, standing at the beer-engine—there is a door to the bar, which was shut—there was no means of my getting to the street door without opening the bar door—I told her if she did not go away I would call in the police, and take her away—she looked round and saw Hornsby, the policeman, standing on the pavement, close to the door—one of the doors were open—her back came against the door—when she saw the policeman she walked away—Hornsby was quite near enough to hear and see me all the time—I had not gone out of my bar at all at that time—I was not within striking distance of the woman at any part of the time—I was never within ten feet of her, at least a long distance—I never touched her in my life, not even her clothes—I did not push her on the back, nor throw her down—I did not see her fall over the curb—I saw her fall when her husband knocked her down in the shop—that was when she came back the second time, about ten minutes after the policeman had driven her up the street—she had gone to another public-house—when she was nearly up the street, I looked out at the door, and there was not a soul in the street but the policeman and her—in about ten minutes her husband and brother came into my house, and a few minutes afterwards she came back—she began to abuse her husband, and he knocked her down, with his left hand, in her eye—I never saw the prisoner near my house that evening—I never saw him at all, to my knowledge, till he was in custody—I saw him at the Court—I am quite positive he was not in front of my house when Mrs. Ivory left it—there was not a soul in the street but the policeman and her, for I looked out at the door to see—when her husband knocked her down, she did not (all backwards, but all in a heap—she put her hand to her eye, and said to him, "You shall suffer for this; I will give you a month for this, as I have done before"—she and her husband, and brother, left the house together—I told them to go and settle their quarrels at home, and they all went—Pendry was the last man in my house, and I shut it up—I swear I never touched her at all.</p>

On the 28th of December last, my husband was very ill, and was not up till after he took tea in the evening—a little before twelve o'clock that night, Mrs. Ivory came in to look after her husband—I told her there was no company there, and the house was clear—she called me a d—liar—my husband had not left the bar-parlour at that time—some further conversation took place between Mrs. Ivory and me, and my husband came to the bar by my side—Mrs. Ivory had then walked from the bar, and tried the door, and come back again to the front of the bar—the bar door wan closed and bolted—she abused Mr. Spicer very grossly and took a pack of cards out of her pocket, and said she would ruin Mr. Spicer with those—Mr. Spicer said be would fetch a policeman, and I saw one through the half-door, which was open, and I said, "Don't go."</p>

                  </hi> I have resided in the New-road very nearly thirty years, and have carried on the business of a coachmaker the whole time. In the course of the year 1835, I determined to carry on also the business of a wine and spirit merchant on my premises—the prisoner introduced himself to me, and proposed to take the cellar, if I would advance him the money to any it on—we entered into terms, which were reduced to writing—he came to my premises on the 1st of January, 1835, and was in the cellar acting as my servant—the first thing he did was to select goods from wholesale dealers, in order to put into the collar, and they were sent in—it was then his duty to draw spirits, serve customers, and attend to the business generally—it was his duty to receive money when he served the customers—the beer and spirits in those vaults were mine—I did not begin the wine business for six months after—I think it was in September or October—I had books for the entry of all transactions which took place in the cellars—they were in the hands of the clerk, Mr. Dearie—the name of James Graham and Co. was over the door—there was no such person as James Graham—I assumed that name for the purpose of carrying on that business—no person except myself had Any property in those cellars, and the persons who sent in the barrel which contained the liquors—the prisoner paid me money while he was in the cellars on account of the sale of goods—I used to pay him money, and to allow him to deduct from the receipts in business, for the wages of himself, the cellarman, and occasionally a man to wash bottles—the first two or three weeks I paid the prisoner 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he was au<lb/>thorised to send out goods to customers—I was acquainted with very few of the customers—I did not know Mr. Harrison personally, nor Mr. Jones, nor Mrs. Shaw—the prisoner made entries in the books relating to the busi<lb/>ness which I have spoken of, regularly every day—he sometimes paid me money—whenever he had a surplus that was not employed, he handed it over to me in sums of from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on those occasions I referred to the hooks which he kept—On the 16th of December, 1836, I called on him to make up his accounts—Mr. Hare had been employed to assist in making them up—I found in the books entries of certain sums having been received</p>

               <p>and forty or fifty entries of money due, in the prisoner's handwritings while he was at my cellars he accounted for sums received from particular customers in the regular day's business—I never had any convensation with him respecting any sums of money due or received from Mr. Har<lb/>rison or Mr. Jones—I mentioned to him in the early part of February last that Mrs. Shaw had paid some money which did not appear in the boob—he would not believe it, and I fetched him up the books to show him that it was so—I do not recollect any thing that passed after that—he never accounted to me for 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he received from Mrs. Shaw on the 3rd of December, 1836, either verbally or by the books—here is the day-book—on the 3rd of December, 1836, here is no entry of the kind—I find on the 22nd of August, 1836, there were goods bad by Mrs. Shaw, of Priory Cottage, Kilburn, to the amount of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the entry is in the prisoner's writing—and on the 25th of August goods were had by her to the amount of 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner never accounted to me for these sums—this is one of the bills used in my wine and spirit business, and it is filled up in the handwriting of the prisoner—on the 19th of September, 1836, I find in the prisoner's handwriting—"Harrison, Esq., 9, Cambridge-terrace, one gallon of brandy, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—there is no sum appears in the books as having been paid on account of that brandy—he never accounted to roe for the receipt of that sum of money, or any part of it—this is another of my bills of parcels in the prisoner's handwriting—here is a total of "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and by cash 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—leaving a balance of 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he never accounted for either of these sums—on the 24th of November, 1836, here is an entry in the name of Jones, but that is not in the prisoner's writing; it is the cellarman's—this is another of my bills in the prisoner's writing, and with his signature, "Jones, Esq., three bottles of whisky, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—settled, Graham and Co., <hi rend="smallCaps">R.

Ray, my wine-merchants, to know if any persons were desirous of buying a business of that kind, and if so to</p>

               <p>recommend them to me; and they sent up a Mr. Sow<lb/>erby—I explained to Dearie the terms on which I had agreed to let the business to Mr. Sow<lb/>erby, and said I had recommended him to Mr. Sowerby, that I had told him the terms on which he was in my service; and in the event of his closing with me, he would find him an excellent servant, at far as I knew, and an acquisition; and that if Mr. Sowerby called, he was to show him the books, and give him every explanation—the prisoner did not say any thing to me about the business at that time—but in the course of a week or so after, he said, if I was disposed to part with the basinets he thought he should be able to find friends who would be able to raise money suffi<lb/>cient to enable him to take the business if I had no objection—I told him the terms on which I had offered the cellars to Mr. Sowerby, and if he could make up the money I should certainly give him the preference—he told me that a person of the name of Ray had offered to lend him 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that probably by other channels he might be able to raise the re<lb/>mainder, but he wanted time to consider of it—he afterwards said he had been speaking with a person of the name of Moule I think, who would be able to advance a sum of money, as Mr. Ray had refused to let him have 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till he got possession—that went off for a few weeks, and then he proposed to take it on his own account, as he found Mr. Moule could not raise the money he had expected, and if I would take it on bills he would take it—I said I would not have any thing to do with any thing but money—I bare subsequently seen the prisoner at No. 1, Union-place—it is a very good house, where he has established wine cellars, five doors from my own house—the name of Dearie and Moule was up there at first, bat since the examination, Moule and Co. has been substituted—during the whole time I have known the prisoner he has never had any interest in my busi<lb/>ness as a partner—he has not had the slightest interest in the property that was upon those premises—I do not know whether he had any other income or means of living, except the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week that I have spoken of.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are a coach-maker, you say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was in partnership with my brother, but not in the wine sad spirit business—I had no partner in that—there was no such person as James Graham—I have signed the name of "Graham and Co."as my name—the prisoner was at first serving me under a verbal Agreement—I was not restricted by any agreement with my brother, from going into any other busi<lb/>ness while I was with him—I did not tell my brother that I went into this whiskey and ale business—we were not on good terms, and have not been for many years—I have been a proprietor in the Marylebone Joint Stock Bank since September—the prisoner paid monies over to me, and on those occasions I have gone over the books myself—I have gone over them with him several times, when I wanted money, I looked over the books, and asked him for money—he was aware that I was going over the books, and I have asked him to account for sums of money—I have several times gone over the accounts with torn, and said, "You have so much money in hand"—I cannot tell any time—it was the general way—some times I vent over the accounts myself, and found there was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in his hands, and I asked him for money, and he pulled out his purse and gave it me—that was both for general and particular accounts—I cannot name any one occasion, it was so general—I knew the books were asked for by letter—they were put into Mr. Hare the accountant's hand—I did not direct him to let Dearie see the books, but I had no objection to it—I never said any thing. one way or the other—there was a balance drawn up to Christmas, 1835, by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030216"/>
               <p>Mr. Hare in the early part of 1836—he made it out as an accountant—at that time there was an account made out from the books—it was cleared and checked by Dearie, and bis salary, and commission, and all—I do not know sufficient of the books to tell you where to look for it—I was not a party to it—the monies put down here, were paid to me at the times here put down—they were paid generally every week, some times a fortnight might elapse—it was sometimes leu than a week, but the date will tell you—whenever I found there had been a sum of money received, I asked him what money he had, and he handed me over 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as it happened to suit him—I generally used to do it every Sa<lb/>turday—I have many times asked him when I have not received it, and I asked again for it—I generally went to him every Saturday to ask him what money he had, and to get money—I looked at the books to see what money there was, probably twenty times during the time he was with me—none of these payments took place between the 7th of February and the 19th of October, because there was very little, I should apprehend, to hand over—it was all outgoings—there was very little to expect from the business the first year—the prisoner was not at that time in Scotland—on the 19th of October 1 received some money—I should think these figures refer to the folio of the journal—I received money on the 19th of October, on the 24th, and on the 26th—it depended on the money he had received—I used to apply to him generally every week, but it did not follow that I had the money every week—it was his duty to enter the sums received in the course of the day, and to hand the surplus to me every Sa turday; but it depended on the monies that were paid into the concern—he was to account whenever I chose to ask him for the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does Saturday occur, now for example, twice in one day, because. I find here, "April the 16th, £45," and again the same day "£25?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All these things are depending on the sums received—when I called on him it was his duty to account for it to me—it was on Saturday generally—I was desired not to touch the books after the prisoner left—the last. entry in this book in the prisoner's writing is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 22nd of October—he remained in my service till the 31st of December—there is no other entry in this book in his handwriting after that—there is in the day-book—• here is the writing of Mr. Hare, the prisoner, the cellarman, and myself in this day-book—whoever receives the money marks the receipt of it—Dearie took care to go over them every night—he might be out all day, but it was the custom to be out till two o'clock, and then to remain at home all day up to eight o'clock—that was the general practice—he has gone to the docks and to many other parts, in the course of business—I have never come to any final settlement with him as to any money there might be between us—I believe he understood the business perfectly well—I did not understand a great deal about it—I bought the goods—it was his duty to wait on the customers, not to get customers—they came as a mat<lb/>ter of course—I did not know a great many of the persons—some of them were private friends of my own—he used to give the orders and inspect the goods, and I used to pay for them for the first twelve months—after that I purchased myself of different brokers—he might purchase in the last twelvemonth—it is impossible to say that he did not buy half a dozen hogsheads of ale—he never went to Scotland for me—he went in search of his wife and family, who deserted him—I do not remember that I said in the course of last summer that Dearie was crone to Scotland, and I hoped he was not going to cut, as he had got 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of mine—I have no recollec<lb/>tion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030217"/>
               <p>of saying so to Mr. Bank—I will not swear any thing of the kind—I think if I bad said it, I should have remembered it—I cannot charge my Memory with ever having made use of such an expression—it might have been so—I never told any body that Dearie was gone to Scotland to pur<lb/>chase whiskey for me—I have no recollection of telling Mr. Sowerby so—it might have been so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you advertise that your whiskeys were come from Scotland, and that the King of Belgium and all the rest were very fond of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was at the request of Dearie—when he returned he brought me an account that he had got several very fine whiskeys, so that it was not alto<lb/>gether a fraud—I inserted the advertisement, thinking it might be profit<lb/>able—I had no intention of fraud—I did not instruct Dearie to purchase any whiskey—I know Sarah Mills, who is Dearie's landlady—I have seen her coming there—I have had some conversation with her about him, many times—I do not recollect that I wrote her a letter about him in February last—this is my handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—when I had got out my warrant, and was taking my proceedings against the prisoner—Mrs. Mills called on the 1st of January, and related a long story of the injury she had received at Dearie's hands, and asked me what was the best course to get the money that was due to her—I told her that Dearie had now money, and I thought if she pressed for it that he would pay her—that was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not recollect advising her to proceed against him for 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or to sue him for 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for a gallon of gin—I will not swear any thing about it, as I do not recollect it—I did not say I would recommend her to an attorney in Grays Inn, who would do it for her without expense—she did not tell me she was not rich enough to sue—I do not recollect that she told me that she was not inclined to sue Dearie at all, and that she believed he would pay her as soon as he was able, nor any thing of the kind—she was in the habit of coming down to complain of Dearie—I am not in the habit of having to do with other people's concerns—I might have told persons that Dearie was Graham—I do not remember any particular circumstance—I never told Mr. Kerslake that he was Graham—parties have frequently come in and addressed him by that name—I never introduced him as Graham to Mr. Hibble or Mr. Kerslake—I always said, "There is Mr. Dearie, the manager"—I cannot recollect that I ever committed myself so far as to introduce him as Mr. Graham—I do business with Mrs. Wilson, of Alsop-terrace—I will not swear that I did not introduce Dearie to her as Graham—I do not recollect that I have, in the presence of Mr. Bell, addressed Dearie by the name of Graham—I will not swear either one way or the other.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that a fortnight before he led, you asked him something about his books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gate him a fortnight to make his books up—I had not done so before, I had an accountant—I never said that Dearie was not capable of making them up—he was quite capable—I never said the contrary to any body—he introduced himself to me, with a certificate of his good conduct, most respectably signed and written, which I am told is a common practice with all Scotchmen; and he showed me a snuff<lb/>box which was given him by the workmen of some mill—he left me on the 31st of December, at eight o'clock, the usual time—he left me quietly, with<lb/>out haste or hurry—it was in October or November that I had been in treaty for the sale of my spirit vaults to him—I think I recommended him to Mr. Sowerby in October—it certainly was not so late as Christmas—I will not swear it was not as late as the 1st of December—I really cannot tell the date—I saw him again on the 2nd of January, on the 18th, on the 28th, and on the 5th of February—I have taken these dates from my me morandum book, which is at home—I copied them on this paper ten days ago—I did not see the prisoner on any other days but these—I do not enter every thing in my book on the day it happens—it is sometimes the next day—I do not recollect seeing him at my own place on the 13th of January, in company with Mr. Lambert, the excise-officer—I have no knowledge at all of seeing him on any other days but those I have drawn from my memorandum—I do not recollect saying to Mr. Vincent Lambert, when Dearie had been on my premises, "You saw Dearie; he tells me he does not much like his partner; he was a d—d fool for leaving here; he might have had this place for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year"—I might have said so a fort<lb/>night after 1 dismissed him—I do not recollect it—I will not "wear I did not—I did not know the books were incorrect then—I knew it on the 9th of February.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say to Mr. Tubb, on the 9th of February, "I should like to have gone band in hand with Dearie, for there is business enough for us both?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said, if he had conducted himself well, I should have been very glad to have gone hand in hand with him, as there was business enough for both of us, and I had no animosity against him—I don't re<lb/>collect telling Mr. Tubb that Dearie had robbed me, and that I had got a warrant out against him, which had been executed the day before—I don't recollect that I told Mr. Tubb that Dearie was a rogue, and had rob<lb/>bed me of 200/., and that I could send him to Newgate—I might have done it—it is very likely that I did—I can't say that I did or did not—I don't remember Mr. Tubb saying, that if a man had robbed him he should prosecute him—I don't remember what passed—I remember Tubb coming there, but I don't remember the conversation—I saw the prisoner on the 8th of February—(1 had then had warrant against him four days)—I did not part with him on good terms, and bid him good bye—I took him up to where the books were, and into the dining-room, where the cloth was laid—I kept a ledger, a journal, a day-book, and a cash-book—the party who took the orders made the entry in the day-book—I don't know that I ever said that Dearie was not an accountant, and not capable of keeping accounts—this is my journal for 1835—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—some leaves have been cut out by Mr. Hare, I believe, so as to make the books begin properly—I don't know whether the entries in the pages which are cut out were in the handwriting of Dearie—I had nothing to do with the books—I</p>

               <p>don't know when the leaves were cut out—Mr. Hare did it—he was the only person who was employed in the accounts—he made out the ac<lb/>counts from the day-book, which he took as his standard—this is the day-book for 1835—there appears to be one or two leaves cut out of it—I don't know that I cut them out with my own hand—I don't recollect it—I don't recollect the circumstance at all—I have no idea at all—the writing in the book next to where the leaves have been cut out, is mine, and my writing continues to the 87th of January—I entered them as they occurred in the course of the day—I suppose I entered them day by day—I did not cut out the leaves myself and make a transcript, be<lb/>cause the other was too bad to appear in the book—I don't recollect that I made a great many of them at one time, and from something that had been written before—I don't recollect any thing further than I state—I cannot tell whether I made the entries one one day, and another on another—I never refused the prisoner the inspection of these books—I think I re<lb/>collect a gentleman who is here, calling on me, with a letter from Mr. Scan<lb/>lan, to see the books, and I told him my attorney had advised me not to five a stone to break my own head—I never told Dearie there were these three sums unaccounted for, and I wished be would give me some account of them—I think in the first year about 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. might pass through his hands, and in the second year about 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—fan deficiencies amount to between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never sent him an account of them—I could not, when I did not discover them till the middle of January—some of them were brought to light only the day before yesterday—when goods am sent out, it is common for a man employed as he was, to send the bill out by the porter—if the money was not paid, the porter may have brought the bill back, and it is always customary to cancel it—I parted with the prisoner on the 31st of December—he staid his usual time, sad came again on the following Monday—I don't know wben he took the place within five doors of me, nor when he entered upon it—on the 2nd of January he told me he had taken the house—I heard nothing at that time of his going in partnership with a gentleman—I knew that, some tine in January—on the 18th of January I saw him on Mr. Corde's account—I did not tee him again, to the best of my recollection, till the 28th—I took out my warrant on the 4th of February, I think—I spoke to the prisoner on the subject of Mr. Cordo's account on the 18th of January—he had entered Mr. Cordo's account in one book, and not in the other—he entered it in tat margin of the ledger—here it is, on the 24th of October, in his hand-writing, add it remained standing due—he received the Money, and did not enter it—it is discharged in the day-book, but not entered in the other book—this is the hill I sent to Mr. Cordo some time in January, after Dearie was gone, and I afterwards sent him this other bill; I had in the mean time seen Dearie—he showed me, from the entry in the day<lb/>book, that he had received the 4i. which had not been entered in the ledger—Dearie left the books in a state of confusion—when I was gong to make up the books by the help of an accountant, I did not desire Dearie to attend and look to his own accounts—I made out the accounts of all the customers, to see what sums were due to the concern—I gave him the fortnight to make up his books, but he would not do it—this entry of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is in his own handwriting, and he discharges Cordo for that money—I had this book in my poasession when I sent to Cordo demanding that money—this is the only book in which Dearie wrote his general entries—the books were in the counting-house on the 31st of December, when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030220"/>
               <p>Dearie left—I sent to him some time in January, to explain an account with regard to a Mr. Campbell—I had sent out the accounts about the mid<lb/>dle of January, and the parties applied to roe—I don't know whether that had happened when I sent to him about Mr. Campbell—I mentioned two or three others to him on the 8th of February—he did not propose to have an accountant whom he named, and to go regularly over the accounts—he recommended a Mr. Wilks as a clerk to succeed him—he came to me, and Dearie told him there was a situation open, and he thought very likely he might have it—it was in Dearie's power to have discharged all these accounts—I have asked him for many of them—one in particular of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mr. Coxhead's—I asked him about that, several times during the year—I cannot tell when I first asked him about it—I desired him to call; I should think it was after June—he continued in my service six months after that—this is one of my licences in my own name, jointly with that of Graham—the former licence is destroyed when we obtain a new one—I should say my former licences were the counterpart of this—I cannot tell that they were in the name of Graham and Burnand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you ever fined by the Excise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was fined through the prisoner's neglect—I can hardly tell whether I paid it on my own account, or on account of somebody else—there was a penalty levied in consequence of Dearie's having obtained two gallons of spirits from a Dundee packet—the man was taken with it in bis possession, and was fined in the mitigated penalty of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they came to me, and asked me to let them have it, that the man should not go for two months to the treadmill—the man's name was Samuel Kerslake—Dearie sent him for these spirits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, did you not send him yourself to the docks to get something, when Dearie was not present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told him to go down to the docks, and there he would receive a parcel that was left by Mr. Dearie, at the Dundee wharf, I believe—I told him to go there, and receive a packet, but it was contrary to my instructions that the whiskey was sent for, but he got it, and I paid the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked about some leaves being out of some of these books—in this day-book there is an entry respecting Mr. Cordo, was it the prisoner's duty to enter that in one or two books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In two books—before I sent out to collect debts, I referred to the ledger, and, according to the appearance of the ledger, the account was still due—it was not discharged—that sum had been received by Dearie, and it was his duty to have marked it off in the ledger, and from its not being marked off in the ledger I was induced to send to Mr. Cordo—I was able, after finding that Dearie had received the money, to correct the mistake—all my books were produced at the police-office without any reserve, and inspected by Mr. Adolphus and the prisoner also—the prisoner being my servant it was part of his duty to receive sums of money owing to me—I authorised him so to do—when he received the money he was to enter it in the day<lb/>book of the day, and so to account for the receipt—the book which the leaves are said to have been torn out of, is for 1835—it has no reference to the present charge—on referring to my books I find on the 24th of Nov<lb/>ember 1836, there was due from Mr. Jones, 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the 22nd of August, Mrs. B.

               <p>if they were there—Mr. Dearie's duties were very considerable out of doors, and from that it became necessary for the porters to act as clerks, and Mr. Burnand saw and sanctioned that—all the porters, or Dearie or Mr. Bur<lb/>nand might receive money—the books and accounts were very irregularly kept—Mr. Burnand knew that fact—I never heard the prisoner tell Mr. Burnand that he was not able to keep the books, but I considered him incapable of doing so—I never knew Mr. Burnand complain of the manner in which the books were kept—I have known the prisoner make payments to Mr. Burnand, at a time when the payments have not been entered in the book—Mr. Hare was employed as a book-keeper, when it was found they could no longer go on without it, and while he was so employed, he occa<lb/>sionally received money when persons came to pay it—I have seen Dearie's initials put by Mr. Burnand to the day-book, before any payment has been nude to Dearie—that has sometimes happened when Dearie has been so much out of doors that he has not been at home to meddle with the books the whole day—I have bad occasion to remind Dearie of payments that he has made on account of the firm, and which ike himself had not entered—I have known occasions, when both 1 earie and Burnand have omitted, for a day or more, to make entries of the money they have received on account of the firm—I remember a particular occasion, when Mr. Dearie made a payment of money to Mr. Burnand, and Dearie had not entered it, and I reminded him of it; if I had not, and he had not recollected it, that pay<lb/>ment would have gone into Mr. Burnand's pocket—it was customary for Dearie to make payments to Burnand relating to beer and spirits, in the coach factory—there was no order or regularity in the mode of making payments, or of entering them when they were made—it was very likely that a mistake might have arisen, or a payment have been omitted to be entered—I remember hearing that Dearie had made a payment for a hogs<lb/>head of brandy, and he had forgotten to enter it, tad he was complaining of something that bad left his money short—he was in the habit of trusting too much to his memory—it was not in hit power to do his business out of doors, and to keep the books as correctly as he should have done—he came in from his rounds at various times—sometimes he was out all day—it is not true that he was always is by two o'clock in the day—Mr. Bur<lb/>nand discharged him on the 16th of December, and he left on the 31st—I saw them together in the connting-house on the 2nd day of January, and they appeared to be on friendly terms—after Dearie had left that day, Mr. Burnand inquired of me what Dearie was going to do, and I told him he had taken No. 1, and was about to commence business—Mr. Burnand said they were very splendid premises, but he must make some cellars to them—I remember Mr. Burnand sending in an account to Mr. Cordo for five gallons and two gallons of whiskey—I informed Mr. Burnsnd, at that time, that I knew the five gallons had been paid—I told him if be would turn up the day-book, he would find the account paid—he would not do so, but he turned up the ledger, and found the accounts were not posted—on the 4th or 5th of January, Dearie came to the counting-bouse, made some observation to me about my leaving Burnand; and after he left I went into the counting-house to Burnand, and apprised him that I should leave on the following Saturday—he said it was very ungrateful of me to go to Mr. Dearie, who bad done nothing for me, and stood out against me all along—I remember the same evening, Mr. Burnand being jocose with</p>

               <p>me as to the place I was going to—he asked if I should have to wash bottles out in that shed; and he said he understood from Dearie that they could not get the lease of the house settled—on the same evening he tent me with a receipt to Mr. Cordo, and told me to say that Mr. Dearie had neglected to make the five gallons paid, and if he would pay the balance for the two gallons, it would make it all right—I called his attention to it in the day-book, as having been paid at that time—I referred to the day-book the next morning, and found it properly entered as paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Collyers'-rents, Southwark. I knew the de ceased, William Thomas Wright—he lived with hit parents in White-street, and was ten years old the day this happened—on Friday afternoon, the 3rd of March, I saw him playing at shuttlecock in Collyer's-rents, with my little boy and another, near the residence of the prisoner, who has the care of a chapel and burial-ground in Collyer's-rents—while they were playing, the prisoner came out of his door, and ordered them to go away from the door—they did not do so—he turned round, went in doors, got a small stick, and beat the deceased from his own door till he got to the end of the rents—the blows did not hurt him, they were not heavy, from the stick—when he got to the end of the rents the boy fell down—he got up again, and then struck the prisoner with a small stick he had, which he was play<lb/>ing at shuttlecock with; a sort of battledoor—the boy then got up and ran away across the road—the prisoner ran after him and knocked him down with his open hand—he struck him over his head, and the boy fell, and while he was on the ground the prisoner kicked him—I am sure I saw him kick him, and to the best of my recollection it was in the right side—it appeared to be a very violent kick, from the manner of his, foot—when</p>

               <p>the boy got up he could hardly walk, and doubled himself up—he got up as well at he could, and took a handful of dirt or mud in his hand oat of the road and threw at the prisoner—the boy came back to my door—I said, "William, don't throw the dirt at the man, let him go"—he stood at my door crying for some time, with the pain in his side—he appeared hurt, and cried terribly—he went home some time afterwards—I had known him for some time—he appeared invariably in good health, and was a fine boy—when the prisoner gave him the kick, I said he was a good-for-nothing scoundrel for using the boy in the manner he had done—I did not complain of his beating him with the stick; that would have done no harm, it was the kick—I did not see the boy again till the Thursday after, when I saw his mother bringing him from the doctor's, and she was obliged to have a friend to help her—he was then complaining of his side, and was quite stooping—he could not get along—he died on the 28th of March—I saw him after he was dead—it was the same boy I had seen kicked by the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. The deceased was my son; his name was william Thomas Wright—he was Leo years old on the 3rd of March—he came home about dusk that evening and complained of being poorly, he sat about a good deal, and went to bed earner than usual—up to that time hit health was particularly good—he was a fresh-coloured, healthy child—he never complained of any injury to his side before—the following morning, at nine o'clock, he refused to go to school, saying he had great pain when be moved his right leg; but I said it was growing pain, and insisted on hit going, and he did go, he returned about twelve o'clock, and still com<lb/>plained of pain up his side when he moved his right leg—he did not get any better, but gradually worse—about three o'clock on Sunday morning I was awoke by his retching violently, and I went to him—he still com<lb/>plained of pain in hit side—finding he got no better, on the following Thursday I took him to the Surrey Dispeasary—he was there treated by Dr. Hughes—in consequence of what my little boy said, I went to the prisoner's house the same Thursday, and he was whitewashing the front of his house—I asked him if I could speak to the landlord, a person of the name of Stammers—I did not know him at the time—he said his name was Summers—I then said, "Sir, how came you to ill-treat and kick my child in the manner you have done?"—he said he had beat him, but not kicked him, and if I did not go from hit door he would charge the police with me—I said that he might do, and welcome—I did not at first think the boy was so dangerously hurt, but he complained so of his side—he was under Dr. Hughes's care till the 28th of March, and them he died—he complained of pain all over his belly at last—I am not aware of the least injury he had received, or any derangement of his general health, until Friday, the 3rd of March.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am attached to the Surrey Dis<lb/>pcuary. I knew nothing of the boy until the 9th of March, when his mother brought him to me at the Surrey Dispensary—he complained of a severe pain in the right side—it affected his gait considerably—he leaned forwards on his right side, with his hand pressed towards his side, as if suffering from pain—I sent him home and examined him in bed—I found no bruise or external mark of violence—oa applying my hand to the part where he complained of pain, it yielded lest than the ether parts—it was swollen, hard, and tender—he could not bear the pressure of my hand on it without suffering—I heard that he complained of pain in moving his right leg—pain would certainly follow on moving the right leg—there was at that time no appearance of general inflammation about the belly, merely local inflammation on the part where the swelling was—he did not appear to be going on well at first—I applied such remedies as I thought proper, and he appeared improving—the local affection extended and became general, and he became much worse alter I first saw him, but after several days he im<lb/>proved, and after that he again became worse—the inflammation, when I first saw him, was defined and local, but on the second day it had extended over the whole belly and abdomen, and became a constitutional one—it yielded to remedies after seven days, but he afterwards became Worse, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030236"/>
               <p>an opposite state of things was induced, and had violent purgings of a peculiar character, denoting a very severe affection of the bowels; not necessarily inflammation of the lining of the bowels—this continued unchecked by medicine, and after several days the boy sank, exhausted from the con<lb/>tiderable discharges he had suffered—when I first saw him on the 9th of March, I did not discover any constitutional derangement about him—all I found was the local affection—he died on the 28th of March, exhausted from the discharges—I made a post mortem examination of the body twenty eight hours after the time I heard he had died—on opening the belly I found on the right side a large well defined cavity, containing a few ounces of fluid—at the bottom of this cavity were three ulcerated openings into the interior of the bowels—the bowels in the centre, and on the left side, had traces of inflammation of a more recent character than that producing the cavity before mentioned—the liver participated in the inflammation affecting the bowels—the midriff or diaphragm was likewise inflamed and ulcerated, as was the lung in immediate contact with it—I noticed several other circumstances, but I am not aware that they bear on the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the boy had received a severe kick on the 3rd of March, to what cause should you attribute his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To inflamma tion, produced by the kick—if I had evideuce that he had a kick, undoubtedly 1 should ascribe it to that—a kick given as described by the witness would clearly account for the original appearances, and those which followed until he died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might all you observed be accounted for by natu<lb/>ral causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might—it is quite possible—it would not necessarily fol<lb/>low that if he had received a violent kick six days before I saw him, that there would be an external mark or bruise—the probability is, that there would be some external sign—there was no appearance of discolouration or braise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he had received a kick in that place three weeks before, would not the discolouration be less apparent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly; the appearances might possibly be produced by a blow which was not violent, as serious conse<lb/>quences sometimes follow slight injuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing you had never heard the boy had re<lb/>ceived a kick, you would probably have attributed his death to natural causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should have inquired if he had not received external vio<lb/>lence, from my suspicions being excited that external violence had been in flicted—in my opinion, external violence was the cause of the injury he re<lb/>ceived, which ended in death—it is not at all probable the injury could have been inflicted three weeks previous, without the boy's making a complaint—in all human probability he would have complained—it is highly probable that external violence would be followed by violent pain almost immediately—I attribute his death to violence, certainly.</p>
