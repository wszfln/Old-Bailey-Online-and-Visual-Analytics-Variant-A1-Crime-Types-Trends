The prisoner came to me on Monday morning, the 2nd of November, and asked if my young master was at home; I said Yes, he was up stairs- he came back to me in a short time, and said my young master had given him leave to put a sheep in there; he did not see my master to my knowledge - a drove of sheep was in the lane; when he came the second time I saw them - he took one of the sheep out of the drove, and put it into the shop; I saw him do it, and said, "Mrs. Genelley is coming down stairs - she will make a noise about its coming through the shop;" he instantly threw it out again into the drove - I went round and opened our large gate where the cart comes in, he drove it in before him, and shut the gate after him - it was a very large sheep; I noticed a red mark down the face, but not round the nose - he left it there, and came with another man at dusk in the evening, and fetched it away; I went up and told mistress, that he had come for it - she said she dare say it was all right, and he took it away; I believe the mark was ochre.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday, the 2nd of November, I was left with another person in care of the sheep; about a quarter to twelve o'clock, four or five sheep came running into the lane with a dog, which turned them all back except one, which got among our drove, and just after that I asked Mr. Genelley if I could put it into his yard - he said Yes; I went, and asked Simmons if I could put it in, and said his master had given me leave - he said Yes, and as I was getting it through the shop, he said Mrs. Genelley would be cross about it; I drove it out again, and drove it in at the gate, and said I would endeavour to find the owner - I went about the market, and told four or five people in the market I had a sheep which did not belong to me, and if they heard of one being lost to send the person to me; about four o'clock, a countryman, who is a drover. came to me, and described the marks - I went and showed him the sheep - he took it away; on the Tuesday, the prosecutor came to me at the Three Tuns, Smithfield, and said, "Where have you sold my sheep?" I said I did not know what he meant - I did not know he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030004"/>lost one; he repeated that I had sold his sheep - I told him I had left one at Genelley's, but he went away, and said"I shall give you in charge;" I went to find out the person who had it, but could not - I returned to the house, and he was not there; I do not live a quarter of a mile from the market, and was at home all the week: on Saturday I was taken at the same house; there was no mark on the nose - it was only down the face - I should think there are thousands of sheep marked in the same way; it is a very common practice among drovers to catch sheep when lost, and take care of them till somebody comes and describes their marks: when Mr. Procter came, he requested me to count the sheep out - I did so, and told him how many there were; he said they were all right; I met

               <p>JURY to HENRY SIMMONS. Q. Do you recollect whether the same sheep as he brought into the shop was put into the yard? A. I cannot say; he took it out of the drove - it stood on its legs, and ran about the mill-place, not like a worried sheep.</p>

            . I am a Police-man. On the morning of the 3rd of November, between four and five o'clock, I was on duty in Rupert-street, and observed the shadows of three men at the upper part of Rupert-street; I observed them turn down Archer-street - I followed them in a few minutes, and on standing at the corner of Archer-street, I observed at the other end of Archer-street two men under Mr. Delaney's house, and one man on the leads; I made towards them, but the two men, I suppose, gave an alarm to the one on the leads, who instantly jumped down, and the three ran away - I followed them, and bad nearly got to them, when the one jumped down, one turned down Smith's-court, Windmill-street - I rather suspect that to be the prisoner; it was the man who was on the leads, I am positive - a man named Skelton (who was at Marlborough-street) stopped me at the end of the court, and dodged me, to prevent my pursuing; I cannot say he was one of the three men - I do not know what became of the other two men; I should not know the man again who ran down Smith's-court - the court is not a thoroughfare; I was within three yards of the man who ran down there, I should imagine -I remained at the end of Smith's-court, and directed Hobbs, the Police-man, who came up to my assistance, to go down the court, as there was a man down there - Hobbs came up the court again, with the prisoner; that was nearly ten minutes after I had seen a man go down the court - I was at the end of the court at the time the man who came off the leads ran down, and remained there till Hobbs brought the prisoner up - nobody went down there from the time he went down till Hobbs brought the prisoner out: we took him to the watch-house - I searched him there, and found on him a small piece of candle, in his coat pocket, which is here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This man says he was not more than three yards from me - I should think he could tell whether I was the person who jumped off the leads - when I was apprehended he said I was not the person who jumped off the leads, for that person had no shoes on. Witness. I did not say he was not the person who jumped off, nor that he had no shoes on; I only said I was not certain as to the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said two or three men ran down this coach-yard, and one person had no shoes on - he went back from the watch-house with two or three Police-men, to search for them. Witness. I did not say so - I said I left three Police-men there while I brought him to the watch-house, and that two or three of the Police had gone down after the prisoner, but no other person; we were sent out by the inspector to search the place where he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030005"/>concealed, not particularly to search for men, but for implements, or things of that kind; I did not say the man who jumped off the leads had no shoes - it was stated by a tallow-chandler, who was at work, that he supposed the man who ran down the court had no shoes on, by the lightness of his running; the prisoner had shoes on when brought to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a Police-man. On the 3rd of November I was on duty in Brewer-street, between four and five o'clock in the morning, and heard a rattle spring; I went down Windmill-street, and Seaman sent me up Smith's-court - I went and searched all the premises round the court; the doors were all shut and fast - it is no thoroughfare; I saw a dung-heap, and over that was a privy erected - I took my truncheon out of my pocket, put it round the dung-heap, and hallooed out "Come out;" I received no answer - I could see nobody there; I returned to a tallow-chandler who was at work in a court in Smith's-court, which is no thoroughfare, borrowed a lighted candle of him, returned to the dung-heap, and found the prisoner curled up underneath the flooring of the privy, laying on the dung; I said, "You d - d rascal, come out;" he put up his hands and robbed his eyes, just as if he was asleep, and said, "What do you take me for? what have I been doing?" I said, "You have been doing enough;.' I took him from the dung-heap to the watch-house, searched him, and found this chisel in his coat pocket; it was quite a dark night - I could not even see the dung, much more a countenance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him I came there to ease myself, and had my breeches down at the time. Witness. He told me so - his breeches were unbuttoned, but not down at all - there is a privy seat for a man to ease himself, without going under on the dung.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BLACKMAN. I am an inspector of the Police. I saw this chisel found on the prisoner by Hobbs, on the night of the 2nd of November - I afterwards went and examined Delaney's premises; I found two impressions on the folding shutters, which are inside the window - I fitted this chisel in the impression; it exactly corresponded with it - the piece of the shutter was left at Marlborough-street- it is not here: I fitted the chisel into the impression where the two small hinges of the folding-shutters go - I did not fit it on the piece of wood broken off; it was broken off at the hinges - the part broken off was brought to St. James' watch-house: I myself took off the part of the shutter the hinges were on - the part of the shutter which was broken off was at the hinges, and it exactly fitted the rest of the shutter.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the state of the premises when you went there? A. Part of the shutter had been broken off - I did not fit the chisel to that, but to the part where the hinges go; that part remained fixed to the shutter - the part broken off was taken to the watch-house, and is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fit the chisel to any part that remained at Delaney's house? A. No, only the part that was broken off - it was taken to Marlborough-street, and is not here; it is at Marlborough-street now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I should wish the Jury to see it, for it does not correspond with the chisel, for I am sure it was never out of my pocket - I am certain it does not correspond. Witness. I am certain it did correspond.</p>

            . The piece broken off was where the screws go into; it was at the watch-house with the other part, which was taken there - the chisel was not fitted into the part that was broken off, but to the part below that- I was not present when Blackman fitted the chisel; I saw the part of the shutter at Marlborough-street, and at St. James' watch-house; it was a part of the shutter which was broken off - there were two pieces of the shutter at St. James' watch-house, one which I found broken off, and another which I saw the chisel fitted to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am not satisfied about the shutter - he says it was broken off at the hinges and down the middle; if I broke it at the middle, what should I break it down the middle for? it was not done with that chisel - if I had used the chisel I could have made away with it while he went for the light: if I had done wrong with it I would not have had it about my person.</p>
               <p>The prisoner then handed in a written Defence, as follows: I declare my innocence in the presence of God. Three days before I was apprehended I came from Watford, of which place I am a native, and served my time as a carpenter - I came to London to endeavour to procure employment, but got only a few days work at times. On the evening preceding the day mentioned in the indictment I went to the Theatre - on my return, I promiscously fell in with two females, and went to different public-houses, till my money was exhausted, and they left me; I was taken ill in my inside, and being intoxicated, went down this yard to ease myself; I was very drowsy, and am unconscious of how long I had been there. Having nothing but a chisel in my possession, I leave it to the Court to say whether I could be guilty of such a charge, and not conceiving I was committing any thing illegal in having such an implement in my possession.</p>

On the 11th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I heard the shop window break; it was whole before, and not cracked- I ran out, and saw the prisoner running down the street; I followed him, calling Stop thief! up Circus-street, into Nelson's-place, and never lost sight of him, except while he turned the corner, and saw him again directly I turned- he stopped running, began to walk, and turned back the same way as he had run; I went up to him, and collared him - I told him I wanted him; he said, "Me! I ayn't the man that robbed you" - I said he must go back with me to Mr. Wissett's; he went back, and I left him in the shop with Mr. Wissett - Knowles, an officer, was sent for: I went out to see what was stolen, and found a gold watch was gone; a handkerchief was in the window, which he had broken the window with; it did not belong to us - I had seen the watch safe a few minutes before, in the window, close to the broken pane - the window was whole on this day; the watch was my master's: the prisoner was running when I went out.</p>

               <p>ROBERT KNOWLES. I was a Police-man at the time in question, but have now left for a better situation. On the 11th of November, at half-past five o'clock, I was on duty in Seymour-place, and saw a parcel of people round Mr. Wissett's window, and walked up; Mr. Wissett was there- the prisoner was brought up by Metcalf in custody; Mr. Wissett gave him in charge - I followed him into the shop, and searched him; I felt in his trousers pocket, and found a gold watch - I then took him to the station-house in Harcourt-street, Marylebone; I asked how he came by the watch - he said a man going down the street said to him, "Here, d-n it, take it;" I had not said it would be better or worse for him to confess - I produce the watch.</p>

             BAILEY. I am the prosecutor's wife; his statement is correct: nobody but the prisoner had access to the house - the box was locked safe; I had seen it half an hour before - the purse has not been found; it was a red net one - the notes were at one end of it, and the gold at the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are not the lodgers frequently in the parlour? A. The lodger is a respectable old lady, and was not in the room for three hours before.</p>
               <p>MARGARET HERBURT. The prisoner came about half-past eight o'clock on the morning of the 30th, to my house in Bull-yard, Broad-street, Bloomsbury; she said she had just left her place, and wanted a room for her clothes - I had a room to let; I saw her with a red net purse, with gold at one end of it, and some paper at the other end - she gave me a sovereign out of it to change.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Newman, a linen-draper, of Little Russell-street. On Friday, the 30th of October, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner bought some articles, amounting to between 3l. and 4l., and paid for them in gold; I saw her with a red net purse, with some paper in it, but cannot say they were notes - she tendered me a 5l. note before she gave me the gold, but I would not take it.</p>
               <p>MR. BAILEY. I got one of the notes from Bristol - here it is.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was my back turned towards you before I ran away? A. Yes - you looked up at the window when you shut the door, and when you looked round, I could see your face - you turned down about five doors off.</p>

             POWELL. I produce a copy of the record of the conviction of Mary Conway, at the October Middlesex Session, 1826; I examined it with the original record, in the office of the clerk of the peace for Middlesex - it is a true copy (read).</p>
               <p>GEORGE BRAND. I was principal turnkey of the House of Correction, Clerkenwell. I had the prisoner in my custody as a common utterer of counterfeit coin; she was convicted in October, 1826 - her sentence was one years' imprisonment, and to find sureties for two years to come; I was in Court when she was tried and convicted.</p>

On Friday, the 27th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at our house - she came and asked for 1d. worth of gin: she gave me a shilling - I gave her a sixpence, 5d., and the gin; I put the shilling into my pocket, where I had two good shillings, and five sixpences, but no other change - a very short time after on that evening, she came in again, and asked for a 1d. worth of gin, and paid me another shilling; I served her, and gave her change - she took the gin and went out; I put the shilling into the same pocket - I saw her at the house again in a very little time, on the same evening; she had another 1d. worth of gin, and gave me a shilling - I gave her change, and put the shilling into my pocket; she came again the same night, a very little time after, and asked for 2d. worth of gin, and gave me another shilling - I gave her change, and put the shilling into the same pocket; I saw her again the same evening - she came and had another 1d. worth of gin, and gave me another shilling; I gave her change, and put the shilling into my pocket - she came again the same evening, almost tipsy, and asked for 2d. worth of gin, which I gave her; she offered me a shilling - I did not give her the change, but rang the bell for Blackburn, my servant, who came and said it was a bad shilling; I sent her over the way to get change for it, as I differed from her - she returned, an officer came in after her, and took the prisoner into custody; I took the five shillings out of my pocket, with two good ones, which I had before, and gave them to my servant, because my husband should not know it; I took all the shillings out of my pocket - I had five bad, and two good ones; I gave the five bad ones to Blackburn - I had received no other shilling between the time the prisoner first came, and my giving them to Blackburn, except what I received from the prisoner; the officer had taken her away when I gave them to Blackburn - I did not put the last shilling into my pocket, but gave it to Blackburn, and have not had it since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner.

She paid me five, and was stopped with the sixth; she drank the gin in the house each time - it was last Friday week.</p>
               <p>MARY BLACKBURN. I am Mrs. Brand's servant. I received a shilling from her last Friday week, about six o'clock in the evening; she told me to go and get change for it - I looked at it, and said it was bad; I shewed it to a young man named John Blackburn, who was in the taproom - he gave me back the same shilling, and I went over to the butcher's shop with it; the butcher took it in his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030008"/>hand, looked at it, and said it was bad - he returned it to me; I kept it in my hand - it was not out of my sight, and is the same as I gave the butcher; as I returned home, I met the Police-man, Walters - I kept the shilling in my hand till I came to mistress' house, and then gave it to the Police-man; I received five more shillings from Mrs. Davis, a quarter of an hour after - she told me to put them into my pocket, that her husband should not see them; I put them into my pocket, and Walters came again - I took them out, marked them, and gave them to him; I had nothing else in my pocket, but a few halfpence.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WALTERS. I am a Police-constable. On the 27th of November, I met Blackburn, about six o'clock in the evening - she said something; I followed her into the Three Compasses - she gave me a shilling, and said the prisoner, who stood there, had endeavoured to pass it; I produce the shilling - I examined it, and searched the prisoner - she was very willing to be searched; I found nothing of any consequence on her - I took the prisoner home, and searched her at home; I left her in the next room to the one she said she occupied, as she was so intoxicated - I went back to Davis, and Blackburn gave me five more shillings, which I have kept ever since, and produce; I then went back to the prisoner's room, and found her in bed in her own room - she was much more sober then; I searched the room, but found nothing - I made her dress herself, took her to the watch-house, and on the way there, I told her it would be better for her to confess; when I took her to her room she was very much intoxicated - that was about six o'clock - she got sober about ten, when I took her again; I was detained some time at Davis', and was looking for another party.</p>

On the night of the 28th of November I was with the prosecutor at the Crown and Shuttle, in Shoreditch, which is kept by Mr. Turner; I went in a little after nine o'clock - the prosecutor came about ten: we remained there till past twelve - he drank pretty freely; he was sober when he came in: I was not exactly sober, nor quite drunk - he went away between twelve and one o'clock; I went outside the passage, and asked if he would go to bed with me, as I thought him too drunk to go home; I lodged that night at Mr. Turner's - the prosecutor then said he would go home, as he could get in at his father's at any hour; he then went away, and I did not hear of any thing happening till Monday night. I know Cock-lane - I suppose it is five hundred yards from Mr. Turner's; the streets about there are very narrow, and I believe some of them are winding streets- I saw nothing of the prisoners, and did not notice whether the prosecutor had a watch or not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Dixey. I found the hat as I have described, and there were other persons about. Withness. I saw no persons but the prisoners, the prosecutor, and the officers.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MILLS. I was at the Ship a little after two o'clock, and there searched the prosecutor - he had no watch; he was feeling his thigh - I thought he had lost his watch, and soon after he said, "I have lost my watch;" he described it in my hearing, but I forget the name he mentioned - he said the name of the place was on it: he kept rubbing the side of his head, like a man in pain - I did not see any blood, nor I did put my hand to feel if it was inflamed - he was very tipsy.</p>


               <p>Dixey's Defence. As I was going home from the Jane Shore I picked up this hat in crossing the road, as any other person might have done; I did not know how it came there - there were two or three men on the other side of the way, with great coats on, and one of them hit me in the neck - I walked on; I did not know how the hat came there - I did not pick it up with an intention of stealing, nor know the person it came from, or I should have given it to them.</p>

The prisoner came backwards and forwards to my house; she came between eleven and twelve o'clock on Tuesday night, the 10th of November, with a gold watch - she said she was in great distress; that she had taken a female with her from Mrs. Conquest's - that female had gone to Paris, and robbed her of every thing; she asked me to lend her some money on the watch, which she said was bought of Mr. Norman, in Princes-street, by Mrs. Conway, who was her landlady, before she went to Sparrow's and lived in Lisle-street - she said she had money to pay Mr. Wright, for a free admission, and wanted 5l. or 6l. on it; I lent her half a sovereign and 10s., and said in the morning I would lend her the rest, as I had nothing but a 10l. note - she left the watch; I gave it to Mary. my servant - she came next morning, and I advanced her 5l. more; she said she would be sure to fetch the watch when her friend came - I sent the watch to Mrs. Conway, in consequence of what I heard.</p>
               <p>SARAH ISRAEL. I am Joseph's niece, and live with her.

On the 17th of November, about a quarter-past seven o'clock in the morning, I went out, leaving my wife in the back room, and the door wide open; there are four rooms on the grounds floor - the windows were all shut down; I returned about a quarter-past eight, and found the door locked - I opened it with the key, and on entering, found the kitchen door shut, which had been left open - the blind of the kitchen window was drawn half way down; it was quite down when I left - my wife returned about nine o'clock; she came into the kitchen, and went into the dairy - we had breakfast directly, and I went into the cow-house; my wife went up to our bedroom after breakfast, and gave an alarm - I then went up, found the drawers pulled out, and things scattered about; I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which have not been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you go all ever the house before you went out at seven o'clock? A.I went into all the rooms up stairs; I was in the bed-room- I met my wife while I was out, and got the key from her; we might be half an hour at breakfast - I did not leave the street-door open when I came in; I do not recollect seeing any body in the street when I came home.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH WRIGHT. I left home at half-past seven o'clock; I locked the door, and pulled the blind down all the way - the door and windows were all safe; I returned at a quarter to nine - my husband was then at home; I had met him, and given him the key - I went up stairs after breakfast, and found a half-pint blue bason (which is not ours) by the wash-hand stand; I found the drawers out, every place rummaged, and all the things about the room, and missed the property stated, all of which I had left safe when I went out, and shut a great dog in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your husband went out first? A. Yes; he left me in the dairy - I believe the door was shut; I left a quarter of an hour after him - I fastened the door myself; I do not suppose the window had been opened, though the blind had been altered - it was half an hour before we discovered the robbery; I had let nobody into the house during that time - the basin I suppose had been brought, supposing we were at home; it was impossible for any body to have got in at the door before I left, without my seeing them, as the door of the place I was in was not shut; it joins the passage - the passage comes into it.</p>

            . I live about a minute's walk from Wright's house. On 19th of November I went out, about half past seven o'clock, to fetch some coffee; I did not go by Wright's, but the other way, into the King's-road - I met the prisoner and two others; I did not know him, but saw him again, with a bundle under his arm, a few minutes after I returned home - he passed my window, as I was throwing some water out; I first met them going towards Wright's, about three minutes walk from it - they had no bundle then; Wright's place has no thorough fare - after I had been in doors a few minutes, I saw two of them go by, the prisoner having a large bundle under his right arm - they were going towards King's-road, in a direction from Wright's house; this was about five minutes to eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you sure the prisoner is the man? A. Yes, quite; I did swear to another man at the office, who was discharged - he proved he was at another place at the time; I did not swear he had the bundle - he followed the prisoner up the ground; he had a man and a boy with him - the man I swore to was before him when I met them; whether he was with them the second time, I cannot say, but there was a man going round the corner; the bundle was in a handkerchief, and appeared to contain wearing apparel.</p>

On the 19th of November, about half-past seven o'clock, I went down Cook's-gardens a short distance, but was not in sight of Wright's house; I went along King's-road, and saw the prisoner - I had never seen him before, but particularly observed his lameness, and am sure it was him; he was coming in a direction for Cook's-ground - the church clock struck eight as he passed me; he had a very large bundle under his right arm, tied in a large cotton handkerchief - he was alone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Beesley? A. Not till afterwards; she had a halfpenny worth of milk of me- she said nothing to me about this - I heard her swear to one Nicholson at the office; she said she thought he was the person - I cannot say whether she swore positively to him; she did to the prisoner. <rs id="t18291203-11-verdict61" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>PHILIP CASENOVE. I am a stock-broker. On the 13th of November, about two o'clock in the day, I met the prisoner coming down the stairs of our office in Broad-street, with a cloak under his arm, rolled up: the stairs lead to several offices - he was walking with a little boy in his hand; I asked what he wanted there - he said he had brought the boy to a gentleman there, whom he could not find: I asked whose boy it was, and why he brought him there; he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030012"/>he had him in charge from another gentleman, who he did not know - I asked the boy if that was the case; he said No, that he knew nothing of the prisoner - that he was going to school by way of Houndsditch, and the prisoner had invited him away, promising him a bird if he would come with him, and that the birds were to be caught with the cloak which the boy had on; the prisoner heard most of this - I said that was a very bad account, and gave him in charge: he had the cloak under his arm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Where did this conservation take place? A.Partly in the street, and partly on the stairs; he must have heard it, but as several persons were talking he might not hear the whole - he got into the street before I stopped him: I saw him first on the stairs, walking quietly, not attempting to escape.</p>

            . I was going to school in Devonshire-street, to Mr. Cutler's - the prisoner came and asked if I would have a live bird - I said Yes; he took hold of my hand, took me to No. 7, Old Broad-street, and said he must have my cloak to catch them - he took it off my shoulder up stairs in the house; I was coming down when I met Mr. Casenove; he had wrapped the cloak up under his arm - I believe he folded it up up stairs; I had never seen him before - I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is your school from home? A.About half a quarter of a mile; I go alone - he wrapped the cloak up before he got into the street; I met Mr. Casenove first in the street - I did not see him on the stairs; the prisoner never tried to run away.</p>
               <p>MR. CASENOVE. I first met the prisoner on the stairs; part of the conversation was on the stairs - I followed him into the street, where the rest of the conversation took place- I first saw him at the bottom of the stairs, just as he was going out; he was on the stairs, and I was not - he had hold of the child's hand.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then the child must have heard you addressing the prisoner on the stairs? A. Yes - it was not in the street he first saw me; the child is mistaken about that - when I met him he was on the bottom stair, which comes into a small passage leading to the street.</p>

               <p>GEORGE MORGAN. I am an officer. I took the prisoner in charge, and asked his name, which he would not tell me, saying he did not wish his friends to know any thing about it, and he cried.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was no conversation in the house with the gentleman.</p>

On the 27th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in, and asked for a pair of black kid gloves - I was behind some calicoes in the window, and the moment the lad turned round to get the gloves, I saw the prisoner take a piece of ribbon off the counter, and put it into his bag - he did not offer to buy it; I came out, and secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who was in the shop besides you? A. We have about five shopmen; it is a large shop - I believe he was the only customer; I never prosecuted any body before - I have not seen his father - I do not know what the other shopmen were doing- I am certain the ribbon did not drop off the counter; there is a bar to prevent that.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

The prisoner came to lodge at the house on the 28th of September - I lost my coat on the 30th; I apprehended him on the 6th of November, at Pimlico and told him he was the person who stole my coat- he said he did not steal it; that it was given to him by my wife to pawn, and he pawned it for 1l.; he is a jobbing man.</p>
               <p>MARTHA BATHO. I missed my husband's coat from the room; the prisoner left the house at the same time, without notice - he was only with us two nights; I never gave him leave to pawn the coat - I left him in the room, and went into the yard, returned in a few minutes, and he was gone; I missed the coat next morning - nobody had been there but him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not come and ask you to lend me 1l.? A. It is quite false; I said nothing about not wishing my husband to know it - it is false.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had obtained the coat from the prosecutrix through a false representation, but not feloniously.</p>

On the 18th of November the prisoner came to my shop, about half-past two o'clock, and asked if I had any small pieces of silver to sell - in about twenty minutes I went into the shop, and saw him lying on the counter; he had got my glass-case open, and this watch, which was hanging in the window, was in his hand - I sprung upon him, and secured him with it in his hand; he did not say any thing, but attempted to get away.</p>

               <p>MR. DAVID SOLOMONS. I live in York-buildings, Regent's-park. On the 19th of November my footman requesting a morning's holyday, I desired the coachman to get a man togo with the carriage into the City; he got the prisoner, and he went with the carriage into the city - Mrs. Solomons went into the City, and made a purchase at some shop in going along; I did not go with the carriage, and Mrs. Solomons is not here, but when she returned I heard the purse had been lost, and there was reason to suspect the prisoner - I asked him about it; he denied it: I urged him to give it up, and save further trouble - he still denied it - I sent for a Police-constable, and it was found on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked if I had the purse, and said if I would confess he would forgive me - I said I would speak to him in another room; he said, "I will speak to you here." Witness. There was nothing passed like what he has stated; I merely asked if he had the purse - he denied having it.</p>
               <p>JOHN MARTIN. I am a Police-constable. I was on duty, and was called in; the prosecutor accused the prisoner of stealing the purse - he denied it several times to him, and to me; I was going to search him, and he said to the prosecutor, "If you will step into the parlour I will speak to you;" I said he should not go out of my sight - he then said, "Have mercy - I have the purse," and gave it up - he had it in his boot; the money was out of the purse; he gave that into my hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been out of employ eight months, and have been very much embarrassed - I picked up the purse on the ground, and did not know it belonged to Mrs. Solomons; when I had denied it once, I certainly did deny it till Mr. Solomons said he would forgive me.</p>

               <p>JOHN HARBOROW. I am a brace-maker. I made these two pairs of braces for Mr. Baker, I have no doubt; this pair I can particularly speak to, because they are a sort of leather which is not generally used - I think they have been made since September twelve months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you not supply Mr. Hunt, Mr. Field, and others? and if a number were to be kept separate, and they got mixed, could you select them? A. I could select this pair; I have bought articles of the prisoner to be used in brace making.</p>

On the 18th of November I was going home at half-past eleven o'clock at night - I saw some persons round the watch-house - a man said his wife was in there, and he could not get to see her; I said I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030017"/>an old parishioner, and I dared say I could get him in - I knocked at the door, got in, and was immediately seized and locked down stairs in the cell, without being asked how I got there - when I got in to the cell I saw the prisoner and four or five others; before I had been there two minutes the prisoner knocked my hat off - I said to him,"Don't ill use me, I don't interrupt you, let me sit quiet;" he said, "You be d-d, you are one of us" - I got my hat again, and in two minutes he knocked it off again; I said, "Don't ill-use me, I am a gentleman" - he said,"What money have you got about you?" I said, "I have three sixpences in silver" - he said, "Give me that," and I gave it to him, because I was afraid I should be ill-used; the other persons who were there sat very quiet - I was not particularly afraid of the prisoner, but I wished to sit quiet- I had sent for bail, as I wished to go home to my family; I called out to Mr. Baker that I had been ill-used, and the prisoner came up again, knocked my hat over my eyes, bruised my nose, and stole my seal, key, and rings from my person - it was a violent blow on my hat, and the snatch was at my watch; I felt the things taken - when the door was opened I told the officer I had been robbed by the prisoner; he was searched, and the property was found on him - I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was quite tipsy - he was there before me. Witness. I was not tipsy - he was there when I went down stairs; I do not know whether he was tipsy - I was not; I had not drank more than six glasses of wine.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOND. I am a serjeant of the Police. I was at the watch-house - there was a great disturbance at the door, with a man whose wife had been locked up; the prosecutor came to the door, and attempted to get in - some of our people were ordered to go and clear the people away; the prosecutor was brought in, and charged by them with an assault and making a disturbance - those persons are not here; the name of one of them was Oliver- I do not know the other's name; he was not under my command - the prosecutor was put down on a charge of assault and disturbance outside the watch-house; the prisoner was there before, charged with assaulting his master, who is a publican, and making a disturbance - the prosecutor called through the bars that he had been robbed; Mr. Baker went down, and the prosecutor pointed out the prisoner, who was tipsy - I cannot say the prosecutor was sober; he had been drinking, but was not so far gone but he recollected what he was about - he charged the prisoner with robbing him of his seal, key and rings; I asked the prisoner if he had them - he said No, he had not; I am positive of that - he had heard the charge, and said he had neither taken them, nor had he got them; I commenced searching him - I took off his jacket, waistcoat and shirt; I found nothing in them - I told him to put them on again, and to pull off his trousers; as he pulled them off I heard something jingle - I felt something in the lining at the bottom of the trousers; I took my knife, and opened it - I found this key, seal and ring: each of his trousers pockets had holes in them and would not hold any thing - it would go down between the lining and the trousers; he said they must have been put there by some one, and that he knew nothing about them - I found this part of a ring under the seat where the prisoner had been sitting, and the other part was in his trousers.</p>

               <p>MR. LATCHFORD. This is my property - I had not drank more than I have stated; I was very unwell - I knocked at the watch-house door when the man said his wife was locked up, and he could not get in - when the door was opened I was laid hold of, and taken down; I told Mr. Roe the circumstance as it occured - I have lived twenty-five years in the parish; I heard no charge made against me, and I know of no name being entered in the book.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOND. The charge was entered and produced before the Magistrate - it was regularly entered; the inspector received it - I was present, and I locked up the prosecutor: they were discharged on paying 1s., the prosecutor and the man who was with him.</p>
               <p>MR. LATCHFORD. I was not taken before the inspector, and had no man with me at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drinking at my master's, and became quite insensible - I made a disturbance, and my master sent me to the watch-house; when I got there I fell on the form, and went to sleep - the officer came to search the place, and shook me; he said I was to get up, and be searched - I got up, and the things were found on me, but I know no more of them than a child.</p>
               <p>JOHN LATCHFORD re-examined. I should think there were half a dozen persons in the cell - it is but small; I have served the office of constable in the parish - it was about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>MR. HENCHAF. I am a publicar. The prisoner lived with me as pot-boy, and behaved well, but on the day in question he got so drunk I was obliged to put him into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WOODWARD. I am a Thames Police-officer. I have known the prisoner between three and four months - I was at his master's on the night in question; he would not be persuaded to go to bed, and he was forced to be dragged to the watch-house by a Police-officer - that was about eleven or half-past eleven o'clock.</p>

            . I live in Somersetshire, but I was staying at a house in Park-street. On the 11th of November, I had dined with a Mr. Saunders, and left his house about half-past eleven o'clock at night; I called a coach in St. Giles - I had eleven sovereigns, and two or three shillings in my pocket; I had a pair of silver spectacles in my waistcoat pocket - I told the driver, to drive to St. James'-street; I had drank pretty freely, and told the coachman I was intoxicated - he took me to <placeName id="t18291203-36-crimeloc195">Leicester-square</placeName>

               <p>COURT. Q.Can you say whether the prisoner was in the coach? A. I could not say whether any one was with me in the coach - I am certain my money was secure when I got into the coach.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you recollect being in Soho-square? A. I certainly was not; I had no female with me - I gave nobody money for particular purposes; I was not holding my hat in my hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. One of the females said, "You have not given me any money;" you felt your pocket, dropped your spectacles, and said, to me "You seem a respectable man, I wish you would see me home, and call a coach;" and I did. Witness; I deny it all - I called the coach myself; I had a watch, but I was not in Soho-square - I told the coachman to drive to where I stated; I do not know that it was in the way to go through Leicester-square - I did not propose to stop the coach, and say I would take you to an oyster-shop, and treat you; you were a stranger to me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did I not in Leicester-square offer to pay the coach, and then found I had no silver; the coachman said we were both strangers, and he wished us to have another coach - I said I would go to Mr. Percy's, and get change; the coachman was not satisfied with that, and I gave my watch, as security, and you asked me to go and have an oyster with you. Witness. I asked the coachman the fare, and he said 1s. - I put my hand into my pocket, missed my money, and took you by the collar; you could not have escaped while the officer was called - I have to regret I was asleep, or I should have put you or any man out of the window, who had come into the coach without my consent.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SAUNDERS. I am a portrait painter, and live in Edward-street, Portman-square; the prosecutor dined with me on the day in question - he left my house a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, and was drunk.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GREEN. I am a hackney coachman. On the morning of the 11th of November I was near St. Giles', at the end of Oxford-street, and took the prosecutor into my coach - he was very drunk; the prisoner was with him - the prosecutor told me to drive to St. James'-street; he said, "I am very drunk;" I said, "It is a dull heart that never rejoices;" I asked the prisoner if he knew the gentleman - he said Yes, and that he was going with him - he ordered me to go to Leicester-square; when I got to Leicester-place, the prisoner told me to turn to the left - I did so, and he told me to stop on the stand, and said, "D-n you, can't you hear?" I said, "I am on the stand;" I got down, went to the door, and to the best of my belief, by the voice, the prosecutor said, "Draw to the pavement;" I did so - the prisoner got out first, and the prosecutor next; I am sure the prisoner got in, and got out - the prosecutor asked the fare; I said 1s. - he put his hand to his waistcoat pockets, then in his trousers pockets, and said he had no money; the prisoner said, "Never mind, I will pay the coachman - you stop there;" he then took the prosecutor's arm, and said, "We will go and eat some oysters;" I said, "A shilling, is a shilling to me, and I don't know you;" the prisoner again said, "You stop there," and he gave me his watch to hold - they walked forward; I followed them for thirty or forty yards - the prosecutor then said he had been robbed by the prisoner or me - he laid hold of the prisoner; I said I will call the Police, which I did, and Slark came - I told him the number of my chariot; he said he was going to St. James' watch-house, and I followed them to the Quadrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your chariot when you were called? A. I was coming home down Oxford-street, near St. Giles' - I was coming to Eagle-street, where I live; the prosecutor and prisoner were standing together.</p>

            . I am a serjeant of the Police, and am stationed in St. Martin's-street. I was called, and took the prisoner in Leicester-square; the prosecutor charged him with taking eleven sovereigns from him, but mentioned nothing else at that time: I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and found on him nine sovereigns and these silver spectacles - I saw the prosecutor the next day, and he mentioned about his spectacles to the other officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did I object to go with you? A. Yes; you wanted to go to a public-house - the prosecutor was very tipsy; I took hold of the prisoner's arm - he could not have thrown away the spectacles without my seeing him; I do not know whether he had time to have thrown them away before I came - I held him part of the way, when I saw he wanted to shuffle away; Bond and I searched him together - three sovereigns and the spectacles were found in his coat pocket behind.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You say you know him as a hackney-coachman? A. Yes, for two or three years; it is usual for coachmen to sit on their boxes while the waterman puts the passengers' luggage in.</p>

I heard a coach running, a little after five o'clock, in Hanover-square; it attracted my notice, as it was going as rapidly as the road would allow- I went to a private watchman in Hanover-street, who was just beginning to cry five o'clock; we walked up the street, up Regent-street, and into Hanover-square again- we stopped talking; I heard the coach again, and saw the prisoner and another man on the box - I thought the other man seemed rather fresh, and I had some suspicion; I followed the coach, and saw a young man run across the square towards it - it went up Hanover-street, up Regent-street, and down Argyle-street, and there I saw the young man join in company with another; they went on to Poland-street, and then I lost sight of the coach in the fog - I ran up Poland-street, and got sight of the coach, and saw the other man get off the box; the two young men came up to the side of the coach, and another man with a white jacket or waistcoat, opened the coach door, and went in - a man with a dark jacket came out of the coach, and shut the door; the man who had got off the box wished the coachman good night - I said Halloo! and ran up to take the number of the coach; I cannot say whether the coachman heard me, but he went on - I laid hold of the handle of the coach door, and it went on to the end of Poland-street; I kept calling all the way Stop! Stop! Stop! as loud as I could - I then let go handle, made a spring, got hold of the trace, and one of the horses slipped; I put my foot on the box - the coachman then stopped; I got down to take the men on the pavement, but they were gone - I then went to take the man in the coach, but he was gone; I made an alarm, and two of my partners came up - the coachman said two men came and called him, and said he need not get off the box; these two boxes were in the coach. <rs id="t18291203-39-verdict209" type="verdictDescription">

I saw the prisoner take the cloak from his shop, about six o'clock in the evening of the 14th of November - he ran away, and another with him; the prosecutor sent the Police-man after him - I am quite sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A. No - it was dark, but there were four or five gas-lights in the window; a person could take the cloak without going in, by putting in their hand- I did not see him for more than a minute - there was another waiting for him; I saw them together - the other went in, and the prisoner took it.</p>

               <p>CHARLES CLIFT. I keep this shop - I heard a rustling at my door, and ran out; a boy told me a man had taken it - I ran a few paces, saw a Police-man, and told him; he brought it back, with the prisoner - this is it.</p>
               <p>EDWARD DRURY. I am a Police-officer. I received notice, and pursued in the direction; I saw the prisoner and another crossing to the other side of the street - I followed them; they looked, and saw me coming - they ran, and dropped the cloak; I took it up, and still pursued till the prisoner was apprehended - they were so near together I cannot say which dropped it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had they turned any corners? A. They turned one, but it was very wide; the lamps had been lighted - the other person was rather taller than him; there was no alarm, but what I made myself when they dropped the cloak - I was some distance from the shop when I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM RICH. I am a Police-constable. I was on duty in King-street, Seven-dials, about eight o'clock in the evening, on the 24th of November - I saw the prisoner coming through the street; I suspected, and followed him to Drury-lane - I there stopped him, and found on him twenty-three pairs of patent brass hinges; he said he was going to Field-lane, but he would not tell me where he got them from - I took him to the watch-house, and the next morning found the owner; the prisoner had three pairs in his hat, some in his right-hand pockets, and some in his left-hand pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to say he did not tell you where he got them as soon as you asked him? A.No; he said at the watch-house that he found them in a court in Crown-street; he told me he was going to Field-lane, and in going along the street he said if I liked to go with him, I should see where he was going to; he said at the watch-house he would go back to the place, but he did not tell me where it was - our inspector and two or three more were there at the time; there was a man with me when I took him - the prisoner said he got them in a court, and when I locked him up I went there, but there was no such thing, nor had any person seen any; he was coming from Crown-court, towards Field-lane, when I took him - I believe there is a shop in Field-lane where they buy such things.</p>

On the evening of the 5th of November I saw some one come and take hold of the handkerchief, and give it a sudden jerk - I thought it was some one going to buy it; I was going round the counter, but he got out, and by the time I got to the door the prisoner had got about six yards off; I overtook him- he was walking fast, and I saw him whisping a handkerchief up, and putting it into his coat; I brought him back, and when I got him about half way he dropped it at his feet; I saw it fall, and at my request a child took it up- I took the prisoner back to the shop, and sent for an officer; while the officer was sent for he said, "I beg your pardon."</p>
               <p>GEORGE LAZARUS. I am a patrol. I went to the shop about seven o'clock, and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROBINSON. I produce the handkerchief, which I got from Dean; I saw Lazarus - there was a great mob round - Lazarus said he was afraid to take the prisoner out, and I assisted.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going by, and he laid hold of me - the handkerchief laid on the ground; he said he saw me drop it, which I did not, and I had no coat on.</p>

               <p>MR. FAIRBAIRN. These prints are mine; these three belonged to a work in the shop, which was waiting for the index - they are illustrations of Bowyer's History of England, and these others belong to the Florence Gallery; I had seen them a day or two before, and urged the prisoner to move them to another part of the shop, as the wet had come in - this book and portfolio we had not seen, as the prisoner had done them when we were out of the shop; I know this marble paper and the Morocco, which correspond with my materials; this pasteboard I had had in use, and here are some marks of glue on it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Fairbairn has sworn falsely to many of the articles. and so has the witness; the box was not locked, and the prints were on the table - this paper and board may be bought at any stationer's in London; the prints are common enough, and the fillet is lent to many binders.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Flint. Q. Was I not lying on the table? A. No, he was standing by the fire - Binglow and Comerford were sitting down; I cannot say which of them pinched me.</p>

I came down, and saw Flint lying in the passage, and two officers trying to handcuff him - Bicknell then asked where his hat and the parcel were; he went into the room, and the parcel was gone - I had seen Evans go towards the yard with a parcel; we went and found it over the wall of the next house.</p>

            . I am porter at the Ship. I saw the two male prisoners and the prosecutor at our house, about three o'clock that day; I heard the prosecutor say he had lost his parcel - the prisoners and the other man went out the back way; I went and told the Police.</p>

I had nothing to do with the articles - I was going to my mother-in-law, and knowing Evans I called upon her; I went into her room, and asked if she would have any thing to drink - I sent for something: I own I had been drinking with the prosecutor, and was rather intoxicated; I laid my head on the table, and when the officer came in, I was roused up with the parcel in my pocket, but I do not know how it got there.</p>

On the 9th of November I dined at Merchant Tailors'-hall; I looked at my watch as I left, and it was half-past twelve o'clock - I had sat down to dinner about six, and drank about my ordinary allowance of wine; one is a little more gay with liquor than when dining alone, but I was perfectly sober: I was accompanied from the hall by my brother, Mr. Loveday, Pope, Mott, and a young man called Frederick, who is clerk to Mr. Leplastria; Pope and I had dined at the hall - the rest were invited to the dessert, and all left together; my brother, Frederick, and Mott quitted us - Loveday left me soon after, and I remained to speak to Mr. Pope; we talked about the pleasant evening we had passed - when Mr. Loveday was twenty-five or thirty steps before us, I perceived a man assault him, and went to his assistance; the instant I was going to his assistance, the same man came to me, and struck me in the lower part of my belly; I will not positively swear it was the same man, but believe so - I felt stifled with the blow, and at the same moment the man who struck me seized the chain of my watch; the end of the chain being appended to my waistcoat button, I attempted to get hold of the chain with my left hand, but could not - I passed the middle finger of my right hand into the button-hole of the man's coat; while I was holding him and struggling with him, another man arrived, and struck me on the head with something which he had in his hand, but what it was I do not know - I fell down from that blow, perfectly senseless, and think I brought the other man down with me; I recollect that the skin of my finger was grazed in the struggle - I do not know how long I remained in that state; while on the ground I received a blow on my arm, and one on my head - whether they were from feet or what I cannot say, but I felt them, and revived to a certain extent; I endeavoured to get up, and was taken to the watch-house, where my senses returned - I was sitting down on a little bench near the table - I felt for my handkerchief to wipe the sweat and blood from my face; the first thing I observed was that my watch was gone, and on searching for my handkerchief I discovered that my snuff-box was not in either of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030027"/>pockets; five or six minutes after complaining of the loss of my snuff-box, the hand of somebody passed behind my back, and at the same instant somebody said, "Sir, is this your snuff-box." but this was not till some persons' pockets had been searched, and the contents put upon the table - I had it when I left the hall. I presume my watch was taken when the chain was seized - I did not use my snuff-box after leaving the hall, and cannot say whether it was taken- I think Puttock is the man who seized my chain, but I do not mean to affirm it, and believe he is the man who struck me in the lower part of the belly; it was the same man in whose hand I saw the chain - I think McAdam is the one who struck me in the head, but will not swear it -I saw something shining in his hand as the blow descended - I do not know London sufficiently to state where I was attacked; it was very near the Bank - I had left the hall five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was it not after the prisoners were searched that your snuff-box was given to you? A. Yes - it was about the time they were talking of searching their pockets; it was at that period that it was produced - I do not recollect stating that the pockets of some persons had been searched before: if I did, I beg it may be stated that I mean to swear it was about the time there was a talk of searching their pockets - I do not mean to say the contents of their pockets were on the table: I drank sherry and port, but no claret - I had punch made of wine and water; I was sober when I left the hall - I had no quarrel with any person in the hall - there was a young man who had his sleeve torn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the beadles of the hall obliged to follow you and your party, to keep you quiet in the street? A. There was a quarrel between a young am and Mr. Leduke, and I begged my brother to carry off the young man- I do not recollect the beadles following me; I was two or three minutes in the watch-house before I said I had lost my watch, but I cannot exactly state, as my senses had not perfectly returned - I swear my snuff-box was not in the same pocket as my handkerchief, for when I took out my handkerchief I found it was not there, for I felt for it - that is one of the first things a snuff-taker does; I immediately complained of losing it, and it was passed to my right-hand, and put on the table - I did not see who handed it to me; it was neither of the prisoner, for they were on my left, and it was passed to the right - it was a dark night, but the lamps were lighted; I was knocked down a minute or two after they came up.</p>
               <p>DOUGLAS LOVEDAY. I did not dine at the Merchant Tailors '-hall, but was at the dessert; I left with Mr. D spres - a great many persons came away at the same time, his brother, Mr. Hope, Mr. Mott, and young Frederick; I cannot state the time - I believe I was the cause of their leaving; Mr. Despres appeared to be sober - I was sober; there had been a quarrel and disputes at the hall - Despres was not a party to them; after we left I separated from the party, in two or three minutes, went on alone, and in about two minutes I met two men, who appeared a little in liquor - I do not know who they were; they appeared to be coming from some feast, and having a little wine in their heads, they invited me to go and take some wine with them - I not having had enough, consented, but did not go, for recollecting Mr. Despres was a foreigner, I thought I had better return to him; I went towards him, and when in a part that was pretty well lighted, there came out of a place very ill lighted (called Bartholomew-lane) a man, who without ceremony struck me a blow in the face - I had never seen him before; I felt the blood run from my nose - I returned the blow with my left hand, upon which something like a regular fight took place between him and me: during the struggle my umbrella was broken: the stick of it was a came - finding I was nearly a match for him, he endeavoured to throw me down, and succeeded; I fell undermost, and found my umbrella completely broken, leaving only the came in my hand - I cannot say it was one of the prisoners, but it was the same man who struck me, that afterwards struck the prosecutor; I planted the umbrella on his neck, and said, "You are the better man. but take care," and continued to strike the umbrella on his neck, and he quitted me without my receiving any further injury - this occupied two or three minutes - I then found myself in the custody of somebody, and was taken to the watch-house; the prisoners were there- I cannot say whether they were there before me or after; I think every thing that took place was in their hearing - on going into the watch-house, I inquired whether I was a prisoner or not, and was told I should know presently; Mr. Despres was brought in apparently lifeless, but bleeding from a would in the forehead - he was pale and covered with blood; the officer asked if I knew him - I said he was a friend of mine; I was then told I was complainant - having some sticking-plaster, I 
               <persName id="t18291203-66-person502">drew</persName>
             the lips of his wound together, and bound up his head with my pocket-handkerchief, and washed his face; he appeared better, and then putting his hand to his watch-pocket, said, "But my watch is gone;" the prisoners were both present - he said it was worth about sixty guineas, and putting his hand to his coat-pocket he said, "And my snuff-box is gone also;" he appeared considerably affected at this loss, as he declared he would not have lost the box for 500l. - the officer ordered the prisoners' pockets to be searched; some duplicates were found in them, and a tin box, with "Warren's patent blacking" written on it - there was a red mark on it, which had the appearance of blood; whether before or after the prisoners were searched, I cannot say, but much about that period; some person in the watch-house said, "I wonder whose snuff-box this is?" Despres immediately recognized it - I asked the person in the prisoners hearing where he found it; he said, "On the bench;" it was placed on the table -I asked both the prisoners if they would state which of them had struck me; both denied it - they were taken to the Compter; I believe Puttock to be the man who struck me; I have no other reason for that belief, than that his lips were cut and bleeding at the watch-house; the prisoners are not the persons who asked me to take wine- they were well dressed, and the prisoners meanly; I recollect striking the man in the face, and thought I might have cut his lip, but cannot say.</p>
               <p>JOHN DASHFIELD. I am a watchman of Broad-street ward. On the night of the 9th of November, at half-past one o'clock, I saw McAdam, I believe, strike Mr. Despres a blow on his forehead, it was with his hand, I think, for I saw nothing else - he struck him only once; the blood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030028"/>directly flowed from his head, and I directly took McAdam into custody - I am certain it was him: I had heard a noise and scuffle and went among them - McAdam directly struck the blow, and I took him; I called Howard, my mate, who came to Mr. Despres' assistance - I collared McAdam the moment he struck the blow; there were ten or twelve persons there - I do not know who they were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not at first swear you believed McAdam struck the blow? A. If I did, it was unknown to me; I did not mean to say so - he had nothing in his hand, when I took him; Despres was on his knees- the blow was the first thing I saw; they were about three hurdred yards from Merchant Tailors'-hall - I had called half-past one o'clock; they could not have come straight from the hall, if they left at half-past twelve - I cannot be mistaken in the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was this? A. At the top of Bartholomew-lane; I did not search McAdam.</p>

I was out on the night of the 9th of November, and heard a noise; I went to the top of Bartholomew-lane, being called by Dashfield; when I got up he had McAdam in custody - I went over to Mr. Despres, and saw him laying bleeding; I rose him up; I saw Puttock cross towards the piazza of the Exchange, from the place where the prosecutor lay, and took him in charge - before I took him he used a had expression, and said, "I won't see my friend ill-used;" Lloyd came to my assistance, and we took him, and Mr. Despres to the watch-house - both the prisoners were searched there, but the property was not found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. No watch or any thing was found on them? A. No - they were searched instantly, and both complained that they had been assaulted and ill-used in the street; Puttock said he would not stand by and see his friend ill-used; it had gone half-past one o'clock: what took lace was before I got up - I picked up the snuff-box in the watch-house, alongside Mr. Despres; I suppose it had fallen out of his pocket, as he pulled his handkerchief out; it was on the bench alongside him where he sat - as soon as I picked it up I gave it to Jones, who gave it to the officer of the night: the prisoners had been searched before I picked it up; neither of them could have put the box where I found it - they were quite on the opposite side of the watch-house; one of them said he had two pairs of trousers on, and desired both should be searched.</p>

               <p>JOHN GIRTON. I was officer of the night; when the prisoners were brought to the watch-house it was nearer two o'clock than one; Despres had a cut on his forehead, and Mr. Loveday dressed it - Despres pointed to Puttock, saying he was the man who had struck him; Dashfield said No, it was the short one who struck him - Despres afterwards said it was the short one who struck him; in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes he put his hand to his fob, and said he had lost his watch - he pointed to Puttock, and afterwards to McAdam, and said he was the one who struck him; I immediately searched them - Despres was taking his handkerchief out of his pocket, and after that a snuff-box was found by his side, by Howard, and given to Jones, and by him to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He at first pointed to Puttock, and when Dashfield said it was the little one, he pointed to the little one? A. Yes; he was equally positive of both - he was not exactly asked which struck him, for we could not make him understand, but he pointed to the party; the box was found directly he pulled out his handkerchief - it could not have laid long there without being observed: it was quite away from the prisoners - they could not have put it there; they both complained that they had been assaulted, and had returned the assault.</p>
               <p>Puttock's Defence. I am innocent.</p>

            . I was attending to trim the lamps at Merchant Tailors'-hall on Lord Mayor's Day, and saw Mr. Despres and Loveday; about six more were in their company - they left the hall about one o'clock, and in consequence of something that was said I watched the party along the street; Mr. Despres seemed very drunk, but Mr. Loveday was not so tipsy - the whole seven of them in the hall were tipsy; - Mr. Despres had hold of Mr. Loveday's arm; they stopped in Threadneedle-street, and I saw the two prisoners coming along towards Bartholonew-lane, by the side of the Bank, and by the time they got to the corner of Bartholomew-lane, within a yard, Mr. Loveday and Mr. Despres came up meeting them, and Mr. Despres struck McAdam, and directly one of the prisoners said to Mr. Despres, "You are mistaken;" the prisoners directly pulled off their hats, threw them, into the road, and struck again; there was a scuffle - the watchmen had not come up at that time; they came up very shortly after the scuffle - they stood a minute or two, and interfered at last; I told the watchman the prisoners had been struck and insulted first, and struck again in their own defence - the watchman said then it was his duty to take them; the beadles of the hall came up - they were sober, and so was I - I am certain the prisoners were struck before they touched Despres or Loveday; they got close against the wall to make way for them to pass - McAdam was struck before any blow was given to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time they left the hall till they got to Bartholomew-lane, was their conduct peaceable or otherwise? A. They were fighting. I light the lamps at different halls, and of this Court.</p>

            . I live in Finch-lane, and am ward-officer of Broad-street. I was attending at Merchant Tailors '-hall: I consider that the prosecutor left form half-past one to a quarter to two o'clock - they were decidedly tipsy, all of them; I consider so from their behaviour in the hall -Mr. Loveday was the most sober, but I should not consider him sober: we followed them out; one, who is a livery man was going the wrong way - I tried to put him right, but did not succeed; he was one of this party - I begged him to go his own way; he said he would not, he would go after his friends - I followed at a distance, to see that no quarrel took place in the ward; I saw a scuffle, but no blows - Sheffield was before me, and interrupted my seeing the first of it; I came up after the scuffle, and in consequence of my interference the whole set were taken to the watch-house; after Despres charged the prisoners with assaulting him they replied that they were assaulted first; they were singing and going on in the hall, and in the coffee-room I parted four of them from fighting, but can only swear to one of them, which is Mr. Loveday - I know nothing of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>MR. DESPHES. I wish to ask the witness (Sheffield) if he means to swear we were arm-in-arm.</p>

I swear they were arm-in-arm; Loveday seemed as if he was conducting Despres - they had passed Broad-street, and some of he party had left them, and gone, I believe, up Finch-lane; Despres had hold of Loveday's arm till they got to the corner of Bartholomew-lane - six or seven of them were fighting and quarrelling in Threadneedle-street; Despres and Loveday were among them - he might have hold of his arm for a hundred yards; just as they got by Broad-street Loveday seemed to conduct Despres from the rest - Despres took hold of his arm, and had hold of it when he struck McAdam: there is but one door to Merchant Tailors'-hall; that is the front.</p>

            '-hall in my official capacity, and saw the party to which Loveday and Despres belonged; they came out of the front door of the hall - there is no other; they came out pretty quiet - I let them out of the gate; I followed them soon after - there was a row in the street before they came up, and they got into the midst of it; I saw one gentleman placed up against the wall, as he was so drunk he could not stand - I went to the corner of Broad-street, and stopped there with Price; Sheffield had gone on before him - we observed a scuffle at the corner of Bartholomew-lane; we went up, and saw the watchmen take the whole party to the watch-house - I am sure it was after one o'clock when they left the hall.</p>
               <p>MR. LOVEDAY. I was conducted to the watch-house by a witness here, and he is the only one who had indentified McAdam; it has been suggested that I was a little drunk which was not the case - I quitted Mr. Despres either in Broad-street or Threadneedle-street; we were not arm-in-arm in Bartholomew-lane - I wished them good night, went home, and I did not see Mr. Despres again till he was in the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in the Commercial-road - I know the prisoner very well; she has often been to my shop; here is "A Digest of the Laws of England," the seventh volume of "Lord Coke's Reports" with a name scratched out, but I have no knowledge of that - "Carey's Chancery Reports," and "Proceedings of Conveyancey," by Barton; and the sixth volume of "Vesey's Reports;" I bought them all of the prisoner as waste paper - the covers are on; I bought them at 3d. or 4d. a lb - the books are valueable, but any gentleman in the profession knows we are much exposed in our line; I am a bookseller, but deal in waste-paper.</p>
               <p>Q. In the front of this book the name, which was pasted on it, is torn out, you know nothing of that? A. No; here is an erasure where a coat of arms is usually pasted - I never noticed that before; I bought them as odd volumes, without looking for the names; I think I told her I would buy no more with the covers on - I have no doubt of it, because they would be in a better shape to sell as waste-paper; I knew the sets were valuable - I asked how she came by them: she said they belonged to her son. who was in an attorney's office.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she say she came by "Vesey's Reports." which cost 30l. or 40l.? A. She only brought an odd volume; they are all odd volumes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you been in the trade? A.About twenty-five years; I do not pretend to know the value of law books - I buy them as waste-paper, and sell them as such; I told her I would buy no more with the covers on, as I would rather buy them in the shape of waste-paper - I made no deductions for the covers; I took no notice of the names being erased - I did not examine them inside; I do not know the value of them - I gave her 3d. or 3 1/2d. a lb.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I am very sorry for what I have done - extreme distress occasioned me to do it; Mr. Mann told me to bring them without the covers - he gave me 3d. a lb.; I acknowledged where I took them to directly.</p>

I got acquainted with the prisoner in July; on the 27th of August he asked master to let him have a bed - he said he could not, but he might sleep in the taproom; I told him he might sleep in my room - he went to bed about eleven o'clock; I got up in the morning, leaving him in bed, and my watch under the pillow - he came down in half an hour, and was going out; he said he would he home by two o'clock, and had turned the bed up- I said, "Where is the watch?" he said he had left it inside; I went up in half an hour, and it was gone - nobody but him could have taken it; I believe he is a gamekeeper.</p>
               <p>CHARLES COWLEY. I am a constable. The prisoner was described to me on the 23rd of November, and on the 24th I found him at the Tavistock coffee-house, Great Russell-street, Covent-garden, cleaning knives, and told him he was my prisoner - he said, "I know perfectly well what it is about, a watch."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a setter dog to break in for his master - he lost a very excellent dog for me; the boy left his watch in the bed - I took it, and said to the maid-servant, "He is very careless about his watch; I will wind it up, and take it down to him," and when I got down he had let out two dogs which I had there; I ran out in my fright to look for them, and put the watch into my pocket: when I returned the dogs were safe in the house - I had to go immediately to Bagshot, and forgot the watch; I found it in my pocket at Bagshot - I asked a person to take it to his master; he said if he saw any body he would send word that I had it, and if not he should be there on Sunday - I went to Croydon, and on returning the Magistrate had had a pointer stolen; I was desired to look for it - I came to town about it, went to the Black Dog, Long-acre, and got stupified with liquor - my fob was cut, and the watch and nine sovereigns and a half taken; I saw Mr. Phipps, and asked him for two guineas which he owed me, to make the boy's watch good - he said the boy had lost the dog I had left in his care, and that would make it even; I said, "Tell the boy I will make it good as soon as I can," but I did not call there, in consequence of a quarrel with his master; it was two mornings before, that I said I had left it in the bed.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WILLIAMS. He had no dog there that night- when he came down I was taking the shutters down; he said he should he back at two o'clock, and had left my watch in the bed; I had not desired him to put up the bedstead.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It fell into the cart? A. Yes - whether it fell into the same place as he took it from I cannot say; it was a fine night - he did not get a yard from me before I re-took him: I lost my hold, and he was at liberty - I felt the effects of their violence,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030032"/>but am sure he was not out of my sight, nor out of the reach of my stick, which was in my hand; he was the only person in front of me - those who endeavoured to rescue him appeared thieves; I have seen them lurking about, not in the way a person would on business - three or four of them came near me; none of them were in front of me after the prisoner got away, but were while I held his arm; I never lost sight of him the whole time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure the person you ultimately seized is the person who had the parcel? A. I am - it was the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far did he run when the four persons rushed forward? A. Not out of the reach of the officer's stick; I saw no handkerchief over his face.</p>

On the 7th of November, about a quarter-past twelve o'clock at night, I stopped the prisoner in Rosemary-lane, about five minutes walk from Jewry-street, with this bundle under his arm, and this hat in his hand; I asked where he got them - he said it was a parcel given to him in the Borough, to bring over to Rosemary-lane, but he did not know the party who had given it to him; I am sure he said it was given to him in the Borough - I took him to the watch-house; some men were passing - I asked who gave it to him, and he said, "Those men there," and made a faint call after them- they turned round, but took no notice of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not ask you to stop the people, who were not three yards off? A. He said they gave him the bundle, that is all; I told the Magistrate you said it was given you in the Borough.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He stated quite different to the Magistrate, who was going to discharge me; I met the party coming over the hill - they asked me to carry the parcel, and promised me part of a pint of beer; I pointed them out to him, and he could have put his hand on them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are either of the prosecutors here? A. No; this prosecution certainly is not without their knowledge - they are perfectly acquainted with it; they are the purchasers of the stock - the assigners of White and Metcalf are not interested in it - I only known that Sewell and Cross are the proprietors by what they have told me: there is nothing about the shop, nor in the window to denote that it belongs to them; but their names are sometimes used.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Who put you in possession of that property? A.Sewell and Cross, and I receive a salary from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030033"/>CATHERINE POWELL. I am servant at the house in Lamb's Conduit-street. I am employed by Sewell and Cross. About three weeks ago I was in the carpet-room, and Reid, who was in their employ, gave me a veil; the officers came to the house and took that from me; I was taken into custody, and when we got into the cart I said to Reid, "William, what is all this about? if you know any thing, tell me" - he said, "I am very sorry, Catherine, you should be brought to prison, for you know nothing about it, for while you were out on the Sunday evening, the cook put me into the sitting-room, and took the things, and did not want you to know any thing about it" - I said, "What things?" he mentioned them, and I said, "They are the things I have been asked about;" he said, "You know nothing at all about it" - he said the cook was always teasing him to get her things, and he never had any peace with her - I asked if he had ever taken any thing; he said, Yes, and had given them to a young woman - I said,"What young woman?" - he said, "The Tartan-plaid young woman." Mackay is the cook.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Were you taken into custody? A. Yes; I came from the House of Correction to-day.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TOY. I am assistant to Sewell and Cross. I was desired to watch the movements of Reid - on the 12th of November, at eight o'clock in the morning, I was in Lamb's Conduit-street, and saw Reid talking to Hislop; he left her, went to Sewell and Cross', and in a few minutes returned to Hislop, where he had left her - they walked together down Theobald's-road and Harper-street, went into a public house, came out again in a few minutes, and he gave her a parcel from his pocket; she put it under her cloak, under her left arm - they walked to the bottom of Harper-street, round the corner, returned, and walked to Lamb's Conduit-street - he left her and went to his employers'; I went back and told Watts what I had seen - I did not see where Reid got the parcel from; it was but small.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know his age? A. No: I saw him take something from his lefthand coat-pocket - I will not swear it was not a pocket-handkerchief; I cannot say it was tied up - it was not a bunch of keys; I saw a parcel, it might be a little larger or smaller than my wrist - he had a blue coat on; I was on the opposite side of the way in Harper-street, ten or twelve yards from them - that street is darker than Lamb's Conduit-street; the house is called Navarino-house - we deal in perfumery, carpets, silks, woollens, and linen; I will not swear the parcel was not a pair of dirty stockings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you told the reason of being sent to watch? A. I was told there was a suspicion of my employers being robbed; I swear I saw a parcel taken from Reid's left-hand coat-pocket, and given to Hislop - she had nothing before, because I saw her arms swing; her hands were free, and it would have dropped down; I do not know whether her arms were under her cloak - I think they were not; but I know I saw her arms swinging - I think it was a cloak with armholes in it; I think it was not a close cloak with her arms inside - I think they were outside - I think they did not walk arm-in-arm, they walked close by each other's side; I think they had been together ten minutes before any thing passed from him to her - it was a minute or two after they came out of the public-house; they went half way down the street, and then he gave it her - I did not interfere at the time, because I had no strong suspicion before that; I was told to watch them - I thought the transaction would be sufficient to convey to Mr. Watts: they separated in Theobald's-road - I had seen Hislop one morning before, when she came to the door and asked for

            , but he was not within; I think I spoke to her that night, after she separated from Reid, just after she went into an oyster-shop, at the bottom of King's-road - I asked where she was going; I wanted to see what she had got, but I could not see any thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know what the words were you said to her at the oyster-shop? A. I do not know exactly; I do not think they had seen me before, for I turned my face as they came up the street.</p>

            , at their house in Compton-street. About six o'clock in the evening of the 13th of November I saw Reid, and I think Hislop; I had never seen her before - Reid came out of Navarino-house; Hislop joined him in Theobald's-road, and they went to Compton-house together - Reid went in, and Hislop remained outside; he came out in about ten minutes, and they walked back to Navarino-house together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you know of any agreement between Sewell and Cross, and the assignees of White and Metcalf? A. No; I believe White and Metcalf were not indebted to Sewell and Cross.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CLEMENTS. I went with Mr. Cross on Saturday, the 14th of November, to Navarino-house; I took Powell, Reid, and Mackay - I took this vell from Powell's bonnet; I then went with a search-warrant to No. 130, Old-street, and on the second floor I found Hislop; I told her I had a warrant to search the house for the things she had received of William, at Navarino-house - she hesitated, and then said, "I have some things, and I will show them you;" she showed some articles, and I found two duplicates in her pocket; she admitted that these things were given her by William, at Lamb's Conduit-street, and said she had received a great many more - she named shawls and handkerchiefs, satin, and some silk stockings, most of which she had pawned and given the money to William, and said he desired her to destroy the duplicates; she had given him some of them, and he had torn them up in her presence - she said he told her that they had hung one or two persons whom they had prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. There was no hesitation? A.There was some slight hesitation; she certainly told me every thing - the articles I found were a cotton gown, a lace collar, a band, and one or two things.</p>

A.Certainly not; this conversation was not in the presence of Mr. Cross - there was a conversation between Reid, Mr. Cross, and me, up stairs, which was before what I am about to relate - Mr. Cross did not promise him forgiveness if he would tell the truth; he did not say he would be merciful to him - he said, he believed he was led in the first instance into it by the cook, and that he was sorry for him; that is all that I remember - I believe Reid had before told him of the things he had taken, but I cannot tell; Mr. Cross said, he never forgave any one, and he would certainly send him to Newgate - he did not then ask him what he had to say; I think he asked him whether he chose to tell him any thing or not - he did not say he would send him to Newgate if he would not tell him; I believe this conversation was before he asked him if he chose to say any thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What did Reid say? A. He said he was led into it by the cook - that she called him into the kitchen on Sunday morning, and told him he might take her up stairs and kiss her, and do what he desired, if he would allow her to go and take any thing out of the shop; that she went and took some lawn, and two or three other things - and he said he took several things himself, and had given them to a girl, named Hislop, in Old-street; I went to Reid's mother's, saw his box, and found a silk handkerchief, the property of my employers - I then went to Old-street, and saw these other things produced.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Reid. Mr. Cross told me he would not punish me.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 11th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I met Wilson in Gloucester-place carrying this bundle - I asked him what he had got; he said some things which did not belong to him - I asked where he got them - he said if I would go to Mr. Robinson's, No. 5, Little Lisson-street, he would tell me all about it; I took him to the Police-station, and said I would go to Mr. Robinson's - he then said he was so irritated at the time he did not know what he said, but if I would go to Mr. Cross, Park-street, Davies, the footman, would tell me all about it; I went there - Davies came to the door; I asked if I could see Mr. Cross - he asked my business; I stated to him that I had detained a man, and described the property - the butler then came to the door, and Davies said "Very likely it is our washerwoman's husband;" I asked him to describe him, and by the description I was positive it was not the same man - I then asked if there was a person of the name of William Davies in the house; the butler said, "Why your name's William Davies' - the butler then went away; Davies came out to the door with me, and said he recollected he did give the bundle to the man to keep it for him, as he had no place to keep it in the house - I said, "If it is all right I don't wish to detain the man;" I bade him good night, and was going away - he called me back and said,"Well, I suppose if the man is liberated, master will know nothing about it;" I said, "No, certainly not. I will go home and liberate him" - he said he hoped his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030035"/>master would know nothing about it, as it might get him into trouble; I went to the Police-station and mentioned what Davies had said to a superior officer, who advised me to go and apprehend Davies, which I did - I asked him what clothes they were, whether they were saddle-cloths or what; he said they belonged to him - I said,"I suppose they are your perquisites?" he said, Yes - I went to Mr. Cross' again and told the butler.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.When you went to Mr. Cross' did you tell Davies what the parcel contained? A.

            . I am housekeeper to Mr. Cross. These three table covers and blanket are his property - I cannot swear to the blanket; Davies had been there about ten months.. I gave them to him to take to wash; they certainly did not belong to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot swear to the blanket? A. No; there is no mark on the table-covers, but I had them in use every day - I think I could swear to them; I do not know of any perquisites being given, or of one or two being used in the stable - I cannot swear these had not been given him.</p>

            . I am a footman to Mr. Oakgood. I saw the two waggons of coals come to his house; I saw the two prisoners at the time - Lawney told me I was wanted in the coal-cellar; I went down for a minute, but I found I was not wanted - I came back, and saw Lawney in the act of taking two empty sacks out of the second waggon which had just come into the yard; Huckleby was down stairs with Hughes at the time - Lawney was running with the sacks down the yard, to where the empty sacks of the first waggon were put, but seeing me he concealed them behind the dog-kennel: I had before that asked Huckleby for the ticket of that waggon, and he said he had come away and forgot it - I counted the number of sacks in the second waggon, and there were but twenty-six; I examined the sacks which had been put behind the dog-kennel - they were regular sacks, and appeared to have had coals in them; I said to Huckleby,"As you have no ticket with this waggon, I shall count your coals" - I counted and said, "There are but twenty-six;" he said he knew they were short, and he hoped I would not say any thing about it - Lawney was by the other waggon, but he was within hearing, and not more than five yards off; I said to Huckleby, "As you had the charge of this waggon, you must be answerable for the coals" - he said they had been left at Holloway; I said, "That won't do for me, I must have my coals correct" - he then said it was at the Red Cap, or Mother Red<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030036"/>Cap, I am not certain which, and wished me not to say any thing about it; I told him I certainly should acquaint Green and Barratt of it - he then told Seaney to come to me, and make it up - when Seaney came to me with a message from Huckleby to make it up, and I refused, Huckleby said he would pay me for them if I would say nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you by when the waggons were unloaded? A. Yes, all but the first six sacks, which had been taken out of the first waggon; I think Lawney was within hearing when I spoke to Huckleby - when Huckleby said they were short, I understood short of the number; I made him no promise or threat.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer, and apprehended the prisoners.</p>
               <p>HARRIET ANN ANSTEAD. I am in Mr. Woodin's service. On the 26th of October I opened the door at No. 2, Park-place - Mountjoy and Carr came in; I went into the drawing-room, and saw Carr placing some pieces of iron bar against the wall opposite the drawing-room window; I then saw Mountjoy take some shoes from the lath-rail, I suppose eight or ten - Carr was present at the time; he placed them where Carr placed the bars - Carr then took one or two pairs of shoes from off a heap, took some from under them, and put the top pairs on again; Carr then went to the street, and looked up and down; I went to the parlour window, and saw him - he then went into the shop again; I went into the drawing-room, and saw Mountjoy fill a bag, which seemed to be a nail-bag, with the iron, and Carr filled his pockets - I went to the parlour window, and saw them go into the street; I then lost sight of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Where is this drawing-room? A.Close to the shop - the horse-shoes were on the rafters at the top of the shop; I could see them distinctly, and have no doubt they were horse-shoes; Mountjoy took them down with an iron bar - different persons had permission to go into that shop; when I went into the parlour I could see them in the street; it was a quarter-past six o'clock in the morning - I do not know whether it is usual for workmen to take horse-shoes from one shop to another.</p>
               <p>MR. WOODIN. The workmen at Gloucester-mews place have often taken things, but not these men; they had nothing to do with any other shop but that in Park-place - they formerly worked at another shop.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not common for men to take shoes from one to another? A. They do sometimes, at the season of the year.</p>
               <p>Mountjoy's Defence. I have carried shoes from Park-place to Gloucester-mews, and I fetch coals.</p>

            . On the 27th of October Carr and Mountjoy came in, and went to work - I saw the prisoner come and take two or three pairs of shoes from the laths in the shop, and put them into his pocket; I was watching in the drawing-room - I went from there, opened the street-door, and saw him go into the Gloucester Arms, with the property in his possession; this was about ten minutes past six o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>MR. WOODIN. I had not empowered the prisoner to take any thing; he should come to work about six o'clock, and they generally remain there till dinner-time - they breakfast in the shop.</p>

On the 5th of November I washed some shirts and other things, and hung them out at half-past two or three o'clock - I saw them safe at four, and at half-past five they were gone; I asked the prisoner if she had taken them in - she said No: I said,"Are you joking?" she said, "I am not - upon my soul, I have not been out of the kitchen this evening;" I went and told my husband of it, and said no more - but on the 23rd I saw the prisoner with my petticoat on; I said nothing to her then, but mentioned it to a lady, and then got a search-warrant: she was apprehended in the kitchen - the officer searched her, and she gave him some duplicates out of a little bag in her pocket, and told me if I would go up stairs with her, she would give me two caps, if I would not hurt her; she gave me two caps out of her box - this neck-handkerchief, which I had lost, was found on the kitchen-dresser.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.When did you go and ask for 10s. to settle it? A. Her master, Mr. Lynn, came and asked if 10s. would settle it. I had had no quarrel with her about washing the stairs, nor any gentlemen coming there; she was not in the habit of wearing my clothes - I never wore hers: I never drank with her -I have never put any of my clothes on her; I wanted to try a petticoat body on her before I went for the warrant, that I might be sure whether it was mine - I know this petticoat by its having a button-hole on the hand.</p>

               <p>Q.Was Mrs. Mabbott sober? A. Yes, perfectly so.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HIGHAM. I am a pawnbroker, and live at Mr. Harris', in Hackney. I produce the shirt for which I gave this duplicate; I cannot say who pawned it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She has offered to lend me her petticoat, and has done so - as to the shirt, I did not know it was hers.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LYNN. I live at No. 21, Hackney-road, and am married. The prisoner was in my service on the 23rd of November, and has been so these two years; the prosecutrix was a lodger of mine - there was an intimacy between her and the prisoner; I have come and caught my servant in her apartment, and I have said, "Don't be so thick with the lodgers, for bye and bye you will be quarrelling;" the prisoner cannot read or write - she has pawned things for me, and did not know but that this shirt was mine; before she was taken she told me she had pawned a shirt - I remember her being taken; Mrs. Mabbott said she was very sorry, but she would not hurt her if I would pay for the shirt, and for the officer, that it would not come to above 10s., and she would not go up to the office, and as to her caps, she said she might have them for what she had done for her; I have known her to wear Mrs. Mabbott's clothes, and Mrs. Mabbott has worn hers: if she was discharged I would take her again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is your wife here? A. No - I am a bricklayer and builder; she said she took a shirt and pawned it- when I have seen them drinking together, I cannot say that I have not taken a drop with them; I did not think it odd that Mrs. Mabbott should wish to be compensated, if she had not lost a shirt, but I said to her, "You are one as bad as the other;" I have no reason to believe the prosecutrix ever pawned my property - I did not know whether it was my shirt; I never saw it: I would not compound a felony - I thought it was mine; I do not look or count over my shirts - I leave all that to her: I did not know whether it was mine - she might have wanted a few shillings; I did not authorize her to pawn any property of mine on the 4th of November, nor between the 4th and the 23rd - she was at liberty to pawn any thing when she wanted it; she was a very honest girl: my wife has left me these three years.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH FORRESTER. I know the prisoner and Mrs. Mabbott - I went to Mr. Lynn's, and Mabbott let me in: I went down into the kitchen to Lynn, and Lynn went up to the parlour, which Mr. Mabbott occupies - Lynn called me up, and I saw Mrs. Mabbott there; she said she was sorry that any thing should occur, and if Mr. Lynn would pay 5s., which she had paid for a shirt in lieu of the one pawned, and something as a consideration for the officer, she would not appear at Worship-street, any further than to have her discharged; I said, "I suppose 10s. will do?" she said Yes, 10s. would he plenty - I said, "What have you lost?" she said the shirt was the principal thing that Jane had washed for her, and she did not care about them; she said Jane had the petticoat on, and she wanted to fit a body on, or something of that - she did not say any thing to me about stealing the clothes; I had seen them together once or twice before, when I have gone there on business - I have observed them in company, and as it were, connected together in one room or the other.</p>

On the 30th of October, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, the two prisoners came into our shop; I had seen them before, and concealed myself at the end of the shop, to watch them - they asked for silk handkerchiefs, and were shewn several pieces; I saw Phillips take a piece containing five handkerchiefs from under a piece which they were looking at - as he attempted to put it into his pocket they came unfolded - they were shewn several pieces afterwards, and when they were going out I came down, and took the handkerchiefs from Phillips; they were in his hand, which was down by the side of the counter - when I went to take him he said, "There are some down here;" they had been in the shop full half an hour - it was full a quarter of an hour after Phillips took the handkerchiefs; Scroggins was nearest to the shop door - he could see what Phillips was doing; they were both looking at the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Who else was in the shop? A. Only my shopman; no other customers - the shop is perhaps a dozen yards long; I saw no other boy in the shop - when I took hold of Phillips, Scroggins ran away; I do not know which asked the price.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.Where does his father and mother live? A.At No. 18, Wood's-buildings, Whitechapel-road; he had not been out that morning, he had been at home - he went out about twenty minutes after nine; he had been before that cleaning his shoes in the kitchen - he got up at near eight o'clock, to the best of my recollection; it was near ten o'clock when I went out - this is about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Trotter's; I do not know that I ever saw Phillips.</p>

               <p>ANN DRYDEN. I live in Stepney-causeway, and am a servant. On the 1st of November, the prisoner gave me at Sewell and Cross', some nett and some lace; she told me to hem it, and make it into handkerchiefs - on the 8th she gave me a piece of Irish linen to make into shifts for her; she gave me a piece of lawn, and some bombazeen, which she told me to keep till she came to my place, on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were not these things found at your house? A. Yes, and then I stated these facts; I went to Sewell and Cross' to see her - I had no opportunity of taking any thing out of the shop; I used to go in the afternoon - I had not the least suspicion these things were stolen; I thought she came by them honestly- she told me they were come fairly by; I was taken up - I did not accuse her, till after I was put in prison; I did not know any thing of it till I was taken for; the officer and Mr. Cross came together - I told every thing I knew, but still they put me in gaol; I swear I had not the least notion where these things came from - she said she bought them; she had been there twelve weeks; I believe she said she bought the linen, but had not paid for it - I believe she said there were eight yards and a half of the bombazeen; the long lawn was new - the linen is cut up; I had worked on some of it - I have known her three months; I am still detained in the House of Correction -I wish to clear myself, and I expect if I get her convicted, I shall get out; I generally went to the house once a week- I was there four days as a char-woman, and slept there; I went through the shop to get to the kitchen.</p>

            . I was servant to Sewell and Cross. On the 14th of November I was taken to prison; the prisoner was not with me - on the Friday evening I came down into the kitchen, and the prisoner said, "I have been much frightened - there has been a gentleman down stairs, and said that William has been robbing the shop;" I said, "Why, are you frightened? you have not been robbing the shop;" she said she wanted to see William, and he came down, but what she said to him I do not know, for I went up stairs - when I came down she said,"There is a parcel yonder;" I said, "I don't know what you mean by yonder - I see nothing;" I then went into the water-closet, and while I was there, I heard a jump -I came on, and she said, "Here are two parcels, and these are stockings, which William has been taking;" she had another parcel, which she said were handkerchiefs -I said it was very wrong of William; we should all get into prison for nothing - the next morning Mr. Cross came and asked me about several things; I could not tell him - he asked me about this, and I was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That other person was convicted? A. Yes; William was - these are not the articles I speak of; I know nothing about these - on the Sunday night I went out from four o'clock till nine; Dryden was there four days together - I have seen her pass the carpet-room; there were chests of drawers, and things of that kind there - she might have been in the shop without my seeing her; the four days that she was at the house ended about a fortnight before I was taken; but she had been there on the Monday evening.</p>

               <p>ROBERT BURGOYNE WATTS. I saw these stockings secreted on a wall in a dark cellar, on the 11th of November; they were in a paper that had a mark on it - these handkerchiefs were also on the wall, and they have still our mark upon them.</p>
               <p>HENRY THOMLINSON COOMBE. I was desired by Mr. Cross to watch; I went to Navarino-house an the 18th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030041"/>November, to watch who came to take two parcels from a wall under the shop floor - I secreted myself in a waterbutt, and about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning the prisoner came, and hammered a nail in the wine-cellar door - she then went away and swept the place out; nothing occurred till about four in the afternoon, when she opened the wine-cellar door, and took out a bottle of wine - I remained in the water-butt till about half past eleven at night; but about nine o'clock the prisoner and Powell went in the water-closet, which is in a line with the waterbutt - the prisoner put up her hand and took down the two parcels from the place described, she took them into the privy, and was there about five minutes - she came out; she had a broom-stick in her hand, the bottom of which was wet, and put it into the dust-hole, and then called out to the other servant, as if she had been at a distance, "If I were you I would make Thomas carry up the coals;" I saw no coals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long were you in the water-butt altogether? A. About eighteen hours; I took a bottle of sherry with me, and nearly finished it - Mr. Watts brought me down a penny loaf about two o'clock; I think I left about one glass in the bottle -I was not in the least affected by it; I have seen the young man who was convicted this morning - whether he placed the things there or not I do not know; I drank the wine neat - I did not sleep at all, and was not in the least drowsy; there was just room for me to put my feet down -I had a stool to sit on; I had two holes made to look through, one to view the wine-cellar, and one to look at the parcels - I raised my head over the water-butt when no one was there, but when any one came with a light I looked through the holes; a person might have come and put the parcels there while I was drinking - I believe Reid was a sweetheart of hers, and had access to the shop.</p>

I saw the prisoner at the Gloucester Arms, Rochester-row, on the 7th of November, selling these biscuits; I called him out, and asked where he got them - he at first would not give me an answer - he then said he bought them in the City, and then that he brought them from Portsmouth, but I found they were quite warm; this is the sieve.(Sieve produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lived at Portsmouth thirty-three years. I bought these biscuits of a man who was selling them in the street - I bought 1d. worth of him, and ate them; he said he would sell me the rest a bargain - I thought as it was Saturday night I might get a shilling by taking them to public-houses; I sell a few little things, which I buy of Mr. Brooks, in Tothill-street, where I took the officer, and he gave me a good character.</p>

On Saturday, the 28th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in Tothill-street - my daughter was with me; I have known the prisoner five years - her parents once lived in the house with me; she is a girl of the town - she said to my daughter, "How do you do, Mrs. Robinson? your mother don't speak to me, but I hope you will;" my daughter said, "I shall not" - I went home - she followed me up stairs, and came into my room; my daughter went out for a candle in about ten minutes, leaving her there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not desire her to leave the room? A. Yes - I do not turn her out, as she is such a character she would insult and knock me down, and my daughter had her child in her arms - I do not think she was at all in liquor; while my daughter was gone for the candle she pushed me down on the bed, jumped on me, and got her knee on my breast, put her hand into my pocket, and took out two shillings - I could not call out, for she squeezed my throat; I got round, and saw her take the cruets, a tumbler, and loaf - she went out of the room; my daughter was coming up stairs - I called out, "Stop her, she has robbed me!" I could not follow her, I was so ill, and did not know where she lived - I told an officer, who took her on Sunday; it was all done in a moment - the two shillings were wrapped in a piece of newspaper; she did not take the tumbler away.</p>
               <p>ANNETT ROBINSON. I am the prosecutrix's daughter. The prisoner did not appear to me to be drunk - she followed us up stairs - I went out for a candle, and on returning my little boy was crying violently; when I entered the room the prisoner was on the bed on my mother, but the candle was out - I lighted it, and took her off; she said my mother had thrown her on the bed - my mother said"No, she threw me on, but I have kept my hand on my pocket;" that is all she said - I then went out for some porter, and as I came back met the prisoner on the stairs - my mother called out, "Stop her! she has taken something;" I called to the landlord to stop her, but he could not find her - I had left her in the room with my mother; it was not my place to turn her out - she went out for something to drink before it occurred.</p>

She asked me to go and have some liquor when I met her, and afterwards asked me up to her room; I went home, and heard nothing of this till Sunday - the tumbler was never out of the room, but she said she saw me take it from my pocket, and put it on the shelf. <rs id="t18291203-118-verdict620" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>MARY FULL. I am the prisoner's mother-in-law. On the Sunday in question, the prosecutrix came into my kitchen, and said, "I have not come to dine with you unless you have got a couple of fowls:" I said, "I have not one" - this was a little before one o'clock; she laid a pear on the mantel-piece, and returned to the front room again - that room opens into the street without a passage; she said, "I have lost my money out of my bag," which she called her reticule - it is made out of a black stuff petticoat; I asked how she thought she had lost it - she said some of the boys had taken it; I said, "What boys?" she said

             had got it, she supposed, and said it was ten sovereigns and two half-crowns; I asked her if she was sure she had it - she said she saw it three months ago (I am sure she said months) when she got change in Long-lane or Long-ally, and had then put it into her pocket-book, five sovereigns on one side, and five sovereigns and two half-crowns on the other; she then said he was gone up stairs with it - I told her to go up after him; she went up, but he was not there - she said she had put it on the table, which is about two yards from the door; when I came into the room, both the street door and the window were ajar - I had opened the window for air; she fetched Lawson to the house, and said I could state the case to him - I said I could only state what she said to me; she said, in Lawson's presence, that she had lost ten sovereigns and two crowns - I asked if she recollected telling me before that it was two half-crowns; she at first told me she tied it together, and then said she tacked it together with a nail and needle - she was told she might say what was proper in our house; I asked if she might swear a man's life away in our house; she said what she swore before the Grand Jury would be the case - she went away, and on the Monday told a neighbour, in my hearing, that she had brought the money to our house to relieve us, as we were walking about the streets, wanting bread; I asked if she had ever shown any charity to me - she said No, but she had brought it to relieve my children by a former husband, as I had acted friendly to her; she has frequently said she should like to come and live with us, if we would allow her 2s. 6d. a week.</p>

               <p>MARY NUTT. All she has said is perfectly right, except about the half-crowns; I did go with the intention of relieving her - I had seen the money three months before, and also three weeks; the window was not open - the door was shut when I went out of the room, but open when I returned.</p>

               <p>JOHN CRAWLEY LITTLE. I am a Police-constable. On the 1st of December I was at Mr. Dobree's, a pawnbroker, in Oxford-street, on business, and the prisoner came in to pledge a piece of velvet; he was asked his address, and gave John Wells, 27, Well-street, Oxford-street - the pawnbroker said he must make a mistake, for he knew the people at No. 27; I then stepped round to the side box, where he was, and told him he must go with me to No. 27, and see if it was correct; he went as far as the door, then told me it was of no use knocking, for he knew nobody there - I asked how he came by the velvet; he said, "To tell you the truth, the fact is, I went home with a young woman last night, gave her a sovereign, and she gave me this velvet, as she had no change to give me, and I thought a sovereign was too much for her:" I said he must go to the watch-house, and on the road he begged me very hard not to handcuff him, or lay hold of his collar - I allowed him to walk by my side, and he ran away some distance; I hallooed, and he was stopped - I overtook and secured him; I searched him at Marylebone office, and found three new silk handkerchiefs in his pocket - I went next morning to Mr. Eyles, and searched a box, which the shopman pointed out as his, in his bed-room, and found four silk handkerchiefs, two gauze scarfs two gauze shawls, two gauze handkerchiefs, a pair or two of gloves, and other things: I found eight duplicates in his trunk, and one in his possession.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Gray, pawnbroker of Fleet-street. I have four silk handkerchiefs, and a remnant of silk - two of them were pawned by the prisoner, on the 24th of October, and the 25th of November; I did not take the others in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known him before? A. No; I cannot swear to all our customers, but recollect taking these articles of him.</p>
               <p>PHILIP EATON. I am a pawnbroker, and live in High Holborn. I have two yards and a half of velvet, and a piece of silk handkerchiefs, pawned on the 26th of November - I believe the prisoner to be the person who pawned them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Why do you say he is the man? A. From his appearance; he is rather a remarkable young man - we are not in the habit of serving many so respectable in appearance.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many young men have you? A. Eight - three sleep in the prisoner's room; all the clothes in the box are the prisoner's, and as such I believe it to be his box - I have every reason to believe the velvet is mine; here are patterns corresponding with one piece -I bought it of a wholesale dealer; it is a common sort - the handkerchiefs have our shop mark on them; shopmen at times purchase articles, and put them down to their accounts - the prisoner has done so; I am confident these articles are not entered - I have no private mark on any thing but the handkerchiefs: the tickets have come off since they were found - a loose ticket was found in the prisoner's box.</p>

I told you that the night previous I suspected you had taken one; you produced the cover of one to me - it was taken from your pocket at the watchhouse; my waiter said he gave it to him, and I was satisfied - I could not have sworn to the tumbler if it had been out of the house; I marked it at the watch-house - I shewed the Magistrate that mark.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was desired to watch, and laid hold of the prisoner at the time, and Mr. Williams asked him what he had got - he said a glass, and that he took it to take medicine out of; he did not say it was not Mr. Williams'.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you remember his charging me with taking a magazine? A. He said he missed books and glasses - you produced a book at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in a long address, stated that he was in the habit of making extracts from different publications, and about ten days previous to the transaction in question the waiter had given him the magazine cover as a cover for his book, and this, from its similarity to a magazine, might be mistaken for one, and caused some gentleman to inform the prosecutor he was in the habit of taking magazines - that the glass was his own, and was in his pocket for the purpose of taking medicine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to MR. WILLIAMS. Q. Have you other glasses of this size? A. Yes, and some larger and well cut - most of those are gone; I have lost seventeen or eighteen, besides cruets, and a table-cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lost several since my committal? A. Not one.</p>

On the 7th of September the prisoner was in my service, and I sent him to receive thirteen great coats from Aaron Simmons - he did not return; I did not see him again for seventeen or eighteen days - he was then in custody: I have not been able to find the coats. The prisoner was remanded for a fortnight, and was discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to swear that from the time you sent him, you did not see him again for seventeen or eighteen days? A. I am not sure to a day: I will say fourteen days - he never came to me on the same day with a letter in his hand, crying, and stating that he had been robbed: I do not know Richard Baker - I never saw him, nor heard of him, to my knowledge; no person came with him to me that day, who found him crying in the street - I never heard of it; there was no letter produced to me - I did not see him till he was in custody; I did not try to get any money from his father to settle this - I do not know Samuel Pope; I do not really know that I was ever in a public-house called the Fountain; I have been in a public-house in Little Catherine-street, Strand, which the prisoner's father and several of his acquaintance frequent - I have seen them there; I do not think it is called the Darkee - there are a great many houses of ill-fame about it; I go there to dine sometimes, when I have been at sales - I saw the prisoner's father there - I never met him to talk on this business; I never said if he would pay me 10l. I would not prosecute - it is about three years since I took the benefit of the Insolvent Act; I was remanded for three months, but not for a fraud, I will swear- but when I was arrested and sent to prison, my friends offered what little property I had to my creditors, and they would not accept of it; my effects had produced 30l. or 40l., and as I was arrested for a mere trifle, and did not owe above 200l., my attorney advised me to take the proceeds, and support myself and family in prison; the Commissioners did not state that it was for a fraud - it was merely for appropriating this money to my own use; my attorney was Mr. Watkins - I do not know where he lives, nor where he did live; when I went into the prison I was beset by prisoners and attornies; I employed Mr. Watkins, and by his advice I appropriated the money - I never asked where Watkins lived; he was in the prison every day - I do not know his Christian name; the prisoner was eight years in my service - he will be out of his time in March: he was discharged after three examinations, and has surrendered to-day - I afterwards went before the Grand Jury, and got the bill, because the Magistrate had not investigated the case; all the examinations did not last more than three minutes, I will warrant - the first time I merely stated I sent him to receive some work, and he never returned: the Magistrate said, "Have you found it?" I said No - he said "Step down," and remanded him for a week; on the second occasion he said, "Have you found your property?" I said No - he said, "I will remand him for a fortnight;" on the third time I had not found them; he said, "I don't think you use due diligence - I must discharge the prisoner;" he was hurried out, and before I could explain he was gone - I believe he came to my house the day after he was discharged, but I was not at home; the Magistrate did not mention any thing about my taking him back; I believe I did see him the next day, in Holborn, and a person who was with him, told me he had been to my house.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What did the prisoner come to you for? A. To ask if I would take him back, or give up his indentures.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you were sent to prison for a mere trifle? A. Yes, I was arrested for 12l. 10s. - I owed about 220l.; I did not pay my creditors any thing.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q.Have you any interest in the house the prosecutor lives in? A.

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that as he was going through Sun-street he stopped to rest his bag, when a gentleman, in appearance, offered him a shilling to take a note to Mr. Brooks, Peter-street, Sun-street; he left the bag with him, and on finding Brooks did not live there, he returned, and the bag and man were gone - that he met one Baker, who accom<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030051"/>panied him to his master, and informed him of his less - that he replied if he did not produce the bag he should give him in charge; he was alarmed, and went to Birmingham to enlist as a soldier, but was advised there to surrender to his master; which he did, and was apprehended.</p>

On the 7th of September, I was going to Goulston-street, Whitechapel, for him to draw a bill; I know it was on a Monday, in Bartholomew-fair - it was about half-past eleven o'clock, or it might be rather latter; I did not know about the prisoner being taken up - I heard he had been before a Magistrate; I dare say that is five weeks ago - I heard it in the tap-room of the Fountain; the prisoner's father was not the person who told me - I never heard it from his mouth, for he and I are not friends; I never speak to him - he subpoenaed me three days ago to come here; I never went before the Magistrate - I did not hear of this before the end of September; it might be a month or five weeks ago - upon my oath I saw the prosecutor before I served him with this notice to produce the letter (looking at it) I do not know who served this other notice - I cannot say but what I might serve it; I served only one, which I received from the prisoner's father.</p>

No; I received the notice from the prisoner's father, in Russell-street, near Bow-street - he said, "I want you to go and serve this notice;" I said, "What notice;" he said "A notice of trial;" we had not been very bad friends, but were not good friends - I was at the Fountain this morning with Mr. Pope; I do not know that I know Sergeant's-inn, in Chancery-lane - I never was bail for any body in my life; I do not know when I was at the prisoner's father's last - it may be a month or six weeks ago; I swear I have not been fifty times, nor twenty times, nor three times within the last two months - I am not regularly in Mr. Tucker's employ; I sit to be employed - he puts me in possession, and to do other jobs; no person was with me when I saw the prisoner - I was coming along Sun-street, and I met him; I saw no one but the prosecutor when I went to the shop, in St. John-street - it is two doors from the corner of a street there; I never went to him to complain of his having prosecuted the boy - he was a stranger to me; I do not know that I ever saw him twice before - I did not know before that the prisoner was in his service; when he had explained this to his master, we went away together, to where old Bethlehem was; I went on with him, till I told him I could not wait any longer - I did not see a person that day of the name of

            . I know the Fountain public-house, in Little Catherine-street. I do not know that I have seen the prosecutor there above once or twice - he is the master of the prisoner, and he said in my presence, that if the prisoner's father would pay 10l. for the goods he would not prosecute him, but if he would not, he would prosecute him as far as the law would admit of - his father replied he would not give him one farthing.</p>

About three months ago - I cannot be certain to the time; I do not think it was six months ago - I cannot tell whether it was or no; I believe it was about the beginning of Bartholomew-fair - I cannot justly tell whether it is nearer six months than three; I am sure it is as much as three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030052"/>months - Mr. Levy was with me, and two or three respectable gentlemen; I do not know their names - Baker was there, and heard it; that I will swear - Baker is no acquaintance of mine, but I have seen him; it was rather a darkish day - I believe it was on a Monday, and we were in the Darkee; I swear it was not on a Sunday - I am a boot-maker, and live in Conduit-street, Long-acre; I keep a house and shop; I had business with Levy at the Darkee - that was the reason I went there; the prisoner was not there - if he had his master would have been ready to take him; the 10l. was not produced, but the prosecutor said if they would give it him he would drop the prosecution, and take the lad - he came in, and said that. the prisoner had decamped with 10l. worth of goods; his father was very much burt about it - we were going to have something to drink, and had a glass of ale afterwards.</p>

            . I am a salesman, of Shadwell. The prisoner came to my shop on the Monday morning to sell this jacket; I said I did not think it was his own - he said he had bought it of his landlady; I said it was not likely he should buy a school-boy's jacket - he ran out of the shop, and said he could bring the person; I stepped to the door, saw the Police, and had him secured.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.What situation was she in in your house? A. She came for some gin; there is a small passage between the bar and the parlour, where the sheet had been left - while I was sitting in the bar I could not see a person passing from the parlour; it was but a few minutes before I missed the sheet, and there was no other person there - I had folded the sheets, and laid them in the parlour ten or fifteen minutes before; she lives but a short distance from me.</p>

               <p>MR. ESPANIZE. Q. What did the prisoner say? A. He said he could show the man he brought them from, and the gentleman and he went away together - after a little while the witness came and owned them; he and I went and caught the prisoner - he said, "You can't hurt me, as you have got your pigs;" he said nothing else.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the prisoner taken up? A. Yes, and brought to my house; but I was not at home, and he was let go - he came afterwards to get a glass of brandy or rum and water; he had a new jacket and smock-frock on - a witness came in and said, "This is the man who took the cask;" and I had him taken directly - I went to his lodgings, where his children were, with a search-warrant; I believe there was a fustian jacket mentioned to the children - he had not desired me to go for a jacket, but when I saw his new jacket I asked where his jacket was; I believe the children said they had not seen his jacket for some time, and they did not know what he had done with it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He came to your house, was not that a fortnight afterwards? A. Yes; I went up to him and said, "How dare you take that cask from my door? and what did you do with the brandy-wash in it?" "Me!" said he, and turned as pale as death - a witness came in and said, "That is the man I saw rolling the cask along, and no doubt he thought it was brandy:" we made search for a jacket and a frock - no one else has been taken up on suspicion.</p>

            . I am a pork-butcher, and live in Lumber-court. I remember a cask being at Mr. Spicer's door on the 15th of October - I saw the prisoner take it; I am certain of his person - he had a short smock-frock on and a jacket under it, which looked like a fustian jacket; he turned it about as if he had bought it, or was going to buy it - this was about four o'clock in the afternoon; he did not take it from the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see him take it from the door? A. No; I do not know whether people are in the habit of looking at casks, when they are put out.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BURTON. I am a fishmonger, and live in Lumber-court. I saw the prisoner roll the cask down the court, about ten minutes or a quarter after four o'clock - he rolled it by the dead wall; I did not see it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How was he dressed? A. He had a short smock-frock on, and a dark waistcoat - I saw no jacket; I did not hear Mrs. Spicer say he was not the man - I was before the Magistrate when serjeant Riley brought the prisoner there; he was discharged because there was another fishmonger who said he did not think he was the man.</p>

               <p>DAVID HARDING. I know the house of Mr. Mitchell - it is near the Regent's-park; the prisoner was a <rs id="t18291203-148-deflabel765" type="occupation">servant</rs>

One Monday, early in November, she gave me a bundle, which was afterwards opened, and property found in it; she told me to take it home, and take care of it - I took it home, and put it into a large box; she said she was going to leave her situation, and wished me to look out for a lodging for a single person; the next morning she gave me a little parcel screwed up in a piece of newspaper, which contained the articles stated in the indictment; I opened them, looked at them, and then told what I had seen - she was taken into custody; this is the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long has she lived there? A. I believe about four months; she never gave me a pair of shoes, except in the bundle - she once gave me an old pair of man's slippers; I did not desire her to take them - she never lived in my house; I was no acquaintance of hers - the slippers she gave me were not worth a penny; they were quite mouldy, and had been lying about the house - I thought they might belong to her - they were of no use to me; I burnt them - I have occasionally been in one of the bed-rooms.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Harding? A. Yes, he cleaned my boots - I did not lose any shoes but those that are here; I had none that were only fit to be burnt - he only comes into my bed-room when I am in bed, to bring up my things.</p>

On the 3rd of November I saw the two prisoners outside the shop, looking in at the window for some time; they then took the pins out of a piece of printed cotton at the door, and folded it up - they went away, and came back to it several times: at last Beavis took it, and walked away - the other was close to her; I followed and took them - they did not say any thing; this is the cotton - there are about twenty yards of it; they moved it several times, to get it into a smaller compass.</p>
               <p>Beavis' Defence. He took it and did something to it, and then he brought it out in a small compass, as if he wanted one of us to take it.</p>
               <p>Markham's Defence. If I had been guilty I should have resisted; I was standing at the window, looking at an intoxicated man - the gentleman came out, and took me, and instead of using me as a Christian, he used violence; he brought out a string, and tied us both together.</p>

               <p>CHARLES TICKLE. On the morning of Lord Mayor's day I met the prosecutor in the street; he was in trouble, and I asked what was the matter - he described what he had lost, and described Coleman; I said I would get her in about two hours - I went into Old Gravel-lane, and took her with this handkerchief round her neck; I took her to the public-house, and the pot-boy said she was one of them.</p>

               <p>Coleman's Defence. I had been at a funeral; I met this young woman with a man very much in liquor - they asked if I would take part of a pint of porter; I went into a public-house with her and a man whom I do not know - they had a pint of ale and a quartern of gin; the watchman came in, and I gave the glass of gin to the watchman; the woman then asked the man if he was going to have any thing more to drink - he said he had no more money; I went on to Fox's-lane, bade them good night, and went home; the next morning I met her, and she said she was going to get an affidavit of a gold watch, and asked me to go with her - I said I could not, but I was going for some little things, and I would wait till she came back; I waited, and she said, "I will make you a present of this handkerchief;" I put it on my neck - she said she had pawned a watch for 15s., and a seal for 4s., and while we were there the watchman came and took me, but she got away; I kept the handkerchief on my neck, and never gave it a thought - my friends came to see me, and I could have given it to them; the officer came and asked me the name of this woman, and I told him - the officers know me and my mother, and know that I work hard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Conner. What she says is all false; I know nothing about it, or her either.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you dined? A. Yes, at the Gloucester hotel, with a friend; we had only a bottle of port between us - after supper I believe I had two glasses of punch; they were rather large - I did not walk to Charles-street; I never walk after dinner - I had been fagging all the morning, and felt tired, but not affected by what I had drank; I believe I went to sleep immediately I got into the coach - the windows were closed; I did not feel any person in the coach - I swear I did not speak to any person in my road at all, nor to any women; there was a man examined, named Michael Fowler, who was called by the prisoner - a person might have got into the coach, and I not have known it; I did not say any thing about a sovereign, or of having lost any -I put seven sovereigns into my pocket in the morning, but had laid out most of them; the watch has not been found - I was sober; I told Mr. Rawlinson, the Magistrate, I was the worse for what I had.</p>

            . I am head waiter at the Gloucester coffee-house, Piccadilly. On the night of the 7th of November Mr. Goodere came home there a little after one o'clock; when I opened the door he was out of the coach, and said to me, "Smith, I have been robbed - I have lost all my money and my watch;" he had the ring and the guard in his hand - I said, "Have you indeed, Sir? has the coach been searched?" the prisoner replied, "Yes; but the gentleman has had a woman in the coach, and I can take you to the place where I set her down;" Mr. Goodere said, "Smith, get your hat and go with me;" I said, "I can't well go, Sir, but here is the Police-man, he will be of more use than I shall" - the prisoner said he saw the gentleman with the watch in his hand when he got into the coach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not Mr. Goodere a little tipsy? A. He had been drinking, I dare say, but I thought him sober enough to know what he was doing; I did not help him up to his bed-room - the prisoner got on the box again and drove from the door, with the prosecutor and the officer inside; I did not see any coachman or cuds about, nor hear any thing said about sovereigns.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CUNNINGHAM. I am a Police officer. On the morning of the 8th of November, the prosecutor called me, and said the prisoner had been robbing him of some money and a watch; the prisoner said, "It was not me, it was a lady he took up on the way, I can take you to the house she went into" - he acknowledged that he saw the watch in the gentleman's hand, but he gave no further account of it; the prosecutor desired me to go in the coach, and we went to Portman-place; when there, I said to the prisoner,"Which is the house the lady went into?" he said, "That I really can't say;" I said, "I am an officer, I insist upon searching you,' which I did, but found nothing; I searched the coach, and the prosecutor said, "Take the number, and ask where he lives;" I went to the address which the prisoner gave me the next morning, but could not find him - he was taken by a brother officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you help the gentleman into the coach? A. No, he got in: it was a chariot - I do not know whether the prisoner looked at the houses or not.</p>

I cannot tell; I have seen him at different ranks, perhaps a couple of years - I do not know the number of his coach; I am sure it was not half-past twelve o'clock, because I had noticed the time, as we always do when we take up a fare; I had taken up my gentleman in Bond-street, at twelve or a few minutes past - my face was 1s.; I cannot swear what sort of a lady it was - I took very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030058"/>little notice of her; she was dressed very gay - I know there was a cloak of some dark colour; it was a very fine night - I asked the prisoner how he got on: there might be a few more words said by us - I did not speak to him two minutes, only just while he got down and let the lady inside; one of his horses was a chesnut, and the other a black one - I cannot tell the colour of the lady's bonnet or hat; I was examined before the Magistrate, and stated these facts; the Magistrate did tell me I was tipsy - I believe he said he would not believe what I said; I did say I could not tell whether it was a coach or a chariot, but now I know it was the same coach or landau that he always drives - I cannot tell why I could not tell the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WADE. I am ostler to the prisoner. On the evening of the 7th of November he went out with his landau, and returned it a quarter before nine o'clock on Sunday morning; it is No. 317. - one was a chesnut and the other a black horse; he has three pairs of numbers.</p>

               <p>ANGELIUS BETRAUN. I am an officer. On the 21st of November, about half-past six o'clock, I was near the Seven-dials, and saw the prisoner with a bag upon his shoulder - he saw me, and hastened his pace; I followed him to Castle-street - I came up with him, and asked what he had got; he said he did not know - I said "I must know," and took it; he then said a gentleman gave it him to take to Bedford-street, Covent-garden, but he did not know him; I went with him, but there was no gentleman there - I then took him to the office; the prosecutor's shop is in Greek-street: this Bible was in the bag.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had it to carry, and was to have 1s. for it - I know nothing of the stealing it.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JONES. I have a copy of the prisoner's conviction - I saw him tried, and know he is the man; I apprehended him for stealing eight books from Mr. Doyle's, in Holborn; he was found guilty, and had three months' imprisonment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was here in my life - it is totally false.</p>
               <p>MR. WONTNER. We believe he has been here, and I charged him with it as soon as he came.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DUNBAR. Q. Where had you been? A. I was coming from my duty in the Strand, where I am in the employ of the Post-office; I had been into that shop to look at my watch, and then put it into my fob; I was crossing towards Day and Martin's at the time - there were persons coming along; I felt it taken quite suddenly - I could not exactly tell from where the snatch came; I did not see the person or the hand - I did not turn to look in the direction it went; I had dined at home, at Battle-bridge, I think about three o'clock, and this was a quarter-past eight - I was on duty at five o'clock, and gave it up at six; I had called at a friend's house in Lincoln's Inn-fields, and there I had part of three pots of ale among four of us - I had left there about a quarter of an hour when I lost my watch; I saw the man when he ran away - I cannot swear to the prisoner; the shop I went into was a pawnbroker's, to ask what they would lend me on it - I am sure I did not slip it down by the side of my fob; I had a thick great coat on - it was not buttoned; I saw a man taken to the watch-house, but cannot say he was the man I saw run.</p>
               <p>PHILIP RILEY. I am a serjeant of the Police. I was in Holborn, and saw the witness - he cried Stop thief! I saw a man running - he ran round a cab, and dropped down before me; I took him - it was the prisoner; the watch was given to Tisdale.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where was this? A. A short distance from Little Turnstile - he was running from Day and Martin's; I was not aware of any fight - I saw a number of persons run when stop thief! was called; the cab was standing as if waiting for some person who had called at some house - I think the street was slippery; I thought the prisoner was struck at seeing me, but I do not know whether he fell by accident or design - I found these seals and chain in his hand; they do not belong to the prosecutor, and have not been claimed - at the watch-house I found six duplicates on the prisoner - two of them are for watches.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL TISDALE. I was on duty about eight o'clock- I saw the prosecutor, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I pursued a man I saw running - he slipped under a horse's head, and fell: the prosecutor was calling out,"Where is my child?" or, "Where is my boy?" and a hand was reached over with dark clothes - whether it was a pelisse or a coat I do not know, and some one said,"D-n your child, here is the watch;" I received the watch within five minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If the cab had been going on he must have been run over? A. Yes; I went up to the prosecutor when the prisoner was secured, and the watch was handed to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was running home from working with my cousin, who is a farrier, and I slipped down at the side of the curb - they said I had robbed the man.</p>

I lost a half-crown from my till last Tuesday; I had marked it, and put it into the till on Saturday morning, and saw it there at three o'clock on Tuesday - the officer afterwards took it from the prisoner, who gave no account of it; he is in my employ.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL CLEBERRY. I am an officer. The prosecutor called me in, and told me he had suspicion of the prisoner's robbing his till; the prisoner was then in the stable - he was called, and said he knew nothing about it; I searched him, and found this half-crown, with the mark on it, in his left-hand trousers pocket - he said, in going to the watch-house, that it was in consequence of his father not sending him up linen from Hertford, and he meant to convert it to his own use.</p>

               <p>MR. STEELE. No - I made the punch on Saturday morning, and marked them in ten minutes; that was after I gave him the 5s.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, declaring that he had received the half-crown from his master. He received a good character.</p>

I saw the deceased on the 9th of November, about four hours after her death - she had a bruise over her left eye, and a few slight scratches on the face; it appeared to have been done by the nails - she died of a fractured scull; there was a considerable quantity of extravasated blood on the brain - it was certainly caused by a fall; there was a small quantity of fluid in the stomach, which smelt of gin- she appeared to have been a stronger woman than the prisoner, and if sober, able to overcome her.</p>

This is a plaster of Paris mould, for the purpose of casting a counterfeit shilling - here is a counterfeit shilling in it; I have seen a great many of these moulds- this has the impression of the obverse and reverse sides of a shilling on it; it is the impression of a lawful and current shilling - the shilling in it has what is called the get or ridge attached to it; it is produced by pouring hot metal into the mould which adheres to the channel - this mould will produce the obverse and reverse sides of a shilling; I have had frequent opportunities of seeing coining implements all my life - the pipkin appears to have had metal melted in it; it is generally done in a pipkin - the metal is at times poured into the mould by a tobacco-pipe, but sometimes with a spoon of this description; this shilling was cast in the mould - I have compared it; it is counterfeit, made of white metal similar to pewter - I cannot exactly say what the other metal is- it is generally made of pewter mixed with tin; it is not silver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not a chemist? A. No; I consider it to be plaster of Paris from its appearance.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a moneyer of the Mint. The prisoner was not employed at the Mint.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been at the Mint? A. Seventeen years; there are now about sixty men and boys employed in the moneyer's department - I dare say there are a hundred persons in the service of the Mint altogether - I will not swear there are not one hundred and fifty; there may be many of them whom I never saw, or whose names I never heard.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLET. Q. Can you undertake to swear the prisoner was not employed at this moment at the Mint? A. No, I cannot - he is not employed in the moneyer's department certainly; that is the department in which the coming is carried on entirely from beginning to end - if he had been employed in the manufacture of coin I must have known it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you the principal in the department? A. No; I have hired the various persons for that department for ten years; there are five others who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030063"/>also hire - I can swear decidedly to each workman in that department.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLET. Q. Is this the sort of mould at the Mint? A. No; nobody could have a mould without authority of some of the moseyer's - there is no such thing as a mould in the Mint; the money is made in a different way - I know every person in the department.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could the prisoner be employed in any way in making money without your knowledge? A. Certainly not; I never saw him about the Mint.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never did such a thing in my life before - I leave it to the mercy of the Court.</p>
               <p>MR. FIELD re-examined. Q.Look at the shilling with the get to it, was that made in this mould? A. Yes, certainly; the obverse and reverse sides were produced by this mould - I have no doubt of the other shilling being also produced from this mould.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Look at the reverse side of the shilling found in the mould, it seems run and rather imperfect? A. Yes, it is an imperfect cast certainly - there is a sinking on the bottom of the head on the obverse side; it is an imperfect cast on both sides - there is no way to refresh the moulds; I have seen much worse shillings in circulation - I remember a half-crown mould being produced here last Session that had been nearly destroyed.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLET. Q. The mould sometimes produces a good and sometimes a bad impression? A. Yes; it depends in a great measure whether the metal is at a proper pouring heat; if it is too cold or too hot the impression will be bad - the shilling found in the room appears a tolerable fair impression for the mould; I think the mould is capable of casting a better impression.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it capable of casting such a figure or resemblance, or similitude as to impose on the world? A. I think it is.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You went there in consequence of information, I suppose? A. Yes; I had received information some time before - I did not know the prisoners before; Cartwright kept the house - they were all three in the room; there were two beds and two bedsteads - Fitzgerald said she was married, but that her husband was sent to Ireland; I did not hear which bed each one slept in - neither of them claimed the pocket.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS KEYS. I am a Police-constable. I accompanied the witnesses to the room; the door was shut - I do not know whether it was locked; I knocked, and Cartwright opened it - Cartwright addressed the prisoners in Irish, and they said something to each other; I saw Fitzgerald put her hand towards the fire-place, lay hold of something, and throw it into the fire - she reached her hand to the fire-place. and threw something into the fire; I pulled it off, and it was this metal - the pipkin was on the stove: I saw Drew put the metal into it; fits the bottom, and appeared to correspond with it - I searched under the fire-place, among the ashes, and found several pieces of plaster of Paris, and one of them appears to resemble the obverse side of a shilling; I found a counterfeit sixpence on the hob, not exactly finished - I got a candle, and on a ledge up the chimney found some more pieces of plaster of Paris; I found in a cupboard in the room, a mug, with plaster of Paris, and another mug of sand - I found a piece of tin, with plaster of Paris adhering to it, and a piece of rag, with plaster of Paris on it: on the mantel-piece over the fireplace, I found a new Queen's metal spoon - I found two iron spoons by the side of the fire-place; one appears to have been put on the fire - I found two knives with plaster of Paris on them. I was afterwards left in the room with the prisoners and Cartwright; Drew had gone down stairs - Connolly had been sitting on the side of the fire, on a pillow and blanket; she asked me to leave the room, as she wanted to use the chamber utensil - I refused, saying I was a married man; she went to the chamber-pot, then came back, and sat down in the same place again - in a few minutes she asked me again to leave the room; she went to the utensil, and while she was there Drew came up to the door - I said, "Wait a minute," but he opened the door, and came in; she went to the same place as she had been sitting in - I saw something white on the pillow, like plaster of Paris; I picked it up, and saw the impression of part of the obverse side of a sixpence on it; I produce it - it is now put more together: during all this time she had a child on her left arm - I told her to shift the child on to her right arm, which she did - I lifted her elbow up, and found this other piece, which has the grove in it, under her arm, between her skin and shift, and at the same time this bit of metal dropped from her; I have matched it with that mould, and it fits the get - I said, "What did you put them there for?" she said they were on the grate or hob when we came into the room, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030064"/>she put them there out of sight - she said, "What will be done to me for having them;" I told her to ask me no questions - I had said nothing to induce her to say any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Connolly. I did not desire him to leave the room, but to turn his back to me. Witness. Her words were, "Sir, will you leave the room?" I did not hear her desire me to turn my back; I omitted to state, that when they had been in conversation together, Cartwright ran down stairs, and I called to Fowler to stop her, which he did.</p>

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin. These moulds found under the bed are for casting counterfeit shillings; they bear an impression of the obverse and reverse sides, and are capable of producing an impression of a shilling likely to impose on the public - these other parts appear to be moulds for casting sixpences; both sides are here - one is broken, but here is the whole impression on it, on putting the two together: it is capable of giving the impression-stamp in similitude of a sixpence, which would impose on the public - the obverse side being broken, would of course not now do it; the reverse side is perfect - I cannot say whether it had been broken recently; this tin band might be used to form the mould into a shape - the plaster of Paris is poured into it; a tobacco pipe and pipkin are often used in coining - here is a piece of glass-paper, which is often used to rub off the sharp edges of the coin, to appear as if it had been in circulation; it is generally found in possession of coiners - I believe the sixpence produced to have been cast in this mould; it appears to fit it - this spoon is made of Britania metal, which is used in coining, and is often found in the possession of coiners; it is made of tin and antimony, which is the metal constituting the coin; the get produced appears to fit the mould for sixpences; the shilling moulds are as perfect as they are usually found - the impressions are as perfect as they generally are.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In your judgment, are the moulds capable of producing impressions likely to deceive the world, and to be passed into circulation? A. Yes - a farther process is required; after they come out of the mould the get has to be separated, and the edges filed down - the moulds only produce the impression; the sixpence must have been produced by the whole mould in a prefect state.</p>

            . I make images from plaster of Paris. The prisoner Fitzgerald came to my shop, and bought 3d. worth of plaster of Paris, three weeks ago - she took it away in a bag; it was superfine, and would make what has been produced; this mould is the same quality - it is the same colour and sort.</p>
               <p>Connolly's Defence. When I came to lodge there I was in much distress; I came to lay-in, and had neither money nor victuals - as to this woman, she is quite innocent of it.</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald's Defence. I had nothing to do with it; I sold caps in the street, and was out all day - I never saw any thing of this till the officers came; I never bought the stuff.</p>

I have known the prisoners six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030065"/>months: I was going up Whitechapel one day last month, between one and two o'clock, and saw them - they said,"Dick, here is a nick for a roll of squeeze;" that means, a chance for a roll of silk - they went into the prosecutor's shop, and asked for a halfpenny ball of cotton, then came out and I went in with them; they made me take the silk off the counter and put it under my coat - they kept touching my toe for me to take it; I carried it a little way -Scroggins then took it, and carried it into James' house; he went in first, Baker and I next - Scroggins said, "Mrs. James, I have got a roll of silk;" she said, "Oh, you young rascal, where did you get it?" he said, "Out of Whitechapel;" Baker said, "A shilling a yard" - Scroggins said,"No, we will take nothing less than 18d.;" she said she would give us that - she pulled it off the roll and measured it; there were forty yards and three quarters; she asked us to give her that bit for a bonnet, and we said Yes - she gave us a half sovereign, and told us to come at six o'clock and she would give us the rest; it came to 3l. - my share was 13s. 6d. - they gave me 3s. 6d. out of the half-sovereign: I went with them at six o'clock - they got 1l. 19s. 6d., and gave me a half-sovereign, and told me I must be contented with that; it was a blue black silk - John James, her husband, was looking over the shopboard with a drover; Scroggins said to me, "Ayn't you going to stand any gin, stand half a pint;" I gave them 6l. - Mr. James gave the drover a bottle, and he went and fetched the gin, and poured out a glass for a baker who was there, sitting by the fire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was all the talk about the silk before the drover? A. Yes; I am sure of that - I always heard the prisoners call silk a roll of squeeze; I know I am not very honest - I am nearly fourteen years old: I was accused of robbing my master, Mr. Plumber, of Eastcheap, of silver spoons - my mother paid for them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What time was this? A. After five o'clock - the lamps were lighted; I do not know whether it is usual for spirits to splash in casks; I was twenty or thirty yards off when I first saw it - I did not examine the cask to see if it was leaky; it appeared to me to be a distiller's can that it was poured out of - I would not undertake to swear the prisoners were the men, but their dress was similar, and one man was taller than the other - they appeared to me to belong to the waggon.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in St. John's-wood-road. The waggon arrived, brought by the two prisoners, about six o'clock in the evening - they said they had brought the pipe of gin, and delivered the note; they took it out as usual, in a four gallon can - I put it down on a slate; they brought in the last can, and said that made the quantity right - I said it did: Cornell then said to Blackmore."I think we can squeeze master out another, and if we can I dare say he will stand something handsome;" I took out a light, and they turned the cask up to empty it into a pail; it was about three parts full -I considered I had good measure, and was very well satisfied; all the gin in the pipe was my property - it does sometimes run over measure; the officer found two bottles- one had a seal on the cork of it, and that was also directed to a Mr. Johnson; the other bottle had only straw in the neck - it was gin, and certainly appeared of the same quality as that in the pipe - this is the bottle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you are liable for one hundred and twenty-five gallons? A. Yes - I considered I had that and the overplus; I was quite satisfied with the quality - I proved it by an instrument.</p>

On Wednesday evening, about eight o'clock, I was at Stoke Newington, and met Howsell with a cheese tied up in this apron, under his arm - I asked what he had got; he said a Gloucestester cheese, and he had brought it from up above; I asked the name of the place - he said he got it of a man with a donkey, for threepairs of shoes; I asked the value of the shoes - he said 5s. 6d. a pair; I said he must go to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>THOMAS WHITTER. I am servant to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner and two others come to our house - I saw the kettle while they were there; I missed it when they were gone, and there was a quart-pot over the fire, with hot water in it - the prisoner and his companions had a basket; I do not know which carried it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ESTILL. I am assistant to Mr. Price, a pawn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030070"/>broker. The prisoner brought this kettle, and asked 4s. for it; my master said I might lend 2s. on it, which I did.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There are many thousands like it- I am innocent of it; the pawnbroker cannot know me, as I never was in his house in my life - I had two shipmates with me, and if any one had taken the kettle it must have been seen.</p>

            . I copy music. On the 28th of November, at half-past five o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another boy; they went by Mr. Jackman's shop, and round the corner of Denmark-street - the prisoner shortly after came away from his companion, and went up to the shoes, which were fastened at the door with some iron wire; he pulled one pair, and another pair fell - his companion came up, and held out his hand to take them; the prisoner saw me coming, and dropped them - I took them up, and watched his companion, who went on to another street, and joined the prisoner; I gave charge of the prisoner - I had never seen him before, but I am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where do you live? A.At. No. 68, Davies-street - I have given evidence in a case before, in which I took the prisoner, because I saw him commit a felony; I was a prosecutor myself once, and have given evidence in two cases, I believe - I was here last Session, and two or three Sessions before; I saw the prisoner try to take some cloaks in Oxford-street - I did not try to take him then; he was in Crown-street when I took him - I had my expences in the former prosecutions.</p>

            . On the 28th of November I heard a pair of shoes fall; I went to the door, and saw a pair lying - I looked out, and saw a man run away; the witness gave me these shoes, which are my master's - he went out, and brought the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether your master was asked to come here to-day? A. No, he was not- the person I saw running was about fifteen yards from me; he went in a straight line - I heard no cry of Stop thief! this witness was formerly in my master's employ.</p>

               <p>JAMES ALDRIDGE. I am errand-boy to Mr. Edward Wrench, of Gray's Inn-terrace, Gray's Inn-lane. On the 23rd of November I was going down Saffron-hill, and saw the prisoner in his shop - he called me, gave me 3d., and asked where I worked, and what I worked at; I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030073"/>him, and he said,</p>
               <p>"Do you think you could get any thing?" I said, "I dare say I might," and then went on my errand; that was the first I saw of him - on the Saturday night I took him three pairs of spectacles; I thought he meant could I steal any thing, when he asked if I could get any thing; on Saturday night he was behind his counter - on the Monday I went again, and took him seven pairs more; he gave me 2s. for them, but said they were not so good as those I took him at first. and he could get such as them at 4d. or 6d. a pair - he had given me 1s. for the first three pairs; I afterwards took him a little telescope, six pairs more of spectacles, and a gold eye-glass - he gave me some money, and said it was only plated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Have you ever had any conversation with him before? A. No - by"getting" I understood him to mean to steal - he did not say what he would give me; I mentioned this to the Magistrate at the second examination - I was told by a boy to take a silver spoon about a month ago; it was taken to Mr. Saunders' by the boy - he was stopped, and we were both taken; I said I knew nothing about the spectacles - I did not say I would swear I never had them; my father took one pair, which I told him I had found - they were stolen; my father said, "Tell me the truth where you found them, and I will keep them till I find an owner."</p>
               <p>JOSEPH EVANS. I live with my parents, in Ravenshall-rents, Liquorpond-street. Aldridge came to our house, called me out, and gave me a silver spoon to sell; I sold two pairs of spectacles and an eye-glass to the prisoner on Saturday week - he gave me 8d. for the spectacles, and 3d. for the eye-glass; I saw Aldridge take two pairs of spectacles to the prisoner's shop, for which he gave him 8d. - I took two more, for which he gave me 8d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If he has sworn you told him to steal the spoon. it is not true? A. No - he told me he had picked it up; I never stole any thing- I have not come from the prison; my father bailed me - I was in prison about six months ago, for being with some boys who stole a vice and some snuff-boxes; the Magistrate liberated me - I was never in prisoner about any thing else; I am twelve years old.</p>
               <p>JOHN LIMBRICK. I am an officer. I received information, and went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's on the 23rd of November, and asked if he had bought any spectacles of a boy - he hesitated; I said I should search if he did not answer - he then turned, and gave me eleven pairs and an eye-glass off the shelf; I asked if he had any thing else - he said No; I took him to Hatton-garden and saw Aldridge, who said there was an opera-glass - the prisoner then said, "Yes, I have one - it is on a shelf in my window;" I went back, and his wife gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Has not the prisoner served the office of constable, and carried on a respectable business? A. Yes.</p>

             THOMPSON. I am a Police-patrol. I saw the prisoner, at a quarter before six o'clock, on the 23rd of November, run out of the Uxbridge-road, about a mile from Tyburn-gate - knowing him, I went and caught him; I asked what he had got - he said Nothing; I put my hand into his bosom, and pulled out a wet pockethandkerchief - he pulled it out of my hand, and said,"What do you want with my pocket-handkerchief?" I called my brother officer, and we took him - I found these other handkerchiefs wet on him; he said they were his also.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he found them? A. Yes, in Black Lion-lane, wrapped up in a white rag, which he had thrown away - they were in his different pockets.</p>
               <p>JOHN BICKER. I was with Thompson - what he has stated is correct.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked them up in a cloth; I took them out, and threw the cloth away, as it was all over mud.</p>

               <p>JAMES FOGG. I am a Thames Police-constable. I had had some conversation with Mr. Stewart, and went to the shop; I saw Lee and another boy walking backwards and forwards, and Phillips working in the shop, and now and then he came to the door and spoke to Lee - I told my brother to go one way, and I would go the other; in a few minutes I saw Lee come along with this kettle - I caught him; I did not see who he got it from - he said a boy had given it, him. and had ran away; I took him to the Ship, and asked if Phillips was the boy - he said No;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030074"/>he afterwards told his sister at the office, that Phillips gave it him, while he put his coat on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he say Phillips gave it him to take to a person? A. No; there is no window to the shop - it is a half sash, and the door was closed; he could see what Phillips was doing when he stopped - he spoke to him two or three times.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen that kettle in the morning? A. I saw the shelf full; I do not know that I I had seen this - if one had been sold, I should have been told of it; I have, I suppose, a hundred kettles - they are all marked.</p>
               <p>Phillips' Defence. I was not at work; I never work after six o'clock at night; it was a quarter-past six - I went up for my jacket; I put it on, and called my mate Dick - while I was calling him the gentleman came in, and said, "Who gave this boy a kettle;" I said, "What kettle?" he said, "You gave the boy a kettle;" I said No, and he put on the handcuffs, and took me to the watch-house - if I had robbed my master, it was easy to escape.</p>

The two prisoners came to my shop between four and five o'clock on the 30th of November; Davis asked to look at some prints - I think I had seen her before- I am sure she is the person who came in, with the other prisoner: I showed them a great variety of prints; they were very difficult to please, but after a length of time Smith selected a piece, and told me to cut off seven yards; she paid me a shilling, and said she would call on the Saturday following, and pay me - as they were going from the shop my young man said he thought they had taken a piece of print- we pursued, brought them back, and Davis dropped this print; I had gone two or three times to the window, and to the end of the shop, to get prints for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. It is not at all unusual for poor people to pay part? A.No; I did not look on the counter before I went after them - Davis dropped this piece on the floor; I did not say I did not see her drop it, but saw her take it from the floor: I brought Smith back, and my young man brought Davis; they were not examined in the street - they were only just outside the shop - we went in altogether; I am sure I saw Davis drop it - she was in a stooping position. and it is difficult to say whether it dropped from her shawl or her petticoat; I am sure this print was not laying in the shop when I went out, for I must have stepped on it or have seen it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Were they close together when they were bargaining? A. Yes - they talked together, and one rose while the other sat down in the chair.</p>

               <p>Davis' Defence. We went to buy a gown - Smith paid 1s.; we came out - the prosecutor and shopman followed us, and said, "Come back;" I said, "Certainly - what do you want?" he said he should send for an officer, as we had stolen a piece of print; I said, "How can you say so? here is a piece on the floor;" he said at the office that I dropped it, and he put it on the counter, and then the young lady said I dropped it from under my gown.</p>

On the 15th of October the prisoner came and asked for 1d. worth of bread and cheese, and then asked for 2d. worth - he said he was in a great hurry, and gave me a half-crown- I said I had not change for more than a shilling, and gave the half-crown to Yeoman to get change; while she was gone the prisoner wasin a great hurry, and asked me for the shilling which I had in my hand; he said he had a friend waiting, he would take the shilling, and call in a quarter of an hour for the rest of the change; I gave him the shilling, and he went away - Yeoman came in directly, and returned me the half-crown; I went round to Burton's winevaults, which is about two hundred yards off, and found him drinking there - I showed him the half-crown, and told him it was bad; he asked me to walk out with him - he took it in his hand, looked at it, and said it might be his or not; I asked him for my shilling - he took it out of his pocket, and I took it out of his hand; I told him to pay me for the bread and cheese, or I would apprehend him - he said he could not do that, for he had no money; I got hold of his hand, and took the half-crown out of it; the tried to get away - I followed him towards Giltspur-street, and stopped him in Bartholomew-close; I gave the officer the same half-crown - as nothing was found on him, my husband thought it best to discharge him.</p>
               <p>MARY YEOMAN. I was charing at Burridge's, and she gave me the half-crown; I could not get it changed, and returned it to her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not take it out of your pocket? A. No, it never went out of my hand.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HOWARD. I took the prisoner in charge, and received this crown-piece from Roberts; I found no money on the prisoner, but 1l. 0s. 6 1/2d. in good money on the other man.</p>

I have known Kemp six years; about the 1st of August last I employed him to assist me in the sale of some pictures - I went to Bristol with him, and took the paintings with us; after being there some time I had occasion to come to town, and left him there with them - he went to Weymouth, Exeter, and Southampton, then returned to London, and delivered me forty-three paintings, at the Gerrard's-hall, Basing-lane, about the middle of October; they were Flemish and Dutch paintings chiefly - he said, "There they are for you, safe and sound;" I said they were not sound, for one was badly packed - I went to Gerrard's-hall on the Tuesday, and cleaned it - they were all there then: on the Sunday following I went to Gerrard's-hall, and they were gone; I found them next day, the 29th of October, at Mr. Smart's, Titchbourne-street - I did not then know Malcolm; I went and saw him at Greenwood's, a map-seller, in Regent-street - I then went to a Police-man, called on Malcolm, and asked him about my pictures: he said he had them in his possession, and I might do my best - I asked where they were; he would not tell me - he said he got them from Kemp, and had given him 80l. for them; and that I might go to law to recover them; I said I would get a warrant to apprehend him - he said that was not the way, that I should go regularly to law: the pictures are now in the officer's possession - they are invoiced to me at 457l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Did you ever advertise in the Times for a situation as lithographer? A. Yes; I never proposed to Kemp to go to Dublin and set up as a surveyor and architect - he made such a proposition to me seven years ago: when we went to Bristol our agreement was that I was to give him one third of the profits on pictures he sold: they were mine - they were sent to me by Cune and Marniffe, at a certain price; they have often drawn bills on me for pictures before I sold them - they sent me some on commission, and some at a certain price; these were sent at a price - I was to have all I could get above that sum, and agreed to give Kemp one third of that profit on what he sold; we travelled together - I never heard of his pawning his watch to keep me from starving, or a double-barrelled gun; I heard of a gun being parted with - I did not get the money; I received 20l. from him when he sent me an account of pictures sold - I do not know who had the delivery-ticket for the pictures, or whether there was one: I was not told there was one, and I could not have them without it - the prisoner had brought them from Southampton; he did not tell me there was a delivery-ticket - I told the people at Gerrard's-hall they were to remain there a few days.</p>
               <p>Q.Had not Kemp a claim on you for 79l. and upwards? A.After Malcolm was arrested he made that claim, but never before - he has paid me 54l. 2s. 8d., on account of pictures.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not produced an account of a payment of 54l. 2s. 8d. by Kemp, and yourself of 61l. 4s.? A. I do not recollect the items; I have given the account that was settled by Kemp - I have got 31l. 10s. above the invoice price on a picture, but, calculating the expences, there was no profit - ten guineas of that was Kemp's property, but the expences were to be borne equally by us; he was only to have a share in the profit on what he sold - I told him I was not obliged to pay Cune and Co. for them, till I had sold them, and that I was at liberty to return them: I never said, if sold at less than the invoice they reduced them -Kemp participated in the difference between the invoice price and what they sold at; they were consigned to me by them - I told Kemp I had sold a pair of pictures for 35l. which were marked at 15l. I frequently go to the Shades, in Westminster-road; so does Kemp - we have met there a dozen times, I dare say; I never took my invoices there, and could not have shown them to him there- he has had them in his possession; he was to have one third of the profits - he was engaged as my agent or servant, and I was the agent of Cune and Co.; the pictures left in Kemp's custody, were what he was to sell- he told me he was in the habit of canvassing for Greenwood and Co. at Bristol, which induced me to employ him; it was never proposed to allow him one half the profits - I got a 45l. bill discounted with Mr. Tenant; it was not that money that took me to Bristol; I received it about a week before I went, and left it in town - Kemp paid the expences down and at Bristol; but he kept an account of it, and the expences were to be divided; it was done with my money, but his hand paid it - it was not his money; I gave him money as soon as we got to Bristol - he was to pay one half.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he not pay 20l., out of his own pocket, towards a bill of 80l., drawn by Cune and Co., that was dishonoured? A. Yes, when he came to London - it was not dishonoured; I had received 60l. at Bristol - he said he wanted to come up to see his wife and children, that he had a 20l. bill in London, which his friend Malcolm would discount, and he would advance the 20l.; I had only three day's notice of the bill - I did not tell him if he could not advance the 20l. they would send no more pictures, for I knew they would; I had 400l. coming due in a very few days - I never had an execution in my house; I never produced a letter to him stating that there was.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. The pictures were consigned to you, and were your exclusive property? A. They were: he had not the least title to them - he was not at all responsible for the payment of them to the consignees; he sent me an account of money due to him, three days after Malcolm was taken - here is an account I settled with him before Malcolm was taken; it is the final settlement, when he came to town, and by this he makes himself a debtor to me of 8l. 15s. 9d., and adds 3l. odd for expences, making 15l. - that is his settlement, in his own writing; I then discharged him; I paid him the 20l. he advanced - I never intimated that he was to consider himself my partner; he had no authority from me to do any thing with the pictures, after delivering them at Gerrard's-hall.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The brother was acquitted, because you said you might be mistake in the hand that touched your watch? A. Yes; as there were two or three round me, I might mistake which hand of the two rose up - the other man was nearest to me; I had been to Islington, but had nothing to make me intoxicated - I had part of two pints of beer before we started; we had a glass of gin, and two glasses of gin and water among five of us before we parted - I swore to the other man's person, but not that he struck me; when he was taken he said,</p>
               <p>"What the devil is the matter?" he was the only man who spoke to me; I am perfectly sure the prisoner is the man who knocked me down - the other man surrendered to be tried, and so has the prisoner; I applied for a warrant when my wife got better, and he surrendered, but he was not to he found when I went fora officer to the gravel-pits - I saw he was not at work in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030080"/>came across, and met him at the corner - he fell back to shun me, and went round somewhere; on the night of the robbery he had a fustian jacket on - I will not swear it was fustian; it was a brown jacket of that kind - he did not wear a coat; I gave his description at Worship-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were just as certain about the other man? A.

            , a gravel-digger, who was tried for this offence. On Sunday night, the 1st of November, I saw the prisoner at my house in St. John-street, Stoke Newington - he arrived there about twenty minutes past eight o'clock; he had on the coat which he now wears - he asked me to make him some tea, which I did; he laid his head down, and went to sleep, and about a quarter or half-past eleven o'clock went home to his lodgings, Bowling-green, Stoke Newington - he had been with me till then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How far is Stoke Newington from Clapton? A. I dare say it is better than two miles, or more, from Tile-kiln-lane - I know the time, for the eight o'clock beer had come; the lad had hardly gone from the door when he came, and we have a clock; my husband had been to Woodford that day to meet his father and two of his brothers - the prisoner was not one of them; he went out between three and four o'clock that morning, with a pack on his back; he did not return, but was taken to the watch-house - the prisoner lodges about a quarter of a mile from me; he did not tell me my husband was taken up - he has assisted my husband to catch birds on a Sunday, but seldom on a working day; he did not appear to have been running, but was very much intoxicated.</p>
               <p>JAMES RICE. I work at the gravel-pits for Mr. Hindle- the prisoner has worked there for eight or nine years; I remember his brother being taken for this robbery on the Sunday; on the Tuesday after that the prisoner was at work with us from eight o'clock in the morning till sever at night all through the day; it was the 3rd of November - I went to dinner at twelve, and left him in the gravel-pits; I returned about a quarter to one - he has four brothers; they are not so much alike as to be mistaken for each other.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BARKER. I work at Mr. Roll's, and know the prisoner: I saw him on Sunday, the 1st of November, as near eight o'clock in the evening as can be, either before or after, in the footpath between Hobson's brick-fields, near Dalston - he had the same coat on as he has now, it was a long coat of the same colour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you ever see him in a jacket? A. Yes - Newington is about half an hour's walk from Dalston fields, but he was as tipsy as he could be; I have known him catch birds, but never on a Sunday - it was in frosty weather, when he could not work. I stood talking to him, and noticed his coat - I knew nothing of the last trial - I happened to say I had met him, and his brother came and asked me to come here; I heard the prosecutrix had said he had a jacket on - he was with me all day on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>JOHN HINDLE. The prisoner was upwards of ten years in my service, and is an industrious, sober, and honest man; I know he was at work in my field on the Wednesday, and I paid him for a day's work on Tuesday- Roberts was with me all day on Friday, and surrendered here about five o'clock; he could not have been in Newgate-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you bring any tea from the chests? A. No - one tea is very like another; the prisoner is a weekly servant, and has a wife and two or three children.</p>

On the Wednesday after I met serjeant Riley, Seymour, and Mansfield, at the King's Head, Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields - my things were all taken off, and I was searched; I had my coat and waistcoat taken off, my trousers were down - my boots were taken off, and my pockets turned inside out; I had nothing on me but a punch to mark the money - I then received from Riley one shilling and one halfpenny, which he said he had marked; I went with Seymour to the Pheasant - I sat down, and Seymour sat at some distance from me - the prisoner was there when I went in, and offered me some beer; he asked what I wanted - I said five; he said, "Give me the money, and I will fetch you five good ones," as I had complained of the others being badly finished - he then left me, and was gone about ten minutes- he then brought in five bad shillings, and threw them down; I had given him the shilling before - I said, "I have to give you another halfpenny, and that will make all right;" the shilling and halfpenny I gave him were what I had received from Riley; the prisoner was then taken by Riley, Mansfield, and Seymour, and searched in the public-house - I was then taken to the watch-house; the five bad shillings were in my right-hand trousers pocket: Riley took them, and marked them.</p>

Thurtel acted under my directions - on the 23rd of November I searched him in the presence of Seymour and Mansfield -I searched his coat, waistcoat, and trousers as narrowly as ever I searched a person in my life; I have known him since he has been in the Police, and have reason to believe he is an honest person - I went afterwards to the Pheasant, with Mansfield, and remained there about three minutes at the door, when Seymour came out, and said, "It is all right;" I then went in, and saw Thurtel sitting, and the prisoner standing by his side - I said to Thurtel, "What have you got there?" I took his left hand, opened it, and the shillings fell on the table; I said, "Where did you get these?" he said, "From that man," pointing to the prisoner; I handcuffed them both together - I put my hand into the prisoner's pocket, and took out a shilling and some halfpence, which I put into Mansfield's hand; Thur<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030082"/>tel took the five bad shillings to the watch-house - I found the shilling and halfpenny which I had given to Thurtel in the prisoner's pocket, and about 6d. worth of halfpence more.</p>

I said No - he said, "I have some friends I can depend upon to make away with them," and on the four different times he had these of me- I had sat with him on the Friday the greater part of the day, and he said if I would lend him a little he would pay me. and I lent him 1s. 4d. or 1s. 6d.; he went out, came in again, and said he wanted five of those things which he gave me, and I gave them to him; I acknowledge I had them, but I got them from this man, and he was afraid I should have him up for something he owned me.</p>

On the 28th of November a person came into my shop, and said, "That was a beautiful piece of beef I had of you," and as he spoke I thought there was something wrong, and missed a side of pork from my door; I went out, but saw no one - I afterwards saw Mr. Keymer at his door, twenty or thirty yards from me; he told me the prisoner and two others had come out of his house just before - I went into his skittle-ground, but no one was there; I went back to my shop, and a little boy told me something - I went up the street, but I have not seen the pork since.</p>

On the 4th of November, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was returning home, up Bishopsgate-street; whether I accosted the prisoner and his friend, or they me, I cannot say, but they said they were going my way, and took hold of my arm - I said they were very kind; when we got on to Shoreditch church I said, "I will bid you good night, but if we can get any thing to drink I will treat you" - we knocked at a public-house, but could not get in, and one of them said, "We can get it a little higher up;" we went to a house in Kingsland-road, and knocked at the door - I put my hand to my pocket to get 6d., but could not find it; I had a hole in my pocket, and supposed I had lost it - they seemed irritated to think I had made fools of them; I said, "To convince you that I have property, I will leave my watch" - I took it out of my pocket; the prisoner took it out of my hand, and ran down a turning - I pursued him, but just as I came up to him I fell down; I got up again, and to my astonishment the prisoner was in custody - I said to him, "You rascal," with an intermediate word which I have no occasion to repeat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you sober? A. I had taken a little to drink, but I was not exactly drunk - this watch was my own; I was never accused of stealing it - I was accused of stealing a watch, but nothing else; I do not recollect being charged with stealing a box from Smith, a painter - I know him, and have drank with him; he might have said it out of a joke- I did take a brooch out of his shirt once, and gave it to Collins, the publican; I said, "I have got Smith's brooch," and we had a glass of brandy and water - Smith<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030083"/>was not asleep at the time; he was standing in the skittle-ground; he never turned me out of the house - I am a book-vender; I know the Tiger public-house; I was in the custody of an officer, but I do not think proper to tell you what for - to the best of my recollection it was for breaking the shutter of a bad house, where I had been insulted; I remained in custody till I got out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long were you in custody? A. A few hours - I was brought before the Magistrate, but he would not hear the evidence; there were two or three prostitutes came against me, and the watchman with the bit of the shutter - I am a subscriber at the Ivy-house, and one evening I wished to get home soon, and I asked a young man what time it was; he felt his pocket, and said "I have lost my watch" - I said, "If you think I have your watch, I wish you may have lost it;" I was surrounded by I suppose fifty persons, and one of my friends said, "If you have taken it in a joke give it back, and another said I will go with any friend of yours, and see if he left it at home;" they went, and found it at his father's, and his father came to the public-house and said,"I don't wish to have any thing done to my son;" he offered me any money, but I would not take it, and he went, and spent 10s., because I had not prosecuted his son for charging me with so diabolical an act.</p>
               <p>EDWARD OXBY. I am a watchman. On the night of the 3rd of November, at half-past twelve, I heard a cry of Watch! I was in Kingsland-road - I ran over, and saw the prisoner come out of a court; I took him - I found nothing on him, but this inside of a watch at his heels - another watchman found the case: I did not see it fall - the prosecutor came up, and said he had lost his watch; he was surprised to see the prisoner in custody.</p>

               <p>MR. SUMPTON. I have acted as constable in Shoreditch, in my own right - I had the prosecutor in custody for three hours on suspicion of stealing a watch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he discharged on the watch being found? A. I do not recollect, it is some time ago - from what I know of his character I would not believe him upon his oath; I have known him eight years - he goes about swindling people in skittle-grounds.</p>

             . I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner on Friday night, and asked where the duplicate was - she said, "My husband has got it;" I found nothing on her, but the next morning I heard she had it, and went and asked her for it - she gave it me, and said she had pawned them , but did not say where.</p>

            . I took the blankets in pawn from the prisoner.( Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I pawned them, but did not steal them; I had but a few shillings to go to market with; I said to my husband, "I will pawn these blankets" - I was unlucky in not taking money, and could not release them.</p>
