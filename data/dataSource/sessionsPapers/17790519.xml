             the prisoner is an opposite neighbour of mine.</p>
               <p>Is she a married woman? - Yes. About three weeks ago she brought a watch to me and said she had it to dispose of; I looked at it; I thought it a very indifferent watch; I showed it to a person who I thought was a proper judge, and was informed it was worth but 18 s. I bought the watch of her; I never confisticated it. Bolton keeps a clothes shop.</p>

               <p>The CONSTABLE sworn.</p>
               <p>I searched Mrs. Gatty's house, and found the watch. I believe there is an evidence in jail that sold the watch to Bolton.</p>

               <p>I bought the watch. As Weverton had asked me if I had a watch to dispose of, I said I had not; and he desired me, if one came in my way to buy it for him.</p>

               <p>These are the sashes we found in the prisoner's shop. On the 14th or 15th of April the prisoner was in custody; we had a warrant to search his house; we found some pieces of sashes that belong to Mr. Harrison.</p>
               <p>Did you find any whole sashes? - No; they were in pieces.</p>
               <p>Had you seen them at Mr. Harrison's house? - Yes; I fitted them in; I made a cross upon them with a chissel; I know them to be pieces of Mr. Harrison's sashes. they were only put in temporarily.</p>
               <p>Must they have been taken out again to be hung? - Yes; to put in the weights and lines.</p>
               <p>Is it the common practice to put up the sashes before they are hung? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had they been in? - I suppose six months.</p>
               <p>Were they completed? - So far as that they only wanted hanging; when they are hung and the beads nailed they are complete.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When did you make this cross? - When I fitted it in.</p>

               <p>I am a glazier, and live at No. 5, Jewry-street. On the 15th of April, I had the prisoner taken up on suspicion of stealing six pair of sashes from a building, belonging to one Mr. Seagrow, in Constitution-Row, leading to Pancras. On the 14th he came to my shop with sixteen squares of glass in a box; I had had some of him a few days before, which I had not paid for; coming again with sixteen more, I suspected him; I did not pay him for them, as he said he was coming again in the afternoon. I went to a person and told him I had bought squares of a man several times, and did not know what to think of it; I was then informed of an advertisement of six sashes that had been stolen. The prisoner came the next morning, and I had him taken up; he then said he bought them at sales, and got them from old houses he pulled down; that he took the glass out and made rounds of ladders of the frames.</p>
               <p>Can they take the glass out of the frames without breaking of it? - They must break a great many; those brought to me were not broke.</p>
               <p>Can you tell by the glass when it has been taken out of frames? - Yes. I did not think that the glass was taken out of new frames.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190005"/>What did you give for the glass? - Sixpence a foot; that is as much as any body gives for old glass.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in the business? - Sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see a house where the sashes were put in their place without being hung? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you seen any houses that were inhabited where the sashes were in their place but not hung? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not carpenters frequently buy sash frames? - Yes; old sash frames and glass together?</p>
               <p>Do not they sell the glass to glaziers? - Yes if they choose it.</p>

               <p>I made the frames for Mr. Harrison. I I have seen the pieces of frames; as far as my knowledge goes they are the frames I made; they answer the dimensions in every point.</p>
               <p>They seem to be remarkably stout frames? - They are what we call two inch sashes.</p>
               <p>(The pieces of frames and a square glass were produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is a remarkably crooked square and it fits the putty in that frame exactly.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As I was coming out of Mr. Maddox's timber-yard one day, a man called to me and asked me if I would buy a couple of old sashes of him; I looked at them, and thought they would do for my own shop; I bought them of him at five pence a foot. When I brought them home they would not fit; I took them to a glazier, and he would not buy them, the putty being hard, without I would take the glass out. I went home and took the glass out and carried it to Mr. Smith, and he gave me six pence a foot for it. A few days after a man brought me two pair of new sashes, which he said belonged to a widow who wanted to dispose of them. I took a pair of them to Mr. Smith, and he would not give me any more than the price of the glass for them, upon which I took them back and took the glass out; one Kelley was in the shop when I bought the two pair, I borrowed four shillings of him to pay for them.</p>
               <p>To Smith. Did he bring you two whole sashes? - He brought me a pair of little sashes, which he said he made himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have been in business but three months. I did not know but I was very safe in buying them. Kelly said he would not come till two o'clock; he was obliged to go to the Excise-office. I did not think my tryal would come on so soon.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. What is the value of it? - About 2 s. 4 d. a foot, the whole is worth about five pounds I believe.</p>

He brought them in the evening; I think candles were lighted. He said they were his wife's buckles, but his name was on the inside of them. He said his name was

               <p>On the 2d of February I supped and spent the evening at the Red-Lion, at Barnet, with the Northampton corps of officers. Between two and three in the morning a part of us came for London. As we were to come over Finchley-common, I put my property in a small pocket-book, to the amount, in money and notes, of 51 l. 10 s. 6 d.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190008"/> came to Mr. Wood's hotel in <placeName id="t17790519-7-crimeloc40">Covent Garden</placeName>

               <p>You had a lodging at this hotel for some time before? - Yes, all the winter; but the prisoner had not been porter all that time. I enquired if he had found any pocketbook in my boots; he said he had not; I told him if he had, I would reward him properly for it if he would deliver it to me, he still persisted in declaring he had not seen it; I enquired of the other porters and the people about the house, and they all denied it. I mentioned it to Mr.

             the next morning; he advised me to advertise them, which I did the next morning, offering ten guineas reward for their restoration. I sent into the country the next morning, and had an exact description of the notes. After receiving that description, I went to the Bank and stopped the payment of the bank post-bill; I went to the banker's, where the Bath bank post bill was payable, and stopped the payment of that. A fortnight or three weeks after I received a letter from Mr. Langston, a banker in St. Clement's-Lane, where the Bath bills are payable, informing me, that such a bill I had given him notice of had been offered for acceptance. Upon the receipt of that letter, Mr. Wood (who has indeed been indefatigable in the matter) attended me to the banker's. They said a porter had brought the bill, who said, he came from the Cannon Coffee-house. We went there; the porter there denied it; we took him to the banker's; the banker could not identify the person of that man; but from a great many circumstances, we presumed it was the prisoner. I was informed by the constable in the evening, that the bank post bill was found upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you loose any money. - The pocketbook contained eight guineas; a bank bill for twenty-seven pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence; a Bath bank bill for five guineas and a bank note for ten pounds; in the whole fifty-one pounds ten shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect where you pulled your boots off? - In my own room.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect who took them? - No. There is one circumstance I should mention: as I came in very late, and was a good deal tired, I desired the chamberlain to undo the boot, because it was fastened in a particular manner at the knee; and then I recollect the boots being upon the ground subsequent to the chamberlain's being in the room, but whether he took the boots away or not I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>You sat up very late, was you perfectly sober? - I cannot say that I was perfectly sober, but I was well enough to recollect every circumstance that passed.</p>
               <p>Did you ride on horse-back to town? - No, in a chaise.</p>
               <p>Was the pocket-book in the leg of the boot or under your foot? - I put it below my calf, it is a very small pocket-book, what is called a Newmarket pocket-book.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect when the chamberlain went out of the room? - I do not recollect who took the candle out that night.</p>
               <p>I understood you, that when you rung the bell for the porter, and the prisoner came up, he told you he had taken your boots down and had cleaned them? - Yes; but it is usual some times for the chamberlain to come in, and take the boots out of the room, and put them out at the door.</p>
               <p>I suppose it is not usual for the porter to be in the bed-chambers? - It is an unusual thing to see a porter in a bed-chamber, unless he is rung for to light the fire or so. The prisoner has had it in his power to take property of mine to three times that amount; my box was always open, and he was frequently backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This happened on the 2d of February? - Yes</p>
               <p>Did not you go back the next day to the inn at Barnet from an apprehension that you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190009"/> might have left the book there? - I did; but I had not the least doubt in my own mind where I had left it, but Mr. Wood said possibly I might have dropped it in the chaise, or have left it there.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On a Saturday morning when I returned from market, Captain Phillips told me he had lost his pocket-book, and mentioned the circumstance he has now related to the court. The prisoner at the bar was the porter whose turn it was to sit up that night; I charged him with taking the pocket-book; he denied it strongly. I laid before him all the consequences of such behaviour; and we offered all the servants a reward for the pocket-book. They all said they knew nothing about it. I advised Mr. Phillips to go back to Barnet, that probably he might have left it at the inn or in the chaise; but we could hear nothing of it for some time. About a fortnight after I turned the prisoner away, we received a letter from Clement's Lane of the five guinea Bath bill being stopped; I gave the letter to Captain Phillips; we went there. I asked if they could recollect what kind of man it was that brought it; they gave a description which nearly answered to the prisoner; they told us the porter said he came from the Cannon coffee-house; as I had turned the prisoner away the day before, I supposed he was gone to live there. We went to the Cannon coffee-house; we saw the master of the house; he produced a porter much resembling the prisoner. We took him back to the banker. When he came there they thought him much like the man that brought the note, but could not identify him. We asked the porter several questions, whether he knew the prisoner; we found he knew him very well; he also knew one Matthews who had formerly lived with me, who likewise was very intimate with the prisoner. I sent for Matthews; he came about eleven o'clock at night; he said he had seen the prisoner; having been rather kind to the young fellow, I said, Do you know Will that lived with me? Yes, I do. When did you see him? I saw him yesterday. I said I have been no bad friend to you, I insist upon your telling me the truth; have you seen any notes upon him, or seen him full of cash lately? he said yes; a Bath bank note.</p>
               <p>Is that man here? - Yes; he said, he received the note from Stout to get it accepted, but it had been stopped.</p>
               <p>Did he say how much the Bath bank bill was for? - Yes; for five guineas.</p>
               <p>Did he say where he went with it to get it accepted? - To the banker's in Clement's Lane. I asked him if he had seen Stout with any other bills or with money; he said, yes; there was a bank post bill for twentyseven pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence, which he had to carry to the bank; he said he mistrusted something, as the banker refused to accept the bill; he was therefore afraid things were not right, and he returned it again to him; I asked him if he recollected where the prisoner lodged; he said, he did; and had no objection to go with me to take him. I called upon Mr. Prothero, and we both went and took him in bed at his lodgings; we charged him with the fact; he produced the bank post bill, and gave it up, and he seemed sorry he had not given it up before.</p>
               <p>(The bank post bill was produced in court by

               <p>Court. Do you remember the date of it? No; I took no private memorandum myself, I received it from my mother in the country,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190010"/> it was cut in this manner when I received it at two different posts.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the sum of it? - I do.</p>
               <p>(The note was read in Court, and corresponded with the statement of it in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>What did you recollect with regard to this note before you received a letter out of the country? - I recollected the value, to whom it was made payable, and whom it was indorsed by.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known the prisoner four years.</p>
               <p>When did you receive any notes from him? - He came to me on the 20th or 21st of April; he called at my lodgings, as my landlord informed me; not being at home, he came to me at Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.</p>
               <p>To Wood. Was that after you turned him away? - I believe the same day.</p>
               <p>Matthews. He called me out; he took out this note of five pounds five shillings, as we were going along Portugal-street. He told me he had left Mr. Wood's.</p>
               <p>What did he take it out of? - Out of his pocket; it being cut in two, I told him I did not think it was good. I went to the banker's in Clement's Lane, it being three minutes past five o'clock, they bid me call in the morning; I called in the morning; they said it belonged to a gentleman that had lost it; they asked me where I brought it from; I said from the Cannon coffee-house; I called upon the prisoner, and asked him to take a walk with me, because I wanted him to speak before witnesses; I wanted to ask him him how he came by it; then he pulled out the other note of twenty-seven pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Should you know it if you was to see it again? - I dare say I should; it was in two pieces.</p>
               <p>(The note shown to the witness.)</p>
               <p>This is the note to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner desire you to do with that note? - As we were going along, I asked him how he came by that? he said he found it, and he wanted me to pass it; we went before this to an acquaintance where I asked him the question how he came by it.</p>
               <p>Who was that? - One Mr. Allen in Tottenham Court Road? the prisoner said he found them and the four guineas at the foot of the stairs, in Mr. Wood's house.</p>
               <p>Did he say whether he found this loose, or how? - He said he found the pocket-book at the foot of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Did he mention any thing of a pair of boots? - Not at that time. I asked him if Mr. Wood, and the Gentleman, never asked him about them; he said, yes; but as he had once denied it, he would never own it; and he wanted to persuade me to take this note of 27 l. 17 s. 6 d. back to Mr. Wood, and say I found it; I told him I would not, but if he would return me the pocket-book with all its contents, I would take it back to Mr. Wood, (as I had the pleasure of living once with him) and tell him I found it; he said, he knew nothing of the 10 l. note, nor the four guineas, as the gentleman said he had lost a 10 l. bank note, and eight guineas, and he found only four guineas. I went to Mr. Wood; he was not at home; I waited till he came home, and told him all the knowledge I had of it.</p>
               <p>Was you present when that was found upon him? - I was.</p>
               <p>Then you did not take him up; you did not stop him at that time? - No; I immediately applied to Mr. Wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190011"/>- ALLEN, sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in John-street, Tottenham-Court Road.</p>
               <p>Are you intimate with Matthews? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he and the prisoner come to your house on the 21st of April last? - Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>What passed between them? - I was out when they came, but they waited till I came home; and Matthews told me a story that the prisoner had drawn him in by giving him this Bath bank bill of 5 l. 5 s. to change; the prisoner said he found it in Mr. Wood's house, and a bank post bill of 27 l. 17 s. 6 d. and likewise four guineas in money. We advised him to take the money, pocket-book, and notes, back again; Matthews said, if you do not like to go yourself, if you will give me the book and its contents, I will take it back to Mr. Wood's; the prisoner wanted to persuade him to deny it; Matthews then said he would go and inform Mr. Wood of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wood. The prisoner did not deny any thing at all in his way to the round-house; he made it appear, that there were a bricklayer, and carpenter, who saw him pick the book up in the morning, whom we know had part of the money. He was very ready to give up every circumstance; it was the bricklayer had the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>For the PRISONER.</p>
               <p>A witness sworn. I have known the prisoner ten or a dozen years; I never heard any thing of him but what was very good; I was his fellow-servant at the time.</p>

               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner before? - No. I was in the kitchen up one-pair-of-stairs backwards; hearing the door open, I went and peeped through the rails, and saw the prisoner come softly along the passage; I saw her take the coat off the nail, and put it in her apron, and run into the street; I followed her, and caught her within four doors of my master's house; she was running away with it; I found the great coat upon her, and brought her back.</p>

On the 27th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was informed that a person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190012"/> who had been in the shop, had taken a piece of cotton off the counter; we were very busy. I said to the young man who was serving, where she was, why do not you follow her? he said, he did not know which way she was gone; a lady, who was in the shop said she was gone up the yard; I went after her, and passed her, and saw the cotton under her cloak; on my passing her, she looked hard at me, and turned back; I did not speak to her, not being willing to make a noise about it; I thought I would let her walk back quietly before me; she went into the shop; she went in at one door and I at another; I met her, and demanded the cloth of her, and she gave it me from under her cloak, and then wished to run away. I secured her, and took her before a magistrate; the cloth (producing it) has my master's private mark upon it; I am sure it is his property.</p>
               <p>Did you observe it on the counter that day? - Not in particular.</p>

               <p>To Hawley. Was there any bundle of her's left? - No; she said nothing about any such thing; she was kept in the house I believe two hours after she came back.</p>

On Thursday the 6th of May, between twelve and one o'clock in the night, the watchman called me up to see if I had lost any thing out of the shop, as he said the door was open; I made all the haste I could down, and missed four saws; the watchman told me, the man who had taken them was apprehended, and was in the watch-house. I went to the watch-house, and saw the prisoner, and all the things mentioned in the indictment. The prisoner came to work for me about six weeks before Christmas, and lodged in the house; I discharged him last Monday was week, because I could not get him to work; that was the Monday before the robbery; he always behaved very well while he was with me; I never suspected him.</p>

               <p>I am a patrol. On the 6th of May, about half after 12 o'clock, as I was taking my rounds, I saw the prisoner lurking about the prosecutor's house; on my coming up to him he crossed the way; I told the watchman of him; I went away and returned again in about ten minutes, and met the prisoner with the saw; I laid hold of him, and asked him where he was going; he said, to his lodgings. I asked him where he got the things; he said they were his own; that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190018"/> worked at Mary-le-Bonne. I took him to the watch-house. He was within two yards of the prosecutor's door when I took him; it was dark, I did not see him come out of the house; I found all the things under his arm.</p>
               <p>(The things were produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My name is at full length on the plane; I am so much used to the saws that I cannot but know them.</p>
               <p>Suppose you was at work in a shop with ten carpenters, who all had six saws each, could you pick your saws from among them? - Yes; if there were fifty I could; the stock is mine: I have the bit here that fits it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether he has not given me leave to take tools if I had a job to do, without asking him? - He often has taken tools and brought them back again; whether that was his intent now I leave to you.</p>
               <p>Was the door broke open? - There is a door under my shutter that was neglected to be bolted, where I suppose he might get in.</p>
               <p>Have you let him take tools? - Yes, he had not many of his own.</p>
               <p>That was while he lived with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you lend him any after he left you? - I do not recollect that I have lent him any; I believe if he had asked me I should.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the Bedford Arms in Charlotte-street, near Mr. Baldero's, in Bedford-square. On Thursday the prisoner brought a basket with three bottles in it to my house, and desired me to take care of them till I saw him; I do not know what was in the bottles. I never saw him afterwards, till I saw him here</p>
               <p>JOHN BALDERO Esq. sworn.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner was charged with taking the wine, he went down on his knees and begged I would forgive him. He confessed that he took a small key that belonged to the locker off the side board, out of which locker he took the key of the wine vaults, and went down and got the wine out of the wine vaults. This confession related to the five bottles of wine.</p>
               <p>Jury. Whether this confession came freely from the prisoner, or was obtained by promises? - There were no promises whatsoever; I charged him with being ungrateful, I had been a friend to him in a particular manner; he went down on his knees and desired me to forgive him; I desired him to get up off his knees, I said I should certainly prosecute him, and I went into another room.</p>
               <p>Is there any marks on the bottle? - I cannot say that there is.</p>
               <p>Whether you apprehend him to have been guilty of taking all the wine at one time, or that it was taken on different days? - Different days I believe.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have often sent for wine; I have bought wine several times of Mr. Walden; I could not get a glass of wine in the house, I had always the key of the locker; the night before Mr. Baldero went to Bath my master's son delivered me out five bottles; my mistress charged me with drinking the wine; I said I could tell her when they were opened time and place; she took the key of the locker from me.</p>

The prisoner came behind the carriage first, then he passed it, and rode up to the coachman. I immediately leaned my head over the carriage, and heard him say three or four times - stop, or I will blow your brains out! When the chariot stopped he went to the window, and said to the Marquis of Granby - deliver your money immediately, or I will blow your brains out. I jumped over the wheels, laid hold of him, and unhorsed him. He said he would blow my brains out. My lord came out of the chariot, and we secured him, put him into a hackney coach, and carried him before a magistrate.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect on May the 10th meeting with the prisoner? - I believe it was the 11th. I believe it was past twelve o'clock. I had rather taken a glass too much; still I had my recollection, but I did not attend to the hour. I had been at Munday's coffee-house, in Round Court, to meet a gentleman who did not come. When I left the coffee-house, in my way through the court to Chandos-street, the prisoner accosted me. I desired her to go about her business; that I did not wish to see her; that I was not a fit person for her, and so forth. She told me a great many stories, and so far insinuated herself as to demand my attention. She told me she was exceedingly poor. Seeing me to be an officer, she said she had been at Gibraltar a considerable time, and had known some persons in the 58th regiment. She begged me to hear her story; that I would go to a place called the Key tavern, just by there. She, I believe, rung at the door, and a man opened it. I went just within the door. I do not know whether I called for drink or she did. The man said there was none to be had. I went out directly. I said, poor creature, go about you business, here is half a crown in charity, and she went away. Immediately after she was gone I missed my handkerchief, and said, I believe in the hearing of the waiter, that she had picked my pocket. I had no suspicion then of any thing else, and went home to Wood's Hotel, where I lay. When I had got into bed I felt, as I always make it a rule, to know if I had my pocket book; sometimes I have things of value in it. It being gone I was a good deal alarmed. I got up, put on my clothes, and took my servant with me, and went to see after her. I went to the place where I first met with her, but could see nothing of her. Two patroles came up, and, seeing a woman, ran up to her, and brought her down to me. When she came I knew so little of her, upon my word, I could not recollect her face; but, upon her speaking, I perfectly well knew the voice, and she immediately owned she was the person that had been with me. I forgot to observe that I told the patrole I had been robbed by her. I asked her how she could be guilty of such an infamous thing as robbing me. She denied it. The patrole carried her to the Key tavern; when we came there she persisted in denying the robbery. I went to search her pocket. The patrole said it was his province to search her. She then put her hand into her pocket, and pulled out this pocket book. (Producing it) I said, that is my pocket book. She pulled out a memorandum book, and then my handkerchief, which I have not here. I had that night a 50 l. note.</p>
               <p>How long before you met her had you seen the notes in the pocket-book? - I saw the notes in the pocket-book that day, and I had the pocket-book at Medley's. I had a 50 l. note I got in change of a 100 l. note at Biddulph and Cock's, and four 20 l. notes, which I had in part of payment of a draft from Mr. Ballard, upon Biddulph and Cock's. I had them in my pocket-book at the time it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190024"/> was taken out of my pocket. I asked her where the notes were; she persisted in denying them; I went into a room to persuade her to give my property up; I told her I would not prosecute her; I said a good deal to her upon the occasion; I said if she did things of this kind she must come to an untimely end some time or other. She still persisted that she had them not. She would not give them up. As we were carrying her from thence to St. Martin's watchhouse she produced the four 20 l. notes, and gave them to one of the patroles, who immediately gave them to me; I opened them and found there were only the four 20 l. notes. I said there was a 50 l. note, where is that? she said she had it not; I told her she certainly must have it, and when she went to the round-house she should be stripped and examined, which accordingly she was; the note was not found upon her; the person who examined her wished to know if he should examine farther than he did, (your Lordship knows what I mean, I do not mention it out of delicacy). Hearing some people had connexion with her, the constable went to see if they could find it. She lay in the round-house that night. As these prosecutions are disagreeable, and the world censures them, I had not an inclination to bring the thing on, and the woman was consequently discharged. That very day, a friend of mine asked me if I had the number of the 50 l. note; I said I had not, but could get it at Biddulph and Cocks's; he went with me and we got the number of the note, and went to the Bank on Wednesday morning, and stopped the payment of it. She was taken up in consequence of my understanding that note was paid to a Mr. Bride, by three women. The part of the pocket-book my notes were in has a clasp. She did not know the manner of it, and had forced it open to get the notes out.</p>
               <p>What pocket had you the book in? - My left hand waistcoat pocket. My handkerchief was in my coat pocket. I have but three of the notes here; I have paid one away. The notes I received of Messrs. Biddulph and Cocks, and a 50 l. note, were the notes in my pocket, these are the notes, the prisoner gave me; she said they were my property.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you positively recollect that you had the pocket-book when you met the girl? - Positively. I had it in Munday's coffee-house. I saw nobody but the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole. On the 11th of May at about a quarter or half after two in the morning, when I was standing in Vine-street, just by the gateway that leads from Chandos-street, I saw two men coming down. Captain Barry came up to me and said a woman had done a very wicked thing somewhere thereabout. He said if I could tell where she lived, or apprehend her, he would give me 20 l. I said to him, to pretend to put one's hand on such a person here I might as well pretend to put my hand on a needle in a bottle of hay. I said has she robbed you; he said she had, of four 20 l. notes and a 50 l. note. I stopped and saw a woman coming; I said, is this her; I went and took her by the arm and asked her if she was the person; she owned it immediately to me, and said she had the pocket-book which I charged her with, I took her to Captain Barry, and asked him if he knew her; he said no, he did not know her face;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190025"/> upon her speaking, he said he knew her voice, that she was the woman's upon that she owned she had the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>How far was you from Captain Barry when you took her? - It might be about fifteen yards I believe. I put my hand in her left hand-pocket, and found one of the pocket-books. I put my hand in her right hand pocket, and found the other with clasps; he went to take it, and would have let her go, but I said no, you shall go to the watch-house and see that you have your property. We took the prisoner to the Key Bagnio, and the prosecutor desired to go into a room to speak to her; we went into the room all together; the prisoner desired we might go out of the room; we went out, but though I was out of the room I could hear all that passed; he talked to her of the had consequences of it; after a long persuading, she would not produce the notes; I then went in and said if he talked to her ever so long she would never produce the notes, and insisted upon her going to the watch-house, upon which we all came out, and as we were going along, I said if she did not produce the notes she would be hanged. When we were near Chandos-street, she turned about and said, I will own the truth now; she pulled a bundle of notes out of her bosom, and said here are the notes. I gave him the notes, and he desired to go back to the bagnio; we did; he looked at the notes; there were only the four 20 l. notes; he said there was a 50 l. note. She persisted in denying that, but owned she took the other four from him. I searched her pockets, and found half a crown, which she said the gentleman gave her, and two shillings and a sixpence, and the gentleman's pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any further conversation between her and Mr. Barry in the room? - Yes; he said, did not I meet you by mere accident in the street, seeing me an officer, you told me you knew a person in the regiment I was in, a relation of yours, and out of charity because you knew him, I gave you half a crown; how could you do such a wicked thing to rob me?</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Barry. At the time she took your pocket-book did you know of her taking it? - No; I did not miss it till I got to bed.</p>

               <p>I did not know that my trial would come on so soon; I have no witnesses; he said to me he had not lost his pocket-book, and that he had been with another woman.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Barry. Did she deny having the pocket-book, when you first saw her, or only the Bank notes? - I cannot say.</p>

He opened his coat and pulled out a pistol, which put me in a flurry and I made my escape. He threw his pistol after me and said d - n you.

               <p>To Wall. Is that the note? - Yes; we copied it in our day books; I put 888 upon the back of it under the Britannia.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the same note that you received that day from Mr. Man? - I am very positive.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of that number? - It is a method we use in entering notes, we do it only for our own satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Do you always use the same numbers, or progressive numbers? - Progressive numbers, we begin from one to about 1000 and then begin again.</p>
               <p>There is nothing but this number to induce you to believe this is the note? - It is the strongest evidence of it.</p>
               <p>What day was it brought? - The 11th of March.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - From the entry in our books.</p>
               <p>Where are the books? - At Coventry.</p>
               <p>You speak from your memory being refreshed by the books? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And nothing else? - No.</p>

               <p>Messrs. Liddle and Company do a great deal of business? - Yes, as much as any country offices do I believe.</p>
               <p>In the course of four months past how many Bank notes have gone through your hands? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Is not O. Gething the name commonly subscribed to Bank bills? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You would have known nothing of the identity of the bill if you had not inspected the books at Coventry? - I am certain that is the note.</p>
               <p>From inspecting the books? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Connsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>You have looked at the entry you yourself made? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Having so refreshed your memory, are you positive this is the note which was brought to you by Mr. Man on the 11th of March - Quite positive.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you recollect how soon after you received the note it was that you put the fig ures 888 upon it? - I cannot tell the minute, as soon as time would permit.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190029"/>Do you put the numbers on before you put the notes in the drawer? - Yes, always.</p>
               <p>This is your hand writing? - It is.</p>
               <p>Should you have known it by the number without seeing the books? - Yes; I gave the cash and made the entry with my own hand.</p>
               <p>(The note was read in court and exactly corresponded with the statement of it in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Can you tell how far you have got in the progressive numbers? - No.</p>
               <p>Since the 11th of March to your own knowledge have you indorsed any other bill 888? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I am deputy secretary to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Whether that is a genuine Bank note? - I believe it to be a false one; I have examined this note with our books; I do not find such a note issued out of the Bank that day. I have examined both the cash book and the note ledger.</p>
               <p>Have you any other reason to say it is not a genuine Bank note? - Yes the dotted lines drawn along here are not true, a pair of compasses will show it, they are not parallel, they are not such as could be taken from the plate used by the Bank; the letter N at No. is a little different; in the word bearer the e and the r are too close.</p>
               <p>Court. You have examined it with the plate? - I have with other notes taken from the plates.</p>
               <p>You have a general knowledge of the form the Bank plates bear, as to the circumstances you have related? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>From that knowledge you made these observations? - Certainly so; and I believe this is a forged note.</p>
               <p>Is there any other reason that occurs to you on the face of it? - I do not recollect any at present.</p>
               <p>Jury. Has the cutting of the bill in two made no alteration in the parallel lines? - I believe it has not.</p>
               <p>Does your observation go to the parallel lines on the same part of the paper? - I think it is perceivable by the eye.</p>

               <p>There is no other cashier of the Bank of your name I suppose? - No. This is not Bank paper, and no such note as that has been issued from the Bank.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>The water mark is in that? - There is something like the water-mark Bank of England.</p>
               <p>Can you tell upon the view of the mark itself whether it is the water-mark used by the Bank? - It is not: and the white lines in the paper of this note are not the same as ours.</p>
               <p>So you are sure it is not Bank paper? - I am.</p>
               <p>Court. All Bank notes are not written upon paper of the same consistencey; some Bank notes are upon much thicker paper than other? - There may be a little difference in that.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the number of white lines always the same upon the Bank paper? - I believe it will be found so.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to swear that this is not your hand writing? - Because there has no such note been issued on that day.</p>
               <p>Does it differ as you can see in any respect from your own hand-writing? - It does differ; it is stiffer.</p>
               <p>Suppose you saw that upon an indifferent paper, and had not the reasons which you now have to think this was a forgery, could you have sworn it was not your hand-writing? - I do not know that I could.</p>

               <p>Court. Were they all good? - All good.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to recollect particularly receiving this note from the prisoner on the 17th of March? - On the 24th of March he came again to me to have two Bank notes for thirty pound, one for twenty and another for ten. The Excise-office were paying in 7000 guineas. There was a scruple about one of them; the prisoner looked at it as it lay at a distance, and said it was a good one; then I recollected him; I turned to the book and saw I had paid him those three notes.</p>
               <p>Court. When notes are paid at the Bank they are cancelled are they not and never issued again? - They are never issued again, there is a hole stamped through the note, and the cashier's name is torn off.</p>

               <p>Do you remember his coming at any time this year, and when, to lodge at your house? - On the 27th of February to the best of remembrance.</p>
               <p>What apartment had he? - A first floor for himself, and an upper chamber for his sister to lie in; he had the first floor for his own use and she a three-pair-of-stairs back room. My house is four stories high.</p>
               <p>Do you remember when he left your house to go into the country? - I think it was on the 24th of March.</p>
               <p>Had he been out of town before at any time? - At two separate times.</p>
               <p>Did he go out of town any other time? - He went out twice in the course of the month of March; once he was out a week; the second time he was out only two days.</p>
               <p>Have you any recollection about what time he went out of town? - He came to lodge at my house on Saturday the 27th of February; and on the Tuesday or Wednesday sen'night following he set off; he told me he was going to Norwich.</p>
               <p>How long was it before he returned? - About a week.</p>
               <p>Did you make observation of his manner of living while he was in your house? - He behaved with all the good order and regularity that we wished for; he kept remarkable good hours, and during his whole stay he drank only one pint of liquor.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing particular in his behaviour or in the style of his living? - He seemed no way shy whenever he came in, he passed the compliment of the day or the night, and would sometimes stand for some time in the shop, and chat about indifferent matters.</p>
               <p>Did he carry on any business that you observed? - When he took my apartment, I asked him for what length of time he would have it; he said a fortnight or three weeks; he said as soon as he had finished his business he should go out of town; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190031"/> him what his business was, he said he was a clock and watch-maker, and came to town for some little instruction. He some times was privately by himself in his back room, from which I judged that he had some piece of work that required retirement.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by privately? - His sister was not with him, he was by himself.</p>
               <p>Court. Did his sister appear in the character of a gentlewoman? - She appeared very mean for a person that took an apartment at fifteen shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not know by what coach he set out? - He did not acquaint me of quitting his appartment till half an hour before he left it.</p>
               <p>Do you know by what coach he went? - The first time he went off, he went with boots and a whip, upon which I supposed he was going on horseback.</p>
               <p>You do not happen to know of his taking a place in the Norwich stage, or any thing of that sort? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury You cannot recollect whether it was the Tuesday or Wednesday he went from your house? - No, I cannot, but I believe it was the Tuesday; he still had the lodgings, his sister staid in them.</p>
               <p>Court. At what time of the day did he set out? - At three in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Were the plates proper for engraving? - I cut them out of a piece of rough plate that I had left; this is a piece of the copperplate that I cut four or five other plates out of. (producing a piece of flat copper with a rough square.)</p>
               <p>Did he assign any reason for it? - He came in and asked me if I could make him a couple of copper-plates; I told him I would show him what copper I had in the house if it would suit him; I sent my boy up into the shop to bring down two pieces of copper-plate; I shewed them to him; he said it would do very well; and I was to cut him out two of such dimensions; he described the dimensions very particularly; four and a half wide, I think, and seven and a half or eight inches long.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not ask him what they were for? - I did not; he told me they were for engraving, and they were to go into the country; he was very particular; he wanted them immediately; I told him I could not leave off what I was about; he asked when I could get them done; he begged I would do them immediately; he said how long will it take up if you go about them immediately; I said two hours; he said he would call in two hours; he called in that time; I was going to do it with some emery, to make it smooth; he said that would not do, it must be ground upon a stone, and he would do it himself.</p>

               <p>I am a stationer.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing the prisoner at any time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where? - At our shop in Cheapside.</p>
               <p>What did he come there for? - To buy some paper.</p>
               <p>What paper? - Paper that we call extra thin post.</p>
               <p>Was it the same sort of paper as that? (showing the witness the forged note and some paper found upon the prisoner apparently of the same sort.) - It seems to me to be the same sort of paper.</p>
               <p>When did you sell it him? - About three or four months ago.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner? - Yes, this paper produced to me now is the same person's make as the paper I sold him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190032"/>Did he come more than once to your house? - Two or three times, and bought the same paper; he bought a quire at a time.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Take that 20 l. note in your hand again, are you a judge of the make of paper? - I am not.</p>
               <p>Has any of the paper that you have been looking at a water mark in it with the words Bank of England? - I did not see that it had.</p>
               <p>Now turn that bill round to the light and observe the words in a water mark Bank of England at the bottom of the bill? - Yes, I think I perceive it faintly.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon you to say that you sold that paper to the prisoner at the bar? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>We suppose, that a piece of that paper was cut off and the words Bank of England stamped in it afterwards by some means.</p>
               <p>To Martin. Do you say the water mark Bank of England is put into your paper when the paper is made, or afterwards? - I apprehend when the paper is made.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is the paper-maker here that makes the paper for the Bank of England, because we should be glad to know if there is a possibility of putting that mark upon the paper after it is made.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>He is not here.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you find that agree with any part of that stamp that is in the middle of the paper? The observation is that in every true Bank note, there is that flourish across the Britannia exactly. In that piece of paper you may cut off as much as will make a bank bill that there is no mark at all in. Then the counsel say, the same that would put upon the paper Bank of England would make that flourish across the Britannia.</p>
               <p>Jury. There is paper enough to make the note without using any that has the mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>And the same mark would make the lines they have been talking about.</p>

               <p>Had he any bundle with him at the time you apprehended him? - Not that day; the next morning I heard of his going along Cornhill; I followed him.</p>

               <p>Have you any of the contents of that bundle here? - The bundle was delivered to the Bank.</p>

             at Brompton the next day. When it was discovered that he answered to the description of the person who had been advertised for a forgery, upon the Darlington bank; when that description was read to him, and he was asked whether his name was not John Matthison (for that was the name he was advertised by) he burst into tears, and said I am a dead man, I will now tell you the whole.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Whether-in-this stage of the examination I may be at liberty to ask Mr. Acton whether there was not a confession taken in writing before the justice? - There was not a confession taken in writing.</p>
               <p>None? - None.</p>
               <p>Was there no examination of this man taken in writing? - I took minutes.</p>
               <p>Was not there an examination taken in writing? - No, not of him; he never signed any examination.</p>
               <p>But whether answers given by the prisoner were not put into writing by the justice's clerk? - No; none except my minutes.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Justice Fielding's clerk, or his people, took minutes of what the prisoner said? - Not that I remember.</p>
               <p>Court. If there was an examination reduced into writing, and signed by the prisoner himself, and the justice, then you cannot give parol evidence of it. Were any of the directors of the Bank present at this time? - The governor was.</p>
               <p>Court. Were any promises made by the governor, or any body else, of mercy if he would confess? - Not the least.</p>
               <p>Did his confession appear to you to be free and voluntary? - I am perfectly satisfied it was free and voluntary.</p>
               <p>Give an account of what he said as correctly as you can? - When he said he would tell us the whole, of course we asked whether he was concerned in these forgeries or not.</p>
               <p>Court. These forgeries is very indistinct. Did you say any thing about the present note in question; was the present note in question then produced? - A great many were, but I cannot say whether the present was; I believe that was not come in.</p>
               <p>Court. Confine your evidence to what you know with respect to this Bank note? - I asked him, among other things, where he had put off those notes.</p>
               <p>Court. That was before this Bank note was produced? - Yes; among the rest of the people, he said, he had put off one of 20 l. to a silversmith at Coventry, of whom he had bought a pair of buckles.</p>
               <p>How soon was it before this note was produced? - It was several days after; we went to the different places where he had put off those notes, particularly to Coventry; the note being brought up, I went for the people to identify the man, and prove the note.</p>
               <p>When was this note produced to the prisoner? - It was on the 5th or 6th of May; then he was brought before Sir

I asked him where he bought it; he said, of a stationer in Cheapside, who is the master of the young man that has given evidence. He said he bought it at a stationer's in Cheapside, nearly opposite the church, and I enquired at the stationers' shops till I found the shop.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether any thing passed between you and the prisoner by which you learned from him, whether the water-mark, the Bank of England, was done after the paper was made, or was upon the paper, when he bought it? - That question was asked him when he first said he would confess. He said that he could make the water-mark after the paper was made, and that he would not disclose the method for the sake of the publick.</p>
               <p>You are perfectly satisfied that you did learn from the prisoner himself that it was done after the paper was made? - Undoubtedly; he said, no man living knew it but himself. He afterwards told us how he did it.</p>
               <p>Court. All that he said was, you asked him if the name of

             was of his hand-writing; he said, he believed it was; how came you not to ask him whether the cashier and the other names were written by him? - As he admitted he made that at Talboy's, I took it for granted; and he said that this ten pound note was the note he had made it from.</p>

             was a lodger in our house. On the 20th of April last, the prisoner and another man came to my house about one o'clock in the afternoon, to look at a lodging. I shewed them up stairs; we went into a room next to Mr. Savin's bed-chamber. While I was shewing them that room the prisoner went into Mr. Savin's room. Upon missing him, I immediately followed him; on my going into the room he seemed very much confused, and turned pale. This raised a suspicion in me, that he had taken something; I said I hoped he had not taken any thing out of the room; he said, he was surprised at my saying such a thing; he did not know what I meant. Recollecting that Mr. Savin's shoe-buckles lay in that room, I said I hoped he had not taken a pair of silver shoe-buckles out of that room; on that they both ran down stairs. I ran down after them, and said, gentlemen, if you have not stole any thing you need not run away so fast, and I called to my servant to stop them if she could, if not to cry stop thief as soon as they were out, which she did, and the prisoner was taken and brought back. He held the buckles in his hand, and asked me if they were the buckles that were lost. I said they were the same pattern as the buckles that used to lie there, but I could not swear to them. The constable has the buckles. The prisoner said he was a Master Tailor, and had two lodgings, and a house of his own.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not the other man look at the lodgings particularly? - You both looked at them.</p>
               <p>Did I ask you any questions about the lodgings? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were we both in the room together? - You was not in the room. I went to look for you when I found you was not with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190035"/>Prisoner. What apartments in the house were to let at that time? - There would have been all the upper part, because the gentleman was going away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What room were the buckles in, the back room or fore room? - I have no back room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were we not both on the stairs together? - Yes; both going up and coming down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You say we were both together the whole time? - No; I said no such thing.</p>

               <p>On the 20th of April I went out about ten in the morning. I left my shoe-buckles and spurs in the closet. When I returned, which was about four in the afternoon, Mrs. Richard told me she had been robbed of my buckles, and desired I would go up stairs, and see if I had lost any thing else. I went up and missed my spurs likewise. The buckles cost me 27 s.</p>

               <p>What did he say to you about the spurs? - He said nothing about them then. In the evening, when he was in the coach going to the justice's, he owned to me and Andrews that he took the spurs.</p>
               <p>Did he own he took the spurs out of Mr. Richards's house? - He said he had done that that was wrong.</p>

               <p>I was at a publick-house in Fetter-lane; there I met with a tailor, who engaged me to work for him, and gave me a pair of breeches to make. I carried them home on the Tuesday following, and met with the other man there. He asked me to go with him to Mary-le-Bonne, to receive some money. He took me to this house; he said he wanted an apartment for a gentleman. He was shewed up stairs; I staid some time in the dining-room, which the servant was cleaning. I went up stairs, and heard him telling the landlady he would call and give her an answer another time. As we were upon the stairs, he delivered me the spurs in a handkerchief, and bid me put them into my pocket, which I did very innocently. I did not steal them, or know that they were stolen. This lady informed my wife, my trial could not come on till Friday; I am entirely unprepared. I am willing to serve his Majesty if I am found guilty, in any capacity the Court may think proper.</p>

When I came home, Morgan was sitting in the taproom; he said to my wife, mistress, give me change for these two pints of beer, and offered her a sixpence. She having a child in her arms, she desired me to give him change. I took the sixpence, and went to the door, and found it was a bad one. I told him it was a bad sixpence; he gave me another. I looked at that, and found it was a bad one, and told him so. He then gave me another, and said D - n them, I believe they are all bad - if my father was a coiner, I could turn

             for him and hang him. That piece was bad. He then gave me a shilling, and I changed that. I got into discourse with him, and asked him who he was; he said, he kept a chandler's shop; I said to him, Morgan, if I was to come into your house, and call for three halfpennyworth of bread and cheese, and offer you three bad sixpences; what should you think me to be? he said, a blackguard. Then I said, I must think you a blackguard, for offering me three bad sixpences. He then desired Jones to go on with the bundle he had, and bid me draw him another pint of beer. I suspected they had counterfeit money about them; I followed Jones out, and asked him what he had there; he said, that he had nothing but some tools; to the best of my knowledge he said tools; he did not tell me they were counterfeit halfpence, I am sure of that. Morgan followed me out of the door, and said, let him go, he has nothing but a few counterfeit halfpence. With that I desired Jones to come back; he did, and Morgan followed him. When he was come back, I sent for a constable, and charged him with them both. Before I charged them, I opened the bundle, and found a parcel of counterfeit halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What else? - Nothing but counterfeit halfpence. There were three bundles: in each bundle five shillings worth, also a single shilling's worth, and twenty-six shillings worth tied up in papers. This is one of them (producing it) the others I have at home. I did not think it worth while to bring them all; they have been in my custody ever since. Mr. Burkwood, Mr. White, and myself, took them to the Compter. We searched Morgan, and found upon him a small and a large key, and about two shillings in silver. Burkwood took the keys from him. In his discourse he told me, first, he lived at Wood's Close; that he kept a chandler's shop. Then he said he lived somewhere near Wheeler-street, Cold-Bath Fields. I went, in consequence of his direction, to a chandler's shop in Wood's Close, and found he had lived there. I was there directed to a little Court in Cold-Bath-Fields; they could not tell me the name of the court. I went and found the court; I enquired at the corner, and was informed, he lived the second or third door up the court. I said to Mr. Burkwood, let us keep together. I went and rang at the bell three times; nobody answered. I took the key from Burkwood's hand, and opened the door with it; we went up stairs, and saw a candle burning in a little room.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - Between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, we then went down, and found a press and several other articles. We then, went up stairs again, and in the room where there was a bed, we found two dies for halfpence upon the floor, and in the cupboard of the room.</p>
               <p>(The dies were produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Was that in the room where you saw the light? - No; there did not appear to be any lodgers in the house; there were but two beds in the house. Jones said that he had slept in one of them a week, and Morgan and his wife lay in the other. He said, they had made no halfpence there yet. I asked him who dug the hole to fix the block in for the press; he told me himself.</p>
               <p>When did he say that, before or after you had been in the house? - After; we could not tell that there was a block there till we had been. The block was fixed in the ground, and the press lay in the cellar; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190037"/> press was not fixed up. There were several articles, as wedges for fixing it up.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You took all the halfpence from Jones? - Yes; Morgan bid him go on with the bundle, it was on the table; he shoved it to him.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear when you came to the house that it belonged to one Edwards? - I am very certain Morgan said it was his house; Jones, who slept with him, said it was his house.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear that the implements were left there by Edwards? - I heard so from Morgan.</p>
               <p>The fly, I believe, was not in the house? - No; it was in the house of one Steel.</p>

               <p>I went with Mr. Lawrence to the house of Morgan. I gave him a key, which Morgan said was the key of his house; with which Lawrence opened the door; I was with him when he found the several things which are produced.</p>
               <p>Lawrence. Morgan said, when he was before Alderman Pugh, that he wanted a clean shirt, and the key was given him to get one.</p>

               <p>How was the field secured? - Very indifferently.</p>

               <p>Did you shut the gate after you? - I cannot say, my man turned him in with two more; I keep three horses. I found him on the Sunday, in Holloway-lane, in Mr. Seabrook's stable; a man who buys horses to kill.</p>
               <p>Was your's a dog-horse? - He was not much better than a dog-horse, though he does my work; the man that turned him into the field is not here.</p>

               <p>Who did you buy it of? - A young man.</p>
               <p>Do you know the young man? - Yes. I do not see him; I do not know his name (looks at the prisoner). I believe that is the young man.</p>
               <p>What sort of a horse was it? - A brown, very rough and large boned horse, very low in flesh.</p>
               <p>Had he a long tail or a short one? - I did not take notice of his tail, I delivered him to the prosecutor when he came to enquire after it.</p>
               <p>What did you give for it? - Twelve shillings, which is the most we give in common for horses to kill.</p>

               <p>Is the house and the hen-roost under one roof? - No; but the hen-roost joins to the house; there is no space between. My wife saw them in the evening. I did not. I was out till about nine o'clock in the morning. My man found them near the stable-door. There were five hens and the cock in a bag; they were dead, but were quite warm; they had been just killed. My man called me, and I got up immediately; he had them in his hand. We found a chissel in the pocket of the prisoner. The door had been forced open with a chissel. The four nails of the lock were drawn. This was between two and three in the morning.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Dear. On the 17th of April, I came in with my coach at about half after two in the morning. I had been to Ranelagh. I had a little dog with me. As I was coming in he barked, upon which a man came out fromthehen-roost; he shammed drunk. I asked him what he did there. He said he was very drunk, and came in to lie down. As I was turning from him I saw another man come from the stable door, where the fowls lay; upon which I secured him.</p>
               <p>Had he any fowls upon him? - No; I sent for a constable, and took him before a justice of the peace.</p>
               <p>What fowls were there by the stable door? - Five hens and a cock; the hens were all dead, the cock was alive in a sack with them. The constable searched the prisoner in my presence, and found this chissel upon him (producing it). The prisoner said before the justice, that he held the sack whilst the other put the fowls into it.</p>
               <p>Was he drunk or sober? - He seemed sober.</p>

On the night of the 24th or rather the morning of the 25th of April, at about half after twelve my wife and I fastened the house and went to bed. At about half after two o'clock I heard a noise, and got up; as I was going down I heard a cry of murder! fire! Mr. Hagstone, your house is broke open! I put my clothes on and went down to Mr. Lawrence's where I heard the thieves were; there I saw the two prisoners in custody; there was a great bunch of picklock keys found in Cremer's pocket.</p>
               <p>Was any part of your house broke open? - Yes; the flap of the cellar window and the cellar door were unlocked, and the street door was open; I was very certain all was fast before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>What sort of light was there at about half after two clock? - No light at all.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>It is not customary for the houses in Dark-house-lane to be open all night? - All but mine; I am ruled by the tides; the Gravesend boats come to my house.</p>

               <p>While I was at the water side at the bottom of Darkhouse-lane, I saw two men endeavouring to break Mr. Hagstone's cellar-window open; Williams had passed me several times in the lane before; I went and told my partner of it, that is Commander, and then went down to the water-side again. When I came back I heard them inside the door; I called Commander up, and he came just as they opened the door.</p>
               <p>Were they in the inside? - Yes, inside of the door; I caught hold of Cremer and said, what business have you here? Williams said he used that house, and came to get a pint of beer; I secured Cremer; Williams struggled with Commander, and got away, but was afterward secured. After I was in court at the Mansion-house, Cremer said if I get clear of this, I will have you here.</p>
               <p>Did you secure the men? - Yes, and took them to the Green-man and Bell.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190045"/>Are you sure the man you saw at the cellar window is the man you secured? - I saw only Williams, I am sure he is the man; I could distinguish him by the light in the publick-house, the sign of the Tilt-boat.</p>
               <p>Was there any day-light? - No, it was between one and two in the morning when I saw him, and between two and three when they were taken.</p>
               <p>You had never seen either of the men before? - No.</p>
               <p>You had never seen Williams before? - I saw him walking up and down the lane, and he came into the Green-man and Bell between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did he speak to you? - Yes; he asked me what I was looking out for as it was not tide time; I said I came out of the boat to warm my feet.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again by his voice? - I knew him by his face when I met him in the lane.</p>
               <p>Was there light enough in the lane to discern his face? - There was, because there were lights in the houses up and down the lane.</p>

               <p>The last witness called to me and told me a man was attempting to break Mr. Hagstone's cellar window; I went down and saw Williams standing facing Mr. Hagstone's, and the other at a little distance.</p>
               <p>Did you see them both then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish their faces? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoners are the persons you saw then? - Yes; I went up to the publick-house again; Griffith went out and returned in about eight or ten minutes and said somebody was in the inside of Mr. Hagstone's house; accordingly I went down after him; he laid hold of Cremer, and I laid hold of Williams; Williams threw me down in the lane, but we secured them both and took them to the Green-man and Bell.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - Between two and three o'clock in the morning on the 25th of April, on a Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>You did not let Williams go when you laid hold of him as he came out of the house? - Yes, I was obliged to let him go when he threw me down. I cried stop thief! and another man stopped him till I came up to him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the man you took the first time was the same you took the second time? - I am.</p>
               <p>When you took him in the house did you see his face? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Suppose you had not taken him for a fortnight after, could you have been sure that he was the person? - Yes, I could.</p>
               <p>How long was it before he was taken the second time? - I suppose not half a moment, or a moment.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you know Williams before that night? - I have seen him before; I cannot say I knew his name before.</p>
               <p>Was you able to know him in the house? - Yes, because he came to me before.</p>
               <p>What light was there in the house, that you could see him by? - There was no light at all; the window shutters were open at the house on the opposite side of the way.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Hagstone. I locked the cellar door and the street door that night; my master was with me when I locked the street door.</p>
               <p>Did you secure the slap of the cellar that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Hagstone. The slap of the cellar window is fastened from month's end to month's end; I saw it fast that night.</p>
               <p>To Stern. You did not look to see if the slap was fast that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you look to see how it was broke open the next morning? - No.</p>
               <p>Is this slap ever opened in the day-time? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>To Hagstone. What time of night did you look at the slap? - I cannot say as to the time of night; I cannot speak to an hour.</p>
               <p>Can you to two hours? - I cannot say to two hours.</p>
               <p>As it is not opened above once a month, do you look at that bolt every night? - Yes, every night.</p>
               <p>Is there no night in the year but what you look at it? - If I am in town; if I am not my wife looks at it; I look at it every<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190046"/> night when I am in town except it is my turn to go to bed, then my wife looks at it; I shewed to all my neighbours in the morning how it was broke open.</p>
               <p>If you shewed it to your neighbours in the morning, then you can tell the time you looked at it over-night? - I made a certainty of looking once; I was down many times.</p>
               <p>How was it broke open? - I look upon it by a wrench that will be produced. I tried the key's that were found upon Cremer, and they would open the lock of my cellar door, and the lock of the street door.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the fastening of the slap broke? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Give as plain an account as you can of the manner in which the slap was broke open. - The bolts were sprung off, and the fastening below was forced off.</p>
               <p>You swear that positively? - Yes I do.</p>
               <p>There was nothing found upon Williams? - No.</p>

               <p>WILLIAMS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>We were in liquor; this young man laid down and went to sleep; I went and walked about, that is the reason that Griffith saw me in the lane; I said I would not leave him for fear of his being robbed, I told him there was a house I knew in Darkhouse-lane; we went to the door, I put my shoulder against it, and it opened, these men came up and asked what we were doing there; I said we were going to have something to drink but I believed they were a-bed, and then they took us.</p>

               <p>I have known Williams about fifteen or sixteen years. I never heard a bad character of him.</p>
               <p>- PARDON sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known Williams from his birth; his father was my clerk; he took all the care he could to give him a good education. I am afraid his mother having married a second time has deserted her care of this boy, his father gave a very handsome see in apprenticeship with him. I never heard any thing amiss of him before.</p>

               <p>I can only speak to the same purpose; I knew his father, he was a very honest man. I never heard a charge against him before this.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes, by sight. The first time I ever saw her to my knowledge was last Tuesday night at eleven o'clock, I saw her in Carey-street, at the corner of Bell-yard. I was going home from Harley-street; crossing Carey-street, from Lincoln's-Inn to <placeName id="t17790519-35-crimeloc196">Bell-yard</placeName>

I followed her, and begged her to return my money.</p>
               <p>How far had she gone? - About thirty yards; I believe she returned me a guinea and eight shillings; I told her that was not all the money she had taken from me; she said it was. It was not light enough there to see; I said I will take you to some house to see; we went to a publick-house, which I think is the Punch-bowl, at the top of Ship-yard.</p>
               <p>Did she go willingly with you? - Yes; she desired I would go with her. I told her she had two guineas and a shilling, which was the money I missed. I said if she would return that I would let her go; else I would take her to the watch-house. She desired I would take her to the watch-house. I took her to Bell-yard, where the watchman was crying the hour of eleven. She called the watchman herself, and went to the watch-house with him; at the watch-house she was searched by the constable of the night but no money was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Was you perfectly sober? - Yes; I suppose I had not drank half a pint of wine after dinner.</p>
               <p>Had you drank any thing else? - No.</p>
               <p>How do you know that you had exactly this money in your pocket? - I had three guineas and a half, the half guinea I had changed and paid eighteen pence out of it. I had paid away no more.</p>
               <p>When had you felt the three guineas and a half in your pocket? - About three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was you with her? - About two minutes I believe.</p>
               <p>Had you seen her before? - No; not to my knowledge never before.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You are a livery-servant to Mr. Hoare the banker? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>You describe yourself as not having drank above half a pint of wine that day, are you sure that is the extent? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you drank other liquor? - No.</p>
               <p>Which was it you or the prisoner that accosted one another first in the street? - The prisoner did me.</p>
               <p>You have told us you found her hand in your pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which pocket? - My right-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>What did you say to her when you found her hand in your pocket? - She was run away. I went after her. She was got about thirty yards from me. It was by Mr. Serjeant Davy's door. She was got into Carey street.</p>
               <p>She readily went with you to the Punch-bowl? - I think it was the sign of the Punch-bowl.</p>
               <p>Did you challenge her with having any more of your money? - Yes; two guineas and a shilling. She said she had none.</p>
               <p>Did she give you the money at the Punch-bowl? - No; I said if she did not give me the money I would take her to the watch-house, and then she called the watchman.</p>
               <p>When you brought her to the watch-house did you find your money? - No.</p>
               <p>You was in company with her from the moment you charged her with it till you got to the watch-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190048"/>Was she fully searched? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was not you in the watch-house? - Yes; but there are two rooms; she was taken into the inner room.</p>
               <p>Was there any mark upon any of the money by which you could swear to it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. When you overtook her, and she gave you the money, did she take it out of her pocket, or was it then in her hand? - I think it was in her hand.</p>
               <p>Did she say, when she returned you the money, that she had taken that money from you? - No; she said there it is.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Did she tell you that was all she had got? - I cannot recollect; she said afterwards she had no more money.</p>

He said that was two guineas and one shilling short. The beadle and I searched the prisoner. She had no money upon her.

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Was you the driver of the waggon? - Yes; I was coming along with the waggon. I was in the waggon between Sunday night and Monday morning. Between the 17th and 18th of April, at about twelve at night, when I was about a mile on this side of Acton, I saw a man take a flat of butter up.</p>
               <p>When you say a man do you mean to say the prisoner? - The prisoner is the man; he had his hair on then. It had fallen out of the waggon. The waggon went over it, and I saw him pick it up after the wheel had gone over it.</p>
               <p>You did not see him take it out of the waggon? - No; I did not see it till I saw him take it up. He went across the road with it.</p>
               <p>Did you see him take any thing else? - No; nothing else.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the man before? - I never saw him till the moment I saw him pick the flat of butter up.</p>
               <p>You do not know how the flat got out of the waggon? - The tilt cloth of the waggon, and the rope that tied the butter on, were cut, and it was got out of the side, the butter must fall out, or be pulled out.</p>
               <p>How long before this happened had you observed the tilt and rope tight? - I did not observe any thing of it till I saw him take up the flat of butter and run away.</p>
               <p>If the rope had been cut before would the butter have fallen out? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Could the waggon have travelled a quarter of an hour after it was cut without its falling out? - I do not know when the hole was cut; it might have gone some way after it was cut. As soon as I saw him take the flat of butter, I pursued him; he kicked the flat of butter into a ditch, and ran across the road into the foot path; I got on my horse and rode back to meet two other waggoners, to ask them to assist me; he ran on till I got before him; then the prisoner turned back, and jumped through a gap in the hedge; my horse jumped almost from under me and threw me in the foot-path; I pursued him through the gap and knocked him down with my whip; he got up and I struck at him again; I heard a rusling in the hedge; I thought he had somebody with him that might do me a mischief; he ran over some wheat fields and hid himself in a furrow; just at that time the Buckingham waggoner came up, and we went after him, and took him.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the box that had the watches in it? - I did not know what was in one flat more than another, but when the wheel went over the flat it crushed the box of watches in the flat; the watches were in the flat with the butter, it was directed to our book-keeper.</p>
               <p>Did you ever loose sight of the man after he took the butter up? - He was never out of sight till I came up with him; I passed him just before I met the waggons; I called to the waggoners to help me, upon which he turned back and jumped through the hedge.</p>
               <p>Did you see the flat of butter in the waggon? - I saw it in the waggon; I put it in myself at Bicester.</p>

             halloo'd out for assistance; he said somebody had robbed the waggon; I was on horseback; he said he was gone over into the fields; we followed him and took him, and tied him, and then we went and found the flat of butter on the near side, about two poles farther in the ditch; I found another; he said he had lost three; I went farther and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190050"/> found another on the foot-path; we took him to Acton-Bottom to the house of one Mr. Whitehead, who said he knew him, and that he went from his house at six o'clock at night.</p>

               <p>Atkins. There was about six dozen of butter in a flat.</p>

               <p>Jury to Hawkins. Did you take him with the butter on his back? - No, he threw it into the ditch, and ran across the road into the foot-path; he was never out of my sight till I took him; he is the man I saw pick it up, and run across the road.</p>

               <p>When did you see the book? - Just before I came out of the punch-house; I was doing some business there; I put it into the inside pocket of my coat.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was secure then? - Yes. As I was going through Butcher-row, I met two girls; they caught hold of me and asked me to treat them with a glass; I kept going on, and they kept up with me, entreating me to give them a glass; I said there was no house to treat them; they said there was one just by; I went with them and gave them a glass a piece. I came out and was going home; they followed me and begged me to give them more liquor. I would not; I said I would have nothing to do with them, that I was a married man. One of them came up before me with her petticoats up in a very indecent manner, jumped upon me, and got hold of me round the middle; I was sometime before I could loose myself from her; I asked her what she wanted, if she wanted to rob me; I believe I might damn her; I felt for my watch and money and found it was safe. I did not then recollect my pocketbook. When I had gone a little from them, I thought of my pocket-book, and missed it. I went back, but could not find them; I never found my book or notes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you did not slip it out of your pocket in the punch-house? - Yes, I felt it in my pocket in Fleet-street, as I was going along.</p>
               <p>Do you know the persons of either of the women? - Yes. I went home to my lodging, got up in the morning, and went to the place where we had the liquor, and described them to the woman that served us; she said she knew nothing of the woman. About nine o'clock in the morning I saw the two girls come out of a passage by Clement's-Inn. On seeing me they bustled along, and held down their heads; I pursued them, they divided, one ran towards Temple-bar, the other, which was the girl that jumped upon me, to Clement's-Inn. I pursued her, and took her, and asked her what she had done with the pocket-book she took from me the night before; she would not say any thing; I told her I would not hurt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190051"/> her if she produced the pocket-book; she would not confess at all.</p>
               <p>Are you positive to the person of the prisoner? - Yes; I took particular notice of her at the bar, where we had the liquor.</p>
               <p>Was she dressed as she is now? - I did not take notice of their dress, only of their features as they stood at the bar. The prisoner is the very same.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This I understand was on a Friday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any previous knowledge of the prisoner, had you ever seen her before that night? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>The meeting was accidental? - To me it was.</p>
               <p>How long was it after the girl ran up to you and embraced you that you missed your pocket-book? - It could not be half a minute I had gone but a few paces.</p>
               <p>Did not you when you met the girl in the morning ask her who she was and where she lived? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you go to this house? - I did not; I was present when he was brought before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Were there any promises made him? - No. There was a letter found in Clarke's possession, that led to his lodging; he acknowledged he met with Clarke at the Union-Arms, on Holbourn-hill; that Clarke asked him how halfpence went; he said any went there; Clarke said he had a great quantity that he had received at the last camp. He said he had had of Clarke at four different times twenty-eight shillings worth for a guinea. I found some halfpence in his pocket (producing them) that were made from the same die with those found in his lodging by Ball.</p>

About half after three in the morning the prisoner Timings came by me with a load of goods, the clothes hung down upon his heels; he endeavoured to shun me, by which I was persuaded he had not come honestly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190055"/> by them; I went to him and said, friend, what have you got here; he said nothing material; he said they belonged to a person at a publick-house, the sign of the Bell and Star; I said I thought he had not come honestly by them upon which he threw them down and said, he was well known in the neighbourhood and was within twelve doors of his own house; I said he should be examined, and the goods; he said he had a little tea in his waistcoat, and did not choose to be exposed.</p>
               <p>Did you take him? - No, he ran away; he was impressed about a fortnight afterwards; I secured the goods.</p>

On the 9th of December I was going down to Smithfield with some liquor to a customer; Dempster was standing at a lottery office door, No. 45, in Barbican; he called me across the way, and said the gentleman of that office wanted some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190057"/> liquor; I went in, and saw nobody but Dempster; he went out, and returned with a gentleman, and then asked me if I had any good rum; I said yes; he asked the price of it; I said eight shillings and sixpence; he said that was dear, and asked me to let him have a gallon; I said I would not serve him with a gallon; he said why; I said because I dare not; I told him I would recommend him where he might have a gallon. I went away; Dempster called me back; I thought then they had agreed to have two gallons. He asked me when I should be at home; I said in half an hour. I believe I said my housekeeper has got the key, she can serve you; she will draw it out of the cask next the window, which that price rum was in. He came before I returned, and had a gallon, and said I sent him for it; I told my housekeeper unless he had another gallon not to take the payment. I called at his house two days after and found the lottery-office shut up; I thought they were all gone; I rang a bell, and Dempster appeared; I asked him how he could come to my house for a gallon of rum, when I had told him I would not trust him; he said my maid need not be afraid, he would call and pay for it; he was to call and have another gallon of rum. A master carpenter came to my house about two months after, and said Dempster was at a building he belonged to, and he would speak to him; he told him he was in my power; he said if I meddled with him I should catch cold. I went to the Mansion-house and brought him before the alderman; he confessed there that he had the gallon of rum, and had sold it. He was committed on the Saturday and on the Monday was admitted to bail, but neither he nor his bail appeared; upon which he gave fresh bail last session; neither he nor his bail appeared, at least if they did I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You would have trusted this man with two gallons? - No, nor yet with a penny.</p>
               <p>He was to go however for two gallons to your house? - Yes; but not without money.</p>
               <p>Your housekeeper was to take the money of him? - She ought to have done it.</p>
               <p>Has she instructions to take money of every body that comes? - No; of strangers she has.</p>
               <p>Did you never see this gentleman before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you knew him at least by sight? - That is all.</p>
               <p>Then you knew he was a housekeeper? - No, I had heard the reverse.</p>
               <p>Do you believe or not that he is a housekeeper? - I believe he is not, if I was put to my oath.</p>
               <p>Recollect every thing you say is upon your oath, you are sworn to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth? - I am not sworn to that, whether he is or not a housekeeper.</p>
               <p>You are upon your oath; which do you believe, that he was or not an housekeeper? - Upon my oath I believe not.</p>
               <p>Then he certainly lodged in Barbican? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He called to you over the way and talked with you about dealing for some liquor? - That the gentleman was to deal for some liquor.</p>
               <p>Did you deal with that gentleman the lottery-office-keeper, to trust him for the liquor? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he say he would take the money with him? - Dempster did.</p>
               <p>Had you left any particular directions with your housekeeper that she should be paid for every thing? - Not that day in particular.</p>
               <p>I believe' you had mentioned a very particular cask, out of which this rum was to be drawn, it was to be the best you had? - Not the best I had.</p>
               <p>Had you fixed upon a particular cask? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had not this man offered to pay you over and over again? - I never saw the colour of his money.</p>
               <p>You know his money is either white or yellow, gold or silver? - He said he paid for it, but had he offered me payment I I would not take it.</p>
               <p>He offered you payment? - He said he would come and pay me.</p>
               <p>When did you call at his house to ask what was the meaning of this? - One or two days after.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190058"/>How long was it before you took him up by a warrant? - Two months after I believe.</p>
               <p>Did you ever call upon him in the intermediate time? - I did once.</p>
               <p>Did you ever meet him in the street? - I saw him in the street several times.</p>
               <p>Court. When was it he said he would pay you? - That same day he said he would bring the cask back, and pay; but I left orders not to take his money unless he had another gallon.</p>
               <p>Court. When was the first time you saw him after he bought it? - Two days; he then said he would bring the cask and money.</p>
               <p>How happened it, as you never sell less than two gallons, that this man should have a gallon cask out of your house? - I have a great many, twenty score.</p>
               <p>As you do not sell a gallon, what do you do with them? - I sell them sometimes seven or eight at a time. In the country they divide them among their acquaintance sometimes.</p>
               <p>Now you left this rogue loose upon the publick without going for a warrant? - A cooper that lives in our neighbourhood said he saw Dempster; that Dempster said he would call and have a gallon of Holland's geneva.</p>
               <p>Then if he would have taken another gallon you would not have thought of this prosecution? - No; I believe I should not.</p>
               <p>Do you remember a little bit of ground this man took just before your house with some fine trees on it that you was fond of? - I do not recollect that he took any.</p>
               <p>Do you remember that this man cut down some trees before your house? - He cut down a tree.</p>
               <p>You was angry at that, it spoiled your prospect? - I intended to take the ground myself.</p>
               <p>This place was very rural, he took it over your head? - He took it before me, I believe.</p>
               <p>He was tried for it was not he? - I heard so.</p>
               <p>He prevented your taking it? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>You wanted to take it? - Possibly I might.</p>
               <p>I cannot do with possibly, you can tell yourself you are upon your oath now? - What has this ground to do with this affair?</p>
               <p>Then possibly you did treat for this piece of ground? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you want to purchase it or rent it? - No; the landlord treated with me for it.</p>
               <p>Then you wanted it? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Court. You can tell whether you wanted it or not? - I had some thoughts of building a house there.</p>
               <p>Court. You must give your evidence fairly - Did you or not want to take this piece of ground? - I had a mind to take it.</p>
               <p>Why did not you take it, was it not that this man had treated for it, and purchased it? - I never heard he had purchased it.</p>
               <p>What did you believe then upon the subject? - That he had a mind to take it.</p>
               <p>Do not you believe that he is the owner of it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you glad or were you not that that tree was cut down? - Neither glad nor sorry; it was quite indifferent to me.</p>
               <p>Court. When was that tree cut down? - I do not know the day.</p>
               <p>Court. When you met Dempster two days after the rum was bought did he produce the money, or promise to pay you at a future day? - He did not produce the money, but said he would come at a future time to pay me.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether you think the proprietor of that ground would have permitted you to cut down the trees before you bargained with him for the ground or not? - I do not think he would; it was in his option whether he would permit me to cut down the tree or not.</p>
               <p>But do not you think he would have permitted you to cut down the tree till you had taken the ground? - I should suppose not.</p>

            ? - I did it inadvertently; he said Mr. Cary had sent him for it.</p>
               <p>Was it contrary to your master's orders, or how? - I do not know that any body had come to me for so little as two gallons before.</p>
               <p>Had you any orders to sell less than two gallons that day? - I do not know that Mr. Cary gave directions to sell less than two gallons.</p>
               <p>Did he produce any written order from Mr. Cary? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>What were his expressions when he said he came from Mr. Cary? - He said he had seen Mr. Cary that day at his house, and that he had ordered him to come for a gallon of rum.</p>
               <p>Did you make any difficulty about one gallon? - I did not think any thing about its being one gallon.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How many of these little gallon casks had you filled? - I do not know; several of them had gallons of brandy and gallons of rum; he often sells a gallon of rum and a gallon of brandy, or two gallons of rum and a gallon of brandy, or so.</p>
               <p>Was there any more kegs than one of rum? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Had Mr. Cary been at home after he went out in the morning? - He had been at home at dinner.</p>
               <p>Had he returned before this man called? - He had been at home at dinner.</p>
               <p>At what time did this man call? - I think it was candlelight.</p>
               <p>Had not Mr. Cary, upon your oath filled out that gallon for him? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you remember giving the man a gallon, and saying, you believed it was all brandy? - Yes; and I tasted it and found it was all brandy.</p>
               <p>Did he not say he would not have it unless it was all rum? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>For the Defendant.</p>
               <p>- PALMER sworn.</p>
               <p>We had bought some rum at different houses in the neighbourhood which was not so good; I mentioned it to Dempster; he said there was a friend of his would help us to some cheap; I said I should be glad to see that man. I was out one day, when I returned I saw this man, Mr. Cary there; when I came in, Dempster said, Mr. Palmer, this is the man I spoke to you about the rum; at the latter end of the lottery I did not wish to have any; I said I would have a gallon; he objected to that; he said I should have two gallons; he said have a gallon of brandy and one of rum; I would only have a gallon of rum; I thought that good enough for a lottery-office; I called him back, and said, if you will let me have a gallon of rum that will do; he said, I will not bring it, but I will manage it; that struck me at the time; Dempster stood by and said O I will fetch it in a keg; I said I had no bottles.</p>
               <p>Then his words were, he would manage it? - Yes, his express words were he would manage it. Dempster said he would bring it, and be answerable for the cask. What struck me was, I thought the man was a smuggler till he said he would manage it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. May I be permitted to ask why he did not send the money? - I did send the money.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was never tendered? - I paid Dempster for the rum; when the rum was brought I thought it not of so good a quality as it ought to have been, as I paid eight shillings and sixpence for it, and saw others advertise at seven shillings and sixpence. He said tell Mrs. such a one, if I am not at home, to draw it out of the farthest cask.</p>
               <p>So Dempster was to have it if he was not at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When this rum came it was not so very good as you expected? - Dempster and my wife tasted it, they asked my opinion, Dempster corked it up; he said he would take it back again; he had it under his arm; I said no, it is a friend of yours; I took it from him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190060"/> partly by force. I looked upon them as two friends at that time.</p>

My husband or Dempster, one of them, I cannot tell which, called him back again; my husband said, if you will let me have one gallon I will. Mr. Cary stood a minute or two, then he said I will not bring it, but I will manage it. Dempster stood close by; he said I will fetch it; Cary said very well, I shall be at home in half an hour or an hour's time. Dempster said he would call in two hours time; he said, if I am not at home my housekeeper will draw it out of the farthermost cask.</p>

On the 29th of April I met a gentleman in the street, whom I had lived with, who ruined me; he said he was sorry to see me in such a miserable condition, and he gave me three guines to buy me some clothes, that I might get into service. When I went home I showed them the money; they handed it about from one to another, and at last the prisoner took it, and she would never give it me again. I am sure she had it.</p>

             (upon whom Judgement had been respited) was put to the Bar, when Mr. JUSTICE WILLES delivered the Opinion of the Judges, as followeth:</p>
               <p>THE Question, submitted to the Judges, was,</p>
               <p>"Whether this offence amounted to a Robbery?"</p>
               <p>This point has been solemnly argued before the twelve judges, who all delivered their sentiments seriatim, and were unanimously of opinion that this was a robbery.</p>
               <p>The grounds and reasons for this opinion I shall briefly state to the court.</p>
               <p>The definition of robbery, as taken from Lord Hale and Hawkins, is,</p>
               <p>A felonious and violent taking any money or goods from the person of another, putting him in fear.</p>
               <p>To constitute therefore the crime of robbery three ingredients seem necessary.</p>
               <p>1. A felonious intention, or animus furandi.</p>
               <p>2. Some degree of violence or fear of violence.</p>
               <p>3. A taking from the person.</p>
               <p>As to the first point, the judges all clearly held, that here was a felonious intention:</p>
               <p>The prisoner, a stranger to Mr. Fielding, stops him in the street after it was dusk, between six and seven o'clock in January, and desired, he would give him a present; and when Mr. Fielding asked for what? he replied, You had better comply, or I will take you before a magistrate, and accuse you of an attempt to commit an unnatural crime.</p>
               <p>The conduct of the prisoner will not hear two constructions; his meaning was to get Mr. Fielding's money from him.</p>
               <p>If a man with or without a weapon drawn orders another to deliver his money, it is a robbery.</p>
               <p>So where a man, animo furandi, demands my money, the words he makes use of seem immaterial whether he says, Give me your money, or lend me, or make me a present, or words of the like import, it is a robbery.</p>
               <p>As to the several cases ingeniously put by the counsel for the prisoner, the judges declined giving any answer to them, saying that every case must depend on its own particular circumstances.</p>
               <p>For the judges declared they did not mean to draw the exact line what should or should not be construed a robbery, but only to say, that the facts proved in this case warranted them to think, that here there was a felonious intention in the prisoner to rob Mr. Fielding.</p>

               <p>The second point considered was, What degree of violence or fear was necessary to the crime of robbery.</p>
               <p>The putting in fear is not necessary to be laid in the indictment, so as the fact is charged to be done violently, and against the will.</p>
               <p>The circumstance of actual fear at the time of the robbery need not be proved, but the law in odium spoliatoris will presume it.</p>
               <p>This doctrine is to be found in Foster, 128, who there puts this case.</p>
               <p>"Suppose the true man is knocked down without any previous warning to awaken his fears, and lieth totally insensible whilst the thief rifles his pockets, would not this be a robbery? and yet where is the circumstance of actual fear?"</p>
               <p>And in the same page describing what degree of fear or violence is necessary to a robbery, the same learned judge says,</p>
               <p>"If the fact be attended with those circumstances of terror or violence, which in common experience are likely to induce a man to part with his property, for the safety of his person, that will amount to a robbery."</p>

               <p>"If thieves come to rob a man, and finding little about him, enforce him by menace of death, to swear on a book to fetch them a greater sum, which he doth accordingly, this (says his lordship) is a taking by robbery; and yet when he fetches the money he is removed from all terror but the fear of breaking his oath and is out of the reach of violence."</p>
               <p>It has been often held that actual violence is not necessary, but that constructive violence is sufficient.</p>
               <p>For where such a terror is impressed on my mind as does not leave me a free agent; and in order to get rid of that terror I deliver my money, it is a robbery.</p>
               <p>It is clear also that no actual danger is necessary; a man may commit a robbery without having any offensive weapon; and though a tinder-box or candlestick be used instead of a pistol, still it is a robbery.</p>
               <p>To examine the present case by these rules: Here are the strongest menaces, and well-grounded apprehensions of personal injury.</p>
               <p>A young gentleman from school accosted at night in London streets, by a person he never saw before, whom he must suspect to be a villain. The stranger demands a present. Even that seems sufficient; but the prisoner goes farther, and says, you had better comply, or I will take you before a magistrate. This is a threat of personal violence; for he had every thing to fear in being dragged through the streets as a culprit charged with an unnatural crime.</p>
               <p>And when a villian comes and demands money no one knows how far he will go.</p>
               <p>This therefore was a reasonable fear which might operate in constantem virum as well as in meticulosam, much more on the mind of a lad come home from school for the holidays.</p>
               <p>But it was said for the prisoner that this was, a fraudulent extorting, and not a taking by violence.</p>
               <p>In many cases fraud will supply the want of violence; as for instance, breaking is necessary to be laid in an indictment for burglary.</p>
               <p>And yet fraudulently getting admission into a house by colour of law, or pretence of taking lodgings or business, have been often held to be sufficient evidence of the breaking into the house.</p>
               <p>But the judges did not entirely determine the prisoner's case on this head, but were of opinion in this case there was a proof of constructive violence, which they thought sufficient.</p>
               <p>As to the third ingredient, here was clearly a taking from the person, though taking in his presence would have been sufficient.</p>
               <p>It may be proper here in my conclusion to state the several authorities, which support this determination of the judges.</p>
               <p>I shall not cite them at large, because they are all printed in the Session's Books.</p>
