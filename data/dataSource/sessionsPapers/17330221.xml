               <p>Compton Morris. The Prisoner came to my Shop for a Quarter of a Yard of printed Linen, for Robings, which she bought, and paid me 6 d. for. I had another Customer in the Shop, and a pretty many Goods lay tumbled on the Counter. I observ'd the Prisoner to be very busy about those Goods, and as she was going out, I suspected she had taken more than she should, and so I call'd her to come back, and said, Hussy, you have stolen something; but she ran away, and I jump'd over the Counter, and follow'd her. I came up with her at the Sun Tavern Door, and took her by the Collar, upon which she threw this Linen from under her Coats, and it fell upon the Threshold. We have been so pester'd with these Vermin in our Shops, that I vow and protest, there's no living for them, I have lost above ten Pounds by them since last Month. The Prisoner had been in my Shop before this time. <rs id="t17330221-7-verdict29" type="verdictDescription">

My House was robbed in the Night between the 22d and 23d of June, but none of the outward Part of my House being broken, I imagin'd that the Person who robb'd me had got in, in the Evening, and lay conceal'd till I and my Family were a bed, and then committed the Fact, and went out at the Door, for the Door was found a jar in the Morning. I had some Suspicion of the Prisoner, because she was seen in the Neighbourhood the Day before, and was well acquainted with my House. Upon which I went to her Lodging, and heard that she did not lie there that Night as I was robb'd. On the 28th of September I went after her to Shrewsbury, and -</p>
               <p>Court. Why did you stay so long before you pursued her?</p>
               <p>Crow. Because I expected her up again in a Month, and so thought to have saved that Trouble and Charge; but hearing she had taken a House at Oswistry in Shropshire, in order to settle there, I went, as I was saying, to Shrewsbury, where I got a Warrant to search her House. When I came thither, I found her at Home, and as soon as she saw me, she open'd a Chest, and took out a Pair of Stays that I had lost, and gave 'em to me. Jenny, says I, Where's your Mistress's Cloak and Hat? She said she'd fetch them; and so she did. And then she took the Tea-Spoons and Tongs out of the Chest, but told me, they were none of mine. I believe they were the same that I lost; but I can't swear to them, because they were not mark'd. I charg'd her with stealing these, and other Goods from me; but she said, those Goods and 20 l. were given her, by the Person who did the Robbery, that she might not discover it, and that she had nothing that belong'd to me, but what she had return'd to me; but next Day (Sept. 29.) when she was carry'd before the Justice, she said, she had bought the Goods; and her Father and Brother coming to intercede for her, I shew'd them a List of what I had lost, and ask'd them, if they knew any thing of those Goods? They said, Yes; and (while her Father staid) her Brother went and fetch'd my Coat, Waistcoat and Breeches, and she said, she bought them too.</p>

I said, about Nine; and suspecting them to be Rogues I run for it. They followed, and one coming close after me swore by God, he wou'd make me remember running; I held up my Stick, upon which another said, Damn him, does he resist? Kill him. Then the first struck at me with a Stick, I warded off 2 or 3 Blows, but at last I was knock'd down and stunned, and got a mighty Cut in my Head. I had some Rice and Prunes, and Stone Blue, in a Paper, which was taken from me, and about 19 Pence all Copper, in my Pocket. I had a Cag of Treacle too, but they did not take that; when I got up they run away. There was 4 or 5 of them in Company.</p>

               <p>John Davis. About 6 at Night I met the Prisoner in White-lion Street, by the Seven Dials. She ask'd me to drink a Dram, and I went with her to Mrs. Young's, a Chandler's Shop, and we had a Quartern and a half of Brandy in a Back-Room by our selves; I pulled out my Watch to see what a Clock it was, and put it up again; she ask'd me for a Shilling upon the Account of - but I did nothing with her. She went away before me, and I staying to count my Money miss'd my Watch. I describ'd her to the People of the House, and they said they knew her, but could not tell where she liv'd. They sent for me next Day, and I found the Prisoner and her Husband there, and they abused me barbarously.</p>

               <p>Constable. She own'd to me that she had the Watch, and had given it to her Husband, to pawn for 30 s. He was taken up for two or three Assaults, and is now in Bridewell - He had beat the Prosecutor, and made him all over bloody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He pick'd up two Women, and lay with them two Nights, at Moll Adams's in Newtoner's Lane.</p>
               <p>Davis. It's true, I was with Clarety-Face Hannah, and another Woman, but that was after I lost my Watch - I had nothing to do with them; I only went to them to enquire after the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They were his old Companions, for when he pick'd me up, he ask'd me, if I knew Clarety-Face Hannah in Castle-Court, and he told me, he used to go to her. He and I had two hot Pots, and two Quarterns of Brandy together; and he offer'd me first Six-pence and then a Shilling, and then he gave me Three-pence more, and, says I, what must I do for this Money? Why, says he, 'tis to let me - . The Jury found her <rs id="t17330221-18-verdict81" type="verdictDescription">

I have laid no more to his Charge in the Indictment, than what I found again at his Lodging in Honey-Lane Market, and at other Places, and what I have here to produce. When these Goods were restored to me, I compared several of the Quantities with the Pieces I had from whence they were cut, and they tallied. This Piece of White Mantua Silk in particular, has his own Mark of 36 half Yards on it, and-this, with the Piece I have at home, from whence it was parted, makes exactly that Measure; here are 49 Quantities cut off, which make 169 Yards in all, which we have put up in 7 Parcels, seal'd and mark'd; 5 of these Parcels I swear to, but the other 2, my Partner knows better than I.</p>
               <p>Richard Manning. I keep the Sign of the Carpenter and Weavers Arms, in Honey-Lane Market, the Weavers use my House to sell their Goods to other Weavers and Macklers, and I have a great many Warehouses on purpose to lay their Goods in; a Porter having at several Times brought several Parcels for the Prisoner - , to dispose of, I at last open'd some of them, and found them not to be whole Pieces nor Remnants, but Quantities cut off, which gave me some Suspicion. I shew'd them to several Weavers, who believ'd, with me, that they were stolen; upon which, I order'd my Boy (next time the Porter came) to dog him. The Boy did, and told me, that he follow'd the Porter to Mr. Biard's, at the Queen's-Arms, on Ludgate-Hill; I went to Mr. Biard's, and and told him, that his Porter had brought 9 Pieces of Silk to my House that Day for - . Mr. Biard came to my House, but did not own any of the Goods; however, he took one Piece of Cloth-colour'd Mantua, and went with me to several Mercers Shops, and at last matched it at Mr. Adams's. The Prisoner Fowl was not then within, but he came while we staid. He was charged with the Fact, and confess'd that he sent those and a great many other Goods by the Porter to my House for Mr. - . I met with - , and said to him, How came you to take such cut Goods from a Servant? You could not think he came honestly by them; I believe I have had as many left for you as came to 1000 l. It's no such Thing, says he, for I never paid Fowl above 100 l. for what I have had of him.</p>
               <p>Court. What Business does - follow?</p>
               <p>Manning. He's a Mackler -  one that sells Goods for the Weavers; and sometimes he makes Goods himself.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it not usual for Macklers to sell for Mercers as well as Weavers?</p>
               <p>Manning. No.</p>
               <p>Court. He own'd, you say, that he had the Goods from Fowl; did he say any thing how Fowl came by them?</p>
               <p>Manning. He told me that Fowl said he had them at a Sale.</p>

               <p>Several Witnesses appear'd for - , they gave him, in general, a good Character, and said, it belong'd to his Business to sell Remnants, as well as whole Pieces.

            . I am Servant to Mess. Trueman. On the 21st of Jan. I miss'd 3 Iron Pins and Chains belonging to the Drays, we have lost 16 within these 3 Weeks.</p>
               <p>William Hill, Watchman. Between 3 and 4 on Sunday Morning, as I was beating the Hour in Booth-street, (facing Princes-street) in Spittle-Fields, I heard a sort of a clinking, and looking about (for it was Moon-light) I saw a Man stooping down, and seemingly very busy about something, but as I made towards him he brushed off; this must be some Rogue, thought I to myself, and if I should run after him, 'tis ten to one if I catch him. So I made as if I had not seen him, and knock'd the Hour as if I was going my Rounds, and then hid my Lanthorn under my Coat, and stood out of Sight. Presently my Gentleman came back, and out I pops upon him, and now says I, Tho' you're the Devil I'll see who you be. Why so you may, Mr. Hill, says he, (for be gave me the Title of a Gentleman) What, is it you, Tom? says I, if I did not know you I wou'd carry you before the Officer of the Night. But what made you shun me ? Why, says he, I had a mind to play the Pool with that Woman; for there was a Man and a Woman standing together in the Street hard by. Now I always take it for a Rule, that wherever there's a Woman, there's Mischief.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you find any Goods upon him?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes, I found 3 Dray-pins with the Chains, in his Apron.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure the Prisoner is the same Man?</p>
               <p>Hill. The Prisoner? No, I know nothing of the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Why, of whom have you been telling this long Story?</p>

            . On the 14th of Jan. I met the Prisoner, and says he, Tom, if you'll go with me I can take off some Pins? So we went to Trueman's Brew-house, and he ring'd [wrung] off 4, and we sold them to a Smith in Gravel-Lane for a Penny a Pound, and on the 26th of January we took 3 more.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure it was the 26th?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I think so, but I know it was late on Saturday Night, and the Watchman stopt me with them between 2 and 3 on Sunday Morning, and the Prisoner then stood behind me, and there was another Man and Woman in the Street.</p>
               <p>Hill. I saw none but Robinson and that Man and Woman.</p>
               <p>Court. What Trade are you, Robinson?</p>
               <p>R. A Weaver, but I have work'd 12 Years with Mr. Coker at the Turnpike.</p>
               <p>Court. And what Business does the Prisoner follow?</p>
               <p>R. He drives Beasts and does labouring Work; he lives in Nagshead-Alley in Winfred-street, Spittle-Fields. I have been acquainted with him but 3 Weeks.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it a dark or light Night when you was taken?</p>

               <p>Parry. I believe they are; I am pretty positive that Bye was he that rode after me, but am not so certain as to the other, who dismounted Michael, and stood over him. Now as Bye and I were presenting our Pistols at each other, and crying, Shoot, and Fire, my Master, thinking I had pick'd a Quarrel with somebody, step'd out of the Chariot to see what was the Matter. Bye withdrew a little, but advancing again, my Master asked him what he wanted. Why, says Bye, I want your Watch and Money; deliver this Minute, or I'll fire. My Master did not seem to mind him, but call'd to my Fellow-Servant, and said, Michael, Why don't ye take your Horse and come to me? But Michael answer'd, They will not let me. Says Bye, I have 12 Slugs in this Piece, and if you don't deliver this Minute I'll fire thro' your Body. Still my Master did not seem to regard him, but call'd to Michael again; Michael answer'd as before, and so did Bye. But when my Master call'd to Michael the third time, Bye was quite out of Patience, and swore my Master's Body should suffer for all that Moment, if he did not deliver directly; upon which my Master called to me, and said, come hither Parry; I went, and he gave me his Silver Watch and 2 Guineas, to deliver to Bye, who would not take them of me, but gave my Master a deal of illprobus Language, and swore at him, Damn you, Sir, you shall bring them your self, or I'll shoot you through the Body immediately; and so then my Master took them from me again, and deliver'd them to him.</p>

I have lost 70 l. lately, but I know how to get 100 l. as soon as any Man in England; and after that, they went to their Horses. About 9 o'Clock, next Morning, I went from Egham, and walk'd to Hounslow, and about 12 I saw the General's Chariot, between the Powder-Mills and Hounslow, and about One, or between 1 and 2, I saw the Prisoners riding through Hounslow as hard as they could drive; my having heard them talk about their Horses, made me take the more Notice of them.

Why, don't you see I'm a Shaving? says Tims; Damn me, says Bye, I'll shave some Body by and by. Then the Ostler at the Crown led their Horses by the Door. One was a Bay Gelding with a swish-Tail, and t'other a brown Mare with a cut Tail.</p>
               <p>Bye. I did not say I'd shave some Body; but that I would be shav'd some where else.</p>

We were on Horseback, but went a foot-pace, and when we came to Belfound, where we live, the Parish Clock struck 12.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think that Clock went right?</p>
               <p>Sherburn. Yes; it went very right by the Neighbours Clocks. We past by the Coach while the Men were robbing it, and then they rode off towards London.</p>

               <p>Sherburn. I don't think these are the Men; for we had the View of them twice; the Capes of their Coats were up, and I saw but little of their Faces, and I think those Men were taller than the Prisoners.</p>

            . Mrs. Walker gave me Six-pence to remove her Goods from one Apartment to another in the same House; when I had done, the Prisoner Curd came by and saw this Coat in the Window between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon. He would sain have taken it away then, but I would not agree to it. Who lies in this Room to Night? says he; No-body, says I; Why then, says he, 'twill be a very good Chance to come at Night and take all these Things away. (For any thing we can steal we call a Chance - ) No, says I, it's too near Home, and I shall be suspected, and so he went away; but after it was dark we met again at a Brandy-shop we use, and then he asked me again about this Chance. At last he persuaded me, and we went together between 9 and 10 to see if we could do it conveniently; but when we came there he said two Men were not enough to stand upon one another's Shoulders and get in at the Window, and so we agreed to take in a fresh Hand. We went towards Covent-Garden<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173302210015"/> and met with the other Prisoner West, and brought him back with us from New-street to Cecil-Court and shew'd him the Place. We thought it was then too early to do Business, and so we went to Curd's Lodgings and lay down upon the Bed till 12, and then we got up and went to work. When we came under the Window they said, they believ'd that I only play'd the Fool with them, or had a Roguish Design to betray 'em, and therefore I should go in, or they would not be concern'd with me; so I consented. West pulled out the Pin of the lower Shutters as far as he could, I set one Foot upon that, and the other upon Curd's Shoulder, and taking hold by the Hook of the Window above with one Hand, I broke a Pane of Glass with the other, and so open'd the Casement and got in. I ty'd my Garter to the Handle of the Trunk and let it down to them; It was a round hairy Portmanteau-Trunk; they both took it and went away with it; while they were gone I got a Sheet and pack'd up in it what I could find. In less than an Hour they came again and whistled, I put the Bundle out of the Window for them, Curd was afraid to stand under it because his Head was broke, and West going to receive it, it knock'd him down, but he got up again, put it on his Head, and then went away with it. I ty'd a Curtain to the Back of a Walnut-tree Chair, and so let my self down, and left the Curtain flying, and follow'd them; but in a quarter of an Hour I bethought myself that I had left my Hat behind, and fearing that might make a Discovery, we planted the Goods and went back again; I got up by the Curtain, found my Hat, and came down the same Way. We preserv'd the Goods till Wednesday, and then being at a Gin-shop together, a Woman went by the Door crying, Old Cloaths to sell ; we call'd her in, and ask'd if she would buy a Sheet? she said Yes, or any thing else that we had, let it be what it would: Then we shew'd her the rest of the Goods, and she bought 'em all of us for 50 s. We divided 15 s. a-piece, and paid a Crown that we had run up at a Gift-shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. West, can you tell the same Story over-again?</p>
               <p>Smithson. Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Court. If you would be understood that the Account he has given is nothing but his own Invention, and in order to detect him, desire he may be put to repeat it, the Court will not deny you; but consider the Nature of such a Request; if he gives a different Account it may do you Service, but if he repeats all the Circumstances without Variation, it will strengthen his Evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. My Lord, we desire he may repeat it.</p>
               <p>Then Smithson gave the same Account as he had done before.</p>

            . As I was going to Newport-Market, between 5 and 6 at Night, I saw two Boys at Nind's Door, I past them, and presently they came along, each with 2 Cheeses on his Head, and went to Curd, who stood at the Corner of the Street; they put the Cheeses on his Head, and something in his Lap, and went away together. I did not then think they were stolen; but as I came back, I heard a Disturbance in Mr. Nind's Shop, and asking what was the Matter; a Woman, said, they had lost 2 Cheeses; I told them which way the Boys went ; we follow'd 'em, and saw Curd and three more, at the Corner of Hays's-Court. Curd went up the Court, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173302210016"/> the others went another way, I follow'd Curd and took him.</p>

I did not then suspect them to be Rogues, but thought they had broke the Glass by Mischance. But while I was looking, Walter came out, and putting his Hand in at the broken Pane, took out a Piece of Sarcenet, and went again into the Entry: Then the other Prisoner took out something else, I think it was a Pair of Stockings, and went after Walter; in a little Time they both came out again, Hastings with a Pair of white Stockings in his Hands, and Walter with the Sarcenet in his Apron. Walter came up toward where I stood, and Mrs. Wells took him by the Collar, and pulled him into her Shop; he said, he had found the Silk. Another pursued Hastings, and took him. As we were carrying them before a Justice, Hastings threw something into a Shop Window; we look'd and found a Pair of white Stockings, and the other Pair was found upon Walter, when he was search'd before the Justice.</p>

I stood with my Back to the House, and he with his Back to the Fields, and being taller than I was, I could the better observe his Face by the Lamp. I said, aloud, Take away your Pistol, and you shall have what I have got. No, he swore he would not, and kept punching me with his Pistol. I took out my Watch and gave it him; he took it with his Left Hand, and then had his Accomplices (who I believe to be the Prisoner and this other Person) to search my Pockets, which they did, and took out 4 Shillings, and 2 Sixpences. Says I, If you'll leave the Watch for me at any House, I'll bring the Money for it. They would not agree to that, but Butler bid me make off, or he would send a Ball after me. As I was going, I found my Breeches were cut all down the Side; I gather'd them up as well as I could, and went to a Watchman in Holbourn; I told him my Case, and he came back with me to the middle of Duke-street to look for 'em, but we could not find 'em.</p>

            , and so into Mrs. Duncomb's Chambers. She did so, and opened Mrs. Duncomb's Door. They enter'd: But the Surprize, the Horrour they were in, is not to be express'd, when the first Object they fix'd their Eyes on was the poor unhappy young Maid murder'd! inhumanly murder'd! and lying weltring in her own Blood, her Hands clench'd, her Hair loose, and her Throat cut from Ear to Ear! A terrible Spectacle. But this was not all, the tragical Scene did not close here; the honest old Servant lay strangled on her Bed, and a little farther, her good old Lady robb'd of her Life in the same manner.</p>
               <p>Those who lodge in the Temple must be under a particular Consternation on this account, when by their manner of living they are obliged to trust their Keys, their Chambers, their Properties, and even their Lives to others.</p>
               <p>About Twelve the same Night Mr. Kerrel coming home, found the Prisoner (who was his Laundress) in his Chambers; he little expected to see her there at such an Hour. He had heard of these Murders, and that she had formerly chair'd for Mrs. Duncomb, he asked her if any body was taken up for the Murders. She said, No. He told her, it was suspected the Fact must have been done by some Body that was acquainted with the deceas'd: And as he had heard that she had formerly done Business there, she should continue no longer in his Service, and therefore bid her look up his Things and go. Upon examining he miss'd some of his Cloaths, and she confess'd she had pawned them. This made him still more uneasy, and he resolved she should stay no longer: Upon which she went down Stairs. His Suspicion caused him to search further, and in the Close-stool he found some Linen, and a Silver Tankard, with the Handle bloody. Looking under his Bed, he found a Shift and an Apron all bloody. These Discoveries gave him an extraordinary Concern; he call'd the Watch, and sent them after her: And such was the Providence of God, that she had not Power to go beyond the Inner-Temple Gate: There she was found sitting between two Watchmen; she was brought back to him; he shewed her the Tankard and the Linen bloody as they were, and asked her if they were hers; she said yes, and that the Tankard was left her by her Mother. The Officers of the Temple carried her to the Constable, by whom she was taken before Alderman Brocas.</p>
               <p>These are the Facts, and if we can prove these things were found upon her, and that she own'd them to be hers; and if we prove that they were not hers, but Mrs. Duncomb's, I believe the Jury will have no Difficulty to find her guilty.</p>

            . The Prisoner has been my Laundress about a quarter of a Year. She was recommended to me as an honest. Woman by a Gentleman in the Temple. On Sunday the 4th of this Month, as I returned from Commons,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173302210023"/> I met Mr. Gehagan, and going with him thro' Tanfield-Court, we found a Mob there, and enquiring what was the Matter, we were told of the Murders that had been committed. Says Mr. Gehagan, This Mrs. Duncomb was your Sarah's (the Prisoner's) Acquaintance. We went forward to the Coffee-house in Covent-Garden; there we heard several discoursing about these Murders, and it was the general Opinion that they must have been committed by some Laundress who was acquainted with the Chambers. From thence we went to the Horseshoe and Magpye in Essex-street, where we staid till One in the Morning, and then returned Home. I found my Door open, and the Prisoner in my Room; So, Sarah, says I, are you here at this Time of Night? You knew Mrs. Duncomb, have you heard of any Body that is taken up for the Murders? No, says she, but a Gentleman who had Chambers under her has been absent two or three Days, and he is suspected. Says I, No Body that was acquainted with Mrs. Duncomb shall be here, till the Murderer is found out; and therefore look up my Things and go away. In the mean time Mr. Gehagan went down to call the Watch, but he could not find the Door readily, and so he came up again, and I went down and call'd two Watchmen, and brought them up, and I found her turning over some Linen in my Drawers, I asked her who it belong'd to? She said it was her own. I went into the Closet, and missing my Waistcoats, I asked her what she had done with them? She called me aside, and said she had pawned them at Mr. Williams's in Drury-Lane, for two Guineas, and pray'd me not to be angry. I told her I was not so angry on that account, but I suspected she was concerned in the Murder. The next Thing I took Notice of was a Bundle lying on the Ground; I asked her what it was, she said it was her Gown. And what's in it? says I. Why Linen, says she, that is not proper for Men to see; and so I did not offer to open it. I searched farther, and miss'd several Things of my own, and found other Things that did not belong to me, and then I charged the Watch with her, and bad them take her away, and take care of her. When she was gone, I found another Bundle in my Bed-chamber; upon this, I call'd to Mr. Gehagan, and shew'd it him; whereupon we resolved to make a thorough Search, and so look'd in the Close-Stool, where we found some more Linen, and a Pint Silver Tankard, with a bloody Handle. We then went to one of the Watchmen again, and he said, he had let her go, upon her promising to come again at 10 o'Clock in the Morning. I bid him find her out by all Means. He hipp'd to his Brother Watchman at the Gate, and they went and brought her to me. I shew'd her the bloody Tankard and Linen, and ask'd her, if they were hers? She said, Yes; they were left her by her Mother. I ask'd, how the Handle of the Tankard came to be bloody? She said, she had cut her Finger, and as for the Linen, she said, it was not Blood upon it, but a Disorder.</p>
               <p>Court. What kind of Linen was it, did you open the Bundle?</p>
         
               <p>N. B. The remaining Part of the Trials, for want of room, will be Published on Monday next.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173302210025"/>Mr. Kerrel. I open'd that which I found in my Bed-Chamber; but my Confusion was so great, that I don't know whether it was Shifts or Aprons. She told me the Tankard had been in pawn, and that she had pawn'd my Waistcoats to redeem it. The Watchman carry'd her to the Watch-house, and there they found a green Silk Purse with 21 Counters, in her Bosom.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you positive that she own'd the Tankard and the Linen to be hers?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kerrel. Yes; but the Linen in her Gown was left unopen'd till after she was sent to the Watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was the Linen you found in the Close-stool bloody?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kerrel. I am not sure whether it was that, or the Linen I found under my Bed that was bloody, for I was very much surprised, and I brought one Parcel down, and Mr. Gehagan brought another, and we threw them down in the Watchman's Box, and so they were mix'd together.</p>
               <p>Court. Shew the Tankard to the Jury, and unseal the Linen, and let them see that too, and the other Things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kerrel. This is the green Silk-Purse, that was found upon her in the Watch-House; she said, she found it in the Street; but some Body taking Notice that it was clean, she then said, she had wash'd it since. This is the Gown, that some of the Linen was wrap'd in, and this is the bloody Apron that was found under my Bed, and which, she said, was not bloody, but the Marks of a Disorder.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was the Linen wet or dry?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kerrel. I can't say which, but it was bloody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you take it up?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kerrel. I took up that under the Bed, and in the Close-Stool. The clean Linen that was in the Drawers, she took out herself, and the Watchman afterwards fetch'd away that which was in the Gown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was the Gown bloody, or the Shift bloody in the Sleeves, or the Bosom, or any where but in the lower Part?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kerrel. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the Shift here?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kerrel. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Produce it then, and let some Body look on it.</p>

            . I cannot be positive; but it seems like the rest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, to Mr. K. Did you suspect me on account of finding me in your Chambers so late on Sunday Night, or was it because you saw me counting Money there on Sunday Morning?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kerrel. I saw no Money that you had on Sunday Morning. I suspected nothing of you, till I found you so late in my Chambers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Swear him if he did not see me counting Money in the Morning, or if he did not count it after me?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kerrel. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you count 90 l. in your own Bed after me?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kerrel. No, I say I know nothing of it. If you had had so much Money, you might have fetch'd my Things out of pawn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What! Did not you reckon how many Broad-Pieces and Moidores, and how much Silver there was?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173302210026"/>Mr. Kerrel. No, if I had, I should have suspected you afterwards; but I had not then heard of the Murder, for it was not known till 2 in the Afternoon, and after I had heard it, I went to the Coffee-House, and did not return home, till 1 o'Clock on Monday Morning. If I had seen you have so much Money on Sunday Morning, I should have had such a Suspicion of you when I first heard of the Murder, that I should have come home directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. 'Tis hard that he will deny, upon his Oath, what he did with his own Hands.</p>
               <p>Court. What time in the Morning was this?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. About 9 o'Clock; and he ask'd me, where I had it? And I told him, from some Relations in the Country.</p>
               <p>Court. What Time did she come to your Chambers?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kerrel. About 9 in the Morning. I sent her for some Tea. Mr. Gehagan breakfasted with me, and she stay'd till about 1 o'Clock, when the Horn founded for Commons.</p>
               <p>Council. There was, you say, clean Linen taken out of the Drawers?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kerrel. I think this is the same.</p>
               <p>Council. Was there any Blood upon it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kerrel. No I should have seiz'd her presently, if I had found any Blood before she went away first.</p>
               <p>Council. Did she own that clean Linen to be hers too?</p>

            . I have Chambers over the Alienation-Office, 3 Pair of Stairs high. Mine are on the Left-Hand, and Mr. Kerrel's on the Right, we are very intimate together. On Sunday Morning, the 4th of February, I rose about 8 o' Clock, and saw Mr. Kerrel's Door shut. About 9, the Prisoner came up, and open'd his Door, and went in, and it was not 10 Minutes before he came to my Bed-Side, and says he, You was a good Advocate for me last Night, and I'll give you a Breakfast. He gave her a Shilling to fetch some Tea; she made it, and stay'd till the Horn blew for Commons. And after Common's he and I went out together. Going thro' Tanfield-Court, we found a Mob there, and seeing Mr. Clark, a Writer, we ask'd, what was the Matter? He told us of the Murder, and said to Mr. Kerrel, this is your Laundress's Acquaintance. We went to a Coffee-House, in Covent-Garden, where some Gentlemen talking about the Murder, said, they should suspect some of the Laundress's. We stay'd there till 8, and then went to the Horse-Shoe and Magpye, in Essex-Street, where we stay'd till 1 in the Morning, and then going home, we found his Door open, a Fire and Candle in the Room, and the Prisoner standing by the Fire-Side. Says Mr. Kerrel, Sarah, this Mrs. Duncomb was one of your Acquaintance, have you heard of any Body's being taken up for the Murder? She said, that one Mr. Knight, who had Chambers under Mrs. Duncomb's, was suspected. Well, says Mr. Kerrel, I'll have no Body stay in my Room, that was acquainted with Mrs. Duncomb. I went down to call the Watch, but there being a double Door to the Alienation-Office, I fumbled, and could not get it open; so he came down and brought the Watch up. He miss'd his Waistcoats, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173302210027"/> ask'd her where they were? She desir'd him to let her speak a Word with him in private? He said, No, I have no Business with you that needs be made a Secret of. Then she told him they were pawn'd. He kick'd a Bundle that lay in the Closet, and ask'd her what it was? She said it was an old Gown of hers, with a Shift and Apron in it; but it was a very indecent Sight for a Man to see, and therefore desired him not to look into it, and so he put it aside again. Then the Watch took her down, and when she was gone he look'd under his Bed, and found another Bundle, Zounds! says he, here's another Bundle of Linen that this Bitch has left behind her; and looking farther, he found the Li nen and the bloody Tankard in the Closestool. We went down together, and he called to the Watch, and ask'd him where the Woman was? The Watchman said he had let her go. You Dog, says Mr. Kerrel, go and find her again, or I'll send you to Newgate. The Watchman soon met with her, and brought her to us. You bloody murdering Bitch you! says I, was it not enough to rob the People, and be damn'd to you, but you must murder them too? I'll see you hang'd, you Bitch! you bloody Bitch you! So I shew'd her the Tankard, and she began to wipe the Handle with her Apron; but says I, No, you bloody Bitch, you shan't wipe it off. She said it was her own, and that her Mother gave it her, and that she had fetch'd it out of pawn, where it had lain for 30 s. You bloody Bitch you, says I, your Mother was never worth such a Tankard. I had much ado, to keep my Hands off of the Bitch.</p>
               <p>Court. How came ye to know that the Prisoner was acquainted with Mrs. Duncomb?</p>
               <p>Mr. Gehagan. She told me so herself.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the Linen that was taken out of the Close-stool?</p>
               <p>Mr. Gehagan. Mr. Kerrel gave me that Linen and the Tankard, and I carried them down. I saw this bloody Apron and bloody Smock taken out of the Gown. The Bundle was in the Closet when Mr. Kerrel mist his Waistcoats, but it was not open'd then; the Watchman fetch'd it away afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was the Blood on the Tankard dry?</p>
               <p>Mr. Gehagan. It appear'd then to be fresh.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was the Blood on the Shift and Apron wet or dry?</p>
               <p>Mr. Gehagan. I don't know certainly.</p>
               <p>Pris. Who took the Shift up?</p>
               <p>Mr. Gehagan. I had it in my Hand; the Blood on it was like that on the Tankard, which I thought was wet.</p>
               <p>Pris. It had been folded up ever since, till now, and if it was wet then, it must be damp still if no Air has come to it. - Was the Linen in the Close-stool bloody, and what Linen was it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Gehagan. I don't know what Linen it was, nor whether it was bloody or no.</p>
               <p>Pris. Was the Linen in the Gown delivered to me before I went to the Watch-house ?</p>
               <p>Mr. Gehagan. No; on her saying it was indecent it was left, but the Watchman came afterwards and said the Constable thought it necessary to have the Smock and Apron.</p>
               <p>Pris. What Gown had I on?</p>
               <p>Mr. Gehagan. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Pris. I would ask Mr. Kerrel the same Question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kerrel. You came up in that blue<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173302210028"/> Riding-hood you have on now, but I did not mind what Gown.</p>
               <p>Pris. Had I any Blood on my Cloaths, or was I clean drest?</p>
               <p>Court. Why it was Monday Morning when you was taken, you had 24 Hours time to shift your Cloaths.</p>
               <p>Pris. Had I shifted my self with clean Linen.</p>

               <p>J. Mastreter. I was on my Watch in the Temple that Night the Murder was done; and nothing past but Gentlemen going to their Chambers. Next Night, or Monday Morning at past 1 o'Clock, Mr. Kerrel called Watch! I went up to him, and he bid me call another Watch, and so I brought

             to him. Then Mr. Kerrel said, Come up, Watchmen; so we went up and he searched his Drawers, and what Linen was not his own he threw out. Then he went to search for his Cloaths in a Portmanteau-Trunk in the Closet where he mist his Waistcoats, and asked the Prisoner what was become of them? She said she had pawned them. He said he could freely forgive her for pawning them, but he suspected she was concerned in the Murder, because he had heard her talk of Mrs.

            ; therefore, says he, Watch take care of her, and do not let her go. So we carried her down, and as nothing was found upon her, I and my Brother Watchman agreed to let her go, upon her promising to be forth-coming at 10 in the Morning. It was a very boisterous Night, and in 5 Minutes after she was gone Mr. Kerrel and Mr. Gehagan came down with a bloody Tankard and bloody Linen. Mr. Kerrel ask'd me where the Woman was, I said I had let her go. Says he if you don't bring her again I'll take care of you. So I call'd my Brother Watch and he found her sitting between 2 other Watchmen at the Temple-Gate. We carried her back to Mr. Kerrel. He shewed her the Tankard, and ask'd her whose it was? She said it was hers, that she had had these 5 Years, and that it was given her by her Mother. He ask'd her how the Handle came to be bloody? She said she had a Prick in her Finger, and she shewed it me. It look'd as if it was done with a rusty Nail.</p>

My Brother Watchman, Mastreter, went, and then he called me too; we went up Stairs, and the Prisoner opened the Door to us. Mr. Kerrel look'd in his Drawers, and in the middle Drawer there was a Pair of Earrings, which she own'd, and took them out and put them in her Bosom. In another Room there was some Clothes, and he ask'd her about his Waistcoats, she went to whisper him, and said, they were pawn'd; he was angry with her, and said, Why did not you ask me for Money? Then he bid me and Mastreter take Care of her; but as we were not charged with her before a Constable, we thought we had no Occasion to keep her in Custody, and so we discharged her; she went as far as Tanfield-Court Arch, and then she turn'd back, and said, it was late, and she liv'd as far as Shoreditch; and therefore had rather sit up in the Watch-house all Night than go home; No, says I, you shall not sit up in the Watch-house, and therefore go about your Business, and be here again at 10 o'Clock. She said she would come at 10, and so she went away. But soon after she was gone, Mr. Kerrel came down with a Tankard and some clean Linen, and very angry he was that we had let her go. I went after her, I found her at the Temple Gate sitting betwixt 2 Watchmen; I told her Mr. Kerrel wanted to speak with her, and (that I might get her along the more easily) I said, he was not so angry then, as he was before, and so I brought her with me: He shew'd her the Tankard, and she said it was her Mother's; he ask'd how it came bloody, she said she had prick'd her Finger.</p>

Mrs. Love came to me, and said she had been knocking at Mrs. Duncomb's Door and could not get in, and that she believed Mrs. Betty (the old Maid) was dead, and that Nanny was gone to acquaint her Sister with it, and that the old Lady could not get up. This was about one a Clock, and at two she told me she had sent Sarah (the Prisoner) for a Smith to break open the Door, but he was not come, and she knew not how to get in. Says I, My Master Grisly's Chambers, you know, are opposite to Mrs. Duncomb's. He went away last Tuesday, and Mr. Twysden has left the Keys with me to let the Chambers. Now I'll see if I can't get out of his Chamber Window into the Gutter, and so into Mrs. Duncomb's Apartment. She desired me to try, and so I did: I got into the Gutter; I broke a Pane in Mrs. Duncomb's Window, opened the Casement, and went in. Here's her Window, and here's her Door; the Door was lock'd and bolted; I opened it, and Mrs. Rhymer and Mrs. Love came in: I did not then see the Prisoner; but I believe she came soon after.

            . Mrs. Duncomb has cut Shifts for me exactly in the same Manner; these Shifts have not been wash'd, I believe, for many Years, but they were laid up in the Box with her Money and the Tankard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Rhymer took no Notice of this Linen. It was strange that she could not see it; she that open'd the Box so often must know every Trifle that was in it.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Rhymer. I have seen Linen at the bottom of the Box, but I did not open it to look at it.</p>

            . Mr. Farlow came to me at the Rainbow Coffee-house at Temple Bar, to go with the Coroner and view the Bodies. In the first Room I found the young Maid, 
               <persName id="t17330221-52-person486">

            , lying in Bed with her Hair loose, and only her Shift on: her Chin was fixt down, as if done with a Design to hide the Cuts in her Throat. I lifted her Chin up and found three Incisions; one of them was not mortal, but the middle one divided the Windpipe, which was cut three Parts through, and either this or the third Wound was sufficient to cause her Death. Wounds in the Windpipe, indeed, are not always mortal, for they may sometimes be cur'd; but in a Case like this, where the great Blood Vessels were cut, the unavoidable Consequence must be Death. She had no Headclothes on, and her Hair was loose, and she seem'd to have struggled hard for her Life.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173302210034"/> In leaning over the Bed the Mob press'd so hard upon me, that I was in Danger of having my Legs broke, so that I could not be so particular in my Observation as I could have been. The next Body I view'd was that of Elizabeth : She was strangled, and it appear'd to have been by some narrow String, as an Apron-string, or a Packthread. It was pull'd so tight that the Skin was divided, and the Mark very deep. There was likewise the Mark of Knuckles on her Windpipe, and the Blood had gush'd out at her Nose. She had a Gown and Petticoat on and a pair of Stockings. I knew her when I was an Apprentice. She had fore Legs, and for that Reason, I suppose, she might lye in her Stockings. Her Gown too seem'd to be a sort of a Bed Gown, and I believe, being old and infirm, she lay both in that and her Petticoat too. The last Body was that of Mrs. Duncomb. There was a little Crease about her Neck, which was just enough to give a Suspicion that it was made by a String, being ty'd round, but the Mark was so small, that had she not been so very antient and weak, that a little Matter, indeed, would have put an End to her Life, one could hardly have thought that to have been the Cause of her Death.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you see the Strings on the Apron?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bigg. Yes, they were bloody at the Ends.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Might they have been murder'd with those Strings and no Blood appear in the Middle?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bigg. They might have been strangled without making the Strings bloody at all. But the Strings being bloody only at the Ends, which when the Apron was ty'd on, would hang before, the Blood might come upon them in the same manner as upon the rest of the Apron, or it might be by folding the Apron up before it was dry.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If I had this Apron and did the Murder in it, how is it possible that my Shift should be bloody both behind and before?</p>
               <p>Council. My Lord, we shall now shew that it was practicable for the Door to be bolted within Side by a Person who was without.</p>

            . The Prisoner was brought to Newgate on Monday the 5th of February: I had some Knowledge of her, because she us'd to come thither to see one * Johnson, and Irishman, who was convicted for stealing a Scotchman's Pack. She saw a Room where the Debtors were, and ask'd if she might not be in that Room. I told her it would cost her a Guinea, and she did not look like one that could pay so much; she said, if it was two or three Guineas, she could send for a Friend that would raise the Money. Then she went into the Tap-house among the Felons, and talk'd very freely with them. I call'd for a Link and took her up into another Room, where there was none but she and I. Child, says I, there is Reason to suspect that you are guilty of this Murder, and therefore I have Orders to search you; (tho' indeed, I had no such Orders) and with that I begun to feel about her Hips, and under her Petticoats. She desir'd me to forbear searching under her Coats, because she was not in a Condition, and with that she shew'd me her Shift, upon which I desisted. Then I examin'd down her before, and feeling under her Arms, she started and threw her Head back: I clapt my Hand to her Head, and felt something hard in her Hair, and pulling off her Cap, I found this Bag of Money. I ask'd her how she came by it, and she said it was some of Mrs. Duncomb's Money; but Mr. Johnson, says she, I'll make you a Present of it, if you will but keep it to yourself, and let no body know any thing of the Matter, for the other Things that are against me are nothing but Circumstances, and I shall come off well enough, and therefore I'll only desire you to let me have 3 d. or 6 d. a Day till the Sessions is over, and then I shall be at Liberty to shift for myself. I told the Money over, and to the best of my Remembrance, there was twenty Moidores, eighteen Guineas, five Broad-Pieces, I think one was a 25 s. Piece, and the others 23 s. Pieces, a half Broad-Piece, five Crowns, and two or three Shillings; I seal'd them up in the Bag, and here they are.</p>
               <p>* Alexander Johnson was try'd in July last. Vid. Sessions Paper, Numb. 6. p. 156.</p>
               <p>Court. How did she say she came by the Money?</p>
               <p>Johnson. She said she took this Money and this Bag from Madam Duncomb, and begg'd me to keep it secret; My Dear, says I, I would not secrete the Money for the World. She told me too, that she had hired three Men to swear the Tankard was her Grandmother's, but could not depend upon them; that the Name of one was

            , another was - Smith, and I have forgot the third. After I had taken the Money away she put a Piece of Mattress into her Hair, that it might appear of the same Bulk as before. Then I lock'd her up and sent to Mr. Alstone, and told him the Story; and, says I, Do you stand in a dark Place to be a Witness of what she says, and I'll go and examine her again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I tied my Handkerchief over my Head to hide the Money, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173302210036"/> Buck happening to see my Hair fall down he told Johnson; upon which Johnson came to me, and said, I find the Cole's planted in your Hair, let me keep it for you, and let Buck know nothing of it. So I gave Johnson 5 Broad-Pieces, and 22 Guineas, not gratis, but only to keep for me, for I expected it to be return'd when Sessions was over. As to the Money, I never said I took it from Mrs. Duncomb, but he ask'd me what they had to rap against me, I told him only a Tankard; he ask'd me if that was Mrs. Duncomb's, and I said Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Johnson, were those her Words, This is the Money and Bag that I took?</p>
               <p>Johnson. Yes; and she desired me to make away with the Bag.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alstone. On the Day she was committed Mr. Johnson sent for me, and said he had found a Bag of Money in her Hair; he shew'd me the Money, and would have had me to have taken it, but I refus'd. I asked him where the Bag was, he said he had left it with her. I told him he should have taken that too, because there might be some Mark upon it. He said he'd call her, and get it from her, and he desir'd me to stand out of Sight, and hear what she said. I accordingly stood in a dark Place and she came up and delivered the Bag to him, and desired him to burn it, or to destroy it some Way or other. She said she only wanted Witnesses to swear to the Tankard, and for all the rest she could do well enough. She afterwards told me, Part of the Money that was found on her was Mrs. Duncomb's, and taken out of her Chamber; that two Men and a Woman were concerned with her, and that she herself was the Contriver, and laid the Scheme of the Robbery; that she let them in, and sate upon the Stairs to watch while they committed the Fact, but that she knew nothing of the Murder; that one Will. Gibbs had been with her from the two Alexanders (the Men who she said were concerned with her) and that she had sent them 10 Guineas.</p>

If it is upon Oath it cannot be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173302210037"/> read, for Persons are not to swear against themselves; all Examinations ought to be taken freely and voluntarily, and not upon Oath, and then we can read 'em. Indeed if afterwards the Examinant will accuse others, his Information may be separately taken upon Oath, but then it is not to be brought in Evidence against him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Johnson swears he found 20 Moidores on me, and Mrs. Rhymer swore there was but 18 lost.</p>
               <p>Court. She was not positive, but said there might be about so many.</p>
               <p>Council. My Lord, we have gone thro' our Evidence, I shall only take Notice of a few Particulars, and then submit the Whole to your Lordship and the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kerrel and Mr. Gehagan have given an Account, that upon searching Mr. Kerrel's Room they found some clean Linen which the Prisoner owned to be hers.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Crowder, upon comparing the Cut and Darning of this Linen, verily believes that it was Mrs. Duncomb's, and that it was in the Box where the Money was kept.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Rhymer too had seen some Linen there, but is not so particular.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kerrel found a Tankard in his Close-stool with the Handle bloody; the Prisoner own'd this Tankard to be hers, but endeavours to account for the Blood by saying that she had prick'd her Finger.</p>
               <p>Mastreter says, That her Finger indeed appeared to have been hurt, but that the Wound was not fresh. And Mrs. Rhymer and Mrs. Crowder both swear positively that the Tankard was Mrs. Duncomb's.</p>
               <p>The bloody Linen, and especially the Apron, are strong Circumstances against her; and as to Mrs. Duncomb's Door being left bolted within-side we have shewn by two unexceptionable Witnesses how easily it might be done.</p>
               <p>Johnson's finding the Money in her Hair, and her desiring him to conceal it and destroy the Bag, and the rest of her Conversation with him, discovers how well practised she was in Wickedness; and her confessing that the Money was Mrs. Duncomb's, and that she took it out of Mrs. Duncomb's Chambers, is a Circumstance so strong as amounts to a Proof.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes; I own'd Part of the Money to be hers, but not that I took it out of her Chambers; and it was Johnson that instigated me to burn the Bag.</p>
               <p>Council. And the Prisoner has frequently called upon the Witnesses to declare whether the bloody Linen was wet or dry; what Cloaths she had on, and whether they were bloody or not? I know not what Service it could do her if it was allowed that the Blood was dry, and that there was no Blood on her Cloaths, when it is remembered that it was 24 Hours from the Time the Fact was committed to the Time that the Linen was found, and she was suspected; a Time sufficient for the Blood to dry, and for her to shift her Cloaths.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Modesty might compel a Woman to conceal her own Secrets if Necessity did not oblige her to the contrary; and 'tis Necessity that obliges me to say, that what has been taken for the Blood of the murdered Person is nothing but the free Gift of Nature.</p>
               <p>This was all that appeared on my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173302210038"/> Shift, and it was the same on my Apron, for I wore the Apron under me next to my Shift. My Master going out of Town desir'd me to lye in his Chamber, and that was the Occasion of my soul Linen being found there. The Woman that wash'd the Sheets I then lay in can testify that the same was upon them, and Mr. Johnson who searched me in Newgate has sworn that he found my Linen in the like Condition. That this was the Case is plain; for how is it possible that it could be the Blood of the murder'd Person?</p>
               <p>If it is supposed that I kill'd her with my Cloaths on, my Apron indeed might be bloody, but how should the Blood come upon my Shift? If I did it in my Shift, how should my Apron be bloody, or the back part of my Shift? And whether I did it dress'd or undress'd, why was not the Neck and Sleeves of my Shift bloody as well as the lower Parts?</p>
               <p>I freely own that my Crimes deserve Death; I own that I was accessary to the Robbery, but I was innocent of the Murder, and I'll give an Account of the whole Affair.</p>

We likewise propos'd to rob Mr. Oaks in Thames-street; she came to me at my Master's, Mr. Kerrel's Chambers, on the Sunday before the Murder was committed ; he not being then at Home, we talked about robbing Mrs. Duncomb; I told her I could not pretend to do it by myself, for I should be found out. No, says she, there are the two Alexanders [Thomas and James] will help us. Next Day I had 17 Pounds sent me out of the Country, which I left in Mr. Kerrel's Drawers.

Between 10 and 11 she said, We can do it now. I told her I would go and see, and so I went Up-stairs and they followed me; I met the young Maid on the Stairs with a blue Mug, she was going for some Milk to make a Sack-Posset; she asked me who those were that came after me; I told her they were People going to Mr. Knight's below.

It was a very stormy Night; there was hardly any Body stirring abroad, and the Watchmen kept up close except just when they cried the Hour. At 2 o'Clock another Gentleman came and called the Watch to light his Candle, upon which I went farther Up-stairs, and soon after this I heard Mrs. Duncomb's Door open;

             went in, but I stayed upon the Stairs to watch. I had told them where Mrs. Duncomb's Box stood; they came out between 4 and 5, and one of them call'd to me softly, and said Hip! How shall I shut the Door? Says I, 'Tis a Spring-lock; pull it to, and it will be fast ; and so one of them did. They would have shared the Money and Goods upon the Stairs, but I told them we had better go down; so we went under the Arch by Fig-Tree Court, where there was a Lamp; I ask'd them how much they had got, they said they had found 50 Guineas, and some Silver in the Maid's Purse; above 100 l. in the Chest of Drawers, besides the Silver Tankard, and the Money in the Box, and several other Things; so that in all they had got to the Value of about 300 l. in Money and Goods. They told me they had been forced to gag the People; they gave me the Tankard with what was in it, and some Linen, for my Share, and they had a Silver Spoon and a Ring, and the rest of the Money among themselves. They advised me to be cunning, and plant the Money and Goods under Ground, and not be seen to be flush; then we appointed to meet at Greenwich, but I did not go.</p>
               <p>I was taken in the Manner as the Witnesses have sworn, and carried to the Watch-house, from whence I was sent to the Compter, and so to Newgate. I own that I said the Tankard was mine, and that it was left me by my Mother. Several Witnesses have swore what Account I gave of the Tankard being bloody; I had hurt my Finger, and that was the Occasion of it. I am sure of Death, and therefore have no Occasion to speak any thing but the Truth. When I was in the Compter I happened to see a young Man whom I knew with a Fetter on; I told him I was sorry to see him there, and I gave him a Farthing and a Shilling, and call'd for half a Quartern of Rum to make him drink. I afterwards went into my Room, and heard a Voice call me, and perceived something poking behind the Curtain, I was a little surprized, and looking to see what it was, I found a Hole in the Wall, thro' which the young Man I had given the Shilling to spoke to me, and ask'd me if I had sent for my Friends; I told him, No. He said he'd do what he could for me, and so he went away; and some time after he call'd to me again, and said Here's a Frien. I look'd thro', and saw Will. Gibbs come in; I think it was Will. Gibbs; says he, Who is there to swear against you? I told him my two Masters would be the chief Witnesses. And what can they charge you with? says he; I told him the Tankard was the only Thing, for there was nothing else that I thoughts could hurt me. Never fear then, says he, we'll<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173302210040"/> do well enough; we will get them that will rap the Tankard was your Grandmother's, and that you was in Shoreditch that Night the Fact was committed; and we'll have two Men that shall shoot your two Masters: But says he, one of the Witnesses is a Woman, and she won't swear under 4 Guineas, but the Men will swear for 2 Guineas a-piece; so he went away, and brought a Woman and 3 Men; I gave them 10 Guineas, and they promised to wait for me at the Bull-Head in Bread-street; but when I call'd for them, as I was going before Sir

            , they were not there. Then I found I should be sent to Newgate, and I was full of anxious Thoughts; but a young Man told me I had better go to the Whit [Newgate] than to the Compter.</p>
               <p>When I came to Newgate I had but 18 d. in Silver, besides the Money in my Hair, and that 18 d. I paid for my Garnish; I was ordered to a high Place in the Goal. Buck, as I said before, having seen my Hair loose told Johnson of it, and Johnson ask'd me if I had got any Cole planted there; he search'd and found the Bag, and there was in it 36 Moidores, 18 Guineas, 5 Crown Pieces, 2 half Crowns, 2 Broad Pieces of 25 s. four of 23 s. and one half Broad Piece. He told me I must be cunning, and not be seen to be flush of Money; I desir'd him to keep it for me till I got clear, and only let me have a little now and then as I wanted it; then says he, Do you know any body that will swear for you? No, says I, can you help me to any? I would not do such a thing for the World, says he, if I thought you guilty; so he took the Money and we parted, but in a little Time he called me down again, and said, What have you done with the Bag? I have it, says I, but what wou'd you advise me to do with it? Why, says he, you might have thrown it down the Necessary-House or have burnt it, but give it me and I'll take care. of it; and so I gave it to him. Mr. Alstone then brought me to the Condemn'd Hold and examin'd me; I denied all, till I found he had heard of the Money, and then I knew my Life was gone; and therefore, I confess'd all that I knew; I gave him the same Account of the Robbery as I have given now. I told him I had heard my Masters were to be shot, and I desired him to send them Word. I described Tracey and the 2 Alexanders, and when they were first taken they denied that they knew Mr. Oaks, whom they and I had agreed to rob.</p>
               <p>All that I have now declared is Fact, and I have no occasion to murder three innocent Persons by a false Accusation; for I know I am a condemn'd Woman, I know I must suffer an ignominious Death which my Crimes deserve, and I shall suffer willingly; I thank God that he has granted me Time to repent, when I might have been snatch'd off in the midst of my Crimes, and without having an Opportunity of preparing my self for another World.</p>
               <p>My Lord, as there was more Money found upon me than belong'd to Mrs. Duncomb, I hope your Lordship will be so good as to order what was my own to be return'd me.</p>
               <p>Court. The Court cannot determine whose Property the Money is, till the Jury have brought in their Verdict.</p>
               <p>The Jury withdrew for about a Quarter of an Hour to consider of their Verdict, and when they return'd the Prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173302210041"/> was again brought to the Bar; and they were call'd over by the Clerk of the Arraigns, and answer'd to their Names.</p>

When it grew late I began to be uneasy, because my Husband was out of Town. I look'd about, and mist a Salt and four Spoons. On Tuesday Morning following, the Prisoner sent Word to his Sister to come to him at an Alehouse in Chick-Lane, so he was taken and brought to me. He seem'd very much troubled, and lamented sadly; Madam, says he, that Night you sent me out, as I went by St. Sepulcher's Church-wall, I met with a Woman that has been my Ruin: She said, my Lad, will you give me a Quartern of Gin? I told her I had no Money. No! says she, you don't look like one that wanted Money; where do ye live? I told her with Mr. Harris in Warwick-lane, Can't you rob the House? says she; sure you may steal something or other, and let it be what it will, the People of the House where I live will receive it of ye. Then, Madam, this Creature came with me to your Door, and would fain have had me let her in, but I was afraid to do that, and so she waited for me in the Alley. I took an Opportunity of slipping the four Spoons and Salt into my Pocket, and when you sent me out again, I went with this Woman to her Lodgings at William Grone's in Bishop's-Court in the Little Old-Baily. There I treated her with two Quarterns of Cherry Brandy, and then the Woman of the House (Crone's Wife) said, if I intended to lye there all Night, one of her Girls must lye out of her Bed, and therefore I must give her Half a Crown to get her another Lodging. I gave one of the Spoons to the Woman that pick'd me up, and when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173302210042"/> Crone came home next Morning, they wanted their Reckoning, and Crone said he would dispose of the Plate for me, but I must give him a Crown for his Day's Work: So he and his Wife went out and pawn'd the Spoons for 35 s. but Crone kept the Salt himself, and he gave me but 9 s. out of the 35, and let me stay in the House till I had spent 8, and then they turn'd me out of Doors.</p>
               <p>Court. What Tredwell confess'd may affect himself, but is no Evidence against Crone. Did you hear Crone confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Harris. Yes; he said when he came home on Sunday Night his Wife told him, that Madam had got a Spoon of the Gentleman's, and would not give it him; upon which, says Crone, I said to Madam, Damn ye, no Gentleman shall be affronted in my House, and my Wife shall have the Spoon. I told Crone, he must needs think the Spoons were stolen. I vow to God, Madam, says he, I thought the Fellow look'd like an honest Fellow. I own my Wife keeps an ill House, but I can't help it, she'll cut my Throat if I don't submit to her, for she is worth Money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lambkin. Crone and his Wife came together to my House, and pawn'd the Spoons for 35 s. she told me while I stood by, that they were her t'other Husband's Spoons.</p>
               <p>Constable. Crone own'd to me that he pawn'd the Spoons at Lambkin's.</p>
               <p>Crone. I own that I had the Salt and pawn'd the Spoons, and Tredwell gave 'em me to pawn to discharge his Reckoning, for he had run up 26 s. that Night and the next Morning.</p>
               <p>Tredwell. I own I took the Things, but I was enticed to it by the Woman that lodges at Crone's. I never was guilty of any such Fact before I gave Crone the Spoons and Salt to pawn, and he pretended to me that he pawn'd 'em all for 35 s. but he afterwards confess'd that he pawn'd only the Spoons for so much, and kept the Salt himself.</p>
               <p>Two or three Witnesses appear'd to Crone's Character. They swore he was a very honest Man and kept a Bawdy House, and they never heard any thing amiss of him.</p>

               <p>Being a speedy and safe Cure, as well as an infallible Prevention, for a GONORRHOEA or CLAPP.</p>
               <p>IT's well known, that the old Way of curing CLAPPS or GONORRHOEA's by the tedious and uncertain Use of Purging Medicines and Balsamicks, is, at this time, by the most skillful and disinterested Practitioners, held in the Contempt it deserves; it serving no other purpose than to prolong the Cure, and increase the Doctor's Demand; frequently entailing n obstinate GLEET on the Patient, and too often a Pox.</p>
               <p>Anatomical Examinations of the Parts first effected, have made it plain, beyond all Contradiction, that this Disease is a local one, that is to say, is confined to the Parts affected only, without entering into, or mixing with the blood : Which Parts are the small Glands called Lacune. These Glands have been accurately described by our eminent Country-Man Mr. 
               <persName id="a17330221-1-person603">

            , and since him y the celebrated Dr. MORGAGNI Professor ow at PADUA. In consequence of which is most certain, that the proper Way of treating this Disease, is to apply directly to the arts affected, a Medicine capable of altering the Nature of the poisonous Venom with which they are enflamed and ulcerated, and also to cleanse and heal up the Ulcer; which Medicine must have nothing of an astringent Quality.</p>
               <p>Purging Medicines taken by the Mouth, will, if duly examined into, be found to have no other Pretence to the Service they are fancy'd to do in this Case, than acting directly as detergent Medicines, on the Parts affected, after they have circulated through the whole Mass of Blood. For consider them merely as Purgers, they serve only to weaken the Parts, and bring on obstinate GLEETS. This every-day's Practice notoriously confirms. Yet has it, till lately, been thought necessary to plague the Patient with them three Weeks together, to make room for nauseating Balsamicks, such as Turpentine, Capivi, &amp;c. which cannot be ventur'd upon before Purging, because they are apt to stop the Running, and send it into the Blood before the Venereal Polson is destroy'd; whence a Pox certainly ensues.</p>
               <p>A due Consideration of all these Things has put several eminent Physicians and Surgeons upon rejecting the old, tedious, and uncertain Method of Cure by Purging, and introducing a new, speedy, and infallible one by INJECTION; that is to say, by siringing a certain Liquor into the Privities, thereby cleansing the diseased Parts from their Venom, and healing their Ulcerations, without the Fatigue of Purging, or the Nauseousness of Ballamick Medicines: and this in a quarter of the Time, and with a thousand times the Safety of the old Method. The great Numbers which Dr. COCKBURN and others have so cured in LONDON are sufficient Testimonies of it.</p>
               <p>But if we consider ITALY, and especially the Republick of VENICE, where the Venereal Disease occurs more frequently than in any other Parts of Europe: We shall find that there, since the Discoveries of the afore-mentioned Dr. MORGAGNI, they have totally laid aside all other Methods of Cure, and adhered to THIS of INJECTION alone; which they have found to succeed in so happy a Manner, as never once to fail: So that a CLAPP is now regarded there as a mere Trifle, which before seldom went off without a Pox.</p>
               <p>Not to enlarge any further at present upon the Excellency of this Method, it may now be proper to inform the PUBLICK, that a very eminent Italian Physician has transmitted to his Correspondent in LONDON a considerable Quantity of the Liquor known by the Name of the VENETIAN INJECTION, which in a few Days infallibly cures any CLAPP, if used in the following Manner ;</p>
               <p>The Patient, if a Man, is with a Syringe (which will be deliver'd with the Bottle of Liquor if required) to inject about an Ounce of the Liquor twice a Day into his Yard, and keep it there about a Minute. If the Liquor be a little warmed it will be the better This he will perceive the Heat of Urine to abate, the Running to grow white, and afterwards thick and ropey, and in five or six Days time to be quite gone, the Cure being compleated with the utmost Safety. For Women, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173302210046"/> may be supply'd with a proper Syringe by any Mid wife or Pewterer, and they are to observe the same Method.</p>
               <p>N. B. This INJECTION will certainly prevent a CLAPP, as it has done Thousands of Times, if it be used as before, twice or thrice within a Day after impure Coition.</p>
               <p>It requires not the least Consinement, nor any particular Diet, nor a total Abstinence from Wine, or other strong Liquors: Though a moderate Use of such Things suits with it best.</p>
               <p>It is sold, seal'd up with the Author's Arms, in square Venetian Bottles, at half a Guinea each, with large Directions, (one Bottle being sufficient for a Care) only at the following Places, viz.
