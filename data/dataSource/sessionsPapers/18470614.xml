                  </hi>. I am single. I recollect losing some money on the 31st of Aug. last—I charged Philip Magnus with stealing it—on the 1st of Sept. I went before a Magistrate at Guildhall, gave evidence against him, and he was committed for trial—I was bound over to attend and give evidence on the 21st of Sept.—I was in Guildhall-yard before the examination took place, and Hannah Decastro made an offer to me—Maria Allen; was with me—I and Allen went to the house of Sampson Israel—I cannot say whether it was the 9th of Sept.—his house is No. 7, Constitution-row, Gray's Inn-road—I went by Phœbe Israel's solicitation, and phœbe and Sampson Israel were there—we took tea there—Sampson Israel offered me a sovereign—he said if I liked to take it, I was quite welcome, as I must want money, being ill and out of place—he assured me he was a respectable man, that he knew the bail I was under was of no consequence whatever, but if I liked to take a sovereign, I was welcome—I was under bail to appear at the Old Bailey—he said several times, with respect to Philip Magnus, he did not care a rush for him, it was for the sake of his wife and family—nothing else was offered to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the 14th, did you again go to Sampson Israel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was to have gone on the 14th, but was so poorly, I could not, and Maria Allen went—Phœbe Israel came back with her, and she was rather saucy to me for not going—she came to my house, No. 10, Milman-street—on the 15th, I and Allen went to the Grotto Tavern, Southampton-buildings, Holborn—we met Elizabeth Magnus at Mr. Israel's shop, in Chancery-lane—we stopped some time at the Grotto, and Mr. Israel brought her sister, Elizabeth Magnus, to the Grotto, and all four took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and went to the pier at Blackfriars'-bridge, and went to Woolwich, we left our boxes at the waiting-room at the pier, and took apartments at Mr. Dawson's, No. 2, Bath-place, Wellington-street, Woolwich—Mr. Israel took them—Elizabeth Magnus, I, and Allen, re<lb/>mained at the lodgings—Mr. Israel returned that night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you go to Woolwich? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because Mr. Israel told me, and they all told me it was of no consequence—they all told me so repeatedly, but I would not believe anybody till I went to Mr. Wooller, the lawyer, and he told me to go down to Woolwich—he said it was of no consequence if it was left in his hands, and Mr. Lazarus (who is not in custody) said it should be left in his hands—we remained at Woolwich from the 15th till the Friday week, the 25th, when the Sessions were over—Elizabeth Magnus remained with us all that time—on the 24th, Sampson Israel and James Magnus came down to Woolwich—Elizabeth Magnus was present—they sent Allen out of the room—she went to get the tea.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything said about the trial on the Friday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were talking among themselves a good deal—I did not hear Sampson Israel, James Magnus, or Elizabeth Magnus, say anything about the trial—when we came to London, we parted—I have not seen any of them since, only Mr. Israel—my boxes were left at Mr. Israel's house, in Chancery-lane—he has a shop there as well as in Constitution-row—on the 8th of Oct. I will ill, and taken to the hospital, I remained there for four months—I came out in June, and have been very ill since—none of the defendants were with Mr. Israel when I spoke to her—I was boarded and lodged at Woolwich ten days—I paid nothing—Mr. Israel, I believe, paid, but Elizabeth Magnus gave the money to Allen, who fetched in everything that was wanted—I saw the money given several times—Eliza<lb/>beth Magnus did not use many things the same as us, because they are Jews.</p>

               <p>to keep out of the way—the prisoners would not have prevailed upon me to have kept out of the way if Wooller had not advised it—it was quite decided at my lodgings, the day before, that it should come to a trial—Mr. Israel said, if it was to come to a trial it was quite time they should be prepared for it—Mr. Lazarus proposed going to Wooller—he said he had seen his name in the paper as being very clever on this point—I did not see anything of James Magnus till the 24th of Sept.—he said he was ready to make it up, whatever sum I liked to have, provided I would say nothing to any body about having received the money—I said, I was not in want of money, but if I received it I would receive it in the presence of witnesses—I was not left alone with him at any time—he returned home in the course of an hour—I was not left alone with him on the Friday, when they came to fetch us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am not in business—I now live at No. 55, Burton-street, Burton-crescent. On the 22nd of Jan., 1846, I was passing from my residence into the city—I met a man in Little Britain, who accosted me—I had never seen him before nor since, to my knowledge—he said, "Sir, I should be very much obliged to you if you would render me a little assist<lb/>ance"—I said, "I know nothing of you, and I don't know that you know me"—he induced me to stop, and he told me he had purchased a horse of a man standing on the other side—he induced me to pass from where I was to the place where the prisoner was holding a horse—as soon as I got there the other man said, "This is the man of whom I agreed to purchase this horse, he agreed to let me have it for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I knew a person who wanted a horse; I went to see if I could get him for a purchaser; I returned to this man, and now he refuses to let me have it, saying, 'It is worth 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.' "—I said to the</p>

               <p>prisoner, "How is it you don't let him have the horse? it appears to be a fair agreement; he says he has found a purchaser who will take it of him"—the prisoner said, "The horse is worth more, I can't let him have it under 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "This is hardly fair, that you should want to raise him after the agreement," and I was about taking leave of the party and walking off, when the other man said, "Do pray stop, and I will remunerate you for your trouble," and he offered to give me a sovereign—I said, "I have nothing to do with such matters"—I was leaving them, and the prisoner said, "He shall have it for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there he stuck for some time—I was about going away again, and the prisoner said, "He shall have it for the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I then was about leaving, and the other man said, "For God's sake don't leave me, he will be off from his bargain; do see the money paid"—we went into the back par<lb/>lour of a public-house, and there the other man pulled out of his pocket what appeared to be a double handful of sovereigns—I supposed there was more than sufficient to pay for the horse twice over—I supposed there was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he began to count them, and counted about seventeen or eighteen, when the prisoner broke out short and said, "No, he shan't have it, he shan't have it"—I said, "That is very singular," and I was about leav<lb/>ing the room, when the prisoner said to me, "I will sell you the horse"—I felt indignant, and said, "I don't want the horse—I have no place for the horse"—the prisoner said, "Indeed, to tell you the truth, this horse is not mine, it belongs to my uncle, a clergyman, living at Barnet, and my uncle and this man have had some falling out, and he would be very angry if he knew I had any dealings with him"—the other man said to me, "If you will advance the money"—I will pay you; there can be no doubt about it; there is the money"—I thought there could be little risk about it, but I said I had not the money about me—he said, "You can obtain the money"—I said, "I have more than the money at home, but I am a considerable distance from home"—he said, "We will take a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and go and get it; you can run no risk, I will pay you"—he put the sovereigns into his pocket, and we took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and all three went to my residence, which was then at No. 14, King's-row—we went into my drawing-room, and I was about paying them the money—I left the drawing-room, and brought a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I laid them on the table, and the other man said, "Don't pay the money now, let us return back to Little Britain, to see if the horse is safe there"—I thought that was a very good suggestion, as there were fifty or sixty persons about there—I took up my notes and we all went back in the same <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—when we got back to Little Britain, we went into another public-house, not the one we had been in before—we went into a back parlour, and there I gave the prisoner the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—he gathered them up, and kept possession of them—the other man gave me a sovereign—the pri<lb/>soner said to me, "If you will follow me, I will give you the horse"—I said to the other man, "If you will follow me, we will see that the thing is complete"—we went though the passage which led into the street—the pri<lb/>soner went first, I followed, and the other man, I supposed had followed me, but he had fled, I saw no more of him—the prisoner said, "I deliver the horse into your hand," and the halter was put into my hand—I looked round, supposing the other man was at my side, but could see nothing of him—I then found I had been swindled—the prisoner went away, or ran away, and I was surrounded by persons who said they were City officers—I was obliged to go away with the horse—I afterwards sold it for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Joseph Dawson was a boatman, and frequented my house—the prisoner is captain of a monkey-boat—Dawson belonged to the same boat—on the 12th of May they were at my house from one o'clock in the day, till evening, drinking together—Dawson got intoxicated, but not the prisoner, that I could perceive—I heard them quarrelling about eight o'clock—I went into the tap-room, and saw Dawson pull his jacket off to fight the prisoner—I told the prisoner if he would not take any notice of him I would get him to the boat—the prisoner agreed, and I did so—I persuaded Dawson to go, and he went very quietly towards the canal—I did not go with him—I saw him go out of the house, and as much as twenty yards form the house, towards the canal—the prisoner remained in the house perhaps half-an-hour—he then left, and I did not see any more off him till I heard there had been a fight—I went towards the Grand Junction Canal, where the boat was, about 300 yards from my house, and saw a policeman and others getting the deceased on the boat into the cabin—they had hold of his arms, holding him up—he was walking—when I first saw him he was just on the plank leading to the boat—I saw the prisoner not far off—I do not know whether he was in that boat or not, as there were three or four boats abreast—the deceased said to the prisoner, "I did not think you would have served me so"—I did not hear him make any reply—they took Dawson into the cabin—I saw no more of him till next morning—I saw the prisoner in an hour and a half, or so, that</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon.

               <p>doubt the death was cause by the inflammation of the covering of the intes<lb/>tines—the rupture of the intestines would be caused by considerable violence, not by inflammation—the violence must have been applied to the belly, or in that neighbourhood—that might happen without any external mark—I am confident it was not caused by disease, but was the result of external violence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Harefield. On the 3rd of June I was called to the police-station, to examine the body of the child—it was a male child, full grown—it was born at maturity—it was in a state of decomposition—I examined it carefully—I could not find any mark of external violence—on opening the chest, I found the cavity well filled by its organs—I examined the lungs, and found them healthy—they were not decomposed—they were florid, and fully inflated, even to their margins—on supplying the hydrostatic test, I found they were buoyant in clear rain-water, with the heart and gland attached—I examined the head, and found no frac<lb/>ture or contusion—the vessels of the scalp and pericranium were extremely congested—the brain had become fluid by decomposition, but the vessels were very much congested—the vascular membrane of the brain still remained very much congested—the umbilical cord was cast round the neck, and crossed over the breast—it was untied, and ruptured at the distance of eighteen inches—it was simply cast round the neck—it did not form a circumvolution of the neck, it simply passed round—from my experience, I judge, that the child was born alive—I am unable to state the cause of death, because the appearances in the head might have resulted, after death, from gravitation, and there was no other morbid appearance—the appearances about the lunge might be accounted for by the child breathing before it was entirely born, but not so fully, I think, as I found them—the lungs were more developed than are ever found in partial birth—the development of the lungs was sufficient to conceal the greater portion of the pericardium—I cannot say what was the cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The conclusion you arrive at is, that it was born alive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that opinion rests on the development of the lungs, and their complete inflation—the congestion of the head proves nothing—there was nothing about the position of the umbilical cord to lead me to suppose it had been strangled by that—it is possible that the child might be strangled with it during birth, and the cord afterwards separate or burst—it is not uncommon for a child to be strangled by the umbilical cord getting entangled round its throat while it is being born, and that would be much more likely in a delivery without assistance—the child would respire when partially born, and that respiration produces the inflation of the lungs—the longer it was being born, the more the lungs would become inflated—according to my conviction, it is impossible they could be inflated to the extent they were, during the time the child was being born—I cannot swear to that as a matter of medical science—I think the child might have been dead five weeks when I saw it—decomposition frequently produces inflation of the lungs—they do not show putrefaction so early as other parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there not cases in which you judge of their putrefaction because you find other parts of the body putrefied? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the lungs would float in water, if slightly putrefied—putrefaction would inflate them, and cause them to occupy more room in the chest, but not so as to conceal the pericardium; but I can swear no part of the appearance of the lungs resulted from putre<lb/>faction; it could not, because the lungs presented a perfectly healthy appear<lb/>ance, and none of the appearances of putrefaction—I judge, by the appear<lb/>ance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140032"/>
               <p>of lungs, whether they are putrefied or not—if they were putrefied they would present that appearance—it is difficult to ascertain whether the lungs are inflated by putrefaction or respiration—floating them in water is not of itself a sufficient test—I can swear that these lungs did not present any ap<lb/>pearance of putrefaction—(I speak of their external appearance)—it would be quite impossible for them to be in any degree putrefied without my seeing it—I subdivided the lungs, and caused each portion to float, and those portions would have presented different appearances if one was putrefied—supposing them to be partially putrefied, it would be extremely difficult to detect whether the result was from that partial putrefaction or from respiration—if inflated from partial putrefaction, they would not float after being subject to pressure, which these did—they were not decomposed in the slightest degree; that is extraordinary, and I can only account for it by the body being perfectly pre<lb/>served from the atmosphere—we cannot at all times distinguish whether lungs are inflated from putrefaction or respiration—it is not the opinion of all the profession that the hydrostatic test will alone detect it—it is stated by some authors to be deceptive, and by some not so—it is not considered certain as a matter of science—I consider it is so—it is a matter of certainty, that lungs presenting these appearances had respired—I do not know of any exception to that opinion by authors of the present day—I have read Mr. Tayler's book—he does not state the hydrostatic test to be infallible, nor do I; but, from all the tests, I can swear respiration alone produced the appearances I saw—there are methods of telling whether it is from decomposition or not—I cannot be deceived, there being no decomposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It could not be from decomposition, unless decomposition existed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I am satisfied there was no decomposition of the lungs—if the child was strangled during birth by the umbilical cord, it would have left a mark till decomposition obliterated it—I could not see a mark on the throat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Dorset-place. I was called on the 7th of May, and found the deceased on a truss of straw in the stable, in a state of collapse, suffering from symptoms of concussion of the brain—there were some slight superficial cuts on her right wrist, and an appearance of having recently received a black eye—it was very pale, afterwards became purple, and at last a confirmed black eye—there was an abrasion of the skin—she had a wound at the back of her head, behind her right ear—there was dilation of the right pupil, and a contraction of the left pupil—I and Mr. Oakley, a medical friend, adopted the usual remedies, and she subsequently rallied—we afterwards took her up stairs to bed, and in the evening, when some reaction had taken place, we applied leeches, and other remedies—Mr. Fergusson, of King's College Hospital, saw her next day with me, and at once pronounced it a hopeless case; but we continued to attend her till Mon<lb/>day night, when she died—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination next day—the back of the shoulders were much bruised, and blackened, as from a fall, also the back of her right arm—on removing the scalp, there was extensive extravasation between the scalp and skull—no depression of born but a ra<lb/>diating fracture in the centre, corresponding with a cut outside the head—on removing the skull, we discovered a fracture extending to the inner table of the skull, and very extensive extravasation of blood on the brain, which arose from a rupture of one of the sinuses of the dura mater—there was some little softening on the right hemisphere of the brain, which if she had lived longer would have terminated in suppuration—we examined the spine, and the other viscera, they were all perfectly healthy—the cause of death was the rupture of the central sinus of the brain, and the extravasation of blood on the brain—the rupture was occasioned by a fall, most likely from the injury at the back of the head—it appeared as if she had struck on some hard point—a man's foot would certainly not have done it—a stick or poker might—we examined the door, but could see no mark of her falling</p>

               <p>on the fastening of the door—the door opens towards the bottom of the stairs, and there is a very awkward fastening protruding from the door-post—it is possible she might have fallen on that—the floor she fell on was brick—she might have fallen on the rough edge of a brick—a fall on any unequal hard substance might have done it—the floor was unequal—if she fell down stairs, and struck against something that might have caused all the injuries—the black eye must have been very recently received—it could not have been from any very hard substance, if so it must have been a par<lb/>ticularly flat surface which struck it—there was no abrasion of the skin at all—the black eye might have been occasioned by a fall—she might have turned round in some sort of way, but I hardly think it could—it is entirely a mat<lb/>ter of opinion—it was as if from a blow from a fist—I should think I got there about five minutes after the fall—the prisoner was there when I arrived—I think he was rather under the influence of liquor—I required brandy—he went for it immediately, and held her up while I tried to get it down her throat—the only conversation I had with him was when I turned her head round to ascertain the nature of the injury—he requested me not to hurt her—he did not say how it happened—the injuries were at the back of the head—it is possible she might have turned while falling, but it is a very narrow staircase—if she had fallen forwards I do not think the injuries would be received at the back of the head—she must have fallen backwards, or else the injury must have been inflicted by somebody behind—when he said, "Don't hurt her," I said, "You are very tender now, you should have thought of that before"—he replied that he was as tender as I was—he said, "It served her right"—I said nothing to that—he continued with me, and paid her a great deal of attention, and exhibited a good deal of anxiety.</p>

I knew the prisoner and his wife—I know the loft, and the room belonging to the premises, and the staircase leading to the loft—on Friday, 7th May, about one o'clock, I was passing the doorway, the door was open—I heard a noise, turned round, and saw the deceased—she fell down the moment I was passing the door—I did not see her on the stairs, she was on the ground—I attempted to pick her up, but left her and went for a doctor—when I first saw her she was lying on her back—I saw nobody else in the stable, or on the stairs—I saw the prisoner and his daughter on the top of the stairs—he was in the loft when I first saw him—I saw him at the very moment I tired to pick her up—he did not come down—he stood at the top of the stairs, and never offered to come down—I did not call to him—nobody came down—I left her with a person named Weedon—directly I raised her up, her mouth was open, and I thought she was dying and went directly for a doctor—I did not hear her scream—I am quite sure the prisoner was at the top of the stairs—no one came down—I came back with a doctor, the prisoner was then at the head of his wife—she was lying on some straw in the stable—when I attempted to pick her up she was on her back, her feet were on the second step from the bottom, and her head was on the ground on the stone—the door was quite back against the wall—it opens to the right—it was quite open—I saw Maria Marlin at the top of the stairs, close to the parlour.</p>

On the 24th of June, about three o'clock, I was in St. Paul's Churchyard, with my niece and daughter—I stopped to look into a shop window—I had a purse in my pocket, containing two sovereigns, one half-sovereign, nineteen shillings, a fourpenny piece, and a half-crown—I was pointing to an article, and felt the weight of the purse go—I took my dress, found the purse was gone, turned, and saw the two prisoners together, twenty or thirty yards from me, passing the Chapter-house—one's hand was in the hand of the other—that induced me to run after them—I ran, and before I overtook them they set off running, the moment they were satisfied that there was something in the purse—they ran together, and turned into a court which leads into Paternoster-row—they then divided—this is my purse—it has more money in it now than I lost.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Mitchell's Defence.</hi> In the beginning of December I was recommended to Mr. Sabine, who kept the coffee-house; I was with her the whole winter; I was servant there to do the work of the coffee-room, to keep the shop clean and clean knives; at the latter end of March, Walters, whose name I under<lb/>tood was Alfred Jones, came and lodge there; a little time after he came, my mistress said to me, "George, I want you to go and pawn some things," that was the first time I went to Mr. Clark's, the pawnbroker's; after that she sometimes sent me, and sometimes the bar-maid sent me, which Walters knows; that was the occasion of my pawning the things. On the 4th of May I was down in the kitchen; I was called by the barmaid to go and take these things to Mr. Duro, No. 22, Stonecutter-street; I went the nearest way; I found my mistress there, she said, "What have you got some China, George?" I said, "Yes," I have; Mary Ann told me to get down as soon as I could, because your daughter wants to go to bed; she said, "I am going home I will walk with you;" we did, and she said, "Hold this while I get my handkerchief out;" she gave me the saucer, and the officer came and took me to the station, and they found this duplicate on me, which I got</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140045"/>
               <p>when Mary Ann one afternoon was going out, she gave me a sugar basin and asked me to pawn it for a shilling at Mr. Clark's; I did so, came back, and she said, "Never mind the duplicate, let it be;" and that is how I came to have it. I pawned these things by the order of my mistress or the bar<lb/>maid; I gave them all the money and duplicates. After I had been a great many times, I said to my mistress, "How is it, that this lad (meanings Walters) gets so much property;" I understood it was from his executor or trustee, he had these goods instead of money coming to him, and he will state the same because I asked him about the things; I took the things directly to the pawnbroker's from the house; what I have done was entirely through my mistress's order; I have had a good character; Alderman Challis knows I have lived in respectable situations. I had not any knowledge of how Walters got these goods; it is a most cruel thing for me, as a servant, to be answerable for the iniquity of a mistress or master; I have concealed nothing, I have stated everything straightforward.</p>

I live at No. 18, Raymond-place, St. George's in the East—the prisoner and his wife lived in the upper room of the same house—I have lived there four years—they had not been there quite twelve months. On a Saturday, a short time since I was in my room, and saw the prisoner and deceased in the street, out of my window—I heard him ask her to go and have some gin—they went out my sight to a public-house—I did not see anything more of them till about five o'clock, when I went up stairs to my own room, which is under theirs—I then saw the deceased on the top of the stairs—she called me faintly, by the name of Mr. Gray—I went to her as I was going into my room, which is on the first floor—she was sitting on the stairs, which are very dark—I could not see anything the matter with her till I brought her down, and took her into my land<lb/>lady's front room on the ground floor—her under garments were very wet with blood—there was much blood—she seemed to be swollen in the face—she could not sit or stand; but when she was tipsy,(which</p>

               <p>was her habit.) she could not stand or sit—I cannot say whether she was sober or not at this time, for I had not seen her from half-past two till five—I considered at the time that she was tipsy, and told her so—I saw no other signs of her being hurt—the landlady fetched a police<lb/>man and she was taken to the London Hospital—her clothes were bloody—she had a chemise on, and the top of her gown, but she was not in the habit of wearing many clothes, because she used to take them off and pawn them—I have seen her in that state before—I also saw blood on the side of her head, and her nose was bleeding—I removed part of her dress, but observed no marks or hurts, or other appearances—she had been away ten days and nights before this—the prisoner had been at home—her child, who is eight years old, was very bad with a fever at the time—I saw no more of her till she was dead—I considered the prisoner was very kind to her while she kept sober, but it was very seldom she was sober—he was very kind to her, but she had a very bad tongue, and used very bad words to him—I only observed blood on her nose until after I saw her dead at the hospital—I saw a cut on the right side of the head.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Raymond-place, St. George's in the East. The prisoner and his wife lodged in the attic at my house, about twelve months—on Saturday, the day of her death, about half-past two o'clock, she was in my room—the prisoner put his head into my room, saw his wife, and said, "There you are, mother"—she said, "Yes"—he said, "Will you come up stairs, I will forgive you for all you have done," but he said, "Where are my shoe-brushes?" and she said, "I have sold them;" he said, "That is just as you do everything, but never mind mistress, I will forgive you for all"—she said, "<hi rend="italic">Mac</hi> you are drunk, I know what you are."—I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Mac</hi> if you touch your wife, if you beat her, I will come</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140048"/>
               <p>and tear you to pieces"—he said, "Mother I won't strike her, may God strike me dead if I touch her"—she said, "I won't come upstairs unless you give me a pint of beer"—he said, "I will give you a pint of beer, or half-a-pint of gin if you will come up stairs"—he said to me, "Mother, will you have any?"—I said, "No <hi rend="italic">Mac</hi>, don't bring any in here, for none shall come in here, if I want any I can treat myself"—they went out, and I saw no more of them till the afternoon at about a quarter to five o'clock, when Mr. Gray came to me, and about half-past five the deceased was brought down stairs into my room by Mr. Gray, in a very bad state—her clothes were all off her back, except her shift—she said she was very much hurt—she was all over blood, from the bottom of her shift up to her hips—I saw a discharge of blood from her per<lb/>son, and could not look any further—her face appeared very much larger than common, from being hurt—I did not notice any blood about it—I cannot say whether she was sober or not then—she had no help in her at all—I should say that arose from her being hurt, because when she was brought down stairs, she said, "Oh my belly, my belly, I am dying"—I saw a blow on the right side of her head, it was either a blow or kick—the scalp was quite naked—she was left lying on my floor till she was taken to the hospital—I did not see her again alive—I afterwards saw blood on the stairs, from the top to the bot<lb/>tom, and on the side of the wall—after she was taken away, I went into her room, and saw some blood on the floor by the bed side—there was a good deal, in one place in particular, where there was a hole in the floor—it was congealed blood—it was quite fresh—when sober, the prisoner and his wife lived very comfortably, but when drinking they were disorderly—whenever she could get drink she would have it—as soon as ever he brought his money home, she would have it, and spend it in drinking, first at one public-house, and then at another.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he appear fond of her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they seemed very fond of each other when sober, and he was fond of his child—when they were drunk they quarreled—the woman drunk very hard—that was the cause of it—when drunk they would quarrel, and fight—he would beat her, because she would make away with everything—she never beat him—she was very abusive with her tongue when drunk, but not at all when sober—when he came into the room at two o'clock, she said he was a whore-master—she appeared to be sober then—I never heard her call him names when sober.</p>

               <p>out, he was in the room with them—Mr. Gray went up—he was playing with her boy down stairs, in the mangling-room—he was very ill—there was no money to get medicine for him, and a gentleman used to call on me to give money for medicine.</p>

               <p>Agnes M' Donald, was brought there in a very faint, cold state—I examined her, and found the head, chest, and belly, very much bruised—the cartilage of the nose was separated—there was a wound on the right side of the head about an inch in length—it was not very severe—it was superficial—the third and fourth ribs on the left side were fractured, and the private parts very much bruised—there appeared to be a rupture of some of the viscera—as she was suffering great pain in the belly, and was in a state of collapse—there was a discharge of blood from the vagina, and she was bleeding from the head, from the cut on the right side, and from the nose—the cartilage of the nose might have been divided by a blunt instrument—the knuckles would do it—I at<lb/>tended her till she died, which was in fourteen hours—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, which I attended—I found the vessels of the brain very much congested, gorged with blood, the third and fourth ribs fractured, the intes<lb/>tines ruptured, and traces of seven inflammation of the membrane covering the intestines—the rupture of the intestines must have been caused by great violence—a kick or a jump on the belly, or a fall against the floor, or against a chair of table, might produce it—it was very extensive—a fall with great violence against the ground, a chair, or banister, would occasion it—the wound on the head was not severe—there were many bruises on the head—it would be impossible they could have been caused by a fall—there were several bruises on the belly and chest—it was not one continued bruise, but several—one blow arising from a fall could not occasion those several bruises—I ascribe her death to the rupture of the intestines—her hands and arms were very much bruised—some of the bruises were recent, and some of long standing—the bruises in the private parts would very likely be the result of a kick—that would produce them; or if she had fallen across a table, or chair. or bannister, or any hard substance, it might do it, but she must fall across it to do it—I do not think a person merely falling with violence would receive such an injury—the rupture of the ribs and the congestion of the brain were very severe—they contributed very much to her death, I imagine—from the time she came in she was too weak a great deal to be capable of being examined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say the fracture of the ribs might have short<lb/>ened her life if there had not been rupture of the intestines, but you attribute her death to the rupture of the intestines? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> yes—some of bruises were recent, and some of them of five or six days' standing—those in the head were very severe—the temporal muscle on the right side of the head was com<lb/>plete pulp—the fractures of the ribs were recent, decidedly—I am quite posi<lb/>tive the inflammation of the membrane covering the intestines was very recent—the intestines are not easily ruptured, it must be done by direct violence—if they were ruptured by disease there would be traces of disease—the intes<lb/>tines would not be more liable to rupture whether a person was drunk or sober, there would be no difference—a fall might have produced many of the bruises—a single fall could not produce them—a drunken person falling from side to side against different objects might produce many of them—it is not at all likely that the edge of a stair would occasion the rupture, but I have not seen the stairs—the edge of a bedstead might produce a bruise on the private parts if she fell across it, but it is not to that bruise that I attribute the rupture of the intestines, but to the bruise immediately over the rupture—that might be produced by falling against the edge of a stair, or a table, chair, or bedstead, or by direct violence of any kind—it was a bruise of some extent—a fall, repeated once or twice, might produce bruises of similar extent.</p>

               <p>the bruises on the head, separation of the nose, rupture of the intestines, and the appearances on the chest, belly, and private parts, according to your judg<lb/>ement, could all those bruises have occurred from a fall or succession of falls? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it possible—I ascribe death decidedly to the rupture of the intestines—the injuries, independent of that, were not likely to cause death—those bruises causing the rupture of the intestines might arise from a fall or a succession of falls—they must have been falls of great violence—if a person staggering when drunk fell against the corner of any hard substance with suffi<lb/>cient violence, it might produce the appearances I saw, but not without—it would be impossible, unless they fell against some hard substance—if she was intoxicated she would fall very heavily, and then if she fell against any hard substance, the violence might be sufficient to produce it.</p>

Oh, my stomach!" the whole night—I did not hear her say anything else, that I can call to mind now—she was using just the same sort of language all night, groaning and making complaints about her being in such pain—I heard her say several times in the night, "Oh, you have murdered me, Harry!

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Ratcliffe. On the 17th of May I was called to attend the deceased—I found her in bed, labouring under a great deal of inflammation of the peritoneum—I attended her till her death—she apparently improved for about a week—when I first examined her there was a sight yellowness about the pit of the stomach, but I was very doubtful whether that was the result of an injury or not—after the end of the week she became much worse, the pains returned with a great deal more violence than at first, the bowels appeared to swell very much—that indi<lb/>cated effusion in the cavity of the abdomen—those symptoms increased till she died, which was last Sunday week, early in the morning—it did not appear to me that she was labouring under any other complaint than that which she communicated to me—after her death I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exa<lb/>mination—I examined the gall-bladder, and found it ruptured—that was the primary cause of death—that would cause inflammation of the peritoneum, which was the immediate cause of death, and would be followed first by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140055"/>
               <p>severe pain, and then by effusion—a violent blow would be very likely to cause a rupture of the gall-bladder, or any other violence externally applied—the rupture was about half an inch in extent—I did not detect that injury till after death—that would be quite impossible—the symptoms would show inflammation and violence, but the nature of it could not be detected till after death—I examined the viscera generally, and found them all healthy, with the exception of the liver—I found no injury about the liver that would account for death—the tinge of yellow on the stomach was very nearly over the gall-bladder—I examined the head—there was nothing about it to indi<lb/>cate any cause of mortality—the rupture of the gall-bladder was quite suf<lb/>ficient to account for the death.</p>

I was at the spice warehouse, which is opposite the wool ware-house, perhaps about sixty feet from it—I remember the lunch bell ringing at twenty minutes past twelve o'clock—I saw one of Kenworthy's wagons at the loop-hole at the wool warehouse—it was loaded, and the wool tied in—it was under the loop-hole—it was level with the loop-hole—the prisoner was standing on one of the bales of wool, which was level with the loop-hole—I saw Pottle go on the wagon, and take off a woollen cloth that covers the wagon—it was folded up at the top of the wagon—he took it into the loop-hole, and laid it down—the prisoner was standing there, and they had a little conversation together, and I saw a bit of a turning of the head by the prisoner towards the gate, and a bit of a beckoning of the finger with Pottle and the prisoner—that led me to watch them more particularly—it caused my sus<lb/>picion—I could not see the gate from where I was—the prisoner looked towards the gate—I then saw Pottle bring a bag and give it to the prisoner on the wagon—the prisoner laid it between two bags of wool—there was a bag of wool behind—he put it rather behind that, and between two bags—Pottle then brought out the covering of the wagon and gave it to the prisoner, who covered up the bag with it—I saw Joiner come and put his horses to the wagon I had seen loaded by the prisoner—the prisoner went away immedi<lb/>ately—I went to my foreman, and told him there was something wrong—this is the bag of coffee that I saw handed into the wagon—I am certain of it.</p>

The prisoner was in my service for six months—on the 26th of May, I was lying on a couch in my parlour adjoining the shop—I could see into the shop—I saw the prisoner go to the till, put his hand into the silver bowl, and take something out—I went into the shop, took him, and found a shilling in his pocket—he begged my pardon—I called in a policeman, and gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>upright young man—he has been in service—I have seen him in livery—I do not know where he lived—Ward asked me to lend the money—she said she was going to leave her place—I lent the money on the prisoner's word—he fetched the things away, and paid the money to my husband—if it had been 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I have been living servant with Madame D'Hombres for the last nine months—I was left in the house—Ward staid in the house about a fortnight—the prisoner was in the habit of coming there—I know nothing about the room where these things were—I never saw the room since the 31st of Oct., when I showed it the man to have the window mended—it was then empty—the things had been moved out the day before by Miss Hawkins.</p>

Carmody was brought there—he had two scalp-wounds, a severe contusion on the left ear, and several bruises and contusion on the left arm—one wound was on the forehead, the other on the left side of the parietal bone—there was a good deal of bleeding from each—the skin was cut in both places—such wounds might be inflicted by a quart-pot—he remained in the hospital till the 26th, and remained under my care for the subsequent fortnight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. On the 23rd of May, about half-past eleven in the morning, the deceased was brought there, suffering a great deal of pain—he appeared very faint, and complained of pain in the stomach—he died on the Tuesday evening,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140079"/>
               <p>about seven o'clock—the day before he died he asked me what I thought of him—I told him I thought him excessively ill, and I was afraid he would not get better—he had a clergyman with him—I should say that he thought he was dying—I saw him the following morning, about half-past six o'clock, and gave him some brandy-and-water—he said it made no difference what he took, he was sure he was a dead man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What condition do you consider him to have been in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the greatest danger—I told him I considered him in great danger—I did not think he would live as long as he did—he was at the hospital, in bed—he died a quarter or half-an-hour after he had the brandy-and-water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PLATT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was is he said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His expression was, "he has killed me, he acted unfairly, he pushed me down stairs, and afterwards came and knelt upon me"—he died half-an-hour after that—he said nothing about drunkenness—I examined his body, and found the bladder ruptured at the upper part to a very large extent, and the contents of it extravastated into the abdomen—that caused inflammation of the peritorium, and that, together with the shock the system sustained, was the cause of his death—the other parts were perfectly healthy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean death was caused by the general effect this had produced on his constitution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he never rallied from the time the injuries were inflicted—the inflammation had not arrived at a sufficient stage—the rupture of the bladder would necessarily have produced death—there are only one or two instances on record, I believe, where the case has been otherwise—the rupture of the bladder might have been caused by failing down stairs with the bladder in a distended state, or more likely by being knelt upon, or by pressure of any kind—I could not form an opinion one way more than the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker in the employ of Mr. Payne, in Hack<lb/>ney-road. I sell bread at No. 130, Long-alley—I used to employ the pri<lb/>soner in carrying bread from my master's shop to my shop—on the 19th of May I counted forty-six half-quartern loaves and placed them in the bottom of the barrow; a sack was placed over them, and sixteen quartern bricks, and two halves, were placed on the top of the sack—I employed the prisoner to take them to my shop, and told him to wait there till I came home—he asked me how long I should be before I got home—I said I did not know exactly, I might be half-an-hour—he asked me particularly that evening, more than he had ever done before—when I had got to my shop, I found him outside my shop—the bread had been removed from the barrow, and was inside the shop—my wife asked me the quantity of bread I had sent home—I told her, and she said that bread did not come home; she said some bread was taken from the bottom of the barrow, and the sack was taken from the top and tucked down to fill the place of six half-quartern loaves, which I missed—I asked the prisoner how it was he had not brought home the quan<lb/>tity I gave him—he said I could not have put it in the barrow—I said I did, and told him what quantity of bread there was—I am certain I put that quantity in the barrow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the treasurer of the London and South-Western Railway Company. In Nov. last, the Company resolved on the issuing of new scrip, in shares of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, on which 10 per cent. was to be paid by way of deposit—that was a resolution of the board of directors and of the proprietors—it was in writing—I have one of the genuine new scrip shares here—(<hi rend="italic"> producing it</hi>)—the Company commenced that issue on the 2nd Jan. this year—I cannot say the exact number that have been issued—they are issuing every day—at the time this was discovered, I think the number issued had reached 1021 or 1023—it was just above a thousand—I have seen these eighty scrip, and have had them entered—they are all forgeries—I see the name of "Alfred Morgan, Treasurer," here—it is the course for me, as treasurer, to sign shares issued by the Company—I find the name of Mr. Lacy, and of another director, also forged—none of these scrip bear my genuine signature—the new scrip were required to be signed by two of the directors—there are two directors named, Mr. Charles Lacy, and the Count John Lewis Eyre—he is a count of the Roman empire—I see names on these scrip purporting to be the names of those gentlemen—I do not believe they are the signatures of those directors—they are forgeries—the signing of the new scrip is not confired to any two particular directors—they take it in course—and at that time Mr. Lacy and Count Eyre were the two directors signing—I do not believe these signatures to be theirs—I see there is a decided difference between this water<lb/>mark and that on the genuine scrip—it is in the squareness of the letters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The genuine scrip has a water-mark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it consists of the name of "Smith and Ebbs," the printers—I see a very material differ<lb/>ence in the shape of the letters—I do not suppose that this is a water-mark—if you will look at the scrip, you will find the letters are straight, in the forged mark, whereas there is a turn in the top of the letters in the genuine water-mark—I have examined the resolution indorsed on the forged scrip, and find that in the word "proportionate, "the letter "o," is omitted—it is spelt correctly in the genuine scrip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the course? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The course is this, we issue letters of allotment, with the banker's receipt attached—the letter of allotment authorises the banker to receive the deposit—the banker signs the letter of allotment, and returns it to the holder, with the receipt—that comes to me—they then sign the Parliamentary deed, the scrip is issued in exchange for that letter, and a receipt is given for the scrip at the back of the letter—that is the process.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLABTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the scrip certificate, I presume, will not be exchanged until your Act of Parliament is passed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I apprehend the Company have no power to do so—there have been no certificates of re<lb/>gistration issued with respect to these new shares—the Act of Parliament has not been obtained—it is before the House now, I believe—a certificate of registration is what is understood as a share.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let us quite understand this; the first thing that issues from the Company is a letter of allotment on an opportunity application for shares? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first thing is a letter, giving every proprietor an opportunity of applying for his proportion of the new shares about to be created—then comes the letter of allotment which is sent to him in answer to his application—he then goes to the bankers and pays the money, the bankers appending a receipt to his letter—he then goes and signs the deed in London, or elsewhere, and then he brings the letter to the office, with a stamp on it of "D. S.,"meaning "deed signed," and then he has the scrip assigned—that is the process—we call upon the party to exchange the scrip for a certificate of complete registration, im<lb/>mediately after the passing of the Act—after the passing of the Act no other document, or security of any kind, is required in exchange for the certificate, except the scrip, nor any other proof of the deposit having been paid—the scrip is never issued till the deposit is paid—Numbers 821 to 870 of genuine scrip had been issued at the time this forgery was discovered, but numbers 1671 to 1680 had not, nor 1701 to 1720—the highest numbers of the forged scrip presented at the office to be examined, had been numbers 821 to 870—if we fail in obtaining the Act of Parliament, we do not require any other document, in order to return the money paid, than the production of the scrip certificate—returning the money would depend on the Act, of course—if the Act was not obtained, I presume we should return the deposits to the pro<lb/>prictors, but we have never had a case of the kind—by a proprietor, I mean an owner of scrip—the Company have not determined what shall be done with regard to this scrip, in the event of our not obtaining the Act; because that could not come before them till the Act was rejected.</p>

L. <hi rend="smallCaps">CRAVEN</hi>."—I found that the bankers had paid 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than the amount for which the check was drawn—in consequence of inquiries that were made respecting that over-payment, I sent for the prisoner to No. 2, Copthall-court, in the city—he came to me—he came as Mr. West—I did not know at that time that he was the person I had corresponded with by the name of Craven—I had never seen him before in my life—I told him that a check had been given for fifty London and South-Western scrip, and that our banker's had paid 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. too much on the check, and I was informed some of the notes had been traced to his possession—I believe I said four 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, I am not certain—and I asked from whom he received them—he said he had received them from a man of the name of Farmery, and afterwards, from a man of the name of Wilson—he did not quite appear to know from whom he had received them—he did not exactly know whether he had received them from Farmery or from Wilson—he said he had received them from a person he knew—he said he did not know Wilson, but describe his person; and this Wilson resembling a person who had been to our office, I requested him to walk with me to the residence of Wilson—I knew a person of the name of Wilson, and proposed that we should go to him together—we did so, but he was not at home, and we could not see him—Wilson called three weeks or a month after that—the prisoner was not there then—West said he believed Wilson was one of the Hall of Commerce men—that was just previous to our calling at Wilson's, in the course of walking down the street—I went to the Hall of commerce, but no such person was known—I was willing that the prisoner should not suspect that I suspected him. and I told him we had sent the scrip to the office of the company to be verified, and that the said scrip was returned as genuine, which was the fact—from the prevarication of his statements, I was induced to suspect him, but I did not wish to let him know it—I never re<lb/>ceived any money from him.</p>

On the 26th of May Mr. Swallow brought two carcasses of beef and two tongues—I saw Mr. Martin on the premises a little after—my master gave information to the police that he suspected the beasts were stolen—Martin came on the Thursday morning, and claimed them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 36, Bloomsbury-square. The prisoner came into my service on the 5th of April—on Tuesday, the 25th of May, I missed three yards and three quarters of poplin—I had had it in my possession a week before—on the 26th of May, in consequence of missing something</p>

               <p>more, I sent for a policeman—I asked the prisoner and another female servant if they had any objection to have their boxes searched—they said, "No"—the prisoner took the articles out of her boxes herself, folded as they were—on that search I did not discover anything—I went with the policeman to the prisoner's sister's, in Scotland-yard, to inquire whether the prisoner had left anything with her—we returned, and I thought it better to send the prisoner away at once—in consequence of what a lady told me, I told the prisoner to leave her boxes, and come the next morning at ten o'clock—on the following day I left my house—I was going to Mr. Thomas', the person from whom I had received the prisoner's character—as I was going, I met the prisoner in Hollis-street, Cavendish-square—she asked me when she was to have her boxes—I told her to come to my house and ask the question, and she would have a reply—I went on No. 9, George-street, where Mr. Thomas lived, who had given the prisoner a character—I inquired for Mr. Thomas—I did not see her, but when I was seated in the drawing-room, with a man who said he represented Mr. Thomas, the prisoner came in at a folding-door, not the door I had entered at—she said, "Now we will give it her"—the man then opened the door, and called another woman—the man then locked the door, and said to me, "Now, Madam, before you leave this room, you shall answer every question before these witnesses; what did you find in her boxes?"—I said nothing, but I rang the bell—a young girl had gone to the house with me, but she sat in the hall—I called, "Mary," twice—she came to the door, but could not get admittance—I went to the window, and said I would not be made a prisoner; if the man did not open the door, I would go on the balcony, and call, "Police!"—he said, "You are afraid"—I said I would go, and then he opened the door—I went down the stairs, and the man shouted after me, "Did you find anything?"—the prisoner said a great many things in the way of abuse, and the man threatened me with a lawyer, and all that—on the Friday night I went to Scotland-yard, where the prisoner lived, with her uncle—I saw the prisoner there—I addressed myself to her uncle—I told him I wished to give up her boxes, and pay her wages, but I would do it in his presence; that Mr. Braithwaite had seen her put things into her boxes after they had been examined, and they should not go from my house till they were searched again—the prisoner said she was determined that should not be done; if there was anything in her boxes belonging to me Mr. Braithwaite had put it there—I said they should not go till they were searched, and I left it to her uncle—he said he would come—the next day, between four and five o'clock, the prisoner came—a policeman was sent for—the boxes were opened again, and the prisoner took out the things—the first thing I saw was this poplin, in a flannel petticoat—I opened the petticoat, and shook it, and this came out of it on the ground—it is mine, and the same as I had missed.</p>

I recollect the prisoner's boxes being searched the first time, and I heard Mr. Stuckey tell her to go—after that I saw the prisoner pack up her things, and I saw her put in one article which was folded up—she held it with her two hands—it appeared to be flannel—she took it from the kitchen drawer—she locked her three boxes, and she corded the large one—I was standing in the kitchen—I was talking to her—she put the things in openly before me—she appeared confused at the time—I did not see the box opened after she locked it—I looked at the box while it was open—I did not examine the lock—it was a square wooden box—I should say it had no hasp—it locked in the usual way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Issac Baigent, who keeps an eating and coffee-house, in East Smithfield, in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate—it is his dwelling-house. The prisoner had been lodging in the house six weeks when this happened—I went to bed with my husband on this Saturday night, about a quarter after ten o'clock, leaving the prisoner in a box in the shop—he was tipsy—about half-past two in the morning I was disturbed by the sound of the knife-box—the prisoner used to sleep on the first-floor; I slept above him—I came down stairs, listened, heard a rattling noise, and thought he was helping himself to a little food—there were knives in the knife-box—I went up to bed again, heard the same noise repeated, came down again, and listened a short time; that was about half-past three—I looked into the prisoner's room—the bed had not been occupied—I listened at the top of the stairs, and heard the grating of a key in the cupboard where my husband keeps his money—I called out, and asked who was there—the prisoner answered, "It is me," and said, "I am getting up, are you?"—I said, "No, I am surprised at your making such a noise on a Sunday morning"—it was half-past three o'clock—that was not the usual time to get up on a Sunday morning—I went down three stairs, and saw the prisoner's foot—he had his stocking on, but no boot—I ran up stairs, put on my gown, and went down—I called my husband—he dressed himself, and came down—I was down first—I searched for the prisoner, but could not find him—I went into the yard, and called out—the prisoner spoke from the water-closet in the yard, and said, "Yes, ma'am, I am here," opened the door, came out, and came into the house—I said, "You have stolen my husband's money from the cupboard, I heard the grating of the key in the cupboard"—I do not know what made me think it was gone—he said I might search him, if I liked—I said no, I would leave that for my husband and the police—he sat down on a chair by the fire-place—my</p>

I have only a room there—it does not open on the staircase—there is no passage to it—it is on the ground-floor—you open the door in the court, and then you are in the room—there is a room over head, but there is no com<lb/>munication between my room and the rest of the house—nobody can get in or out, except by going into the court—I do not know what parish it is in—the prisoner lived with me about three weeks before my loss, living in the same room with me, and slept with me—we are both unfortunate women—one morning in April, I felt her leave my side in the bed—it was not dark—it was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning—she lit the fire and washed herself—I went to sleep—when I awoke, she was gone—she never came back—I had had a watch under my pillow, with a silver guard to it—I missed them—I got up, went to my box, where I had another silver watch, that was gone—I did not keep the box locked—the prisoner often went to it—I missed a silver pencil-case, a gold-pin, a pair of gloves, and an apron—I never saw the prisoner again till I saw her with the officer—I had seen the pencil-case and pin safe in the box, I think, one day in the same week, but am not certain—I had seen the watch safe on the Sunday night—this was on Tuesday morning—I found the pin and pencil-case at Mr. Whitly's, No. 10, Lower-street, Lambeth—there was no person in the room that night but the prisoner—we went to bed between one and two o'clock in the morning—we took a man home with us that night, he did not stop in the room above ten minutes—he went away between one and two o'clock—we did not go to bed till after he left—the value of the property altogether was about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am in partnership with my father—we are booksellers and stationers—the prisoner was our binder's apprentice, and for the convenience of business, he lived in our second house, No. 36—in consequence of suspicion, on the night of the 15th I watched, and about half-past five, on the morning of the 16th, I heard a door, which leads into the lobby of the shop, open—he moved various things on the counter, lifted them up, and put them down again in the same place, as near as I could see, till he came up to where I was, he then saw me, and started back very much frightened—I said, "What are you doing here?"—he said, "Oh my!"—I went with a policeman to his mother's house, and found a purse, pencil-case, some books, and all these thing produced—they are my father's and mine, I had missed them—I missed this pencil-case from a card which had five others on it, about a month before, on taking stock—I know these three books, and other things, which were found in his box, at the binders, they belong to my father and myself—this is the key of the till—this bunch of keys belongs to the premises—they open everything on the premises—I had had a new lock put on the till, as I suspected another lad who was taken up, and the next night the new key was missing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at No. 7, Bow-street, Covent-garden. On Thursday morning. the 20th of May, I went to No. 9, Upper Wellington-street, Covent-garden—I found the female prisoner there—I had not known her previously—I ascertained that she had been delivered of a male child—I saw the child—it appeared quite healthy and well—I occasionally visited the mother and child until the following day—the last period at which I saw the child alive was at twelve o'clock on Friday morn<lb/>ing—it was then quite healthy, with the exception of a little inflammation and a small discharge from the eyes—that was not in the least of a dangerous nature—about six o'clock the same evening, I saw the child dead—it was then cold, the face was suffused, the nostrils dilated, there was a protro<lb/>sion of the eye, the hands were clenched, the extremities of the fingers and the nails livid, and the legs drawn up towards the body—those appearances</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140129"/>
               <p>did not then indicate the death the child had come to—I had no suspicion then; but from a subsequent knowledge that I had of the affair, I had sus<lb/>picion, and I went to the police—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the Saturday morning, at five o'clock, from which I thought the child had not died a natural death—the body of the child was natural—we first examined the lungs, we found the right lung considerably congested, the left lung was much more so, with three distinct extravasated spots—the heard was come pletely empty—the liver was much congested—all the other viscera were quite healthy—we examined the brain—the left side of the brain, corre<lb/>ponding with the lung, was much congested, with extravasation—the conclusion at which I arrived from those appearances, was, that the child had died from suffocation—the external appearances that I saw on the Friday, at six o'clock; would be the natural appearances of suffocation—Mr. Guthrie, Mr. Canton, and Mr. Echlin, were also present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—Mr. Guthrie performed the examination in my presence.</p>

SERJEANT ALLEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you were not the first person that had attended her during her confinement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, my brother was the first person that went—he is here—she was delivered on Wednesday, at four o'clock—I first saw her on Thursday, at twelve—there were no appearances of inflammation in the child's eyes on the Thursday—I had seen the child before I saw the mother—it was brought to my hours by the wet-nurse, a woman named Barber—I did not pay particular attention as to how it was dressed—I think it was dressed in the usual way in which infants are—it had a shawl on, I think—it had infant's clothes on—I remem<lb/>ber seeing some peculiarity about the navel—it was stripped to show me, and I remember a towel was wrapped round it—that was all the nurse di<lb/>rected my attention to—the navel did not appear to be broken or torn—it appeared as if there was a little extra inflammation—I cannot recollect whe<lb/>ther the child had a cap on—I did not pay that attention to it—I remember a shawl being over the child, and that the towel was removed to show me the navel—that is all I distinctly remember—children are usually bandaged—the towel was placed round the bowels—I cannot tell whether the shawl was a thick woolen shawl—my attention was only called to the circumstance, that there was something the matter with the navel of the child—the nurse said the child was quite healthy—I did not then inquire into the circumstance of the birth—I heard from my brother that the child was safely delivered, and well, and so on—I saw the child again on Friday morning, at twelve, when I called at the wet-nurse's house, the nurse having been previously to my house, begging I would call, as there was some little inflammation about the child's eyes—I then perceived some inflammation about the eyes—it extended to both eyes—there was also a secretion from the mucus membrane—it was not running from the nostrils, but from the eyes—the mucus membrane was slightly inflamed—it must have been inflamed slightly to have caused the dis<lb/>charge—it was a slight discharge, that would arise from a cold—that is the general cause—I beg distinctly to say that there was no discharge from the nose, it was entirely confined to the eyes—I examined to see whether there had been a discharge from the nose—I opened the eyes, and saw what it was, which is a thing very common in infants—it is a certain discharge from the eyes, consequent upon sudden exposure to light and cold—it is possible that a running from the nose might proceed from the same cold that caused the inflammation of the eyes, but I am doubtful whether matter would run from the same opening; tears might—I think the manner of feeding the child would not have anything to do with it—if the cold was first taken, and the child was afterwards fed upon too strong food, that would have a tendency to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140132"/>
               <p>increase the consequences of that cold; but the child had had a teaspoonful of castor-oil on the previous evening, and one in the morning, which was sufficient to reduce any inflammation that might have ensured—that would have tendency to decrease the symptoms—it would be a natural effect that the inflammation should go on if the child was fed on unwholesome food, anything that would derange the current of the blood would increase the inflammation—if there is any inherent tendency to inflammation on a child, the effect of unwholesome or too strong food would be to increase that—I never remember a case where similar effects have been exhibited in the shape of inflammation, where there has been pressure on the head, from an irregular birth—I have not seen such a case—it is very common to see inflammation with that suppuration of the eye, but I never saw it resulting from difficult labour—I do not know that pressure on the head during birth would exhibit any particular symptoms—it would exhibit no external symptoms, and the only internal injury that could exist would be congestion of the brain—I think that would not afterwards develop itself in a discharge from the nose—the con<lb/>sequence would be entirely internal, not external at all—inflammation of the membranes of the brain is the consequence of consequence—the effect of congestion would be internal inflammation—I found the mother as a good many usually are after lobour—I merely asked the usual questions which medical men ask after the delivery of a child, and they were answered satis<lb/>factorily to me—she had no particular after-pains, and everything was going on very favourably indeed; I conceived that she was a person in good general health—I have never expressed an opinion that she was then labouring under a liver complaint, or disease of the lungs—she did not appear to be in a weaker state than persons would be usually under the same circumstances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With regard to the appearance of the child on the Friday night, you say it was from something you had heard that you were induced to believe the cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was from something I heard previously that induced me to act in the manner I did, and to give immediate information to the Police—I was sent for in a great hurry at six o'clock on Friday—the eyes at that time were protruding, although the sockets were not opened, both eyes were very prominent—those circumstances did not then lead me to form any opinion as to the cause of death, because from other circumstances I had determined to enter more minutely into the case—there were no external symptoms that I could judge by—I had heard something before—I had heard nothing between the Friday when I saw the child, and the Saturday when I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem examination</hi>—I immediately went to the Police, saw the inspector, and went to Mr. Guthrie—I never saw a case where a child had died from being overlaid—I have not been in practice more than two years—my experience in these cases is rather limited.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of last witness, and am a medical man. I have been residing in the country for my health, but have lately been residing with my brother—I delivered the female prisoner, at No. 9, Welling<lb/>ton-street—I first saw her on the Wednesday evening, between four and five o'clock—when I got there she was in string labour—the child was born between three and four minutes after I got into the room, with my assistance—there was no difficulty whatever in the parturition—when I first examined the child it was as perfectly healthy a child as I ever remember to have seen—I continued with the mother very nearly an hour—I delivered the child to a woman named Barber—I never saw it again, not the mother either—my brother then attended.</p>

               <p>had not received any previous intimation that my services would be required by the prisoner, it was entirely accidental—I was sent for about a quarter-past four on the Wednesday afternoon—when I arrived she was in strong labour, I mean the child was being, or about being, expelled from the womb—the child being born about three minutes after I was there, would certainly indicate strong labour—that operation was performed by my assistance—I rendered no other than the ordinary assistance, merely by grasping the head—I should say nature had very nearly completed the whole of the operation before I arrived—the head of the child protruded when I arrived—it was then that I found it necessary to give some manual assistance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you find that the head was stationary in its partial expulsion from the womb? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It generally remains so—it is usual in these cases that the head should remain stationary for a time, until a successive pain comes, and then the child generally, with the slightest assistance, is brought into the world, or without assistance—this was not a case of difficult labour—I believe it is always usual when the head is presented, for the medical man to take hold of it with his right hand, and gradually to assist—that is not always the case—sometimes the child is expelled without the slightest assistance—my assistance in this case was very slight—the more we leave things to nature of course the better—it is the ordinary practice to do so; but when a pain came on, I did as medical men generally do, assisted nature so far as to give relief to the mother as soon as possible.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then there was, in your judgment, occasion, at all events, for the use of the hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could hardly tell when I arrived there, how long the child had been in that position, it might have been one, two, or three minutes, I could not tell; at all events, the assistance I rendered was so slight, that I might say it was a pure effort of nature; in fact, it was merely the act of taking the child by the head—as far as taking the child by the head with my hand, I certainly did render the ordinary assistance—I should have done so under ordinary circumstances, in any case—I required no particular reason for doing so on this occasion, because it is so usual—I did not know how long the child had been in that position, with the head partially excluded from the womb—I should say it had certainly not been so many minutes—it might have been two or three minutes—I should say it could only have been from the time I was first called, the distance from 7, Bow-street to 9, Wellington-street, which is very short, and the time it would take a person to come and me to go back—I should say that would not occupy above five minutes—it is between 200 and 300 yards, or it may be a trifle more—I should say it could not have occupied more than five minutes, for I was on the point of leaving the house at the time, and I merely received the message, and went directly—when the child was born, I delivered it to Mr. Barber, who sat close by me—there was nothing to place the child in, at least, nothing that is usual, no flannel, or anything of that sort, to place the child in, in the first instance—I asked for flannel, and there was none—subsequently a small strip was produced, but not sufficient—afterwards, at the suggestion of some one, I do not know whether it was of myself, a woman present brought her flannel petticoat, and the child was enveloped in that—very likely a thick woolen shawl might also have been produced, but I do not know—the child was not removed while I was there—I left first—I attended to the proper ex<lb/>amination of the navel—I saw that the child was quite right, because I always make a point of doing so—I examined it at the time of its birth—I handed it immediately from where it was born to the nurse—it was immediately wrapped up in something—I left, and never saw it again</p>

I am surgeon, and have been in practice between ten and eleven years—I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the child—I have heard the evidence of Mr. Brooking, at to the appearances—the left lung was very much gorged, and there were several spots of ex<lb/>travasation—I found the appearances generally very much as they have been described by Mr. Brooking—the brain was not so gorged, it was more vas<lb/>cular than usual—from the appearances I saw, which have been mentioned by Mr. Brooking, I came to the conclusion that the child had died from suf<lb/>focation—I have not the slightest doubt of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT ALLEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were the ages of those infants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not exactly remember, but they were very young—a few days old—they were both suffering from the same complaint of the eyes that this child had—that had nothing to do with their death—the complaint of the eyes was not in the slightest degree dangerous—the hospital is an ophthalmic hospital, and they were brought there on account of their eyes—it is a common complaint—there are thousands at the hospital every year—hundreds certainly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, did you observe whether there was any inflammation of the mucus membrane? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was slight inflamma<lb/>tion of the mucus membrane, not leading in the slightest degree to the now—that inflammation would not cause any discharge through the nose—if the child had any discharges through the nose, it would be from some other cause, not immediately referable to the discharge from the eyes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>no opinion on that subject—the discharge from the eyes would occasion slight redness of the <hi rend="italic">conjunctiva</hi>—it would not occasion the extravasation of the lungs, or the inflammation of the brain, nor have any connexion with it at all.</p>

I formerly lived with the female prisoner, in Wellington-street—I had been living there about ten days before her confinement—I knew she was in the family way—I had been in the house about three days when the first conversation took place between myself, Mr. Cleveland, and several others—she said she had not provided any clothes, as she knew the child would not live—I made no remark on that—I should think she has made the same observation a dozen times, with us all in the kitchen—on the morning she was confined she said to me, "Harriet, will you go to Mr. Gliddon's, at the cigar divan, next to the Pizzas, and ask there if Mr. H. has been there?"—I knew who Mr. H. was—Mr. Harry was the name we knew the gentle<lb/>man by—I knew who she meant—we were told to call him "Mr. Harry" by Mr. Cleveland; but this morning she told me to go and see if Mr. H. had been there—she said nothing then about being in the family way—she told me to tell him to come directly—she did not say why—the male prisoner is not Mr. Harry—I went to Mr. Gliddon's—I came back, and told her that the gentleman said that Mr. H. had not been there at all—I stopped in the room a short time with her after that—she got very much worse, and said, "Harriet, you take some money off the mantel-piece, take a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and go either to No. 57.

On Saturday, the 15th of May, about two o'clock in the morning, I was in Little Carlisle-street, Portman-market—I was not quite sober—I was proceeding down the street, and the prisoner came across from the opposite side—I do not recollect his saying anything to me, but he knocked me down with his fist, and struck me on the said, and then he robbed me of my watch—it was in my right-hand waistcoat pocket, and attached to a small piece of cord round my neck—the cord was cut off my neck—the part that was round my neck remained on till I got to the station, and the other part was attached to the handle of the watch—the prisoner walked away very fast—I got up and followed him, met a policeman, and gave him in charge, and he was taken to the station—the policeman, some time afterwards, produced my watch to me—I am sure it is mine—this now produced is it.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 15th of May, about two o'clock in the morning I was in Little Carlisle-street—the prisoner came up to me when I was at the corner, and asked where I was going—I said, "Home, if I live long enough"—he said, "Where do you live?" and I said, "Next door"—I did</p>

               <p>live there—there was a drunken man standing on the other side of the way—the prisoner left me, and went towards him—I waited at the door, and they walked together down the street five or six doors—I turned my head the other way for a moment, and heard something fall—I looked round, and saw the man that was drunk lying in the road—it was the prosecutor—he pri<lb/>soner was then several yards before him, walking away—he did not walk fast—the prosecutor got up—I did not go to him—he called out, "You vagabond, you have robbed me of my watch," and went down the street after the pri<lb/>soner—they met a policeman, and he took the prisoner into custody—I did not see how the man fell.</p>

               <p>came up towards me, and I made towards them—the prosecutor was calling out, "You vagabond, you have robbed me of my watch"—that was pre<lb/>vious to my coming towards them—when I got within six yards of them I saw the prisoner throw something away, up a gateway, where there are no stones—I could not tell what it was he threw—I then met the prisoner and prosecutor, and the prosecutor said, "I give this man in charge to you for knocking me down and robbing me of my watch"—I said, "Are you certain that this is the man? be sure; it is a very serious charge"—he said, "I am quite cer<lb/>tain; there was no other man near me"—the prisoner opened his coat and said, "You can search me; I have got no watch about me"—that was after I had seen him throw something away—I said, "I shall search you"—I took him by the collar, and took him up the street to where I had seen him throw something away—I turned my lantern on, which I had in my belt, and there I saw this watch, and picked it up—the prosecutor was then behind me, and I said to him, "I have found a watch; I do not know whether it is your or not; you had better come and see it"—he claimed it at the station-house—I did not show it to him before—I have it here—the guard seems to have been cut off—I took this part from Britton's neck, and it corresponds with the other.</p>

On Monday, the 10th of May, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I returned home, and found the prisoner Langford in my house and another person, who I believe to be the prisoner Fonseco—they were up in a corner outside, the bar having a print of ale together—they could see into the parlour—I went into the parlour and told my wife and child to go up stair—I found two persons in the parlour having a glass of ale—Mr. Schottler was behind the bar—I sent her up stairs, and then attended to the business of the house—some of my usual neighbourly customers were there—the prisoner were on one side of the bar, and the customer on the other—when the cus<lb/>tomers left Langford asked me whether he might go into the yard, that would be through the parlour where the two persons were—I suppose he went into the yard—he went into the parlour—that is the way to the yard—I did not go with him—he came back, and took his station opposite to where the cash<lb/>box was—the cash-box was inside—he stood outside against the counter—there is a shelf inside the bar underneath—my cash-box was on that shelf—being rather inside, and in the dark, it could not be seen by people passing by, nor by person in the bar, except when it was taken out to give change—Lang<lb/>ford placed himself outside the counter—the other placed himself inside, with a coat over his arm, opposite Langford, about two step off—Langford called for half a quartern of gin, paid for it, and shared it with the other—he then called for half a pint of ale, and shared that with the other—during that time the other person opened the street door three or four time, looked out, and said to Langford, "I do not see him coming, Jack," as if he was waiting for some one—the top of the bar is eighteen or twenty inches broad—my son, who had been in the yard, came out of the parlour and went up stairs—then one of the persons in the parlour came out to see what o'clock it was, the dial being in the shop, and when he turned round he asked me to bring him in a glass of spruce and water—I took it into the parlour—I could see back so far that I had only to make four step out of sight of where the cash-box stood—as I placed the spruce and water on the table I turned round and heard the gingle of the bunch of keys in the cash-box—I immediately suspected that they had hold of the cash-box—I went to took, and saw Langford and the other both rush out of door—I thought there was something wrong—I looked and the cash-box was gone—I had seen it just before I went into the parlour—there was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—I do not know exactly in what coin it was—there was one sovereign, a half-crown, sixpences, fourpenny pieces, and, I believe, shilling—I went out at the door, and saw them just turning the corner of a street fifteen yards off—they were on the fast trot—the one I believe to be Fonseco had the coat over his arm then—I pursued and came up with them—they were side by side—I went up to the one with the coat, and said, "what have you got there?"—I lifted up the coat, and saw the cash-box under—he looked in my face and said. "My property"—he threw the cash-box and the coat into the road, and while I was picking them up, I called out, "Stop thief!" several</p>

On Monday morning, the 10th of May, I was standing opposite Mr. Schottler's house, and saw the two prisoners come out of the house—I have no doubt as to either of them—Fonseco came out first with a bundle on his arm—I had not much time to look at it—it was something turned up under his arm—they were running—when they got three or four steps out of the house, I saw Mr. Schottler come out—he ran against me, and as he ran against me, he called out "Hoy, hoy"—I suppose he was calling to the two prisoners—I saw him run after them, and when he was opposite the wharf he cried out "Stop thief"—I ran after them, as Mr. Schottler was running and about twelve steps in the Globe-street he caught the prisoner with the bundle over his arm—the prisoner dropped the bundle, and ran away—when Mr. Schottler came back, he said, "I have got my property"—I saw him bring back a cash-box and a coat, which was the bundle that I had seen the man with, and drop in Globe-street.</p>

Taddy's—I left off work on Saturday, the 15th of May, and did not work after that—I did not work on the Monday, because of the stock-taking—when stock is taken the men are out of employ<lb/>ment—at other times there are sometimes ninety, and sometimes 100 men em<lb/>ployed—I cannot say how many men were employed in the week ending the 15th of May—they are not discharged virtually, only nominally—they will be taken on again when the stock-taking is over, unless there is any objection—they leave off work then, and are not paid in the mean time—in the week ending the 15th of May there were 150 men working on the same floor with me—Fonseco was one—he was sitting at the side of me, not on Saturday, the 15th—he is a Jew, and does not work on Saturday—he was by my side on the 14th—he attended there every day that week, and sat by the side of me—the proper time to go into the manufactory in the morning is eight o'clock—we cannot get in after half-past eight—it is establishment rule, and we cannot get out after half-past eight, without leave of the foreman, Mr. Brown—Mr. Moffatt is the under foreman—we cannot get out between half-past eight and one o'clock, without getting leave—I can positively say that Fonseco was working by my side from nine to one o'clock on Monday, the 10th of May—we come in at half-past eight, and at nine o'clock we commence the regular day's work, and it is an understood thing between men sitting next to each other that they shall commence at the beginning of the hour, that was an invariable rule between me and Fonseco, not taking any notice of the first half-hour—I am quite sure he was not away between nine and one o'clock—he was there the whole day—Joseph Neaves sat on the other side of him—Fonseco sits on my right, between me and Neaves—the door of the place is locked at one o'clock, and continues locked till two—then it is unlocked.</p>

Taddy's—I do not know where the prosecutor's house is—Fonesco sat on one side of me, and Neaves on the other side of him—there was no one on the other side of me—the person nearest me, was Badcock, who sat opposite to me—we sit eight at a table, four on each side—we all sat down at half-past eight—I do not know that I can tell you all the eight who sit at the table—sometimes the foreman changes them once a fortnight, sometimes once a month, some<lb/>times once in six months—I cannot tell you why he changes them—it is a whim of his own—the men sitting at this table on the 10th of May, were James Ellis, Fonesco, Joseph Neaves, Thoman Neaves, Badcock, and Gibbs, myself, but I cannot remember who the eighth was—that day we were making cigars, some called regalias—I myself was making what we call <hi rend="italic">points</hi>, and Fonseco also—I do not know whether Ellis was making large or small sizes—there is a yard space allowed to each man, and some 3ft. 10in., or 5ft.—the tables vary in size.</p>

               <p>lose a day—the May stock-taking sometimes lasts a fortnight, sometimes three weeks—it does not always begin in the same day in May, as there is no getting finished exactly to a day—there is no account taken in a book of the names of the men who are there—if they are too late, they come in at half-past ten—the foreman thinks the two hours' loss punishment enough—it is piece-work—at half-past ten there is no notice taken of what men are there—they know who are not there by their places being vacant—the fore<lb/>man walks up and down—I can almost be positive that there is no account taken, either by the foreman or clerk, of the men who come in the course of the day—a man of the name of Ascalape had left a portion of cigars, part of the last week's work behind him—the foreman did not pay him, because they do not pay for fourteen or fifteen cigars—the foreman asked Fonseco to take the work—the foreman pays in hundreds—there were fifteen or sixteen cigars left—they were not reckoned on this occasion, and the foreman asked Fonseco to include them in his work, and allow Ascalpe for them—I know it was on Monday, the 10th, that Ascalape called—he is not here—I could not have sworn to the day—if it had not been for that circumstance—I think I first heard of this charge against Fonseco on the 18th—it was in con<lb/>sequence of that that I searched back, and ascertained the day when this occurred—we were absent about a fortnight after the 15th, or two or three days over the fortnight—I recollect that Fonseco was not absent during any part of Monday the 10th, because we worked together by the hour—I had only known him absent on one occasion three oro four months ago, and that was to go on business—he has always attended to business—we do not work as partners in the same job; but to cause us to work quickly, and not to lose any time, to keep our attention on the work—he has never been from my side the whole time I have worked there—I have returned since the stock<lb/>taking, and am now in the same employ, and Fonseco also—he sits behind me now, at another table—we sit back to back.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">CAARTEEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had Badcock left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I not see anything down to Badcock after Thursday, 24th April—the prisoner made 350 cigars on the Monday, 400 on the Thursday, (allowing for the 200), 400 on Wed<lb/>nesday, 400 on Thursday, 400 on Friday—he is a Jew, and does not work on Saturday—there are 400 cigars down to Scott on Monday—the Saturday and Monday's work go down together—Fonseco does not work on Saturday—Saturday and Monday is connected together—Scott made about 400, but it was a different sort of cigar—I superintend a portion of the manufacturing—I have the general supervision of that one room—none of my business lies out of the room—there are eighty or ninety men in the room—I should say no man could go out and come in again without my knowledge, because he would have to asked leave—there is nothing else to prevent his going out—he might ask leave of the foreman of the premises, but I should know it from him—it is such rare thing for a man to go out come in again, that I should be sure to remember if it was done.</p>

On the 7th of June I went to the Gun public-house, in Shore<lb/>ditch, at two o'clock in the morning—I went into the parlour, and remained there till near five—I went there to see for my husband—he drinks very much, and I expected he would be there—I came out of the parlour about five o'clock, and stood by the bar-door—the prisoner was sitting close against me, with a female and two or three men—he got up and called me by name, and asked how I was—I looked at him, and said. "Very well, thank you"—he came and took the glass that I had, and drank out of it—I felt him pull my dress, and I missed half-a-crown, two shillings, and six sixpences—they were in my pocket in a paper—I saw the paper in his hand—I pulled a piece of it off, and gave it to the landlord, and he threw it down in front of the bar—I am sure it was the paper the money was in—there was the mark of the money on the paper—I took it up—the prisoner and the others got it out of my hand and destroyed it—before they destroyed it I had ascer<lb/>tained that it was the paper that had had my money—I told the prisoner he had robbed me—he said, "Oh, nonsense."</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Henry Tucker and others, silk mercers, in Trump-street. On the 26th of April the prisoner came to the warehouse—he wanted sixty pieces of Korahs (that is East India silk hand<lb/>kerchiefs) for a shipping order to Hamburgh; and he wished to have them on approbation for the approval of a third party, if he chose forty or fifty pieces out of them he would return them to us to ship, and the others were to be returned to us—this is the invoice that was sent with the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brewer-street, Pimlico. On the 12th of June, about twenty minutes past ten at night, I met the prisoner at Buck<lb/>ingham-gate—she asked me if I would give her a drop of gin—I took her into the White Horse—we had a quartern of gin, came out together, and came down St. James'-street together, walking side by side till we came to William-street, when she turned up a dark passage—I put my hand in my pocket, missed my money, and followed her—she met me, and said there was no thoroughfare, I could not go through—I accused her of robbing me—she denied it—a policeman came, and I gave her in charge—I had had one sove<lb/>reign, three half-crowns, and one shilling and sixpence loose in my pocket—it was my wages which I had received, and an old coin which I had found three weeks ago—this now produced is it—I swear to it by this figure "7" on it.</p>

"Yes"—that is Mr. Hunt, a stable-keeper—he took the brushes away—on the afternoon of the same day he came again, and brought the brushes back, saying he would exchange them for three others, as Mr. Hunt supposed the first expense would be the least, and he would have a better quality—he then asked for a body-brush for the bodies and insides of carriages—he asked me the price—I told him they were marked outside—he had four brushes, three in exchange, and one extra—he said he would exchange them for Hunt, and that his master would come in the course of the week and settle for them—he took them away with him—he gave me his name, as Harry Smith—when he came a second time, he said, "It is cus<lb/>tomary for us men to have an invoice, merely to show our employer—I gave it him—on Friday, the 14th, he came again for a bottle of blacking—he took up a bottle of blacking, saying, "Add this to the brushes," and took it away.</p>

On Wednesday, the 2nd of June, between one and two o'clock in the day, I went into Mr. Mills' room and missed a pair of sheets, which were my mother's property, from the bed—Mr. Mills had the use and care of them, they are not here—between five and six o'clock in the afternoon I supplied the bed with other sheets, I saw them safe be<lb/>tween eight and nine o'clock, and fastened the room with a padlock—the prisoner Griffin held the light for me—I came away between eleven and</p>

                  </hi>. My mother is a window, and keeps the house No. 5, New-street, Bishopsgate, in the parish of St. Botolph Without, Bishops<lb/>gate; Landsberg lodged in the first floor front room, Cohen at the back, and the prisoner on the third floor. On the 25th of May, about six o'clock, the prosecutor, the prisoner, and Cohen went out together—after they had been gone about five minutes the prisoner returned—I opened the door—he went into the parlour—I went in, then left him there, and went down stairs—he then went up stairs and opened Mr. Landsberg's room—the door makes a noise when it is opened; it bursts—when I heard the door I spoke to my mother, and she went up stairs—there was no other person in the house but a lady on the second floor—my mother was up stairs three or four minutes—the prisoner then went out—he turned to the left, and I could not see him as I looked to the right—I heard somebody go out—the lady was not out all that day—there was one gentleman lived in the house—he came in twice, and went out twice—I let him in once, and let him out once, and my mother let him in once, and out once—he had got nothing with him—another gentleman came once, and let himself in—he had nothing with him, and I let him out—neither of them could have had a bag or box without my seeing it.</p>

On the 25th of May I saw the prisoner coming from Mr. Parish's house—he was about twice the length of this court from the door—he turned to the left—I am certain he is the man—he had a blur bag of the common size with him, which had four corners to it, and seemed to be knocking against his knees and thighs—I am sure there was something in it—it was like a box which came up slanting—there was another man with him who held the bag while the prisoner stood opposite the door and made water—I saw them both come out together from Mr. Landsberg's house—while the prisoner made water the other man walked round the corner, to see if any one was coming—they looked frightened—the man with the bag kept staring about—the prisoner took off his hat and put on a cap—I followed them—they ran down the court as fast as they could—I saw no more of them—I next saw the prisoner in the Compter—there were about twelve or thirteen men there—a gentleman said, if I knew the man I was to pick him out—I walked round and laid my finger on him—it was about half-past six o'clock in the evening—my father works in the St. Katharine Docks.</p>

Bank of England note, 2 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, 2 or 3 fives, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and some silver—three was a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece among it which were remarkable, the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. had a hole in it—there was also a double sovereign—I missed that cash-box about a quarter to four o'clock—I had seen it safe at three o'clock—I went up stairs, and imme<lb/>diately I came down I went into the yard and found the back gate open—my suspicions were directly excited—I looked for Henry Farr, and he had gone out without his hat or cap, and left his clothes behind him—I went in pur<lb/>suit of him—I had seen Charles Farr once—I traced Henry to his mother's, but did not see him there—I went down to Bridgenorth on the 5th of May, and there saw Charles Farr, and on the 7th of May I found him in custody at Hoxton—I said, "I have got you at last," or something to that effect—he said, "Oh, you don't want me; it was not me that took the cash-box, it was my brother, and you did not see him take it"—he taunted me with that in the station-house—he was searched, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. some silver found on him, among which was a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with a hole in it on one side—this now produced is it—I will undertake to swear that it is the one I lost—I said to him at the time, "This sixpence was in the cash-box"—(it was along with a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece and a half-crown that was battered—there were several remarkable things)—he said it was not—I know it by the hole and by the general appearance of it—it has been through my hands repeatedly—it is knocked up at the side—I also said to him, "Why, you are dressed like a gentleman now, and you had no clothes before, where have you got all these from? it is my money that has bought these"—he said, "You cannot prove it," or something to that effect—on the same night, I saw Henry Farr at Bow-street, and charged him with stealing my cash-box—he said, "I did not do it," or something to that effect.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there then a ratification of his appointment sent by the Poor-law Commissioners, prescribing what his duties were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, merely approving his appointment—his duties are prescribed in the order—the Guardians are bound by that prescription of the duties—the order directing the election, also prescribes the duties—the prisoner was appointed by the Guardians—he has since been dismissed by the Poor-law Commissioners, not by the Guardians, they have no power of dismissal—the prisoner gave a bond to the Guardians on being appointed—I have got that bond—every Wednesday morning he was expected to show to the Guardians how the rates stood—he did not go before the Guardians, he rendered an account every Wednesday morning to me, as clerk to the Guardians, of the money he had received on the different rates that were then due—it can hardly be called a weekly account—it was the result of the monies collected—the Guardians are the Guardians of the Union—they direct a certain sum of money to be paid by the Overseers to them, as their share of the expenses of the Union—the money is collected for the Overseers, and paid to the account of the Overseers, at the banker's—they have to pay a great many small local expenses, Police-rates, and so on, and then they pay the amount ordered by the Guardians over to the Guardians.</p>

Thomas Truman"—he is paid by a poundage—the money collected is paid in to the bankers, to the account of the Overseers, the Overseers have to pay the Police-rate, the County-rate, &amp;c., that is without any connection with the Guardians, quite independent of them—the Guardians know nothing of it, in fact all that they know is with regard to their own receipt for the main<lb/>tainance and support of the poor—the Overseers pay a certain amount to the treasurer of the Union, for the Guardians for the relief of the poor, and the surplus, after that amount is so paid, is retained by the Overseers for the next year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There is no accounting, as I understand, by the Overseers to the Guardians at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is the result of every Wednesday—the collector is expected to show the balance of each rate as it stands at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the auditor of the district in which the Holborn Union is situated. I audit the accounts of each Union separately—Saffron-hill is a distinct district—the Union consists of a number of parishes or districts, and I audit the accounts of each distinctly—I am elected by the Guardians of the districts, and the Poor-law Commissioners ratify the ap<lb/>pointment—I audit half-yearly now—the prisoner has been in the habit of producing his books, and accounting to me for the district of Saffron-hill—on Thursday morning, the 6th of May, I proceeded to audit those accounts—he produced this account-book to me—it is an aggregate account—on looking</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140180"/>
               <p>over the book, there were some circumstances which excited my suspicion, and I sent the prisoner home for his check-books—these are receipt check-books—he takes these out with him—when he receives money he tears out a receipt, gives it to the person paying the money, and enters in the margin the per<lb/>son's name from whom he receives it, and the amount and date—when I sent him for his check-books, I expected him back immediately—he did not re<lb/>turn—I did not see him again until Saturday morning, the 8th of May, when he came to me in consequence of some communication I had had with his friends—I then went into a detailed examination in his presence of the check-books with the rate-books—in the first place I took an account of those rates which appeared by the check-books to be unpaid—the receipt-books were produced—there are receipts in them for the money of Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Baker, and Mr. Simpson, and he stated at the time that they were unpaid by them—I asked him the question upon each particular item—the fact of the receipts being here, would purport that they were not paid, but not in all cases, because in some cases he gives stamp receipts—that was why I asked him upon each particular item—the three receipts which have been produced, are not stamp-receipts, but similar to those in the book—he denied having re<lb/>ceived these—as far as I know, this book is in the same condition as it was when I received it, except the writing that is across the receipts.</p>

The prisoner worked there for about fourteen months—he left on the Saturday evening before Easter Sunday—he came to the shop on Monday, the 31st of May, about half-past six o'clock in the evening—I was working there—he had left some tools there—he came to fetch them away—I think he had some beer—he was there a quarter of an hour before I spoke to him—I was at work at the forge making a shoe for a gentleman—I was half an hour about it, and he kept on blackguarding me—I told him to be quite and hold his tongue—I had done that shoe and then I went to do another little job—he came up to me and, "Jarvis, you are a d—d thief, and a rogue"—I said, "If you call me that again, I will give you in charge"—I pushed him from me, and told him to go away, and come when Mr. Jones was at home—at that time he had got his tools in his apron, and he said, "You are Mr. Jones's foreman, look at what tools I have got"—I looked, and saw a hammer which did not belong to the prisoner—it had been there two years before he-came—he had put a handle in this ham<lb/>mer, and was going to take it away—I told him it was not his—he said, "If it is Mr. Jones's hammer, it is my handle, and I will saw it off"—some time after I went to put my hand to him to take the hammer, and I said, "You go away"—he said, "I will go when I like"—I went to put my hand to it and he took up the hammer and hit me twice on the head with it—I bled a great deal, and was taken to the surgeon—I was in bed from Monday till Thursday, and did not leave my room till Saturday—I had not struck the prisoner before I received those blows.</p>

On the evening of the 31st of May, I was on the stairs which look into the shop—the prisoner came for his tools—he had been there some time—I heard him ask Jarvis to look at his tools—Jarvis said he did not want anything to do with him, to go out of the shop—after he laid his tools down on his apron in the shop, Jarvis saw a hammer, he said it was his master's, and the prisoner should not take it away—the prisoner called Jarvis a d—d thief and a rouge—Jarvis told him to go out of the shop, he did not want anything to say to him—the prisoner came round to Jarvis, while Jarvis was at work by the fire, Jarvis turned round and said if he did not go he would pull his nose—he put his hand to his face, I did not see whether he pulled his nose—they were quarrelling for some time—I did not hear what they said—they walked down the shop as if they were going out of the gate—Jarvis put his hand on the prisoner's shoulder, and said he would take the hammer from him, he should not take it out of the shop—the prisoner turned round and struck him twice on the head with the hammer—I was frightened, and went away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the 9th of April I was on duty at Woolwich. Thorn came to me—in consequence of what he said, I went to the door of the Crown and Anchor—I saw Thorn take hold of Glover by the arms and say, "You must go out"—Glover immediately caught him by the collar, and made use of the most beastly expressions—he took Thorn by the collar, threw him back with great violence, and succeeded in getting into the tap-room—Dyble was there—he did nothing then—they were both to<lb/>gether—I took Glover into custody, and took him outside into the street—he then struck me in the eye, and knocked me backwards—I fell backwards, he fell on me—I still held him by the collar, while he was on me—Dyble came out of the house, and said, "You b—r, let him go," he caught me by my thumb, pressed it backwards from Glover's collar, and kicked me in the side—I became insensible—I had previous to that called out for assistance, and while I was insensible two civilians came to my assistance, and pulled Dyble off me—both the men were on me then—my hand is very much hurt—the skin is torn off—I was off duty two days—both the men had been drinking—I kept hold of Glover—Dyble made his escape, and was taken next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bawsey, in Suffolk.

I am the prisoner's wife—he is a lieutenant in the army on half-pay—we were married in 1820, and have three children—he is addicted to drink, and when under the influence of drink he is generally very violent—he has told me that he was not right in his head at times, and to be cautious what I said to him when he was under the influence of drink—he said he did not know what would be the end of it, as he knew his head was bad—we live at No. 105, East-street—on the 3rd of June he came home about half-past ten in the morning—he had been out all night, I think—he was very much agitated indeed—he had been drinking—he went into Mr. Crossland, the landlord's place—I could not hear what was said, but I could hear the tone of his voice—I do not know that he spoke to me—he kept talking to himself for two or three hours—I went down to the yard—he followed me round the yard—I went round because I was afraid he was going to strike me—he had not said anything to make me think so, but I saw he was in a violent passion—he did not say what he was in a passion about—he went up stairs, I remained down till nearly twelve o'clock—he re<lb/>mained quite still, and then I went up stairs—when I got up he came behind me with a knife—I did not see it, but I felt him stab me in my arm—he made no observation at the time, that I heard—I ran out of the room, went down stairs, and got away—I did not hear him speak—my recollection is not more faint now than it was before the Magistrate—he said nothing after he stabbed me—there was nothing said in the house at the time about my life—I do not know what was said out of the house, for the prisoner and the policeman walked on together—my son was in the room, and struck the prisoner's arm—I cannot say in what position the prisoner's hand was then,</p>

I am a son of the prisoner and prosecutrix, and live in the house—the prisoner was out all the Wednesday—he came home about ten o'clock next morning, and went out again almost immediately—I did not see him follow my mother at that time, he went down stairs after her about half an hour after that—he came back in the first instance, and spoke to me—my mother returned up stairs shortly before twelve o'clock—she came into the room, my father went behind her, and stabbed her with a knife in the arm—he had been quiet for a short time previous to that—the knife had been lying open on the table—this produced is it—he usually carried it with him—there was a table in the room, my mother went behind it, and he followed her, and struck at her a back-handed blow with the knife in his right hand—I cannot say what part he aimed at, it took effect on the left arm—I rushed forward and struck his arm as he was in the act of striking—I cannot be certain whether that diverted the blow from the direction it would otherwise have taken—I believe it is the opinion of the surgeon that the blow was struck very closely indeed to the heart—he struck from behind—I do not think he introduced his arm so as to strike before her—he made no observation at the time, but followed her down stairs after he had stabbed her—he then said he wished it had gone to her heart—about half an hour previous to the transaction, he said the flesh was drunk, but the spirit was not—my mother had not been in the room above a minute, when he followed her be<lb/>hind the table—he had been apparently quiet perhaps about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before she came up—I had heard him use expressions of resentment on other occasions—he has said that when he was in that state of mind he could not be accountable for the consequences, and he could not tell what the consequences would be.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, High-street, Newington. On the 3rd of June the constable brought Mr. Brock to my surgery about noon—I examined her left arm—there was a triangular wound through the muscles at the back part of the bone—it appeared to have been done by an instrument thrust through—there was one wound above, and one underneath the arm—the cut was continued downwards towards the elbow, almost forming a flap—if it had been continued a little longer the flesh would have been quiet disengaged from below—it did not appear to be made with the same blow, at the same time—there was a stab, and then an extension of the cut, as of a second action of the hand—it might have been done in drawing the knife out, because above the length was two inches, and below, where the knife had passed through, an inch and a quarter—the blow was behind the done—it passed through the muscles—it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140216"/>
               <p>went down to the bone—it was through the thickness of the arm—upwards of an inch and a half of the knife went in—the knife produced probably would cause the wound—it is beveled on both sides, which formed the triangle—it was not of a dangerous character—if it had passed in front of the bone it might have been so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How near the position of the heart was the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was in a true line between the fourth and eighth rib.</p>
