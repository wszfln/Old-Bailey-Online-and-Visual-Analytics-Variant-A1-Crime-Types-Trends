                  </hi>. I reside at No. 5, Clement's-inn, Strand. I am connected with the newspaper press—Mrs. Arnett, the mother of the prisoner Arnett, was the person who ordinarily did the domestic duties of my chambers—she is the wife of the principal porter of the inn—I usually took my tea at chambers, about 7 o'clock—on 28th March, I was in cham<lb/>bers during the whole or greater part of the day—I dined at chambers that day—I saw Arnett during that afternoon—I told her I should not want the tea things laid, as I was going out—I went out at 9 o'clock tliat even<lb/>ing—I left in a pocket book a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, any a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and a purse con<lb/>taining six or eight sovereigns, in a small drawer of a chest of drawers in</p>

               <p>my bedroom; that drawer was locked—I had the key in my pocket, on a bunch—on my going out of the inn that evening, I saw Arnett standing at the door of her father's lodge—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I know the number of it—I returned to chambers between 12 and 1 o'clock, nearly 1 o'clock, I believe; as I came into the inn, an intimation was made to me as to a robbery at my chambers—I found both the outer and inner doors shut—on going into the sitting room, I found every thing as I had left it; the dinner things were still on the table, nothing appeared to have been dis<lb/>turbed—I then went into the bedroom, and found the drawer which I had left locked, standing open—there was no light in the room—I afterwards found a small mark on the lock, I believe it had been forced open—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was still left in the pocket book, the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was gone—Mrs. Arnett, the prisoner's mother, had been absent from the inn for some time previously to the robbery, and she was still absent at that time—during her absence the domestic offices at my chambers were usually performed by a charwoman in her employment, and in the evening the prisoner Arnett usually came in—there were duplicate keys of my doors—I had one key for each door, and the others were kept at the lodge—I have seen Foreman at the inn; I do not think she had been there for about three months before this—when she was there, she was there in the capacity of a domestic servant to Arnett, the head porter.</p>

In consequence of information, about the end of March last, I took measures to stop the payment of this 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note at the bank of England, and afterwards saw Foreman on her arrival from the country, having made a previous intimation to her family—I took her to Miss Baines, who said, in her hearing, "That is the person who changed the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—Foreman said, "Miss Baines, I did not do it; I never saw a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—I then took her to Mr. Holdsworth's cham<lb/>bers, told her that I was a policeman, and that she must consider herself in custody for stealing a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—she said that about April last, a young person named Betsy Arnett brought her a parcel, sealed up in five different places with black wax, containing a brooch given to her by a young French-man in the Temple-gardens, and asked her to mind it for her, as her mother would not let her wear it; and that about three weeks afterwards, as she was dressing for church one Sunday morning, she missed the parcel, and immediately communicated the loss to Miss Arnett, and when she came she appeared very much grieved at the loss, saying that it contained a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; that they afterwards went to a charwoman in Brydges-street, Covent-garden, where they mentioned the loss of the parcel—in consequence of that state<lb/>ment, I went to Arnett's parents, but did not see her—in a few days she returned to town, and I saw her, and asked her if she knew Foreman—she said that she did—I asked her if she ever gave her a parcel—she said that she had not—I asked her if she had ever been to a charwoman in Brydges-street—she said that she had—I asked her for what—she said to have her fortune told—I asked her if she had mentioned to the person in Brydges-street about the loss of the parcel—sue said that she had not—I asked her if she did not tell her what the parcel contained—she said that she did not—after taking Foreman into custody, I took her to the porter's lodge in Clement's-inn, and confronted her with Arnett—I stated to Arnett sub<lb/>stantially that which Foreman had told me, and she said, "Oh! Emma, how can you say so?"—Foreman said, "You know, Betsy, you brought me a parcel"—I do not remember what Arnett said, but she denied it—Fore<lb/>man said, "You know you went with me to Mrs. Dent's, and mentioned about the loss of the note"—Arnett said, "Oh! Emma, how can you say such a thing?"—she denied the statement altogether—I afterwards put myself in communication with Mrs. Dent—I was present at the police court when this charge was being inquired into before the Magistrate, and heard Mrs. Dent examined; Foreman was then present at the bar—I saw Alice Dent sign this deposition (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I remember it, because she signed</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Ballance and Co., silk manu<lb/>facturers, of No. 37, Steward-street, Spitalfields. They have warehouses com<lb/>municating with the dwelling house in which I live with my family—on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185611240010"/>
               <p>29th Sept., I shut up the warehouse and left it all safe, about half past 10 o'clock, when I went to bed—my son was out—about 4 o'clock I was aroused by my son ringing the bell; and at the same time I heard a rumbling, rattling noise, as though it was a rattling of tiles, at the back—it sounded as if it was in the yard adjoining—I went down and let my son in; I then unbarred the middle door, and looked into the yard, and there I saw three bags containing a quantity of silk and goods, the property of my employers, worth upwards of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the bags were in the yard close by the window—those goods had been all safe the previous evening—I found that a panel of the shutters had been cut, and an entrance made through from the yard into the warehouse—there was no other door or window open—they had apparently gone in and out the same way—the place where the bags were lying, was about a yard or two from where I heard the tiles rattling; it is a very narrow yard altogether—a passage runs along there, leading up to the wall where the parties had come over; there was a rope ladder there—I have not seen the place where the prisoners were found, I know where it is—the rope ladder was placed against the warehouse staircase window, fixed round one of the iron bars—they could get from the yard on to the tiles by means of the rope ladder—there was no other way for them to get, but into the yard, where they were taken—the yard where they were taken is about ten yards from, our wall, where I found the bags—I told my son to call the police immediately.</p>

RIBTON</hi> (<hi rend="italic">for Hawthorn</hi>). <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the warehouse in the rear of the private house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; one warehouse faces into Steward-street, the other is a back warehouse—they are both on the ground floor, they lead into each other; the house next to the front warehouse is now empty—it was a Utrecht Company, for printing, or something; they have left about a fortnight—there is no communication between that house and the warehouse—the house on the other side is a bottle warehouse—my apartments are over the warehouse—the front entrance is by a street door, and there is a regular window which has shutters, which were barred inside—there is a room called a weavers' room; no one works there, it is a room where weavers wait to be served; the entrance to that room is in Duke-street; it is on one side of the yard, it is separated from the yard by a wooden partition, about ten feet high, covered in with glass at the top—on the other side of the yard is a narrow passage leading into the street, and right through both warehouses from back to front—that passage is divided by doors—the yard is about four yards long, and about a yard and a half wide the passage is separated from the yard by doors and windows; and then you could not get out into Duke-street without unbarring a heavy door—at the end of the yard is a kitchen; that does not lead in to the back ware-house—it was quite plain how the entrance had been effected, by the rope ladder; it could not have been effected by Duke-street, the doors were all secure; I examined them when I went to bed that night, and also when I came down at 4 o'clock, after the prisoners were taken, and I found all the doors safe—the bottle warehouse is at the comer of Artillery-street—the back premises of the Tower public house do not quite adjoin our back premises, they are contiguous—the noise of the tiles that I heard was on a shed at the back—they are all sheds and closets about there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, A</hi> 411). About a quarter to 4 o'clock, I heard a call of "Police!" went to the prosecutor's premises, and found that an entrance had been effected through the back by cutting the shutter—I found a bag in the yard—I went round into Artillery-street, listened, and heard a noise at the back of No. 17—I sprang my rattle: City police<lb/>man 622, came up, knocked at the door, got admission, and got into the back yard, and on to a water closet—I assisted him to get up, another party assisted me up, and I saw the prisoners standing together in No. 18 yard—Lusette exclaimed, "Here we are, we will not resist"—No. 17 is at the back of the prosecutor's premises, and No. 18 is the adjoining yard—a rope ladder was extended from the first floor window, which I saw, and there would be no difficulty in a person getting by it to the yard in two minutes—Lusette said, "There are three more in the <hi rend="italic">mess</hi>"—in the bag were two <hi rend="italic">jemmies</hi>, a jack bit, a screwdriver, and a gimblet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—No. 17 and No. 18 were both locked outside, front and back—there was a person inside who lived at No. 17, and a person partly dressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you knock at No. 17? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a very short time before I was let in—a number of females live there—I saw a lodger outside No. 17—I cannot say whether he opened the door—I do not know who he was; I should know him again—the landlord was inside, partly dressed—No. 2, Duke-street is open all night—I do not think it is a brothel, or a lodging house; I do not know much of that neighbourhood—there is a sort of wash house, or yard—you can get into Messrs. Ballance's premises from there by getting through a skylight, and back the same way—No. 18 is a shop where they make sealing wax—I do not know whether the persons reside there—I do not think there was anybody there that night, because there was a padlock on the front door—the yard where I found the prisoners adjoins the Tower public house, separated from it by a wall twelve feet high—when I first went into Messrs. Ballance a back yard, the rope ladder was extended from the staircase window down into the yard—I do not think any persons who were in the yard could get into the wash house without using the rope ladder; they could stand on the top of the wash house, and tie the ladder to the staircase window, and with it's assistance could get in at the staircase window without going down into the yard—they made their entry on the ground floor—whoever made an entry made it from the yard—they had only to step off the rope ladder into the wash house—the water closet is the roof adjoining; you could get from one to the other—we found marks of violence from the skylight on to the tiles, which made us imagine that the entrance was effected by means of the empty house in Duke-street.</p>

               <p>made their escape there was a large hole broken through the lath and plaster of the wash house into No. 17 yard, and then we could see that somebody had been trying to scramble back into the wash house again—that was eight or nine yards from where I found them.</p>

I had assorted goods to take out, and placed them on the warehouse floor—it was the prisoner's duty to take the goods which I had assorted, and place them in the <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>, and when he had done so, it was customary for him to come in and say he was ready, and then I would go out to him—on this occasion I did not wait for his coming in to me, but went down to my <hi rend="italic">trap</hi> sooner than I usually did—when I got round the corner in sight of the <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>, I observed that the prisoner was doing something underneath the footboard; before I had time to reach the <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>, he held his head up pretty sharply, and saw me</p>

               <p>approaching—he then jumped into the <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>, to put the goods which he had into the body of the trap, and then went into the warehouse for more goods—while he was absent I examined the <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>, to see what he had been doing under the footboard, and in the boot I found these four boxes, each containing a dozen neck ties—two are worth 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and two 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I took the boxes into the warehouse—the prisoner had no right to place them there—there was plenty of space in the body of the <hi rend="italic">trap</hi> for more goods than were in it—after this he accompanied me as usual with the <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>—I asked him why he had put those goods in there—he made some obser<lb/>vations which I did not clearly understand, and I said, "You have no right to put them there, Sir;" indeed, I believe I called him a d—fool for doing so, I was much enraged at it—he said, "I was not going to do any<lb/>thing with them"—I went out, and returned as usual—those four boxes did not form any part of the goods that I was to take out with me that morning.</p>

Q.</hi> How long has the prisoner been working in that department? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four months, I think; up to this time he has borne the character of an industrious honest roan—I have heard that he was employed for many years in the Post-office, and subsequently in the London Docks, under the War Department—thousands of these pistols were sent away to the Crimea during the late war—I am not aware that a large quantity of arms returned were sold at Liverpool, by authority of the Government—it is doubtless the fact, that large numbers of these pistols went to the Crimea, and were lost, with other things, after being landed—I cannot say that I ever saw this pistol until it was produced from the pawn<lb/>broker's, having a large quantity under my charge—I know that a pistol bearing this number was supplied to us by Colonel Colt, in Oct., 1855—this paper which I am looking at is not in my writing; I do not wish to refer to it—I was not in that department in Oct.—it does not appear to have been used.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal foreman of the War Department of the Tower of London. The prisoner has been employed there twelve or thirteen months; the labourers, of whom he was one, leave work at 4 o'clock precisely; and, as they leave, they undergo a search by two constables—on 4th Nov., I gave the prisoner his ticket about ten minutes before, at his request, imagining that as he had been engaged the previous evening by Lord Kingston, that he was anxious to get to his Lordship that evening, as he applied earlier than the proper time, rather than wait for his number to be called, which was very low down the list—I cannot say whether he was searched or not.</p>

I have known the prisoner twenty years, or more; I was never particularly acquainted with him, more than "How do you do?" but I knew that he lived with Mr. Bryant, the job and postmas<lb/>ter, in Oxford-street—on 13th Oct. last I met him in Queen-street, Edgware-road, a little before 6 o'clock in the evening—he asked me how I was, and said he had not seen me for some time, and he would give me something to drink, but he had nothing but a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and asked where he could get it changed—I said he was very lucky to have such a thing, and there was Mr. Sculls' public house, where he could very likely get it changed—he said, would I get change for it, for he was not known—he took this note out from under his coat, and said he had it given to him by a gentleman for whom he had sold a horse—he gave the note into my hand, and we went into Mr. Sculls' public house—I asked Jones, the barman, if he could change it—he said he would try—I gave the note into his hands—he asked my name and address—I told him, and he wrote it on the front of the note—he then went into the bar parlour, came back, and said he could not change it—he gave it back to me—I gave it to the prisoner, and we went out—he put the note in his pocket—he said, "Don't you know anywhere else where you could get it changed?"—I said, "I know two or three houses here, but they don't know much of me," and walked on—we afterwards went to the</p>

                  </hi>. I am no relation of the deceased; I live in Dove<lb/>row, Goldsmith's-row. About a quarter past 12 o'clock, on Monday night, 30th Oct., I was at the King's Arms public house, near Kingsland-gate, with Ann Hayes, the deceased James Taylor, and Jane Jenner—we all went into the tap room—I was afterwards standing at the public house door—the prisoner came up to me, and asked me if I was the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> that had had the scratched face a few weeks ago—I said, "Yes;" and he asked me if it did not serve me right—I said, "No"—at that time the deceased and Hayes came up—the prisoner asked what they wanted—the deceased, said, "This is my niece, and whilst I have a pair of hands I will protect her"—nothing occurred to render his saying that necessary—I do not know what he was to protect her against—the prisoner up with his hand, and fetched him a smack over the head with his open hand—it was a very hard blow—this was inside the house, against the tap room door—the deceased went outside the house and the prisoner followed him—I went back towards the bar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married to Samuel Hayes, but do not live with him. I live along with my aunt, Mrs. Jenner, in Goldsmith's-row, Hackney-road—she lived with Mr. Taylor, the deceased; he was my uncle—on 30th Oct. my uncle, Mrs. Jenner, and I were at the King's Arms, in the Kings-land-road—we had something to drink there—my uncle was rather the worse for liquor, and so was Mrs. Jenner—I was sober—as I came out of the tap room, I saw the prisoner standing in the passage, talking to Joseph Taylor—I went and stood against the street door—my uncle came out of the tap room, and stood against me, and the prisoner asked him what he wanted—he said, "I don't want anything"—the prisoner directly up with his hand, and hit him underneath his ear—my uncle made answer, and said, "All right," and passed through the passage, and out at the street door—the prisoner followed him, and struck him again, and knocked him off the kerb, and he fell down, and the prisoner took and kicked him twice when he was down; once at the back of the head, and once in the back—my uncle had a cap on—I said to the prisoner, "Don't hit my uncle again, nor yet kick him again;" and he directly made answer that he would serve me the same—he knocked me up against the stone place—I went away to fetch my aunt from the tap room—she came out with me, and she ran and took the prisoner by the handkerchief, and he ran away—I asked a man who was coming past to help me lift up my uncle, which he did, on to the path</p>

               <p>—he was not able to stand—he said, "Oh! my neck and my legs are broke"—a policeman came up—he examined his legs, and found they were not broken—the policeman helped to put him on the man's back, and he carried him on his back to Mrs. Brown's, and put him on the stairs—Mrs. Brown was not at home, and I went to seek for her—when I came back, my uncle was lying in the yard, just outside the door step, not far from where I had left him—I had left the man with him, and found him there with him when I returned—my uncle was then taken round to Mr. Lam<lb/>bert's on the same man's back—I did not go there with him—it was some-where about fifty yards from Mrs. Brown's—my uncle did not fall off the man's back at all—the man put my uncle's arms round his neck, and carried him <hi rend="italic">pick-a-back</hi>—I went to look for Mrs. Brown again, and returned in about ten minutes, and then my uncle was being carried back again to Mrs. Brown's, on the man's back—he was put on Mrs. Brown's bed—I remained with him—he kept complaining of his neck and legs, and said they were broken—a doctor was sent for three times, but he would not come—about 7 o'clock in the morning we took him away in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and took him to his own house—I was with him, and Mr. Brown, and my aunt—I cannot tell how far it was; we paid half a crown for the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—they got him up stairs, and laid him on the bed—he kept complaining that his neck and legs were broken—I remained with him all the time—my aunt went and fetched Mr. Welch, the surgeon, and he came directly, about 9 o'clock—he gave my uncle medicine, and applied mustard poultices to his heart—he died on the Thursday morning as this happened on the Monday—he was very bad indeed all the time and insensible, until about 12 o'clock on the Tuesday night—he was sensible when he died.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived with the deceased as his wife for nearly five years—I was with him on the night in question—I did not see the beginning of the transaction, I only saw the prisoner kick him when he was outside—he kicked him at the back of the neck—my husband was then in the road, on his back—I ran across to assist him, and laid hold of the prisoner's hand<lb/>kerchief—he said, "You b—w—if you don't loose me, I will serve you the same"—I said, "Why are you ill-using my master?"—I held him tight, we struggled, and fell both together, and he dragged me with him about two yards, and gave me a tremendous blow on my arm—I afterwards saw my husband taken by a man to Mrs. Brown's; he had no fall as he was being taken—I saw him on the stairs there—a man carried him from the stairs on his back, and sat him down in the yard; they did not throw him down; he could not keep on the stairs, his arms and legs were so stiff—he never moved hand or foot after he was kicked—he was taken to Mr. Lambert's, and back again to Mrs. Brown's, and laid upon her bed—he had no fall in going from one place to the other—I had been having a little to drink that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Hackney. I was called in to attend the deceased on Tuesday morning, at 9 o'clock—I found him dressed, lying on his back perfectly paralyzed, and the surface of the body completely cold; there was no action of the heart—he was unconscious—I directed mustard poultices and warm applications—he died at 1 o'clock on the Thursday morning—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—there was a large clot of blood surrounding the upper part of the spinal cord, and compressing it—that was the immediate cause of death—there was also extravasation of blood at the base of the brain—the deep seated muscles at the back of the neck were very much bruised, and blood effused between their fibres—violent kicks would produce such injuries to the head as I saw—the imme<lb/>diate effect of the injury to the spinal cord would be paralysis, and in severe cases death might ensue—the party would feel severe pain at the seat of injury, but not below it—it would prevent his moving his limbs—the upper and lower extremities were perfectly paralyzed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose the injuries you saw might have been caused by a fall, or a series of falls? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not believe a fall could have produced them, inasmuch as the deep seated muscles at the back of the neck were bruised—I cannot imagine that a fall could produce it—if a fall had produced injury to account for the paralysis, I should have expected to have found that the body of one of the vertebrae was broken, that he had really broken his neck; whereas the bones were perfectly sound—I do not</p>

               <p>mean that it must necessarily follow that the bone must be broken by a fall, but I think a fall could not have produced the extensive mischief with<lb/>out breaking the bone—I speak as positively as a medical opinion can be given, that it could not have been caused by a fall—I am a member of the College of Surgeons—I have practised since 1850—I was dresser at the London Hospital for two years—I have seen a great many injuries of the spine, but injuries of this description are extremely rare—I have seen very few of them—injuries to the upper part of the spine, without the bones being broken, are excessively rare—a kick might have done it—I have never seen an injury precisely similar to this before—a person under the influence of liquor would be more liable to receive serious injury from any local violence applied to him.</p>

Fewtell, Halton, Hants"—it laid on the counter to be taken out by the book carrier—I did not see it taken away, but I miased it—before I missed it the book carrier called my attention—in about three minutes after I saw it on the counter—I went outside, and saw Harvey in custody of-two policemen, coming in a direction to the Cross Keys—I accused him of stealing a parcel from our premises—he made no reply with reference to the parcel, but said he would mark me and do for me, and he swore violently—I saw Brown, and in consequence of what I heard I gave him into custody—I had seen both the prisoners before about the premises.</p>

I saw the two pri<lb/>soners there on the evening of 12th Nov.—I recollect the time that Harvey was given into custody, it was about a quarter before 6 o'clock—I had seen the two prisoners for full an hour before, walking up and down—I saw them the best part of the time, as I had to come out of the office to see things placed in the vans, and I warned the policeman—I had seen them walking up and down on the preceding evening—on this evening I was calling the parcels over to go by the different railways—the office got crowded—I observed Harvey—he put his hand in his pocket, and asked me some questions—I referred him to the other end of the office—I heard Sherlock say, "Leave my parcels alone," and then he called out, and Mr. Underdown called, "Stop thief!"—I did not see this parcel on the counter, because my back was turned to it—as soon as I heard the cry I ran out, and I saw Brown walking round the mob that was collected outside round the man that was taken—I saw Harvey in custody of the policeman—Brown was four or five yards from him, at the corner of Goldsmith-street, with his hands in his pockets—I did not see the parcel before I saw it at the Man<lb/>sion House—when I saw Brown a few yards off, I said to the policeman, "You had better take this man into custody, he has been with him all the evening"—Brown must have heard it—he said he knew nothing at all of the man, he was merely walking up and down—I had seen them walking up and down on the evening before, for I dare say half an hour or three quar<lb/>ters, watching about—I saw them talking—I could not hear their conver<lb/>sation</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Brown, a draper, in Whitechapel. On Monday night, 10th Nov., Cannell, and two other women came into the shop, and they asked for, cloth for a mantle—I showed them some grey, and some black—Cannell said she should like a darker grey, because her brother-in-law was dead; and after showing a great many pieces she had a yard and a half cut off, and took me to the other side of the shop to look at some buttons—she detained me there; and while I was there the other two women went to the other side, and returned again—when I had finished, the Other two women had gone out, and Cannell paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. off the parcel, and she left, saying she would call for the parcel at 10 o'clock the next morning—she did not call the next morning—the other two women had left the shop two or three minutes before Cannell—they had come in together—about an hour after Cannell left, I missed about twenty yards of black cloth—not a piece which I had been showing them, but it was on the counter at the same time—at tea time on Tuesday, the following day, a piece of grey cloth was missed—I believe this cloth produced is my master's—I believe these different pieces to be the whole of the piece of black, and this to be the grey—there is no piece here so small as to be the piece I sold—these are worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I live at No. 2 1/2, Fieldgate-street, Whitechapel, where Mrs. Cannell lives, and keeps a beer shop; she takes in lodgers. On Monday night, 10th Nov., I was in Thrawl-street, Spital-fields, about 8 o'clock—I had nothing with me—I had been to Mr. Clarke, in Thrawl-street, to tell Mr. Cannell that he was wanted—I went there again in twenty minutes, or half an hour afterwards—I had a bundle with me the second time—I do not know what was in it—Mrs. Cannell gave it to me to take to Mr. Clarke, in Thrawl-street; as I was going along the policeman stopped me—I went back to Mrs. Cannel's with a policeman—Mrs. Cannell was at home when I got back, and the two boys, Lott and Aspen, were at home, upstairs—they were lodgers there, and slept in the first floor back room—they slept in the same room—I do not know whether they slept in the same bed—when I got back one policeman was in the house, and one went back with me—the policeman asked Mrs. Cannell if she had sent the bundle out; she said, "No," at first—I told her she gave me the bundle to take to Mr. Clarke, in Thrawl-street, and she said, Yes, she did—she said that two young women brought it, and she gave me the bundle to take out—the policeman took me up stairs—we all went up stairs together—the policeman went into the room where the two boys were—I was not in the room when any cloth was found—I was in the room when the policeman said he had found two pieces of cloth—he brought the two pieces out of the front room into the back room where we all were.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Ashley Adam Clifford, a grocer, of No. 5, London-terrace, Hackney-road. On Wednesday, 5th Nov., I got into an omnibus at Shoreditch to go to London-bridge—I sat on the left hand side, in the middle—there was no one above me, two or three gentle<lb/>men were below me, nearer to the door, on each side—the prisoners got in near the Eastern Counties Railway—Reynolds sat opposite me, and I made room for Hasletine to pass; she wished to sit on my right side, and I went to the top of the omnibus—I do not think they spoke together, and I did not notice that they were acquainted—Reynolds had a check shawl folded over her arm—when we were near Camomile-street one of the horses stumbled, and the omnibus was brought to a stand—I looked through the small window in front, which was on my left, to see what was the matter, and on turning round Hasletine was much nearer to me than she was before; not uncomfortably close, but there had been space for two people between us before—the omnibus went on almost directly—the prisoners got out at Cornhill—the conductor then beckoned me from the top of the omni<lb/>bus, and in consequence of what he said to me, I felt in my pocket, and missed my purse, containing 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; but I did not know how much there. was till it was counted at the station—this is my purse (<hi rend="italic">produeed</hi>)—it was safe when I left home, and I had not had occasion to use it once—the conductor went after the prisoners, and I remained in the omnibus till he came back—I then followed a beadle, who had the prisoners in custody, to the station house, where I identified my purse.</p>

I was conductor of this omnibus on 5th Nov.—Mrs. Clifford was in it—one of the horses stumbled, and I got off the monkey board to assist the coachman, as was my duty—as I was in the act of getting down, I saw Hasletine close to Mrs. Clifford, with her mantle thrown over her hip—I thought it was rather close to be comfortable, considering that the omnibus was not full, and my suspicions were aroused—I had seen the prisoners get in one after the other; they came up to the omnibus at the same time, between Shoreditch Church and Hackney—they got out at the corner of Cornhill—the fare is 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each person, and Reynolds paid me a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, which I concluded was for the two, and let the other pass with<lb/>out payment, as they had both got in together—directly they got off the step, I said to Mrs. Clifford, "Have you lost anything?"—she felt in her pocket, and said, "Oh! dear, yes, and I shall not be able to pay my fare"—I caught sight of the prisoners' cloaks going round Leadenhall-street—I went through the market, and saw them together close to the pump, touched them on the shoulders, and said, "You have been robbing a lady in my <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>"—I took hold of one of them, and the other swung herself away, and walked towards the pump again—I am sure of their being the persons—Hasletine said, "Let us go, do not expose us"—I said, "I must give you in charge of a policeman"—I did so, and returned to the omnibus, and informed Mrs. Clifford.</p>

On this morning, at 6 o'clock, I went to work in front of Mr. Edmiston's shop, and at about 10 minutes past 6 o'clock saw the pri<lb/>soners come out, Philby Fish first, Herbert next, and then Roberts, who carried a bundle—I had not known them before; I am sure they are the men—I identified them at the station from among a number of constables in plain clothes—they were not two yards from me—it was light.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the men come out quickly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Philby Fish came out first, and returned back again to shut the door, which he left ajar; the others were then about a couple of yards from him, going towards Temple Bar—I was then only two yards from him, from the kerb to the street door—I did not say anything to them—I was taking one of the kerb stones which was worn out, and was going to refaoe it—I kept looking at them—I did not go on with my work for ten minutes—I told a couple of my mates of it—I saw Fish on the Monday following, and Roberts on the Thursday—M'Kenzie is the constable I informed; he is not here—a private constable came for me at night to my house; he said that the third man was in custody, and could I go and identify him—I went the same night—there were about four mixed up with him, and he made five—the inspector in the office told me to look and see if I knew anybody there, and I put my hand on Roberta's shoulder—I have had no money from the police—the prisoners were out of sight when I spoke to my mates—I was near the Adelphi—I could see them a long way up the Strand, beyond Southampton-street—I did not go to my mates, they were fifty yards off; some of them came up to me; if they had not, I should not have told them till breakfast time—if I thought the prisoners had committed a burglary,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185611240051"/>
               <p>I could have apprehended them, but I thought they were some of the shop<lb/>men come out of the place, or some one belonging to the premises—what drew my attention to them was this: on the day before, when I wads dress<lb/>ing a stone, the shopboy came out and began to beat a mat close to my face, and I thought I was going to have the same again—I have only seen Checkley once since the prisoners were committed, nor yet any of the other officers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Edmiston. On the evening of 17th Oct. I closed the shop, and all the fastenings were safe—at 25 minutes past 7 o'clock in the morning, I received information, and on entering the place I saw a great pile of goods in the passage; I could scarcely enter the door—one of the side shutters was taken down bodily, with three bolts in it, and left in the passage—the door of the dwelling house passage had been forced open; the skylight on the leads was broken into, and forcibly wrenched back, with the bare all taken out—the house had been entered by the back door—they had broken open the sash and two windows, and had drawn the bolts of the side sash which leads on to the leads.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, Chapel-street, Oxford-street. I am a porter at a milliner's, at No. 257, Regent-street, in the Circus—I am twenty-three years of age—on the night of 20th, Oct, I was passing along Parliament-street, on my business; I was going in a direction from West-minster-bridge towards Charing-cross, going through Parliament-street, on the same side as Mr. Berry's shop—it was about half past 9 o'clock—as I was passing Mr. Berry's shop my attention was attracted by hearing a groaning from the interior of the shop; it was a groan that you would hear from a man that had been struck down, as if from a person suffering—I looked towards the shop, and saw three men outside the shop; they were close to the door, apparently looking into the shop—the door of the shop was open about an inch, on one side—one side was fastened, and one side was open about an inch—that was the right hand side as I looked in, the side next to Westminster-bridge—that would enable a person looking through that opening to see the counter—the door opens inside—the men were looking through that aperture; the shutters were up of both windows, and also the shutters to the door—I did not at first look in at the opening—I spoke to the men, and said, "What is that?"—they answered that it was a man and his wife quarrelling, and I walked on a little distance, about six yards; I had not got so far as the mews belonging to the houses in Richmond-terrace—I then returned, not feeling satisfied with the answer I had received from the men—I went up to the door—the three men were still there, outside the door—the door was still ajar; I went and pushed it open wider—I then saw Robert Marley.</p>

               <p>his hand, and was striking with it—I could see who it was be struck—he was striking a man who I believe was named Richard Cope; he way crouched down behind the counter—I could see what part of his person he struck, on the left side of his head; he had no hat, or any covering on his head—I saw him strike three or four times—I then turned round and asked the persons that were passing by for assistance—I mean the persons passing to and fro.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What had then become of the three persons that were looking in at the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I turned round to ask for assistance, they were gone from the shop door; I called to the ordinary passengers that were going by.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Q.</hi> When you spoke to the men outside, was not the answer given, "I suppose it is only a man beating his wife?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he said it was only a man beating his wife—there was only one of the doors open; the one nearest Westminster-bridge; it was open about an inch—I could distinctly see the counter through the aperture, the counter on the left hand side of the shop; not the first time: I could not see anything that was going on inside the shop until I went back—I did not look in the first time, I only stopped—the parcel that the man had, I should say, was about a foot long, and about three quarters of a foot wide, according to the way he carried it—I cannot state the colour of it; it was not a very bulky par<lb/>cel, it appeared to be about three or four inches thick, not more—I did not notice other persons pursuing until I began to halloo; there were several persons walking behind me—the man had got about six or eight yards from the shop when I began to follow him; before he got to Gannon-row the dis<lb/>tance between us had increased a little—he walked faster than I did—at the time he turned the corner of Derby-street, I did not notice other per<lb/>sons joining in the pursuit; Derby-street is a very narrow street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, living in Liverpool-street, King's-cross. On the night of 20th Oct, I was passing along Parliament-street, about twenty-five minutes past 9 o'clock, I was coming towards Charing-cross from Westminster-bridge, on the same side as Mr. Berry's shop—as I passed the shop, my attention was attracted by several persons standing outside, there might be five or six, or there might be more, I did not count them—the door of the shop was about three or four inches open, the side nearest the bridge—I did not hear any noise—I did not go up to the door—I stood on the pavement, and saw a man inside, in the act of striking—I could see that from the pavement—he was standing against the counter, he appeared to be striking in a direction just at the end of the counter—he had his arm lifted up, and was striking over the counter—I did not see what he was striking at—I remained standing in the same position, on the pavement—I then saw the man take up a parcel and put a cigar in his mouth, and come out—he took the parcel from the floor, from the front of the counter—I could not see the face of the man so as to recognise him again—when he came but, he pulled the door to after him, and walked away towards Derby-street—I followed him—I did not look into the shop before I followed him—the door went open again—I then saw a man lying on the floor, bleeding from the head—I then went in pursuit of the man that had come out of the shop—he had not then turned the corner of Derby-street—I saw him turn down Derby-street—I followed him down the street—I was from fifteen to twenty yards behind him as he was going down Derby-street—he was carrying a parcel in his hand—I had seen him bring a parcel out of the shop—he was walking when he went down Derby-street—he turned to the right, into Cannon-row—I followed him—as soon as he found that he was pursued he started running—I did not observe him look round—I ran after him—he crossed Bridge-street, and through a court into Palace-yard—I followed him until he was stopped by the waterman in Palace-yard—I was about ten yards behind him when he was stopped—I had only lost sight of him in turning the corner into Palace-yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Wokingham, in Berkshire—I am out of a situation now—I have been endeavouring to procure one—I was going past Mr. Berry's shop in Parliament-street on the night this happened—my attention was attracted by a faint cry of "Murder!" from inside the shop—it was about half-past 9 o'clock—there were some persons about the door at that time—it was partly open, so that I could see into the shop—I could not see the counter—I was coming towards the House of Lords from Charing-cross—I stopped and looked in at the opening of the door—I had just got opposite to the door—I remained on the level pavement—I turned round and looked into the shop—one of the doors was partially open—I think it was the left-hand door—it opened towards the inside—I was rather past the door—I saw into the shop, and saw the prisoner—he was striking some one—I caught a glimpse of the other person—he was stand<lb/>ing either at the end of the counter or behind it, I think at the end, where the flap is—I did not notice whether that was the person whom the prisoner was striking—the prisoner had something in his hand that he was striking with—I could not see what it was—he had something.</p>

I was on duty there, at the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stand, on the night of 20th Oct.—about half past 9 o'clock on that night my attention was drawn by some persons running and calling—I was then between the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> on the stand in Palace-yard—my attention was called by a mob of persons calling out, "Stop him! stop him!" and I saw the prisoner running, by himself, from the direction of the Hone Shoe and Magpie-passage, leading into Palace-yard—that is a foot passage that comes from Bridge-street into Palace-yard—I saw the prisoner running from there—he was at the head of the whole of the people—the next person to him was, I should say, somewhere about fifteen or twenty yards off; that was Lerigo; he was calling out, 'Stop him! stop him!"—the prisoner was running in the direction of George Canning's statue, turning round by the iron railings leading round by St. Margaret's Churchyard—I ran after him, and overtook him—I was the first person that came up with him—I caught him outside the railing, just before he was crossing the road, on the pavement, on the same side as New Palace-yard is—Lerigo came up immediately after I had stopped him—he said, "Oh, sir, for God's sake, don't let the man go! don't let him go, for he has nearly murdered a man!"—I said, "Where is the man?"—he said, "Oh, I will show you, sir! I will show you!"—he could not tell me where the man was, he was so exhausted with running after the prisoner—I</p>

               <p>I told him to lead on, and I would follow him with the prisoner—I took him with Lerigo to the place in question, in Parliament-street—I saw the deceased, Richard Cope, in the hands of two policemen—he was bleeding; he was outside the shop; the shop was shut up, and the door was shut, and that was what took my attention, the deceased being my own brother-in-law—I married his sister.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you first saw the prisoner running in Palace-yard, did you see whether he had anything in his hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had a lighted cigar in his left hand, but nothing in his right hand—I did not see him do anything just before I took him, for my attention was particularly directed to stop<lb/>ping the man—I did not notice what he had in his hand, or anything of the kind, because I seized hold of him from behind—I did not see anything picked up.</p>

I saw the deceased on the night of 20th Oct, when he was brought to the hospital—on that night he was attended more especially by Mr. Legge—I made myself thoroughly acquainted with the case immediately after he was admitted—he had a depressed compound fracture of the skull on the left side—there were two other small contused wounds of the scalp, and paralysis of the right side—that would arise from the depressed compound fracture, it comes on the opposite side to the wound—he appeared perfectly conscious when he was brought in—he was not able to speak—he had not recovered his speech on the following day—on the afternoon, of that day I sent for Mr. Holt, the senior surgeon—I was present when Mr. Holt operated on the deceased—the operation consisted in, first of all, removing a small portion of the skull, so that he might by that means be able to get an elevator between the depressed portion, and then raise it from the brain—that afforded immediate relief to the deceased, by his own affirmation, by means of a nod—that was done to relieve the paralysis—I continued to attend the deceased from that time until bis death, on 9th Nov., under the superintendence of the senior surgeon, Mr. Holt—on 6th Nov. an unfavour<lb/>able change took place in the state of the deceased; it was a fit of shivering—he gradually sunk from that time—after his death a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exami<lb/>nation was performed by myself, under the supervision of Mr. Holt—on removing the scalp, the bone was extensively denuded of its covering, the peritoneum—the peritoneum is a thin, fibrous membrane which covers the bone, and conveys the vessels to it; it is under the scalp, but on the outside of the skull it is so intimately connected with the bone in health, that you would almost call it a part of it; it is the outer part of the bone—there were two fractures found, one being the elevated portion that I have men<lb/>tioned, and another corresponding with one of those scalp wounds which I have mentioned—the man died of deposition of matter in the lungs; that was the immediate cause of death—I attribute that deposition of matter in the lungs to the injury to the head—the shivering fit would be symptomatic of a deposition of matter—that was on the 6th, as he died on the 9th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there a considerable deposition of pus in the lungs) <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were three or four small patches, small circumscribed abscesses, about the size of half a hen's egg—I say that was decidedly pro<lb/>duced by the injury to the head; undoubtedly—that is a common cause of such things—it is not equally usual as the result of phthisis, not under these peculiar circumstances—there were no tubercles in the lungs; there were abscesses on the lunge, and in the tissue of the lungs—the idea sug<lb/>gested itself to me, and I searched for tubercles, but there were none in the lungs—I had never seen the man previous to his being brought to the hospital that I am aware of—my attention was directed to the injury of the head—that injury was progressing favourably until 6th Nov., with one very important exception, that on 1st Nov. he had a shivering of very much the same character as he had afterwards, on the 6th—I believe it was on the 1st (<hi rend="italic">referring to his notes</hi>) these are notes that I made every day as I left his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185611240066"/>
               <p>bedside—on 1st Nov. he had the first shivering, and I saw it—my note is, "Shivering strongly"—that passed off, and he went on as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing you had made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of a body on the head of which there had been no injury, and had discovered these deposi<lb/>tions of pus and abscesses in the lungs, would that have satisfactorily accounted to you for the man's death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the immediate cause of death, but I should have been disposed to think that unless the patient had been previously debilitated by some other influence, that alone would not have caused his death—I did not subject the chest of the deceased to any particular examination at the time of his admission—I did on the night of the 5th, at midnight; I was sitting up with him, and he had been complaining of a cough—I then examined his chest minutely all over, and there were no secondary symptoms of disease, that is to say, it is clear these things were not there on the 5th—I used a stethoscope—certainly none of these abscesses were there then—I consider that quite a reliable test unmistakable—from some considerable experience, I am not likely to be mistaken on such a point as that—the abscesses were in a state of suppura<lb/>tion—suppuration is the result of inflammation—there can be no suppura<lb/>tion without antecedent inflammation—on the evening of the 5th, I examined the man's chest carefully, and there was not any indication of disease in the chest then—he died at 2 o'clock in the afternoon of the 9th—I can say that there was no inflammation existing on the 5th—I do say so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then am I to understand you to say, as a surgeon, that inflammation and suppuration supervening upon it, and abscesses, will all take place within the period included between the night of the 5th and 2 o'clock of the 9th Nov.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> it evidently did—I should say that is consistent with my experience, without any antecedent disease existing—there was no indi<lb/>cation of any disease of the lungs on the 5th; I wish to qualify one of my answers, the stethoscope would not indicate a form of inflammation in the centre of the lungs; there would be so much healthy texture between the centre of the lungs and the extremity of the stethoscope, that that disease would not be indicated, so that had he suffered from a form of <hi rend="italic">pneumonia</hi>, called <hi rend="italic">lobular pneumonia</hi>, which is very rare, I should not have been able to detect it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On examination after death, did that appear to have existed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did not—these formations were on the surface of the lungs—I give my opinion as a surgeon, that the wound in the head might cause the inflam<lb/>mation of the lungs, by an affection called <hi rend="italic">pyœmia</hi>, that is by no means of uncommon occurrence—it is not uncommon that violent blows to the head may produce inflammation of the lungs such as I found—inflammation of the lungs, commonly so called, would produce quite a different appearance to that presented by the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> here, and these circumscribed abscesses—the cause of this peculiar formation of pus, is a <hi rend="italic">questio vexata</hi> among the most learned pathologists of the day—they are known to be the result of blows on the head; but the <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> is a matter much in question—blows on the head may he said to be a common cause of this sort of deposi<lb/>tion—if I had heard of a person dying with these symptoms, he having previously received such blows on the head as I saw, I should not have been at all doubtful as to the one being the cause of the other; I should have had no doubt at all about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not the deposition of pus found in more organs of the body than one, in cases of injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes it is, sometimes it is not; in this case it was found in the spleen—I cannot tell whether the</p>

               <p>spleen was in a diseased state before the injury to the head, I never saw the man before—I never examined the spleen—the spleen and kidneys were in a diseased state—I should say that was a diseased state of short stending; that would be my opinion—it is not at all probable, according to ordinary surgical knowledge, that the disease in the kidneys and spleen may have existed antecedently to the infliction of the injuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did what you saw in the kidneys and spleen induce you to come to the belief that that disease had existed before 20th Oct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say it had not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am senior surgeon of the Westminster Hos<lb/>pital. I had charge of this oate I performed an operation on the skull, by raising up the depressed part, which gave relief to the patient—I attended the case to its termination; I also attended the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—in my judgment the cause of death was the deposits in the lungs, in the covering of the lungs, and in the spleen—I attribute those deposits to the injury of the head—I have no doubt on thai point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then from that injury to the head, carefhlly treated, as no doubt it was, proceeded the cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did; I believe he would not have died had be not received the injuries on the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Supposing that no injury had been inflicted on the head, would the appearances in the lungs independently, account for the man's death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not, without there had been some previous in<lb/>flammation of some of the veins of the body—if he had been perfectly well up to the time of his death, those deposits would not have been found—he could not have been, to all outward appearance, well, and yet these things be there—I believe that the depositions that were found in the kings were the result of inflammation which probably arose at the time of the first shivering attack on the 1st.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have heard Mr. Marshall state, that inflammation, none having previously existed, may commence on the night of the 5th, and result in suppuration, such as he has described on the 9th; do you, as a professional man of long standing and experience, endorse that opinion, and coincide with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can only say that suppuration varies with the intensity of the inflammation; it is possible that inflammation will remit in suppura<lb/>tion, the whole process being between the night of the 5th, and 2 o'clock on the 9th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you examine him with a stethoscope as all seeing that he had received only blows on the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he had a very slight cough; that began some few days after his admission; it was found that there was a little rough bronchial breathing at that time; it was</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I have heard what has been stated as to the injuries that the deceased sustained, and the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> appearances—in my judgment the death is to be ascribed to disorder of the brain produced by the violence inflicted on the head, aggravated by fracture, and depression of the skull—the immediate effect of such injury is to produce disorder and disturbance of the seat of the brain; the affection of the lungs is a subsequent affair; it is not merely injuries of the head, but injuries of other parts of the body, are frequently the cause of what we call secondary inflammation, either in the lungs, liver, or other internal parts—it is not unfrequent from injuries to the brain—the secondary affection is not the peculiar result of injuries of the head—injuries to other parts of the body may produce just the same consequences—I should rather say they produce secondary disease, than inflammation, because the question of inflammation is rather a doubtful one—my opinion is, that the injury to the head was in itself fatal, and that death would have ensued in this case, even if the secondary disturbance had not taken place in the internal organs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You think he would have died even without those secondary symptoms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am firmly of opinion that he would.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Although you have heard that he was progressing favourably until the 1st, and afterwards till the 5th Nov.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The expres<lb/>sion "progressing favourably" is very general, and rather equivocal—I do not collect from the history of the case, as far as it has been detailed, that there were any circumstances to lead me to believe that, after a compound fracture of the skull, with depression, and the removal of a circular piece of bone by surgical operation, the patient would have recovered; it would have been quite contrary to my experience if he had recovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand you, that persons having suffered injuries as vio<lb/>lent, have not recovered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I speak of a case where the skull has been seriously injured, and where a portion of the bone has been taken out in order to admit of a depressed piece being raised to its proper level; those I consider the circumstances of the present case—I understood from Mr. Marshall's evidence that a circular portion was removed in order to admit of the bone being raised to its proper level; I did not understand him to speak of the external laminæ only.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Edward Maynard, of Bull-lane, near Barking. On Tuesday night, 4th Nov., I brought some goods from London in a cart—I took the cart into Mr. Maynard's barn, which adjoins his house, and left it there safe about 11 o'clock—it contained some Dutch cheeses and some spruce in a half gallon bottle—I locked the barn door, and left it—I was near the barn again about ten minutes past 12 o'clock that same night, and saw the prisoner about thirty yards from the barn—he was in the road, walking towards Mr. Maynard's premises—next morning I found the barn broken open—the staple had been forced out by a plough coulter, which was found there, and the padlock taken off—I missed eight Dutch cheeses and the bottle of spruce.</p>

On Wednesday morning, 5th Nov., about 4 o'clock, I went to Mr. Maynard's barn—I found the door had been broken open, the staple had been drawn and was lying on the ground with the padlock—it appeared to have been done with a plough coulter which belonged to Mr. Maynard—the barn comes quite close into the road, but it was the back door that was broken open; a person to get to that door must have gone into the field—I found some footmarks leading from the road into the field and to the barn door—I took the prisoner into custody about 7 o'clock that evening—I took off his shoes, and compared them with the footmarks in the field leading to the barn door, they corresponded exactly—the nails in the middle were very much worn, but those round the outside were per<lb/>fect—I first made an impression with the shoe by the side of the footmark, and then compared the shoe in the footmark, I did not perceive the least difference—I traced the footmarks to the barn, and then from the barn about 250 yards to a hedge, where some cheeses were afterwards found—Mrs. Hewitt showed me the place—I could not trace them farther, because the ground was too hard to receive any impression.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a turner, and live at Stratford. I did not know the prisoner, but was employed by him to cut some timber this day three weeks—I was on the wharf at Barking-creek, and he asked me if there were any chain horses—I said, "No, you are too late for chain horses"—he said that he wanted them to pull some timber out—I said, "What will you</p>

I will do it"—I did it, and he out it up into four pieces at his place—he asked me to let it lay at my place for a day or two, as he had not room to put it in his place—I had three pieces of it, and placed two pieces of it outside of his door, by the side of the road—I saw it cut—his place is No. 16, Turn-pike-row, Stratford—I was questioned by the police, and told them what had happened.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 381). On Friday night, 21st Nov., in consequence of what Emery told me, I saw Benham; and in consequence of what he told me, I went to the prisoner's house, No. 16, Turnpike-row, and asked him whether he ordered Benham to cart a ship's yard away from Abbey-wharf—he said "Yes," and that he gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him who he bought it of, and how he came by it—he said that he bought it of a man named Holden—I asked him if he knew where he lived—he said "No," but no doubt he could soon find out—I asked him what price be gave for it, he said 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him not to cut up any more of it, as he was cutting it up at the time, and that he must find the man, or find his address, and tell me to<lb/>morrow morning—he said that no-doubt he should see him that evening—Addington was with me all this time—I went next morning with Addington about a quarter to 9 o'clock, and asked the prisoner whether he had found out where Holden lived, or whether he had seen him—he said "No," and that he had not seen him—in consequence of something I learned, I saw him again about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and told him that he must consider himself my prisoner for stealing a ship's yard, or receiving it, know<lb/>ing it to be stolen; and that I had ascertained that he had been drinking with Holden at the Green Gate beer shop on the over night—he said that he had not been drinking, but Holden asked him whether he could not stand a pot of ale without hurting himself, and he refused—I asked him whether he had found out where Holden lived, or said anything to him about the ship's yard—he said "No," he had not mentioned it to him—he said at the station house, that he gave him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and spent 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the Green Gate beer shop, where he bought it—that is about 200 yards from the prisoner's house, and about a mile from the Abbey-wharf, or half a mile if you go by the side of the river.</p>

I am the father of the last witness—in consequence of information, I went to the prosecutor's house on 20th Oct.—I directed my son to go to the back, and I went to the front—I tried to open the door with the key—I thought I unlocked it, but I could not get in—I called a man who was passing, and said, "Here are thieves in this house"—I heard a slight noise, and saw lights in the house—I told him to watch the door, and I heard a rushing down the stairs—I heard some men running to the back of the house—I ran round to stop them—I saw the prisoner, without a hat, running across the road in a direction from the back of the house—I caught him, and we fell down together—the words, I think he said, were, "Don't hurt me"—I said, "I will not hurt you, but I will hold you"—I held him, and took him to the Dockyard police station, and handed him over to the officer—I went back, and my son and I examined the garden together—my son pointed to the place where he had stopped the other man, and I found this life preserver—the next morning, at the house No. 11, two doors from the prosecutor's, I saw a labourer, who was with me, find this hat—my son's head was bleeding.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What width is the archway? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than half a dozen yards—I was not right opposite the archway—I stood by a corner whare I could see them—I was close to the corner of the archway, looking round the corner—the arch is more than half a dozen, yards long—the <hi rend="italic">slide</hi> is not under the archway, it is six yards from it, and it may be ten—I was standing at the <hi rend="italic">slide</hi> at the time they went in, but I went over to the corner when I saw them take the handkerchiefs—the arch<lb/>way is a public thoroughfare, people pass through continually—I never noticed a window in the top—I do not know whether there is a store room over it—there are people at work there, but they were not at work that day—Keeble was not under the archway, but the other two prisoners met him at the archway—I know what they were wheeling in the barrow—I could see it marked "silk handkerchiefs" in ink or something, as they came down the wharf with it—I was not a yard away from it then—I did not speak to them—they saw me—there were a good many men about—when Williams went away with the barrow, King went to the stores with the handkerchiefs—I do not know how many were taken out—they saw me in the cooperage—I only saw King, Day, and Williams when they took the stockings—I then looted round the corner at the same place where I stood before—Williams put one pair of stockings in his pocket—there were not men at work in the building where the casks were; it is used to keep casks dry—I was two or three yards from them when I saw him give Day two handkerchiefs—they might have seen me, I do not know—I did not hear any more pass—I only heard Day ask for the third one—I have known Day, and Williams—Day went into the yard the same day as I did—I did not mention all this till evening, because after I told them I would report them, I made sure that they would return them, give them up to the foreman—his name is Stagg—I had seen him in the day, and spoken to him fre<lb/>quently—I did not ask him whether these men had given him back the handkerchiefs, because I knew they had not—I accused them of it, and they told me that they did not give them up—that was at about half-past 4 o'clock—I was accusing Williams of it, and the foreman heard me, and asked me what it was, and I told him—I and Day did not agree very well, but I had no spite, it was through another young man in the yard who I had a difference with—I have not had a fight with him, but we spoke angrily to each other—I never had any difference with King—I lived</p>

               <p>next door to him—I was obliged to leave when my landlord left—there were not complaints by Mrs. King of my being drunk and keeping late hours—there was a complaint made about that house to a policeman by Mrs. King, but there were lodgers in the house besides me—it was not of me that the complaints were made—I cannot tell how soon after that I left—I then went to Cross-street, Rotherhithe, to live with the same landlord—complaints were not made about that house also—nobody charged me with having any mittens that did not belong to me, nor did I have any—Williams did not say that I had—I know a man named Cooper—a pair of mittens were not pulled out of my pocket in his presence—I swear that—I did not assist in loading the barrows.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the labourers in the victualling yard, Deptford. On 28th Oct., the prisoners were employed there, and after dinner I heard Ryan accusing Williams of something, but could not under<lb/>stand what he meant; and I afterwards asked him, but not in Williams's presence—Ryan gave me some information in the evening, and I went to Keehle's lodging, and told him I had been informed that he had taken some silk handkerchiefs from the bale that had been landed, he made no answer—I said, "It is no use your denying it, I have a witness to prove that you did take them"—he said, "I have one which I bought of King, and was to give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—he told me I could take it if I liked—I said, "You can bring it in the morning," and in the morning he brought it, and I told him to come with me to Mr. Bean, the foreman of the stores, and give it up to him—on the evening of the same day I asked King to go with me from Lord Kingston's house; having called him out, I said, "King, you have made a very bad job of this"—he asked me what I meant—I said, "By taking the handkerchiefs from the bale to-day"—he said that he did not know anything of it—I said, "It is no use your denying it, for I have a witness to prove that you did take them"—Keeble then said, "King, it is no use your denying, it, for you know you sold me the handkerchief for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—King said, "I sold it you, but there was no money received"—these stores came from the ship <hi rend="italic">Speagle</hi>, from Sheerness.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live at No. 31, Searle's-terrace, Victoria-road, Deptford, I am foreman of the stores. On the morning of 20th Oct., I was raising a quantity of stores from a vessel, and the prisoners were employed in removing them—I received part of a bale containing black silk handker-chiefs—I did not see who brought it, but Williams acknowledged to me that he was the person that brought it to the stores—it was rather unsewn on one side, and I made a complaint as to it's state—on the following morning, Keeble brought me a black silk handkerchief, of the same description as we generally pack in the bales—he said that he had purchased</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185611240087"/>
               <p>it of King, and was to pay him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I put a mark ou it—I have compared it with the contents of the bale, and it corresponds—the purser charges fifty-five handkerchiefs, the bale actually contained thirty-one, and this one would make thirty-two—in the course of the same day, a bale containing stockings was brought into store; there was a small hole in the wrapper of about four inches, large enough to get a hand in; it might be torn or worn out—I examined the bale, it contained 143 pairs, and one odd one; the purser charges 118—the handkerchiefs are packed in eight dozens, and four put into a bale—they were return stores—Williams said that he brought that package, but that there was another wrapper over it—that was within a few minutes after the package was delivered, when I made the complaint—I complained to stagg in Williams's presence, and he acknowledged that he brought the package into the store, but that it had a wrapper over it—I have seen the wrapper since, it was on the floor alongside the package.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many men were moving the packages? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ten or twelve—there was only one package of silk handkerchiefs—if I had found 118 pairs of stockings in this bale I should have thought it was all right—I found 143 pairs, and one odd one—you cannot depend upon the accuracy of the account given—fifty-five handkerchiefs are charged—I had that account in the same way—the bales are always covered with wrappers, the mark telling the contents is on the outside—I saw the principal part of the bales brought into the stores, but did not see the damaged one brought in—the man in charge did not allow Day to go away till he had shown it to me—he is not here—he is the man who received it from whoever carried, it there—I spoke about it immediately afterwards—I went with Day—Williams acknowledged that he had carried it, but that the wrapper was upon it—bales are sometimes damaged a good deal—I do not know whether this has been to the Crimea—there are very often sales of these things by auction—handkerchiefs had been sold a month or five weeks before, but I cannot say exactly—it sometimes happens that the bales are so damaged that the contents are found in the hold of the ship—it had been a very foggy day the first part of the morning, but it had cleared off partially between 10 and 11 o'clock—I know the arch; it is, perhaps, forty yards from the slide—if you are standing at the slide, you can see to the centre of the arch; you can see through it, but not through part of it if you are not in a right line with it—workmen pass and repass through it; it is large enough for carts and waggons to go through.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>no mark on the outside wrapper—I examined them myself, and saw them all shipped in a perfect state—they did not get damaged by getting knocked down in the hold, because I saw them all shipped on top of ninety chloride of zinc jars, which had been received from Chatham—I cannot say whether they might have been damaged on their passage.</p>

I was not in uniform—I saw Miller come up, and go into Bennett's shop—he came out again—Powell went past Bennett's with a truck, and Miller went and fetched him back—it stopped at Bennett's shop—there were four scaffolding boards on the top of the truck—Powell took them off, and then took the lead out, and took it into Bennett's shop, and Bennett weighed it—Miller was in the shop—I stood at the door, and saw it weighed—I heard Bennett say, "There is one quarter and six pounds"—they then all three came out together, and went into the public house next door—after some time they all came out together—Bennett went into his own shop, and Powell and Miller took the truck away—I followed them to Vauxhall-road, and took them—they told me they got the lead from where they had worked that day—I asked them where they had</p>

               <p>worked, and they refused to tell me—after I had taken them into custody, I went back to Bennett's shop, and told him I wanted that lead that he had just bought—he said that he had not bought any lead that day—I told him I wan an officer, and I saw it come there—he again said that he had not bought any lead—I called in an officer who was in uniform, and Bennett denied it then—I said, "It is no use denying it, it is behind the counter," and with some hesitation be let us go behind the counter, where I fonnd the thirty-four pounds of lead—I have since examined Mr. Hearn's yard, and found it had been taken from there—I have fitted it, and it fits exactly.</p>

I was called by the last witness to Bennett's shop—I stood outside, and the witness went in—I heard him ask Bennett for the lead he bad just bought—Bennett said, "What lead?—the officer said, "That thirty-four pounds you met bought of Powell and Miller"—Bennett said, "I have not bought any lead to day"—the officer said to Bennett, "It is no use for you to deny it, I am a constable"—Bennett said again he had bought no lead that day—the officer called me in, and he again asked him for it—Bennett said, "What lead?—he hesitated a minute, and then he said, "Here it is"—he told him where it was—I took Bennett to the station, and in going, he told me he had bought the lead, and given 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound for it—he said he had bought a good deal of the prisoners at one time and the other, but this would be a sickener for them, and that it would be the last time he would do so.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 228). About 2 o'clock in the morning of 13th Oct.

On Wednesday, 29th Oct., about a quarter past one in the morning, I was in High-street, Borough—I was on the left hand side of the way, going towards the Elephant and Castle, on the same side as St. George's Church—when I got to Stone's End, I saw the prisoner Hunter come out of a court—he bent his head down underneath the gas lamp and looked at me, and I did the same, and did not like his appearance—he was alone—I attempted to step into the road to pass him, when I felt a spring from behind, and was immediately seized by the throat from behind, before I could get into the road—I was walking very fast at the time, and when I was seized I had got within arm's length of Hunter—he was walking across me—he stopped when I was seized, and he immediately seized me by the right arm—another seized me by the left—I had a loose coat on at the time with a pocket at the side, and he seized my pipe case from it—I believe Hunter must have done that, he being on that side of me—I received a bruise at the time from the violence—he seized me by the arm, and seized the pipe case out of my pocket—I was then held by the arm after being seized by the hand by a third man—I struggled with them, and they held up my over coat, and put their hands in my wowsers; I do not wear braces, so they could not get their hands into my pockets, but they undid all the buttons, and pulled out my shirt, and after that they said "Quick"—I could not say which of them it was that said that; some of them did—they looked round and cried out "Quick," and then I saw the prisoner Murty for the first time—they tore open my over coat while he tried to unbutton the under one, which was closely buttoned up—I kicked him as hard as I could on the legs—they then said, "Squeeze him tighter," and that was the last I recollect—they all opened away from me when I kicked—the man behind still had hold of my throat at that time—I was calling out as well as I could, but of course I could not call out, I was only gurgling in my throat—I tried to throw the man behind—I could hardly move while I was held by the three, but I kicked the fourth one when he came to unbutton my under coat, and that startled them—after they said, "Squeeze him tighter," I became insensible—I scrambled up as well as I could, and I saw the policeman running after three, and I ran as well—I felt very unwell, and went home—I had been in bed about half an hour, when the policeman came to fetch me, and I gave him a description of Hunter in the hall, and I also gave a description of two other men—Murty is one of them—Hunter was brought to me, I should think, within an hour; it might have been an hour and a half—all the property I lost was my pipe case—I was very much hurt—I have a lump in my throat at the present time—my stomach was almost beaten to a jelly from the way in which they used me, and I have a large bruise on my left breast—I have had a great dizziness in my head ever since.</p>

On the morning of 29th Oct., about 1 o'clock, I was on duty near Stone's-and, in the Borough—I heard a noise on the opposite side, from the Ship public house, a scraping of feet, and scuffling about on the pavement—I went across very gently, and, when I got within about two yards of the kerb, some one ran away from a some<lb/>thing that I saw lying on the pavement—the person that ran away had a cap on, and a pair of light trowsers—I saw him very clearly, because he had to run past me—I had a full view of him; it was the prisoner Hunter—he went into Trinity-street—I followed him very closely, and called out,"Stop thief!" two or three times—I lost sight of him when he got to the corner, because he was some distance before me, and he turned sharply round the corner of Trinity-street—I followed him down Trinity-street—I cried "Stop thief!" in Trinity-square three or four times after springing my rattle, and I heard the constable Armstead say, "Come on; I have got him"—he might</p>

I opened the door to them"—I took him to Tower-*treet station, and there he said, "There are others ought to be apprehended as well as me"—Mr. Mason was sent for—I was not there when he came—previous to taking Murty I went with Mr. Mason to different public houses on one or two occasions to seek for certain parties.</p>
