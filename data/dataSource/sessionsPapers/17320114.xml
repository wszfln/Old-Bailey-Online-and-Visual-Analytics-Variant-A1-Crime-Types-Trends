            . Last Monday Sev'n-night, between Four and Five in the Morning, the Prisoner came to me with this Mallet and Chissel, and we went together into Bow Church Vault, and there he cut the Lead and Plate off of Mr. Boyville's Son's Coffin. I knew it to be his Coffin, because there was an Inscription upon it. I help'd him to carry the Lead to Mr. Moore in King-street, in Old-Street-Square , who gave us at the Rate of 9 s. 4 d. a Hundred for it.

             . I keep an Old-Iron Shop in Chissel-street . Mr. Moore came to me for some Iron to make Coffin Handles, and said he had some Lead to sell. I bought upwards of 300 Weight of him at 11 s. a Hundred, which I sold to Mr. Newton at 13 s. a Hundred. I asked Moore, who he bought it of? He said of some Grave-Diggers who had it for Perquisites.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Warner told me that he had Orders from Mr. Prior, the Church-Warden of Bow Church, to clear the Vault. And when I went down with him, he said, This is a good Place, my other Perquisites are but small, and when these Things [Iron, Lead and Nails] are gone, my Business will be worth nothing.</p>
               <p>Warner . A little while ago the Sexton gave me leave to go down and level the Floor of the Vault. The Prisoner went with me, and taking one of the Candles he look'd all round the Vault. Lord! says he, What a Sight of Brass Nails and Handles here is? What a pity it is they should lie and spoil here, when I can have 2 d. a Pound for the worst Handle among them?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There's Mr. Hall, the Common-Council Man, knows me, and can give me a Character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hall. I know he has been Under-Grave-Digger in Aldgate Parish for four or five Years. We have had some suspicion of him, - and Yesterday we searched the South-Vault of the Church, and found it all robb'd, - and Nobody had the Key but him and his Master, and his Master hears a very honest Character.</p>

             . I saw the Deceased put into the Coffin, and afterwards Interr'd in the Vault; and hearing last Saturday that the Vault had been robb'd, I enquir'd after Mr. Garland's Coffin. Warner told me, the Coffin was taken quite away, and the Corps thrown on the Ground, and shew'd me the place where it lay. I knew the Body by two Things; the Deceas'd had been Lame, and one of his Legs was shorter than the other; and after his Death his Body was open'd for the Satisfaction of his Friends to know what Distemper he dy'd of.</p>
               <p>Warner . Last Saturday Morning between 4 and 5 the Prisoner went into the Vault with this Mallet and Chissel . He broke the Wooden Coffin, and then cut the Sides of the Leaden one, and tumbled the Corps out upon the Ground, and cover'd it with the Saw-Dust that came out of the Coffin. Says I, this Corps will soon be discover'd by the smell if ye leave it here, and then I shall come into a scrape, and my Master may lose his place: No, says he, it has been Buried so long that there's no fear of smelling. Then he cut the Lead to Pieces, and we carried it to Mr. Moore. There was about one Hundred and a half of it. When Mr. Paine came to me, I ript up the Shrond , and shew'd him the Body. The Shroud look'd as fresh and as white as the Shirt on your Lordship's Back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you take the Mallet out of our Vestry? - 'Tis the very Thing that Alderman Parsons knocks with. And did not you borrow the Chissel of your Brother-in-Law?</p>
               <p>Warner. No, you brought them both to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. And will you swear too that you did not carry the Lead to Moore?</p>
               <p>Warner. I helped to carry it. And when we came to Moore he seemed unwilling to buy it at first for fear of Trouble. What a Plague in Hell are ye afraid of? says the Prisoner, Don't ye know that I rummage the Church at Aldgate, and that these are my Perquisites? - Well, but (says Moore ) you promis'd to bring me some Coffin Handles. And so I will to Morrow, says the Prisoner, as I hope to be saved, - upon my Life and Soul, - the Devil fetch me if I don't. - And so Moore paid us for the Lead, but stopp'd a Shilling till the Prisoner brought the Handles.</p>
               <p>Moore. I would have stopp'd the Lead, but they said it was their Perquisites, and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140004"/> came honestly by it, and so I gave them 9 s. 4 d. a Hundred for it, which is the Price that all Old-Iron Shops give.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Warner brought me into the Secret, and said this and that, and t'other, and that I was safe enough , and he could get the Key of Mary, the Sexton's Maid, and would I go one time and another time? But I refus'd to go several times, till at last he persuaded me there was no Danger in it. The Jury found the Prisoner <rs id="t17320114-1-verdict9" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>James Crawford, Waterman. On the 10th of November, as I was standing at Cupid's Bridge , where I ply, the Prisoner Beach past me, and went into the King's Head Alehouse. A Peter Boat had been robb'd a little before, and Beach was suspected to have been concern'd in it, he having dispos'd of some Fish and other Things which were thought to have been taken out of that Boat, and so I and some other Watermen agreed to take him. We went and found him and Moss (the other Prisoner) sitting by the Fire, and two Parcels of Goods lying by them. We seized Beach , but Moss got by us and hid himself in the Cellar, where we afterwards found him. They gave no account how they came by the Goods, and so were carried before Justice Lade . The Goods were open'd there, and I saw Stockings, Diaper, and other Shop Goods.</p>

            , the Prisoner's Apprentice . On Wednesday the 9th of December , about 11 at Night, I went to Bed, and fell asleep, but was awaked by a Noise between 12 and 1. I heard my Mistress (in the Room under me) cry Murder ! For God's Sake don't murder me! For the Lord's Sake, Robin , don't murder me ! Pity me! for Christ's Sake! - for my poor Family's Sake! - Then she call'd me, Charles! Charles! Charles! and once she cry'd louder than ordinary. The Prisoner said, G - d d - n you, what do you want with Charles ? I was afraid he would come up to me, and so I stepp'd out of Bed, and was going to get out of the Window , to save my self, but a Child that lay with me (who was lame, and could not speak plain , tho' it was ten Years old) cry'd Sharly ! Sharly! do no go. Then I consider'd with my self, that by venturing out at Window I might be accessary to my own Death, and so I went to Bed again. I heard a great many very violent Blows, which by the Sound seem'd to be given with the Tongs, or the Fire-shovel. By and by the Neighbours cry'd Murder! and I heard the Street-Door open, which I thought the People without had broke open. Then I said within my self, By the leave of the Lord I will venture out, as soon as the Mob comes in; but presently I heard the Prisoner come up Stairs into his own Chamber.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How do you know it was I that came up, when you did not see me?</p>
               <p>Bird. Because as soon as you came up I heard you scolding again - I got up, and was going down Stairs, about 6 in the Morning, I heard a low Voice (which I thought was my Mistres's) and it said, Charles, go and strike a Light, and take the Tin Pot and draw some Beer. I did so, and brought it up. And the Voice said again, Set it down upon the Chest and leave it there. I did so; but I neither saw his nor her Face, for they were both cover'd in the Bed. - Then the Voice bid me make a Fire, which I did; and while I was blowing it up I heard 2 or 3 dismal Groans. Then I went to my Work.</p>
               <p>Court. What Work.</p>
               <p>Bird. The Prisoner is a <rs id="t17320114-9-deflabel50" type="occupation">Waterman</rs>

This was between 6 and 7 o'Clock; and about 8 Job Allen came to me, and told me my Mistress was dead. Then I have lost a very good Mistress, said I; and with that I ran home to know the Truth of it; and there I saw Dr. Smith, and the Constable, and the Prisoner, and I found it was too true! my poor Mistress was dead indeed! - Then I went to my Work again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How do you know but it was your Mistress that came up Stairs? for you said you thought it was me, only because you heard my Voice after I was come up.</p>
               <p>Bird. I thought it was not possible that my Mistress shou'd come up Stairs so readily, after the Blows that she received, and the Groans and Cries that she made.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . Did you hear us both go down?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140007"/>Bird. I don't remember that I heard any more than one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you come home to Dinner the Day before this happened, and your Mistress told you she'd give you no Victuals, for she intended to make away with her self?</p>
               <p>Bird. No. I came home to Dinner, and there was cold Beef; I desir'd her to let me broil it, and she said, with all her Heart; I might do as I wou'd - She was as good a Woman as ever broke Bread.</p>

This was between 12 and 1. I jump'd out of Bed, ran to the Window, and look'd out. He ran down Stairs, and came out of the Door in his Shirt, with a Candle in his Hand; his Wife was lying in the Street. He damn'd her for a Bitch, and said she was drunk. He set down the Candle on a Bench, and taking her by the Arms, dragg'd her backward up the Steps into the Entry, and shut the Door; as he was hauling her in, I called out, You Villain! you wicked Rogue! you have thrown your Wife out of the Window, and kill'd her! All the Neighbours were alarm'd, and several came out, and said, For Christ's Sake don't use the poor Woman so, but let some Body help her; but he would let no Body. After he had got her in, I heard several Groans, and thought she might be in Labour, for she was so near her Time, that she look'd every Hour, but about 6 she dy'd, and half an Hour after he went out and brought a Mid wife.

Her Right-Hand was cut all a-cross the Fingers, and the Window-Post was bloody with strugling. The Prisoner said, see how the wicked Jade has cut her Hand with the Glass-Window in getting out. But I look'd, and there was not one Pane of Glass broke, nor was any of the Glass bloody, but only the Post.</p>

            , the Husband of the last Witness. On Wednesday the 9th of December , the Prisoner came Home between 11 and 12 at Night, and begun to scold at, and beat and abuse his Wife; she thought to escape by running down Stairs, but he was too nimble for her, and catch'd her just without the Street-Door, and beat her so barbarously, that he rais'd all the Neighbours, who cry'd out, shame on him. He beat her thro' the Entry up Stairs, and in the Chamber she cry'd, Oh! Oh! Oh! and afterwards, O Robin ! - What are you going to do? - For God's Sake spare my Life! - Don't kill me! - for Christ's Sake! - for my poor Family's Sake. Then I heard a strugling, a rustling like the rustling of a Tarpaulin , the Woman gave a great shriek, and something rush'd out of the Window at once - I could hear very plain, for there's only a Deal Partition betwixt my Room and the Prisoner's - I and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140008"/> my Wife jump'd out of Bed, and went to our Window. The Prisoner came out of his Door with a Candle in his Hand. His Wife was then lying on the Stone Pavement, she lay like a Log, and neither stirr'd Hand nor Foot. He set down the Candle, took her by the Shoulders, and haul'd her upon her Back up 3 Steps. - My Wife and other Neighbours call'd to him, and cry'd, Murder! He took no Notice of them, but dragg'd her in, and shut the Door fast . - Then he dragg'd her up Stairs. - It must be he that did it, for No-body was there to do it but himself, - and I heard several heavy Groans; but whether they were hers or his, I don't know.</p>

             . I have lived next Door to the Prisoner 3 Years, - there's only a thin Partition between us, so that I can hear every Word that's spoke in his Room. For this 12 Month past, I have frequently heard great Out-cries of Murder. And particularly about 3 Weeks before her Death, he came home in a jealous Fit, and beat her, and swore he'd Murder her, if he was hang'd for it. I heard her cry, O for God's sake Mercy ! Pity me! - Pity the tender Infant within me ! Damn ye, for a Bitch, says he, I'll send you, and your Infant to the Devil together ! - I'll split your Skull, and dash your Brains against the Back of the Chimney - I know I shall come to be hang'd at Tyburn for ye. And that Night as she was kill'd, I heard him beating her again, and a great many Blows he gave her. She begg'd, For God's Sake! - For Christ Jesus's Sake! and for her poor Children's Sake ! that he would not kill her! and she call'd, Charles ! Charles! Charles! and gave a great Shrick! Then I heard Mrs. Anderson get out of her Bed, throw open her own Window, and cry out, He has thrown his Wife out of Window! I struck a light, and saw it was then about half an Hour after 12. Mr. Anderson and his Wife lodge in the fore Part of the House, and I in the back Part. After the Prisoner was taken by Mr. Betty, the High-Constable, I heard him say, I will not wrong my Conscience, I believe the Blows I gave her, and my threatening to fetch my Cane, was the Cause of her going out of the Window, but I was not in the Chamber at that time. He was before the Justice 8 or 10 Months ago for abusing her, and throwing her upon the Bed, while he had a Knife in his Mouth, and swearing he would rip her up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you hear me in another Room when the Out-cry was of her being thrown out of the Window?</p>
               <p>Fleming . No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you hear the Blows?</p>
               <p>Fleming . Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. And did not they found as if they were struck against a Door to get it open?</p>
               <p>Fleming . No, they founded as if struck against a Human Body.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see my Wife after her Death? Had she any marks?</p>
               <p>Fleming. Yes. All her left Side was black - and the Body of the Child within was black, and part of its Head was greenish, - but I did not take very particular Notice.</p>

O! with some other Words, but I could not tell exactly what those Words were. As we came nearer, the Cries encreas'd, and says I to Mr. Horseford, This Fellow will kill his Wife. No, says he, 'tis only a Family Quarrel, and they'll be good Friends again by and by. We pass'd the Door, for we were going to a House a little beyond, but looking about we thought we were gone too far, and so turning back, I heard the Woman say twice or thrice, For God's Sake, Robin, save my Life! - Don't throw me out o'Window ! - I did not imagine that the Fellow would be such a Villain to do it , for if we had thought he would, I believe we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140009"/> could have catch'd her and broke her fall; but suddenly the Casement burst open, and she came out with her Back foremost, and fell down on the Stones. There was a Candle in the Chamber, and I saw a Man there, near the Window, which I believe was the Prisoner, but I am not sure of it. I was within 8 or 10 Yards of her when she fell, she groaned, but was not able to rise. Presently the Prisoner came down with the Candle in his Hand, went to his Wife, and took her by one Arm to lift her up, but finding her helpless, he said, G - d d - n ye,

We went and acquainted the Watch with it, but they took no farther Notice than to Laugh at it, and next Morning I heard she was dead.</p>

               <p>Furnell . No; I saw you, or some Man like you, near the Window; and before she came out, I heard a rustling, as if it was in Opposition, and as she came out she gave a terrible shrick.</p>

             . On the 9th of December, between 12 and 1 in the Morning, I was coming along Ropemaker's-Fields with Mr. Furnell, and just as we turned out of Church-Lane , I heard several Blows, and coming nearer, a Woman's Voice cry'd, For God's Sake, Robin , spare my Life! - Murder! - For God's Sake spare my Life this time. This Fellow will kill his Wife, says Mr. Furnell; no, says I, 'tis only a Family-Quarrel, and we shall get no Thanks for meddling betwixt a Man and his Wife; and so we pass'd the Door, and went forward, but thinking we were got beyond the place we intended to go to, we turned back, and heard the Woman cry, For God's Sake, Robin, don't throw me out at Window! - For the Lord's Sake! - For Christ's sake! - spare my Life! - I look'd up towards the Window, and suddenly the Casement flew open, and at once the Woman came out with her Back foremost. I saw the glympse of a Man in the Room, - I was 10 or 12 Yards off when she fell, - She lay at length on her Back like one dead, - Just as we came to her, a Man came out in his Shirt with a Candle in his left Hand, and he put his right Hand under her Arm to lift her up, and said, G - d d - n ye,

            . On Wednesday the 8th of December, about 3 in the Afternoon, I saw the Deceas'd, and asked her how she did? O, says she, I shall be murder'd to Night! Why so? says I. Why, says she, the Child has told me that my Husband is gone to eat a Leg o'Mutton and Turnips at Will Perkins's, and there he'll get Drunk, and then come Home and Murder me. He had kept Account of my Reckoning from the 11th of March, but now he has moved it to the 11th of April, and wants me to lay my Child to a Man in the Country; and he said if I would not, he wish'd the Devil might appear to us both in a great Flame of Fire, and carry him away before my Face if he did not Murder me when he came Home at Night. And so she desir'd me to leave my Cellar Door open that she might ran in and hide herself when he came; I told her she should not go in the Cellar, but I would leave my other Doors open, and she should come into my Room and Welcome. And so I did, and I don't know whether or no she was coming to me, but he met her, and she turn'd back, and about Midnight, when he came Home I heard him swear, he'd make her remember leaving the House. He beat her up Stairs, she cry'd out, O, says my Child, that wicked Man is beating his Wife. I heard something fall into the Street, and then his Door was open'd. I ran out, and he was dragging her in. O Mr. Hallam , says I, (clapping my Hands) take pity of her, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140010"/> she's a dead Woman. He made me no Answer. I lean'd over the Bench at his Door to save her, but he pull'd her Legs into the Entry, and then threw her down, and said, Dead or Alive , lie there! and so he shut the Door against me, and bolted it. Many a time have I seen him beat her, and two or three Nights in a Week I have heard her cry out Murder, and have often gone to help her, and got behind him , and held my Arms round his Neck thus - while she has run away for fear of being murder'd.</p>

On Thursday Morning before Eight, the Prisoner call'd me to come to his Wife; I was not quite dress'd, he desir'd me to make haste; he went away, and return'd in 5 or 6 Minutes to hasten me. She had spoke to me the Friday before to be her Midwife, and I knowing her time was out, thought she was in Labour. But as I came along with him, he told me his Wife had met with a sad Misfortune; I ask'd him how? O Mrs. Lane, says he, she got out of a Window while I was in another Room. When I came there, a Neighbour said she was Dead, and so I found her, for her Face, Hands and Feet were quite cold, but her Body was a little warm. - Another Neighbour came in and asked him how she got up Stairs, and he said she walked up. At Night we stripp'd her, and I search'd her Body. There was a great Bruise on her left Arm, and several lesser Bruises on her Back and Sides like Slashes. Her right Hand was cut. The Child was full grown, and black from Head to Foot, especially on the left Side.</p>

            . About a quarter past 12, on Wednesday Night, I happened to be up, and a Neighbour called to me, and said, Hark! there's a crying out, our little Neighbour is in Labour; but presently there was a great Shrick , and Cry of Murder! So I went and sat at Mrs. Mingo's Door, which is almost over against the Prisoner's . The Deceased cry'd, For Christ's Sake , don't murder me! for God's Sake! for my poor Family's sake, spare me! - Charles! Charles! Charles! - G - d d - n you for a Bitch , says the Prisoner, what do ye call Charles for? This was follow'd by 3 or 4 heavy Blows. The Window was forced open, and she came out, and seemed to catch at the Sign-Post in falling, but miss'd it, and came to the Ground. She gave dismal Groans. The Prisoner came out in his Shirt, it was speckled Shirt, and with a Candle in his Hand; and going to lift her up with one Hand, he said, G - d d - n the Bitch, she's drunk, and has thrown her self out at Window . Then he dragg'd her in, shut his Door, went up and shut the Casement, and put out his Candle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was you or Mr. Furnell nearest my Wife when she fell?</p>
               <p>Adams. Mr. Furnell and his Friend were coming by before she fell out. I begg'd 'em for God's Sake to stop, for here was a Man that would murder his Wife. And one of 'em said, What have we to do between a Man and his Wife? But for God's Sake stay, says I, for fear he should kill his 'Prentice too, who is my Sister's Son.</p>

             , Surgeon. The Overseers of the Poor desired me to view the Body of the Deceased. Her Arm was bruised, there were 3 or 4 Marks on it, like the Marks made by a Stick, and there was a Wound in the Palm of her Right Hand, above an Inch long, and a quarter of an Inch deep; it seem'd to be a Stab with a Knife. I did not take notice of the small Bruises. On Saturday, the Coroner order'd me to open the Body. - The Abdomen was full of contused Blood, the Womb was rent 7 Inches, and the Infant, which was dead, but full grown, was forced out of the Womb, all but its Feet. The first thing we saw when the Tegament of the Belly was opened, was the Child's Right Hand; and I believe the Fall was the Cause of her and the Child's immediate Death.</p>

My Wife has thrown her self out of the Window. I wish you'd carry up this Water, while I draw your Drink. I went up with the Water, and said, How do you do, Mrs. Hallam? How happened this ? Why, says she, I can't tell very well; I unfortunately drop'd my self out of the Window, I feel a Pain in the Bottom of my Belly; but if I should do otherwise than well, there's Anderson and Fleming are so hard-mouth'd, that if my Husband should come to a Tryal, they will swear his Life away; and therefore I beg you would speak in his Behalf, for he is innocent of throwing me out of the Window.

She said her Husband hit her with a Pint-Pot, and she said, Carman! if any thing should happen to me extraordinary, those People at the next Door will swear my Husband's Life away. I suppose she did not then think that her End would be so soon. I went to see her about 8 a Clock that Morning she dy'd, and she was then warm.</p>

I took her up, and enquired who she was; for presently a great many People were got about me, but no Body could answer my Question: Her Body was all black, and her Legs were perfectly covered with a white Mold. She had on a thin old Crape-Gown, and a Bit of a red Petticoat, but no Shift nor Stockings - By-and-by a Woman came out of the Four Swans , took her under her Arm (for she was light enough) and carried her in; I followed, and still enquired who she was, and at last the Prisoner came, and said it was his Wife. And are you not asham'd to keep your Wife so? says I, she looks as if she was starved, she's nothing but Skin and Bone! No, no, says he, she's not starved. Some of the Company gave the poor Woman a Dram, and she began to come to herself. I desired she might be put to Bed, and taken care of: She was carry'd up Stairs, I would have followed directly, but they refused to let me, for they said they must put her on a clean Shift. Sometime after this, some Women went up, and I followed them into the Garret; and then she had got a Shift on. There was a half-peck Loaf wrap'd in a Cloth, and hanging up by a String: It was very hard and mouldy. I asked, why it was hung there ? and somebody answered, to keep it from the Mice. The Deceas'd being pretty well come to herself, said to me, For God's Sake stay by me! I have been used barbarously ! I am starved to Death! I stay'd with her about half an Hour, and came again next Day. The Lock and Key of her Door were without side: I asked the Reason of it, and was told by the Woman of the House, that it was to lock the Deceas'd up. I found several Bits of hard Cheese lying about the Garret. The Deceas'd said, Those Bits of Cheese are laid for me, and I would eat them if I could, but in the weak Condition I am in, I might as well try to eat a Piece of Board. When they brought me up any Victuals, they used to leave it just within the Door, and if I could not get out of Bed to fetch it, I might lie and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140014"/> starve : And once I made shift to crawl to the Door, but was not able to get back again; so that I was forced to lie there in the Cold all Night; and they let me have none but cold hard Victuals, such I can seldom eat, and cold Small Beer. I have begg'd many a time for a little Water-gruel, but all in vain. They would not so much as let me have a little Fire, or a bit of Candle, or Sheets to my Bed, tho' they knew I was ready to perish with Cold, so that for want of these and other Necessaries my very Skin has peel'd off. And so saying, she shew'd me a Paper in which she had put some of the bits of her Skin as they peel'd off. They were all white and mouldy, and look'd just like her Legs which were cover'd over with a white Mold. Her Flesh was all over wasted, and black where it was not mouldy. - Her Flesh did I say? No; I mean her Skin, for I saw no sign of any Flesh that she had. I asked her why she did not cry out for help? and she said she had done so, and that thereupon the Prisoner came up and Horse-whipp'd her, and threatened that he would murder her if it was not for the Law. She lived 10 or 11 Days after this. I went to see her every Day. She spit Blood the first Day, and was all along very feeble, and complain'd of a Weakness inwardly. She said she was 55 or 56 Years of Age.</p>
               <p>Coroner. Did she tell you why she got upon the House?</p>
               <p>Best. Yes: She said she did it thro' Necessity, as thinking it better to make an end of her Life in that manner, than to starve to Death.</p>
               <p>Court. You say her Body was black, might not that Blackness come by the Fall?</p>
               <p>Best. I believe not, for her Body was all over black, she was stunn'd with the fall, but recover'd in about a Quarter of an Hour, and I did not perceive that she had received any further Hurt, for she was so wasted away, that she fell very light, and then her fall was broke by an old Shed.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think she could not eat the Cheese! was it so hard as not to be eatable?</p>

               <p>Best . Perhaps hail Man might eat it; but I believe that a Woman in her weak Condition could not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she say why he us'd her thus?</p>
               <p>Best . She said, It was because she refus'd to sell a small Estate .</p>
               <p>Court. How long had she been confin'd thus?</p>
               <p>Best. She said a Year and a half.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she give you this Account more than once? Best. Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>Court. And did she never vary in her account?</p>
               <p>Best. No, not in the least Circumstance. She repeated the very same Things from the first time to the last.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think she was in her right. Senses?</p>
               <p>Best. Yes, without doubt, she was examin'd before Justice Leake.</p>
               <p>Court. Is her Examination here?</p>

               <p>Who faith, That she came from Christ-Church Hospital about the Month of April 1730. (when she was almost recover'd of a Fever and Learnness she had) to her said Husband Corbet Vezey , at his Lodgings at the Sign of the Four Swans in Mile-End Old Town aforesaid: At which time he put her in a Garret in the said House, and put a Lock on the outside of the Door thereof, and confin'd her till November following, about which time she obtained leave of her said Husband to go out and beg a Shift, and about a Week's time she return'd , and her said Husband then put her in the said Garret, and confin'd her to the 16th Instant, and kept her during that time chiefly with cold Meat, and sometimes with dry and mouldy Bread, and cold Small Beer, which she by reason of her Indisposition could not eat, putting it sometimes just within side the Door, which she was obliged to croep on her Hands and Knees to fetch, and bad<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140015"/> neither Candle nor Fire all the time, which she often complaining of, and desiring him often to send her hot Victuals, good Bread , warm Beer, or some Water-Gruel, which he always refused; and desired him to let her have a Minister, which he likewise refused; and has several times threatened her, that he would kill her, if it was not for the Laws of the Land. And that he used her as above partly upon Account of her refusing to sell a small Estate she had, and his keeping another Woman Company. And that she lately offer'd to call out at the Window to the Neighbours for Relief, and her said Husband then whipped her with a Horse-whip. And the 16th of this Instant December, in the Evening, after her said Husband brought her up some Bread, and she desiring him to bring her some Water-gruel , which he refused, and she being almost starved and tired of her Life with the above Treatment, got out of a Window of the Said Garret, and tumbled down into the Highway, to make an end thereof.</p>

             , High-Constable. On the 17th of December, by Justice Leake's Order, I went to enquire about this Affair. I found the Prisoner in his Loom, and I ask'd him, Why he us'd his Wife in such a Manner? He took me up shortly, and said, He'd never use her better. Upon this I secur'd him, and went to his Wife, who gave me the self same Account, as she did to the Justice upon her Examination. I was present when she sign'd that Examination, and she then seem'd to have some Thoughts of Death; but so perfectly in her Senses, that if the Clerk mistook but a Word in his rough Draught, she always observ'd it, and desir'd it might be corrected; and she repeated it 2 or 3 times, that her Husband refus'd her Water-gruel that Day, and therefore she thought to end her Life by getting out of Window.</p>

             . I went to see the Deceas'd the Morning after she got out of the Window. I found her a Bed, very weak and sore, full of Pain, and in a sad Condition. She was a mere Skeleton to look at, her Body was as black as Wainscot , and there was nothing but Skin over her Bones. She told me she was starv'd for want of Necessaries, and had neither Fire nor Candle, and that he often swore he'd murder her if it was not for the Law. I ask'd her, why she got out of the Window? She said, she thought to make an end of a miserable Life, for she had undergone so much, that she was not able to bear it any longer; that she first attempted to cut her Throat, but the Knife she had was so dull, that she thought it would rather add to her Pain than release her from it. Afterwards she thought to Hang herself, and at another time to strangle herself in the Bed, but at last resolv'd to throw herself from the

            . She told me the same Story several times; the last time I saw her was 3 or 4 Days before her Death. I had no Acquaintance with her before this, when the Prisoner asked me to go up and see her; I said I did not know her, why then, says he, if you don't know her, nor she know you, she'll owe you the less Discourse. He was carried to Prison that Night. I believe she did not die by the fall, but was starved to Death.</p>

            . Justice Leake sent me Word of what had happened to the Deceas'd, she being a Relation of mine. I went to see her next Day, and found her a Bed in the Garret. She was very weak and low, and almost wasted away to nothing but Skin and Bones, I enquir'd why she got out of the Window; she answer'd 'twas to release herself from her Misery and Consinement , and added, that she had been kept there about 18 Months, except a little time (Once) when she was out; that she had neither Fire nor Candle, nor the common Necessaries of Life to subsist; that she was kept with mouldy Bread, hard Crust of Cheese, and Small Beer, and sometimes Meat, but all Cold; that they always set it for her on the Ground, just within her Door, and if she could scramble out of Bed for it she might; and that sometimes she was so Cold that she could not get the Victuals to her Month, but has been forced to let it drop out of her Fingers again; and that she did not dare to call for help, because he threatened to beat her: Her Skin was quite discolour'd, and she look'd like an Anatomy. I visited her 3 or 4 times before her Death, she was in her Senses all along, and never varied in the Accounts she gave me of the ill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140016"/> Usage she receiv'd from her Husband. About 2 Months before this happen'd, I met the Prisoner's Father in White-Chapel, and asked him, where my Kinswoman (the Deceas'd) was? He answer'd, with her Husband. And do they agree any better, says I? Why, says he, I believe she wants for nothing. I told him I was glad of it, for I had heard otherwise before, and that when she went into the Hospital he would allow her nothing, for though he was but a Journeyman Weaver, yet he must have had some Money, because he took in Pawns.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she want for Victuals?</p>
               <p>J. Badily. She had no such Victuals as was fit for a Person in her Case to eat, and then the Room was in such a Condition with her own Nastiness (for she had not Necessaries to case herself, and to keep herself clean,) that the scent of it was very noisome to her.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she receive any Hurt by the fall?</p>
               <p>J. Badily. She told me she thought she had not, and I did not find that she was bruised.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What did you say to me when I was in New-Prison?</p>
               <p>J. Badily. The Prisoner talk'd of coming to an Agreement with me. She had a small Estate of about 7 or 8 l. a Year, and he offer'd that that should be made over to me if she would consent, and that he would allow me 3s. a Week more to maintain her; but this was after he was taken up.</p>

            . I went to the Deceased after her Fall, and found her in a very weak and lamentable Condition. She shew'd me her Legs and Breast; she was nothing but Skin and Bones; her Skin was all black, and she look'd just like an Anatomy that I have seen at a Surgeon's. She told me she got out of Window to rid her self of a miserable Life. I asked why she did not send word to me, or some of her Neighbours, to come and help her? She said she had no Body to send, and if she knock'd or call'd for Help, the Prisoner would come up and horse-whip her. There was a Half-Peck Loaf hung up in her Room, but it was dry and mouldy; and several odd bits of Cheese lay about on the Ground, but she said her Stomach was so bad that she could not eat any of it. O Conson , said she, no Tongue can express, nor Heart conceive, the deplorable Miseries that I have felt! I have been lock'd up in this Room for a Year and a half, perishing with Hunger and Cold, and in want of the common Necessaries of Life. In the Extremity of Winter, without Candle! without Fire! without Conveniences to ease my self! without Water to keep me clean, or Covering that would keep me Warm! continually languishing, unable to help my self, and yet without a Friend to help me! to comfort me! to pity me! In this Condition, tho' I have hardly had Strength to get out of my Bed, my Victuals, cold! and hard! and mouldy! has been brought but just within my Door, and there left upon the Ground, by the Creature that keeps Company with my Husband. I have been forced to crawl thither on my Hands and Knees, and when I have got to it, my Fingers have been so benunim'd with Cold, that I have not been able to lift it to my Head, but have been necessitated to take it up from the Ground with my Mouth, and then it was seldom that I could eat it! And sometimes I have been unable to creep back to my Bed again, so that I have been obliged to lie at the Door all Night, in the midst of Winter! Many a time I have begg'd for God's sake for a little warm Beer; and once, and but once, it was brought me. I had no better Place to case my self in that the Chimney, and there it used to be piled up together, so that not being able to bear the Smell, I have often been forced to lie with my Nose under the Pillow. Once I threw a little Water (which I had in a broken Pan) out of Window; for which he came up and horse me. O! Mr. Vezey , said I, you can ease your self where you please! you don't know what it is to want such Conveniences, sure if you did you would never use me thus! He damn'd me for an old stinking Bitch, and swore if it was not for the Law he would murder me; and so went away again. You see, Consin, how my Hair is matted together ; he will not allow me so much as a Comb. I am almost devour'd with Vermin, they have eat Holes in my Head. My Hair was so troublesome to me that I have taken a great deal of Pains to cut some of it off with an old rusty Knife. My own Filthiness has been intolerable to me. This, and much more, more than I can speak, I have suffer'd; because I was not willing to part with that little Estate of mine.</p>
               <p>After the Deceased had given me this Account, I desired her to consider with her self that she was a dying Woman, and therefore ought to be very careful that she spoke nothing but the Truth. Consin , said she again I have told you the Truth, and nothing but Truth; I have suffer'd more than I can tell you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140017"/> and yet I never called him any thing worse than Mr. Vezey. When I wanted any thing with him, I always said, Mr. Vezy , pray let me speak with you; and his common Answer was, Damn you, for a Bitch; if it was not for the Law I would murder you.</p>
               <p>Court. Was not the Fall the Cause of her Death?</p>
               <p>A. Badily . I ask'd her that Question, and she answer'd, No; I felt no Hurt whatever by the Fall, but I feel an inward Sinking and Decay, for want of the common Necessaries of Life; and I assure you, Consin , on the Word of a dying Person, that I am starved to Death; for tho' I had some Victuals, it was such that in my weak Condition I could not sufficiently eat of to support Nature. And she begg'd of me to get a Minister; and I have since been very sorry that I did not do it at that time, but I did not then think she was so near her End. When I went into her Room (tho' it had been clean'd out but a little before) the Scent of it was so offensive that I could hardly bear it. She offer'd to kiss me, but she was in such a sad Condition, and smelt so strong, that I was obliged to decline it. The Creature that belong'd to the House was almost constantly with her, to hear what she said, and to keep her from speaking, as much as she could. As for the Prisoner, I know little of him, and never had any Conversation with him. Whenever I talk'd with the Deceased on this Occasion, she constantly gave me the same Account, and never varied in the Circumstances of any one thing that she repeated.</p>

That they set the Victuals on the Ground just within the Door, and that sometimes she was so weak that she could not get to it. She was very sensible.

            , Brother to the Deceased. Last November was a Twelvemonth, I found my Sister (the Deceased) in Forestreet, begging a Dish of Broth. I took her home with me, and kept her about a Fortnight; but being a poor labouring Man, I could not afford to maintain her any longer, and she being willing to go home again, I went with her to her Husband, and as soon as ever she came in he turn'd her up Stairs, and said, Get up, you damn'd Bitch, to your Room, and there you shall starve, and never come out till you are brought out on four Mens Shoulders. I went to see her sometimes on a Sunday; for as I was a working Man I could not spare time to go any other Day. She had no Shoes on her Bed, and was full of Vermin. When the Prisoner was at home he used to go up with me, but when he was abroad I could not get in, for he commonly took the Key with him. I offer'd to take her home, if he would allow me for her Maintenance, and take my Bond that she should not be sent home to him again; but he would not take my single Bond, and I could get no Body to be bound with me.</p>
               <p>Court. 'Tis very strange that you should know your Sister was treated in this manner, and not complain to a Magistrate .</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140018"/>Harrison. Why, I did speak of it to some People, and they told me that no Body could hinder him from locking his Wife up if he had a mind to it, for she was his Goods, and he might do what he would with her; and I was a poor Man, and could not afford to go to Law.</p>
               <p>Court. What Reason did he give for using her thus?</p>
               <p>Harrison. Because she would not part with a small Matter in the Country; and he told me, if she would but do that he would make her a happy Woman.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you never sollicite him to let her have her Liberty?</p>
               <p>Harrison. Yes; I talk'd with him about it the latter End of the Summer, and he told me, if I'd take her home he'd allow me 18 Pence a Week; but I said she was then so weak that I cou'd not get her home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the Man-in-the-Moon Tavern in White-Chapel, I offered to settle the Estate upon him and his Brother, and allow him 2 s. a Week to keep her. Mr. Martin the Attorney was there at the same time.</p>
               <p>Harrison. Yes, he did so; but that was the Year the King was crown'd, and the Attorney said I must give Security to maintain her; and I said I could give none: And as for the Estate he talks of, that was seiz'd by my Brother, and I had no Money to go to Law about it.</p>

             went up with me to see my Wife, he said he would rather live in a Jail than live as she did. Says I, You talk as if you did not know what a Jail is. Why, says he, here's Victuals and Drink indeed, but in a Jail I should have Company.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I first married this Wife I was a Journeyman Weaver, and I took the Man-in-the-Moon Ale-house in Skinners Street; and no Couple could live more lovingly, for she was as good a temper'd Woman as ever trod Shoe of Leather. But she begun to wrong me in my Alehouse, so that I have miss'd a Guinea at a time; and she would take my Linen away and carry it out of Doors; and tho' I was a good Husband, and very careful and sparing, yet I found I was run out above 60 Pounds, for I was a 100 and odd Pounds in debt, and had but 30 Pounds to pay it with, and I was hard press'd for Money, and wept bitterly; and yet I could not believe my own Eyes, for she had got such a fair deluding Tongue, that I loved her as I loved my Life. And she took this Linen -</p>
               <p>Mrs. Badily . It was none of your Linen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She took this Linen, and a matter of 19 Pounds in Money and Rings, and a Counterpain and other Things, and put them all in a Trunk, and sent them to the Three Goats-Heads in White-Chapel; but as God would have it, I got Intelligence, and fetch'd them all back again. Then I open'd the Trunk, and look'd over the Goods, and told the Money, and said, Mary , I desire that you would not carry my Things out at this rate, but let my own House hold my own, and if we can get Money let us keep it, there they are all again! do so no more; She cry'd sadly, and said, She did it for fear they should be seiz'd, and desir'd me to give her the 3 Rings, which I did to make her easy, and when she got them she said, This is for such a One, and this for such a One, and this for such a One; Zounds! Says I, yes, my Lord, I did say Zounds, that I did, Zounds! Says I, and which is for me? Then she cry'd again sadly for a Broad-Piece, which was my former Wife's, and I told her, If she cry'd her Heart out she should never have it; but if she had a mind to look at it now and then she should and welcome. At another time I look'd under the Bed, and pull'd out a Handkerchief, and there was 25 s. in Half-pence, all but 2 naughty Farthings, and under the Drawers I found another with 17 l. in Silver in it; this was 13 Months after we were married. Then she lent 30. in my Name to one Mackey, and she has I believe a great many Things out that I shall never hear of, and that's the Reason that I confin'd her. She had me Arrested by Mr. Badily ; she left my House, and I put her in the Postman to invite her Home, and once I gave half a Guinea only for the Sight of her, and then I could not have her away. After this she came again, and said, she was come to live with me; and I said, Mary, come and welcome, if so be you will live honestly, and not rob me; she made many fair Promises, and I believ'd her again. I would have set her up in a little Brandy-Shop, in Bell-Yard, but she did not like the House: Then she pilfer'd from me again; if I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140019"/> but a Farthing's-worth of Oatmeal, she would steal some of it, and hide it. I verily believe, that at times, she has robb'd me of above a Quart of Oatmeal in this manner, and then she would steal my Butter, and Pudding, and Soap, and the Lord knows how many Things. and hide them upon the Bed's-Teaster, as if that was a Place to put Victuals in. But she would be doing, God knows, tho' it was but a little.</p>

            . I know nothing of that, I am a feeble old Man, I never was up in her Room in my Life, and I never saw the Deceas'd but that once when her Brother brought her Home, and then she was very thin and poor.</p>
               <p>Ann Crew [Drew] a Washerwoman . When I have been washing at Finlow's House, I have seen them carry up Plates of Victuals, such as they had themselves for Dinner, and as much as I could eat, and seen them bring the empty Plates down again. I have been up in her Room 4 Times. The first Time I went up, she complained for Beer, and said, she was almost parched up with Drought. I told the Prisoner of it, and he took no Notice of it at first, but I speaking to him again, he made me go up, and then Mrs. Finlow was there, and shewed me 4 or 5 Bottles of Beer. I asked the Deceas'd why she complained for Drink when she had so much? she said, She let it stand there because she lov'd to have it stale, and to drink it one under another.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see those Bottles when you first went up? Crew. No; I was not in the Room then, for he was gone out, and had the Key with him: She spoke to me through the Door. The next Time I went up, I swept the Room, and made the Bed. Court. What kind of Bedding had she? Crew. There was 1 Sheet, 3 Blankets, and a Counterpain; they were good tidy Blankets, fit for a poor Body's Bed. I washed her Shifts. Court . How often? Crew. As often as she soul'd them. Court. That's not the Question. How often have you washed them? Crew. Why, my Lord, she would not always soul them: She said, she would not wear them out, because she was willing to keep them to go into the Hospital; and so she cut the Sheets, and pinned the Pieces about her instead of a Shift. Court. You will not answer the Question. Crew. I have washed 2 Shirts. Court. Did you wash any Sheets for her? every Month, or two Months. Crew. I cannot say how often; but I have washed Sheets. She had 9 Caps. Court. And how often have you washed Caps for her? Crew. As often as she soul'd them; but she would not soul them. Court. When you went up, how did you get in? Crew. With other Company; my Mistress let me in: But the last Time the Key was in the Door, and I got in myself, and carried her up a Couple of Eggs and a Rosher of Bacon; and she said, Very well. This was about 9 or 10 Weeks before she died. Court. What Conveniencies had she? Crew. A Chamber-pot, and a Pan to spit in. I swept the Room after she fell down; I never saw any Ordure about the Room, nor any Nastiness in it but Dust. This is one of her Aprons - and this one of her Handkerchiefs - The Deceas'd gave them me for laying her out. She had 18 Handkerchiefs, 2 colour'd Aprons, and 1 Muslin Apron; they were in a Trunk in her Garret, and I did not see that the Trunk was lock'd. I never saw her out of Bed but once, and then I peeped through the Key-hole, and she was standing on the Floor.</p>

             . I have been divers Times in the Room, and always - almost - found the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140021"/> Key in the Door. I eat and drank with her sometimes. I have clean'd her Room, made her Bed, washed her and shifted her; she had tolerable good Shifts; and a Month afterwards, which was the Morning she got out of the Window, I found her without a Shift; says I, why do you go so? Because, says she, I can't bear a Shift. I have eat and drank with her many and many a Time, and have carried her up, Fish, Flesh, and Fowl, hot, and sat by her Bed-side while she eat it. She had a very good Stomach, and eat heartily, till latterly. I went up with Dr. Scurry, when he came to see her: He asked her how she did? and said, it is a Mercy that you got no more Hurt when you fell out of the Window; and she answer'd, I know nothing of it. About 3 Months before her Fall, I would have taken her to keep at my House, and her Husband offered to give me 3 s. a Week, but she would not consent, and said, she would stay where she was. About a Year before her Fall, she went out, and said, she would go to her Kinsman, who owed her 100l. she staid a Fortnight, and then her Brother brought her home, and a Porter came with them with a Bundle. Her Brother desired the Prisoner to pay the Porter for bringing the Bundle, but he refus'd till he saw what it was, and when it was opened, it was nothing but a Bundle of Rags.</p>

I have seen the Prisoner carry up hot Victuals from Dinner several times, both roast and boil'd; I have desired her to let me know if she wanted any thing, but she made no Complaint, and her Husband was not then with me. I have carry'd her up Victuals myself, since she fell off the House. She was lock'd up for robbing him, and carrying away his Trunk; and other Things.</p>

I went up and found a Plate of Victuals; it was part of a Fillet of Veal, and boiled Bag Plumb-pudding. Says she, I think what I eat turns to Phlegm. Says I, can you eat any of this? What is it, says she? I han't look'd on it yet. 'Tis Veal and Pudding, says I; then give it me, says she; and so she eat the Pudding, but says she, I don't care for the Meat now, set it down. Do you want any thing, says I? No, says she, only I forgot to ask Mr. Finlow to spit in. I told Mrs. Finlow of it, and she she'd go to Town on the Morrow, and buy some thing fit for that Use. This was about 5 Months, ago. I afterwards called on a Worky-day the Prisoner was gone to Bromley, and Mrs. Finlow was frying a couple of Mutton-chops; is that your Father's Dinner, says I?

No, says she, I would not have you believe any such Thing, for I had hot Meat, both roast and boil'd, every Day, or every other Day, as good as any Body could desire to eat.

               <p>Mr. Scurry. Surgeon. I never ask'd her why she throw'd herself off of the House; Mr. Dawson<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140023"/> and I indeed enquir'd about the Loaf, and she said she ty'd it up her self, to keep the Mice from it. I went to see her the Day after her Fall, and found no Contusion or Fracture, or any thing like it. She had a Difficulty of breathing, and a Cough, attended with a great Spitting, an ill Habit of Body, was very weak and asthmatic, and prodigiously emaciated. I order'd her Panada, and such kind of thin Diet. When I open'd her, I perceiv'd no inward Contusion, nor extravasated Blood. Upon opening the Thorax I found her Lungs much decay'd, and an Adhesion on the Left Side. 'Tis frequent to find an Adhesion, a Decay of the Lungs, and a general Waste, in Consumptions, for these are the common Symptoms.</p>

               <p>Mr. Coldham . No, I believe not; tho' I never examin'd the Body of a Person that dy'd for Want. The Lungs might be entire , for tho' the Body is emaciated, it does not follow that the Intestines must be corrupted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mackenny , Surgeon. I examin'd the Body with Mr. Scurry , and his Opinion agreed with mine, that she dy'd of an Asthama .</p>
               <p>Mr. Scurry . I had heard the Report of her being starved, and asked her if it was true, she said she had Victuals, but complain'd of her Consinement.</p>

On Sunday the 14th of February last, about 10 in the Morning, as I was going from my House to the Church, in a publick Way, about a Quarter of a Mile from the Church, and a 100 Yards from the Houses, I was stopp'd by the Prisoner, who came out of a Lane Parallel with the Road. He presented a Pistol, and said, If I spoke a Word he would shoot me dead. He took half a Crown from me, and other lose Money, besides a GEOGIUS Half-penny, (an R being wanting in the Name) which were all in a Silk-Purse, and from the little Finger of my Left Hand, he took a Gold Ring with a Cornelian Stone, impress'd with a Mole, which was my Grandmother's Coat of Arms, and then he return'd to the Lane he came out of; I would have gone back into the Road, but with his Pistol he oblig'd me to go to Church. Since which, he was committed by Justice Bobun of Enfield , for an Assault, with Intent to commit a Robbery. I saw him last Sunday in Newgate. The Keeper refus'd to let me see him alone, but call'd all the Prisoners and made them pass by me. I pick'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140024"/> him out from the others. The Keeper said that Man's Name was West; but, says I, let his Newgate Name be what it will, I know him perfectly well, for he was not disguis'd when he robb'd me.</p>

Upon this the first of them ran away; but the Prisoner taking up his Hat and Wig, swore at me, snatch'd my Pocket off, push'd me up towards the Wall , and brnised my Thigh against a Post, and ran away. I scream'd out, and follow'd him, and catch'd hold of his Sleeve, upon which he swung my Pocket to me again, and with struggling he got from me, and left the Cuff of his Sleeve in my Hand - here it is.</p>

               <p>[At the Desire of the Prisoners, the Witnesses against them were examined apart.]</p>
               <p>Job Nutton. About 7 a Clock, last Wednesday Night, I was going along Fleet-street, to my Master (who was at the Bull-head Tavern at Temple-bar) and, on this Side Shoe Lane, there were two Girls, who were singing Ballads; and a Gentleman threatned to beat the Girls, because some-body had pick'd his Pocket. I stood a little to see what was the Matter, when Quan (the tallest of the Prisoners) stoop'd down before me, and took up Half a Crown. Sir, says he to me, I believe 'tis a good one; let's go to the Light at that Shop-window, and see, and, if it is, I'll give you Half a Pint. We went; he rubb'd some of the wet Dirt off: It was a very remarkable Piece; it was bent, and look'd as if a Coach-wheel had ran over it. Sir, says he, pray lend me another Half-Crown to compare with it. I did so. He rubb'd 'em one upon the other, and said, I find 'tis good, and for Luck's sake, I'll treat you. I have a Friend lives at the upper-end of this Court (we were then at the lower-end of Bolt-Court) where we can have a Glass of good Wine. - Come, Sir, I'll shew you the Way. I was got but a little up the Court, when Conway (the short, lame Prisoner) clapp'd a Pistol to my Breast, and said, Damn you, Sir, deposit. Quan presented another Pistol, at the same Time; and Conway put his Right-hand into my Left Pocket, and took out 3 Guineas, and 20s. A Woman came up the Court. Quan swore, if I made the least Noise, he would shoot me thro' the Head. When she was pass'd, Conway said, Damn you Sir, you have got a Watch, we must have that; and began to search for it. The String of my Watch was thrust into my Fob, so that they could not get at it readily; and more Company coming up the Court, Conway walk'd off, and Quan took me by the Shoulder, led me into the Street, bade me go forward quietly, and swore, if I offer'd to speak, or turn back, he would be my Death. I went to my Master at Temple-bar, and from thence to the Queen's-head in Red-Lion-Court, in Long-Acre, where I related what had happen'd, and described the Prisoners so perfectly, that some in the Company said, they knew 'em by the Description, and would send for Mr. Haton, the Constable, who knew their Haunts, and would take 'em. Mr. Haton came; I gave him the same Description, and he apprehended 'em at a Baudy-house the same Night, and they were carried before a Justice. I swore to Quan, and to the bent Half-crown, which was taken upon him. I was a little scrupulous of swearing too positively against Conway, that Night, on account of his Crutch, For, when Conway robb'd me, he stooped to take the Money out of my Pocket, and I took Notice that his Crutch reached above the Bend of his Arm, and when he was brought before the Justice, I thought that his Crutch, (which was a short Hand-crutch) appear'd to be shorter than it was over Night; but, next Morning, I consider'd, that the Difference consisted only in the Position of his Body; for, when he stooped, his Crutch might reach above the Bend of his Arm, tho', when he stood upright, it would reach no higher than his Hand. My Scruple about his Crutch being thus removed (for I had no doubt as to his Person) I was fully satisfied, and swore to him as positively as to the other, and I am now certain, that the Prisoners are the two Men that robbed me in Bolt-Court last Wednesday Night. I saw Quan plainly at the Shop-window when we look'd at the Half-crown; and I saw them both, when they took my Money, by a Light that came from Bolt-Court Coffee-house. They had light natural Wigs on then, tho' now they have got dark Wigs to disguise themselves.</p>
               <p>Conway. Was not you drinking, and playing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140031"/> at Cards with me, at the Mourning-Bush Tavern, at Aldersgate, the Day before you say we robbed you?</p>
               <p>Nutton. No: I never was in your Company before you robbed me.</p>
               <p>Quan. When you was before the Justice, you, at first, said, that you could not swear positively to either of us.</p>
               <p>Nutton. When I first came into the Room, at the Justice's, there was but one Candle, and you stood on one Side of me, so that I had not then a full View of your Face. Three more Candles were brought in; the Half-crown was shewn me, which I knew at first Sight, and swore to be the same that we look'd on at the Shop-window. Then I turned about, and saw you; and, as soon as I had looked you full in the Face, I was certain, and swore positively that you was the Man.</p>
               <p>Quan. What Hour was it when (as you say) you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Nutton. About 7, or between 7 and 8 at Night.</p>

            , Constable. About 9 a Clock, on Wednesday last, a Gentleman came to me, and told me, that a young Man, who was at the Queen's-Head in Red-Lion-Court, had been robb'd. I went thither, and found the Prosecutor, who gave me so exact a Description of the Persons who had robb'd him, that I presently believ'd the Prisoners to be the Men. He said, That near Bolt-Court in Fleet-street, the tallest of the two Rogues stooped down before him, and took up a Half-crown; That they went to a Shop-window, to see if it was good: It was dirty, bent in the Middle, and bruised in the Head; That this Rogue offer'd to treat him with Half a Pint for Luck's sake, and carried him up Bolt-Court, where a short, thick, lame Rogue clapp'd a Pistol to his Breast, and bade him deposit: The tall Rogue presented another Pistol; the lame Rogue rifled him; a Woman came up the Court; the tall Rogue threatned to shoot him, if he spoke; the lame Rogue felt for his Watch, but the String being in his Fob, and other People coming by, he went off; and then the tall Rogue, taking him (the Prosecutor) by the Shoulder, led him down the Court, and bade him go off quietly, or he was a dead Man. - I knew the Prisoners Haunts, and taking two Men to assist me, I went in search of 'em to

            's (a notorious Baudy-house) in Holsford's Alley in Drury-lane. This was abouthalf an Hour after Ten. I found no Body at Home but a Woman. I took a Turn in the Neighbourhood , and, posting my two Assistants in a proper Place (to avoid Suspicion) I came to the same House again. It was then about 10 or 15 Minutes past 11, and found 'em both sitting by the Fire. T hey asked me how I did, and if I had any thing to say to them? I pretended that I had got a Warrant to search for a Woman. They said, they believed them were more Whores and Thieves in Fleet-street, than in Drury-lane. I went out again to see for my Assistants, and ordered one of them to go into the Court, at one End, and one at the other, and so meet at Thomson's Door. At my return, Quan was standing at the End of the Alley: I seized him, and searching his Pockets, found some Gold and Silver, and this very batter'd, bent Half-crown. One of his Madams, who was standing by him, lent me this Paper to wrap it in. Then we went into the House, and took Conway. They have followed the Trade of dropping Half-crowns a pretty while. We carried them before Justice Mitford, and sent for the Prosecutor. When the Prosecutor came in, there was but one Candle, but three more were brought, and Quan was standing on one Side of the Prosecutor. I shew'd the batter'd Half-crown to the Prosecutor, and as soon as he saw it, he said, I'll swear to this. The Justice bade him see if he knew any Body there. He turned about, and taking a full View of Quan's Face, he swore positively, that Quan was one of 'em. You Rascal, says Quan, do you say that I held a Pistol to you? I never saw you in my Life. The Prosecutor, turning to Conway, said, And I believe this to be the other; but when he stooped to take the Money out of my Pocket, I thought his Crutch was longer then, than it appears to be now. To which Conway answer'd much as Quan had done; You Rascal, did I hold a Pistol to you? I never saw your Face before. And yet, next Day, one of 'em said to the Prosecutor, How could you be such a Rascal, to swear we robb'd you, when we won the Money of you at Cards, at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140032"/> Mourning-Bush at Aldgate - Aldgate! said the other, No; it was Aldersgate, and the Drawer will swear it.

            . I went with the Constable to take the Prisoners. When they were examined before the Justice, they both said to the Prosecutor, Ye Rascal, did we hold Pistols to you? We never saw you in our Lives. But next day they both said they had won it of him at Cards, at the Mourning-Bush , the Day before the Robbery was committed.</p>

               <p>Quan. Last Tuesday Night, as I was going along Fleetstreet , I found Half-a-Crown, and taking it up, the Prosecutor cry'd Halves! I told him that as he was by when I took it up, I would give him half a Pint, with all my Heart; and in going along we met Conway , and so we all three went to the Mourning-Bush at Aldersgate, where we play'd at Cards, and staid till between 1 and 2 in the Morning.</p>

They were both to be Godfathers, but I suppose they came by Accident now, for I know of no Invitation. I never saw them before that Night. They went up one Pair of Stairs into the Room where she lay-in. She was a-bed and asleep. I desired them not to disturb her, and told them that

My Master pursued her: I met him as he was bringing her back, and he told me she was got about 100 Yards towards Buckingham-House when he took her. She deny'd that she had the Watch.</p>

               <p>Whitby . She did not pretend then that it was given her, but when he brought her into the Room to search her, I observ'd that she kept down her right Arm, and examining under that Armpit, I felt the Watch, and said, Here it is! But, says she, if you take it, I'll swear a Robbery against you. Then the Prosecutor took it out of her Bosom.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been but three Weeks in London, and was in St. James's-Park when the Prosecutor came up, and ask'd if I was a Quaker? No, Sir, says I.

Why, Child, says he, I am a Gentleman's Butler, and can provide you with a Place if you will go along with me. The Gentleman being a Stranger I refused to go with him for a good while; but at last, being willing to get into Business, I was over-persuaded, and he brought me to the View of Oxford, which I have since heard is a very ill House: There he began to be very rude, and offer'd to put his - I am ashamed to speak it - his Hands up my Petticoats. - I gave him! to understand, that if he did not behave himself civilly, and like a Gentleman, I would leave the Room. Whereof he said, he had not much Money about him, but if I would oblige him so and so, he would leave his Watch in my Hands till he help'd me to a Guinea. I was in a great Straight what to do; I was out of Service, and had no Money, nor any Acquaintance in Town, but Mr. Oakes and his Wife in Swallow-street, and so at last, when he had given me his Watch for a Pledge, I did let him have his Will to the full; and after he had fulfill'd his Desire, he asked me several odious, filthy Questions, which my Modesty will not let me repeat. Then I desir'd him to take his Watch, and let me have the Guinea that he promis'd me; but he said, he had but a Shilling in his Pocket, and half of it must pay for the Wine, and a Groat for Cakes, and he would give me the rest. I told him Two-pence was very short of a Guinea. He said, if I would go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140035"/> and fetch some Rods to whip him, he would send for the Guinea. I told him I did not know what he meant by such Discourse, and that that was no Place to get Rods in; and so I went out, and Mr. Figg follow'd, and brought me in again. I did not deny the Watch, and Figg took it out of my right Bosom, and then they sent for

               <p>Gerrard Russel. Between 10 and 12 at Night, on Christmas-Eve, I had Occasion to go to - do - my Occasions. I had a pair of Breeches under my Arm besides those on my - those that I wore. And as I was couching down (in Hanging-Sword-Alley in Fleet-street) the Prisoner came up to me, and very immodestly put her Hand betwixt my Legs. The first thing that she laid hold on was my - my Watch-String, and she held it so fast, and Jugg'd it so hard, that tho' I catch'd hold of it myself to save it, I thought in my Conscience she would have pull'd it off - and so indeed she did at last [for what could a Man do with such a Woman when his Breeches were down? She got my Watch out, but the Hook of it hitch'd in my Fob. Damn you, says she, I never had such a Tustle for a Watch in my Life; and with that she gave me a punch, and push'd me clever backwards, and then the Swivel broke , and away she run a-cross the Way. I got up, but had not Presence of Mind to cry Stop Thief; and so she made off with my Watch, and I afterward , found the String in the Alley. She was three Minutes a struggling with me.</p>

             (my Fellow-Servant ) was waiting for some Bread and Cheese , which the Deceas'd had called for. I sent him to the Gunsmith's , and carried in the Bread and Cheese myself , and leaving it there , I went and dress'd myself : When I was dress'd I went in again and stirred up the Fire . The Prisoner said to the Deceas'd, Turner, Why don't you send for your Sword? the Deceas'd answer'd, You know the Reason why ; 'tis because I have got no Money. And the Prisoner reply'd , Damn your Blood, you know that I have Money enough. The Deceas'd rung the Bell, and called for Pen, Ink, and Paper, which was brought, and I went out. I did not see the Pistols brought, but between 12 and 1, as I was standing at the Street-Door (which is a Pannel distant from the Door of the Room where the Deceas'd and the Prisoner were) I heard a Pistol go off, at which I was startded, and flew from the Door to the Kennel, and presently be thought myself of the Pistols that were sent for about an Hour and a half before.</p>
               <p>Council. Before the Pistol went off, did you hear any Noise in the Room like struggling?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I heard a Noise in the Room just before like walking about, but not like struggling. Immediately after the Pistol went off, the Prisoner came out of the Room, and pulled the Door to, twice, to shut it; He look'd as white and as pale as Death, and came hastily out at the Street-Door .</p>
               <p>Council. Did any Body stand in his Way?</p>
               <p>Nichols. There was an Oyster-girl putting up her Oysters at the Door; he pushed her aside, but did not push her down, and then made his Way up Church-Court .</p>
               <p>Council. Did he run?</p>
               <p>Nichols . No; he stagger'd, and seem'd to be so frighted that he could not run. My Master presently came to the Door, and asked which Way he went? I told him, and he order'd the Potter to pursue. My Master and the Porter run up the Court, but return'd and said, they could not see him.</p>
               <p>Council . Do you know why they called for Pen and Ink?</p>
               <p>Nichols . The Porter told me it was to send for a Sword.</p>
               <p>Council. Who did you see in the Room when you first went in?</p>
               <p>Nichols . No Body but the Prisoner and the Deceas'd; but the other Drawer told me there had been a Woman with them before I came.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you go into the Room soon after the Pistol went off?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes; in less than a Minute : The Deceas'd was sitting on the Ground betwixt two Chairs, with his Back against the Window; his right Hand was near his Knee , and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140037"/> the Pistol lying on the Ground, within two or three Inches of his right Hand, with the Cock next his Hand, and the Muzzle from him. I saw Blood run out at his right Ear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The first Time you went into the Room, did you not observe Mr. Turner, the Deceas'd, walking in a melancholly-mad Posture?</p>
               <p>Nichols. When I first went in, he was walking gravely, and the second time he was singing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I come out of the Room before you got off of the Steps at the Door?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I was by the Kennel-side when I first saw you come out, and pull the Door to, twice.</p>

            , Master of the King's-Arms Tavern . I did not see the Prisoner come into my House, but about 11 o'Clock I saw him come out of the Room and hand Mrs. Falkingham into a Coach, and then return into the Room. I was not in the Room all the Time, till the Deceas'd was Dead. My Drawer told me, that two Gentlemen had order'd a pair of Pistols, and then, and not before, I knew that there were two in the Room. I was in the Kitchen when the Pistol went off, and my Cook said, I'll be hang'd if they have not shot one another. My Cook ran immediately and open'd the Door; I followed and looked in, and seeing the Deceas'd lying on the Ground, I flew after the Prisoner; I run up Church-Court with all Expedition, but could not get Sight of him; when I return'd I found the Deceas'd sitting on the Ground, his Head leaning to the left Side, which was towards that Side of the Room where the Door was, and the Blood was streaming from the Wound.</p>
               <p>Council. When the Prisoner handed Mrs. Falkingham into the Coach, did you see any Sword that she had with her?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bently . No.</p>
               <p>Council. Had the Deceas'd any Sword on after he was shot?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bently .

               <p>Prisoner. Was the Deceas'd's Back close to the Wainscot?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bently. Yes; quite close</p>

The Gunsmith's young Man came with a Pair, and carry'd them in; but I don't know how long he staid, for I did not see him come out again. The Bell was rung again, I went in, and the Deceas'd bid me go and see why the Gunsmith did not make haste with the other Pistols; I went, and met his Man coming down Lancaster-Court with a larger Pair, which he carry'd into the Room .

             . I am 'Prentice with Mrs. Goldfinch, a Child's Coat and Mantua-Maker , in Johnson's Court, in Fleet-Street. Mrs. Falkingham lodges at our House. On Thursday the 6th of this Month, about 2 in the Afternoon, Mr. Hiller and the Deceas'd came to Mrs. Falkingham's ; they went away again, and return'd in about half an Hour. The Deceas'd came about 5; between 5 and 6 Mr. Hiller and he quarrel'd prodigiously, they had very high Words, and talked of going to fight the next Day. The Prisoner desir'd them to be Friends, and not talk of Fighting. With much ado he persuaded them to agree, and they appear'd to be pretty well reconcil'd about Six, and sent for a Bottle of Wine, and drank to one another, and all was like to be well. I went into the Parlour, and soon after Mr. Hiller came down, and went away. It was not long before I heard a fresh Noise above; I went up and found them all 3 standing, the Prisoner, the Deceas'd, and Mrs. Falkingham. The Prisoner said, Sir, (or Damn you, Sir, I don't know which) bring Sword and Pistol; and the Deceas'd answer'd, I'll come ready arm'd. With that I came down, and they all 3 soon follow'd, and the 2 Men went into the Court, and began to quarrel and make a Noise. The Deceas'd was standing near the Door, and the Prisoner walking at a Distance. I desir'd them, if they had any thing to say, that they would come in, and not speak so loud to make a Disturbance in the Neighbourhood. The Deceas'd would not come in, but the Prisoner did, tho' he presently went out again, and then they went together down the Court, and thro' the Arch that leads to Gough's-Square. Neither of them had Sword or Pistol. Mrs. Falkingham said, they were going to fight, and sent me after them to bring them back. I took hold of the Prisoner's Arm, and desir'd him to return, but he forc'd himself from me, and went forward. The Deceas'd follow'd, and in going I heard him Name the Word Whore ; but who he meant I don't know. Between 8 and 9 I went down into the Kitchin, and found the Deceased walking about in great Disorder , and beating his Breast in a violent Passion . I asked him what was the Matter? He struck his Hand very hard upon his Breast , and said, You cannot tell; but it lies here - Damn her! she has done her worst , for she has set two Men to kill me. He named no Names, but I thought by the Word her, he might mean Mrs. Falkingham .</p>
               <p>Council. It seems the Deceased was there late and early, did he lodge at Mrs. Falkingham's ?</p>
               <p>Thrasher. No; Mrs. Falkingham is a married Woman, and has lodged at our House 3 quarters of a Year. Mr. Hiller used to come to see her sometimes, but he has not been so long acquainted with her as the other two. The Prisoner used to come oftner than Mr. Hiller, but the Deceased frequented the House more than both of 'em. Mrs. Falkingham hearing what a Passion the Deceased was in, came down. He made a great Noise at her, so that she said she would go out, that she might prevent a Disturbance in the Neighbourhood. He begg'd her to stay, because, he said, Mr. Noakes (the Prisoner) was coming. She told him she'd stay for no Noakes, but go directly. His Sword lay in the Kitchin; she bid me take care of it, and lay it in her Room; and if Mr. Noakes came, to tell him they were gone to the King's-Arms in the Strand. The Prisoner came about an Hour after, and asked-if Mrs. Falkingham was within? I told him, No; she was gone with Mr. Turner (the Deceased) to the King's-Arms Tavern. He said, Very well: And seemed dubious whether he should go to them or not, and did not appear to be resolved when he went away.</p>
               <p>Council. Had the Prisoner a Sword on then?</p>
               <p>Thrasher. I am not certain; but about 11, or later, a Porter brought this Letter to me.</p>

I remembered what had hapned over Night , and asked the Porter if there was any Quarrel between the Gentlemen? and he said, No. The Porter came again before One, and enquir'd what was the Gentleman's Name who sent for the Sword? I ask'd him his Reason, and he told me he was shot. Then I directed him where he might hear of the Gentleman's Friends.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you let the Prisoner know that you had carried the Deceased's Sword into Mrs. Falkingham's Chamber.</p>
               <p>Thrasher. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was there not a Quarrel between Mr. Hiller and the Deceased, on the Wednesday before the Accident?</p>
               <p>Thrasher. Yes, a great one, and they fought in Hyde-Park. It begun on Sunday Night. Mr. Turner (the Deceased) dined with Mrs. Falkingham, and after Dinner they went out, and return'd with Mr. Hiller, and they were all free and good-humour'd. The Deceased and Mrs. Falkingham order'd me to deny her to the Prisoner, if he came; and so I did. He went from the Door, but turning back presently, said, How could you deny Mrs. Falkingbam ? Says I, She is not within. Who's above in the Dining-Room? says he. Why there's Mr. Turner, says I. And with that the Prisoner went up, and found Mr. Turner and Mr. Hiller, but Mrs. Falkingham was retir'd, because the Prisoner should not see her. The Prisoner and the Deceased were good Friends; they ask'd one another how they did? and the Prisoner sat down. Mrs. Falkingham desir'd me to tell Mr. Hiller to go away, and come again in a little time, that so she might get rid of the Prisoner, who she thought would not stay when Mr. Hiller was gone. I took an Opportunity of letting him know her Mind. He went away; and both the Prisoner and the Deceased followed. Mr. Hiller return'd before Supper, and while he was there the Deceased came up, and flew into a violent Passion; Now, says he, I am a happy Man! I have met my best Friend, Mr. Noakes! (the Prisoner) He's the best Friend I have in the World! for now I have found her out! Then he desired Mr. Hiller to go with him to White's Coffee-house in Chancery Lane. Mrs. Falkingham said that he should not go, and the Deceased said that he should; For, says he, I have given Mr. Noakes my Honour upon it that you was not at Home to day when you was deny'd to him, and I have engaged, on Forfeiture of a Crown (which I have left in his Hands) that I will bring Mr. Hiller to vouch it; and therefore he shall go with me. Well, says Mrs. Falkingham, if you will force Mr. Hiller to go with you, I will go too, and let Mr. Noakes know that I was at home when I was deny'd. This put the Deceased in a violent Passion again; he swore and rav'd, and called her all the ill Words, and abused her at a strange Rate indeed. And he jangled a little with Mr. Hiller; for, says Mrs. Falkingham , you should not make this Noise, if Mr. Falkingham was at home. No, says the Deceased, and if he was, that snotty-nosed Fellow (pointing to Mr. Hiller) should not sit there, neither.</p>
               <p>Council. Where was Mr. Falkingham then?</p>
               <p>Thrasher. In the Country, for his Health. The Deceased was still very uneasy; he swore and made a Noise, and beat himself several Blows on the Breast, and was very angry. And he still insisted on Mr. Hiller's going with him. Mr. Hiller was willing, but Mrs. Falkingham would not let him. At last, a Coach was called, and she went with 'em; and none of 'em came home that Night. On Wednesday Evening, between 4 and 5, Mr. Hiller came to drink Tea; and in about half an hour the Deceased came, and another Man with him. While the Gentleman was talking to me, the Deceased went up Stairs. I heard a Noise, and followed. Mrs. Falkingham strove to shove him out of the Room; but he forced his Way in, and (going up to Mr. Hiller ) said, Damn you, Sir, you are the Man I wanted! Come down this Minute, or I'll lug you out by the Nose. Mr. Hiller was in some Confusion, and the Deceased swore he would have his Will of him; and he swore at Mrs. Falkingham too; but she would not let Mr. Hiller go out with him. The Deceased abused her, and said, I will stay then till he goes; and so sat down, but in the greatest Disorder imaginable, swearing and beating his Breast violently, till at last he had work'd Mr. Hiller up to a Passion , who then got up, and said, Pray, Sir, what Tavern<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140040"/> are you for? The other answer'd, The Horn. Mr. Hiller went down, and was follow'd by the Deceased and the Gentleman who came with him. I afterwards went to enquire for 'em at the Horn, but they were gone. It was past 10, before they came back to Mrs. Falkingham's ; she was sitting with her Apron over her Face when they came up, and pulling it off, she saw Mr. Hiller first, and said, Thank God, you're come home alive; but turning her Head short, and seeing the Deceased, she gave a Shriek, and fell into a sort of a Fit. After she recover'd, Mr. Hiller said to the Deceased, Shall I proceed? and he answer'd, No, not for the World; I will not live to hear it. But, says Hiller, I will tell, and tell the Truth; and so addressing himself to Mrs. Falkingham, Madam, says he, Thank God I am come home alive! for Turner (the Deceased) has wounded me, and it might as well have been my Death as not. Then turning to Mr. Turner, he said again, Shall I proceed? No, not for the World, says Mr. Turner. But Mr. Hiller went on. We have been and fough t, Madam. We have been as far as Hyde-Park. When we were at the Horn Tavern, we sent for Swords, but the Master of the Tavern would not let us have any. But I got two at a Sword-Cutler's. We went to the Park together ; Turner would have had me to have gone on farther ; but I refused. Then draw, says he; and I did. He prick'd me in the Hip, my Foot slip'd, and I fell. He came and stood over me with his Sword. Now, says he, if you don't promise to ask Mrs. Falkingham to pardon me, you are a dead Man. It being dark, and I being frighted, I gave him my Promise; and so we return'd hither in a Coach. And now, Madam, I must desire that you would grant him your Pardon. When Mr. Hiller had spoke this, the Deceased fell on his Knees to Mrs. Falkingham , and begg'd her Pardon, and confess'd that he had injur'd her wrongfully. She said, I'll forgive you as a Christian, if you'll never disturb my Peace any more. He begg'd for leave to visit her, as formerly, she deny'd him. Then he begg'd for leave to come and drink Tea with her at 3 the next Day; which she at last consented to; and then appeared as much over-joyed and elevated as he was passionate before. And will you forgive me, says he, then I am this Night the happiest Man living! How am I obliged to Mr. Hiller for making us Friends! He was subject to very extravagant Passions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you never hear him threaten to kill himself?</p>
               <p>Thrasher. One Sunday I heard him tell Mrs. Falkingham that he would go and hang himself. He went into another Room, and she bid me go and watch him; but I laugh'd and said he had more Wit than that came to.</p>
               <p>Council. Did not the Deceased charge the Prisoner with being too great with Mrs. Falkingham ?</p>
               <p>Thrasher. The Night before Mr. Turner was shot, I heard him reflect on Mrs. Falkingham for being too great with the Prisoner; but I never heard him speak to the Prisoner about it, nor never heard that they quarrelled on that account.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you never hear that Mr. Falkingham left Mr. Turner as a Guardian over Mrs. Falkingham ?</p>
               <p>Thrasher. I have heard her say that Mr. Turner said he was left as a sort of a Guardian over her by her Husband.</p>

            , Brother of the Deceased. A Day or two after Mr. Falkingham went out of Town, which, I think, was on the first of January , my Brother (the Deceased) among other Discourse said; Before Mr. Falkingham went, he desired his Wife to see no Man but me. My Brother lodged with me, and, about 9 the Night before he was murder'd, he call'd at the Door, and gave me his Pocket-Book, a Letter, and Haunthal's Overthrow , and bid me take care of 'em, and let no Body see them, and especially the Letter. I asked him, if he would come in? He said, No. I saw one with him, and asked, who it was? He said, Mr. Noakes. I did not know Mr. Noakes; and I never saw my Brother any more.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Whiscard. The Deceased came Home on Monday Night, sate down by the Fire, pulled out a Letter, and stooped down to read it by the Fire-light. When he had read it, he said to his Mother, Can't I take up a Man that threatens my Life? Yes, sure, said his Mother. Why, says he, I am threatned to be shot through the Head. Let me know who it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140041"/> is, Child , said she, and I'll secure him. That would be pretty indeed, says he.</p>

Yes , Child, says his Mother, let me know who it is, and I'll take care of him. Aye! says he, that would be very pretty indeed. But, can't I swear the Peace against him? Yes, to be sure , said she. Pray, Madam, says he, put your Hand in my Bosom, and feel my Heart. She smiled; but he, repeating his Request, she did so, and declared, she never felt any thing flutter so in her Life. He was so out of Order, that he did not go to the Office the next Day, but staid till the Day following. He was Clerk at the East-India-House . We don't know who the Letter came from: But on Thursday, about two a Clock, he was sent for (by Mr. Hiller , as it was said) and he went out gay and lively.</p>

             , Surgeon. Between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon, after the Deceased was shot, I opened his Head; the Wound entred at the Right Ear, and past neither upward nor downward, but parallel. The Pistol was clapp'd so close to the Head, that no Powder appear'd on the outside, but it all pass'd into the middle of the Brain, and being confined, had split the Skull, and raised the upper-part of it, so that I had no need to make use of a Saw. If the Pistol had been held with a full extended Arm, it might have recoil'd. The two Bullets were lodged close to the Left Side of the Scull, but had not perforated it.</p>
               <p>C. Was the Pistol put into the Ear?</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilky. No, but a little higher than the natural Orifice of the Ear: The Bullets split the Flap of the Ear, went thro' the Temporal-Bone, and made but one Orifice in the Skull, and one continued Wound. These are the 2 Bullets; I found 'em thus close together, and one dented against the other. The Instant the Powder enter'd the Brain, the Deceased could have no Sense, or feeling of Pain. It was immediate Death.</p>

            , Surgeon. The Wound was just above the Meatus Anditorium. The Explosion of the Powder has raised the Skull. The Bullets inclined rather upwards than on a Level. They had broke the Cranium on the other Side, but had not gone thro' the Scalp.</p>

            . I lodged White's Coffee-house, in Chancery-lane. The Deceased, and Mr. Hutton came to see me and brought the Prisoner with them. Then began to talk about Mrs. Falkingham. The Prisoner said to the Deceased, Pray was she at Home with I was there to ask for her? The Deceas'd seem'd unwilling to answer at first, but afterwards he gave the Prisoner his Honour the she was not. To which the Prisoner reply'd, If I should find that she was at Home, I hope that you will not refuse - and then mutter'd something which I could not hear. After this, I heard the Prisoner say, I would not value shooting any Man in the Head; and, if it was not for the Law, I would rob all the Company .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not that spoke in a merry Way only?</p>
               <p>Spranger. We were upon a serious Subject - Religion. He spoke of Religion in a merry, ludicrous Way, but , I believe, he was very serious in it. He said, There was no such Thing as a God; and if there was a God, that he himself was Part of the Divine Being. The Deceased went away, and brought a Lady to the Door in a Coach. I would not let her come in, because the House is a civil House, and the Woman that keeps it, will not admit of such Company. The Prisoner hearing she was come, spoke to her in the Coach, and then took his Hat and went away.</p>

             . The Deceased dined with me on Sunday. After Dinner we went together, and called on Mr. Hiller, in Hatton-Garden, and from thence we all 3 went into the City, and returned in the Evening. The Deceased desired, that I might be denied to the Prisoner, and he bid the Maid tell him (if he came) that I was not at Home. He came before Supper. Mrs. Thrasher denied me; he went from the Door, and I coming down at the same Time, I suppose he heard my Voice, for he turned about, and asked Mrs. Thrasher, why she denied me? She insisted upon it. He asked her who was above? She said, Mr. Turner (the Deceased.) He came up, I retired. He staid half an Hour, and then he and the Deceased went together, to White's Coffee-house in Chancery-lane, but Mr. Hiller staid to Supper. The Deceased left Word that he would be back again in half an Hour. He did not stay long, and when he returned, he said to me, that he had told the Prisoner, upon his Honour, that I was gone into the City, and would not be at Home all Night. I said, I was surprized that he should give his Word and Honour upon any Thing that was so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140043"/> false, and that I would send the Prisoner Word that I was at home. He swore and called me Bitch, and other ill Names; I asked Mr. Hiller to go with me; we called a Coach: The Deceas'd made such a Noise, and behaved himself so strangely, that he rais'd a Mob in the Street, and while the Coach was driving along, he never called for the Coachman to stop, but forced the Door open, and jump'd in. When we came to the Coffee-House, Mr. Hiller, to avoid Quarrelling, went out and left me with him in the Coach, where he abused me, and called me Names. I sent in for the Prisoner, who came out to know my Business; I told him I came to satisfy him that I was at home when the Maid denied me, and asked him to go with me to the King's-Arms at Charing-Cross, because I would not have a Noise at home to disturb the Neighbours. I desired the Deceas'd to go home to Bed, for he was much disturb'd and not in his Senses, but he would go with us. When we came to the Tavern, the Prisoner called for a Stake, for says he to the Deceas'd, You have supp'd, but I have not. The Deceas'd abused me so there, that I said it was unsufferable, and I would stay no longer, and so I desired the Prisoner to call a Coach.</p>
               <p>About 10 the next Morning, Mr. Hiller called on me, and told me if ever I suffered Turner to come into my Lodgings again I should be very much to blame, and I ordered myself to be deny'd to him. There was no bearing his Company, he made such a Disturbance.</p>
               <p>A Week before this, at Chelsea, he threatened to kill himself, and ask'd me to lend him a Penknife, he said he had ruin'd a Woman in Exeter-Street, and she had ruin'd him; he behav'd himself like a mad Man, and I don't believe he knew what he did.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday, about Four, Mr. Hiller came to drink Tea with me, in half an Hour my Maid came up and told me, the Deceas'd was below. I lock'd the Door; he forced it open. I asked him what he wanted? and why he made such a Disturbance ? he turned to Mr. Hiller, and said, I have found the Villain I wanted; come out this Moment, or I'll pull you out by the Nose. G - d damn you, I have lost my own Peace , and I care for No-body's else. Mr. Hiller slipt down and left his Hat, the Deceas'd follow'd, and they went away together. I took Coach and call'd at several Taverns to enquire after them, but could not find them. They came back after 10, says Mr. Hiller. We have been to fight in Hyde-Park , my Foot slipp'd, and Turner taking the Advantage , made me promise to get his Pardon of you. Turner ask'd Leave to come and drink Tea with me at 4 next Day; I told him, if he behaved himself civilly he might. Next Day they both came to drink Tea; the Deceas'd asked me if we were Friends? I said, Yes . But, says he, I must fight Hiller again; I will have his Blood, or he shall have mine; for I am resolved not to live. Mr. Hiller was then present. The Prisoner came up about 5, I told him I was glad he was come to vindicate me, tho' I wonder'd he should take the Liberty of saying such Things of me to Mr. Turner .</p>
               <p>Council. What Things?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Falkingham . Mr. Hiller told me that Mr. Turner said, the Prisoner had told him, that he lay with me all Night.</p>
               <p>Council. That who lay with you?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Falkingham . That the Prisoner did, and then told Turner of it, and Turner told Hiller: Upon this Turner said that Hiller had bely'd him in saying so, and Hiller insisted upon it, that Turner did tell him. The Prisoner endeavoured to make them Friends, and at last prevailed with them so far, that Hiller begged Turner's Pardon, and owned that what he had said was false. They appeared to be pretty well pacified; but as Mr. Hiller was going away, Mr. Turner, the Deceas'd, said to him, I expect to see you to-Morrow , or I'll pull you by the Nose in the India-House. I found that the Deceas'd was not yet easy, and therefore I said to the Prisoner, Let us go to the Horn to Supper and avoid him. Upon this the Deceas'd began to swear and rave, and call me Bitch and Whore. We came down to the Door, and he and the Prisoner went into the Court Mrs. Thrasher desired them to come in, and not make a Noise there to disturb all the Neighbours. The Deceas'd says to the Prisoner, If you have any thing to say to me I'll answer you. The Prisoner replies, Sword and Pistol then. With<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140044"/> all my Heart, says t'other, and so away they went. I sent Mrs Thrasher after them to persuade them to come in again , but I saw no more of them till between 12 and 1 that Night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . In what Manner did I speak when I said Sword and Pistol?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Falkingham. You spoke it laughing, in a joaking Manner . Between 12 and 1, as I lay abed , I thought I heard them quarrelling under my Window, I got up and look'd out, and ask'd them what they meant by making that Disturbance to fright me? They both burst out a laughing and went away. Between 4 and 5 the same Morning they came again, and walked to and fro under my Window; I heard the Prisoner say to the Deceas'd, Turner, This is as bad as walking upon the Quarter-Deck at Sea, at which Turner laugh'd. I look'd out again, and said to them , Why do you disturb the Neighbourhood thus? I thought you bad bad more Sense, Mr. Noakes, tho' Turner has not. Upon this Mr. Noakes , the Prisoner, went away, and Turner sung and tanted , and by and by he fell on his Knees and ask'd me Forgiveness, and said he was the happiest Man living, and Mr. Noakes was his best Friend for reconciling us. I asked him why they came there to fight? he said 'twas only to frighten me, and then he went away. Between 7 and 8 he knock'd at my Door, the Maid let him in; I stepp'd down and ask'd him why he disturb'd me so early? says he, I have been rambling all Night, Mr. Noakes is my best Friend, and now I have no Body to make my Peace with but you. I am surprized , said I, that you behave yourself in this Manner: You have made such a Noise, and a such a Disturbance in the Court, that I must be forced to leave my Lodgings, my Landlady won't let me stay in the House any longer. G - d damn your Landlady, says he, she's an old Bitch; lend me a Knife, and I'll rip her up. I desir'd him to be easy till I was dress'd: I went and dress'd me, and bid the Maid call a Coach; he said he would not go yet, for his dear Friend Noakes was a coming. I told him he might stay if he would, but I would go; with that he threw down his Sword, and I bid the Maid take Care of it. We took Coach together, and drove to the King's-Arms, and were shown into the Fore-Room next the Street; we called for a Pint of Mountain and a French-Roll; says he, Are you sure you are Friends with me? I told him he had ruin'd me, and I must abandon my my Lodgings and go-but I knew not where. Then he cry'd and stamp'd, and pull'd a hot Poker out of the Fire, and run it against his Breast twice or thrice. I call'd the Drawer, and then he laid by the Poker and sat down. I told him I wanted to see Mr. Noakes, the Prisoner, before I went, and d esired him to tell me where he was; he said that he knew, and that Mr. Noakes was his best Friend, but that he would not tell me. I thinking he might go to the Bagnio after he went from my Window that Morning, I wrote a Letter and sent a Porter with it to the Hummums to see if he could find him; the Porter returned, but could not hear of him, and laying the Letter down, the Deceas'd took it up and read it, and then threw it in the Fire. In about half an Hour after, the Prisoner came, asked the Deceas'd how he did, and they shook Hands. Then the Prisoner ask'd me if I wanted him? I said Yes; I am going away, and thought it proper to see you before I went, that if any Reflections should be made on my Conduct, you may give me no worse Character than I deserve. The Deceas'd said, And will you go? Then I am a ruin'd Man; and burst out a crying - and you shall bear of it very soon. Mr. Noakes had on a mourning Sword; the Deceased snatch'd it suddenly from his Side, and run himself into the Breast with it; and had run himself through if we had not prevented him. He pull'd out his Shirt, it was bloody, and said, See - I have not done it effectually yet - but it's no Matter. Then he fell into a great Passion again, and sweated and swore, and behav'd himself like one distracted. Well, says I, 'tis no Time for me to stay; for since you are a mad Man I will be gone. Pray, says the Prisoner, take the Sword with you for Fear of Danger. I went from thence to Mr. Hiller in Hatton-Garden, and about 5 a Clock the same Day, I saw the Prisoner again.</p>
               <p>Council. Did he take the Poker out himself? Mrs. F. Yes. Council. What sort of a Poker was it? Mrs. F. It was pretty thick, and about 3 quarters of a Yard long. Coun. How did he hold it? Mrs. F. By the middle.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140045"/> Council. Was he standing or sitting? Mrs. F. He sat in a Chair, and taking the Poker, he said, I'll rip my self up with this. His Coat was open, and I think he run the the Poker against his Waistcoat. Council. After he laid the Poker down, did you take it up? Mrs. F. Yes. Council. And how did you hold it? Mrs. F. By the Top. Council. Was it hot? Mrs. F. I don't know how hot it was, I had my Gloves on, and after he had laid down the Poker, he run about the Room, and said, he was damn'd, and nothing but damnation could make him easy. Council. How did he take the Sword? Mrs. F. We were all sitting at the Table. He sat at the Prisoner's Left-Hand, betwixt him and the Fire, and starting up suddenly he snatch'd the Sword, and run round one side of the Table to the Window. He said, He had ruin'd one Woman in Exeter-Street, and now be had ruin'd me, and nothing but his Life would make amends. Council. Did you appoint the Prisoner to meet you in the Evening? Mrs. F. Yes; I desir'd him to be at the India Coffee-House about 5, and I went thither and found him. Council. Did the Deceas'd hear you make that Appointment? Mrs. F. Yes. Council. What great Business had you with the Prisoner, that you made this Assignation to meet him at a precise Time and Place. Mrs. F. Business? I wanted to see him; I did not appoint 5 a Clock precisely, I said, I would call on him in the Evening about 4 or 5, and I knew that he was usually to be found at that Coffee-House. Council. You had seen him but that Morning, why did you want to see him again so soon? Mrs. F. If I had a Mind to see him again, and again, I hope there was no harm in that. Council. To what other Places did you go that Night? Mrs. F. I was that Night with Mr. Hiller and a Relation, at the Vine in Holborn, and at a Friend's House on London-bridge. Council. When you came to the Prisoner at the India Coffee-house, did he tell you presently what had happen'd ? Mrs. F. No; I sent the Sword in by the Coachman. Council. Do you know such a Person as Mr. Falkingham . Mrs. F. Yes; he is my Husband. Council. Where is he now? Mrs. F. In Derby. Council. What Discourse had the Deceased with you about your Husband? Mrs. F. Nothing Material. Council. Did you never hear that your Husband left him to be your Guardian? Mrs. F. I have heard the Girls in the House call him my Guardian, in a merry Way, but no otherwise. Council. Who took those Lodgings for you at Mrs. Goldfinch's ? Mrs. F. My Husband. Council. Did the Deceased never tell you that your Husband had desir'd him to caution you against keeping Company with the Prisoner? Mrs. F. No. Council. You say, that as soon as the Deceased had attempted to stab himself at the King's Arms, you saw that his Shirt was bloody; did you then look in his Bosom to see if there was any Wound? Mrs. F. No. Council. You say, that he frequently behav'd himself like a Madman; How came you to venture yourself to a Tavern with a Madman? Mrs. F. I was not apprehensive that he would hurt me, for he din'd at our House almost every Day.</p>
               <p>Jame Freeman, the Gunsmith's Apprentice. The Drawer of the King's Arms came for a Pair of small Pistols with Powder and Bullets. I went with them into a Room where the Prisoner and the Deceased were. Each of 'em took one. The Deceased said that these were too small; that they wanted a Pair three times as long; and that an old Pair would do; for they only wanted to borrow them, for they were going to Windsor in a Chaise; and then he bid me fetch a larger Pair, and bring Powder and Bullets. I went back, and as I was returning, I met the Drawer coming to hasten me. I carry'd the Pistols in; each of the Gentlemen took one. The Deceased asked the Price, I told him a Guinea; for they were old Pistols. The Prisoner asked if they must leave the full Value; I told him Yes. The Deceased said, that then, one wou'd be sufficient, and gave me half a Guinea; and ask'd me if I brought Powder and Ball? I told him, Yes. He bid me charge it; and when I had put in the Powder, he bade me put in more. The Prisoner try'd with the Rammer, and said there was enough. Then I put in a Ball; the Deceased bid me put in another. The Prisoner said, Why so? Because (says the Deceased) when I do any thing, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140046"/> love to do it to the Purpose; and if they come, I'll pop 'em. I suppose he meant he would pop the Rogues, if he met any. When I had loaded the Pistol, I put it into the Deceased's Hand. He open'd the Pan to see if it was primed, and then shut it again, and laid it down. The Prisoner was then standing on the other Side of the Table; that Side from the Door, and the Deceased near the Window, that Side next the Fire-place, on the Right-Hand of the Fire; I heard of the Accident in about half an hour after .</p>
               <p>Council. How did the Deceased behave himself, did he appear to be any way disordered in his Senses?</p>
               <p>Freeman. I did not see any uncommon Behaviour in him, and I thought he talked rationally.</p>

             . On Thursday Night, or rather Friday Morning, 'twixt 2 and 3; the Prisoner and Deceased, 'Rack Punch were drinking at the Rummer Tavern in Drury-Lane - for then I found 'em there, and sociable they seem'd, and drank and talk'd like Friends, till Watchmen cry'd Past 4 a Clock! The Reckoning was a Crown, Noakes paid it all. From thence we rambled to King's Coffee-house, in Covent-Garden. Ale and Orange there we drank, and still they cordial Friends appear'd - They told me that they had been serenading some Ladies, but they did not tell me who. And what (said they) is your Opinion, Sir, of such Diversion? I assured 'em that I was not fond of Catterwauling Frolicks. At 5 I left 'em, and return'd at 6, and found 'em still together very friendly. 'Twas after 7 when the Deceased arose, and asked the Prisoner if he would go with him? But he refused to go; then the Deceased bad him Good Morrow, and went out alone.</p>
               <p>Council. Did the Deceased appear to be out of his Senses?</p>
               <p>Mr. Penkethman . No, Sir, I did not take him to be mad, but rather thought he was a little silly. For he wou'd laugh at every thing that pass'd, at every Word was spoke, tho' nothing merry, nor fit to raise a Smile; the meerest Trifle imaginable wou'd set him on the twitter - When he was gone I importuned the Prisoner to cross the Water with me and two more who were in Company, to spend the Day in Merriment; (for I had then no Knowledge that I should at the Theatre be wanted) the Prisoner gave Consent, we all agreed, and down Southampton-Street we took our Way; a Servant to the Theatre by chance we met; his Business was at Tavern Doors and City Gates the Play-house Bills to fix. I view'd his Bills, and found, that very Night a Part appointed was for me to act, in Th' Amorous Widow, or the Wanton Wife; and by His Royal Highness's Command. Our Journey then was stopp'd, and so to the Rummer in Drury-Lane we all return'd, at 9, but did not tarry, for they had no Fire. We to the Play-house went, and breakfasted, and after 10 we parted.</p>
               <p>Council. If you had not met that Man with the Play-house Bills, should you and the Prisoner have gone over the Water together?</p>
               <p>Mr. Penkethman . Yes, we had so agreed; and I believe, had we not thus prevented been, we had spent the whole Day together.</p>

             [Helar.] On Friday Morning Mrs. Falkingham came to me in a Coach. Madam, says I, where are you going? I don't know, says she, I have left Turner and Noakes together. I saw her have a mourning Sword, and was afraid the Deceased had sent it to me as a Challenge, and begg'd her to satisfy me whether it was so or not. She said, No; but she brought it away to prevent Mischief, for Turner was very obstreperous. Several People taking notice of my talking to her at the Coach Door, I stepp'd in, to prevent farther Observation, and bid the Coachman drive on towards the City. We stopp'd at the Fountain at Snow-Hill. There she told me that the Deceased had called on her before she was up, and had made such a Disturbance that she must be forced to leave her Lodgings. The Deceased was always in a great Passion when he saw me, but would give no Reason for it. He would stamp about, and use such violent Expressions -</p>
               <p>Council. Did she tell you that Turner had attempted to kill himself?</p>
               <p>Hiller. Yes, she said he had endeavoured it two or three times.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Council. Did she say any thing of a Poker?</p>
               <p>Hiller. I heard her speak of the Poker, but I don't remember the Particulars.</p>
               <p>Council. Did she tell you in what Place he was when he took the Poker.</p>
               <p>Hiller . No.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you ever hear the Deceased talk of killing himself?</p>
               <p>Hiller. Yes, he has talked of it in my Hearing, and he has desired me to do it for him.</p>
               <p>Council. On what Occasion did he talk thus?</p>
               <p>Hiller. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Council. How long have you known him?</p>
               <p>Hiller . Two Years. He belong'd to the India-House, and so do I; but I never before knew him in such a Condition as he was in for a Fortnight past.</p>

             . I had been at the India Coffee-house, with my Musick-Master, and going out between 1 and 2, I met the Prisoner. He seem'd surprized, and said, He had just seen the Death of a young Fellow. I asked him, how? He answer'd, he shot himself. Do I know him? says I. His Name is Turner, says he, and he belongs to the India-House . Says I, You will infallibly be taken up, and therefore I would advise you to go to your Father's. Was there any Difference betwixt ye? No, says he. What was it about, then? said I. A Woman, says he, and I saw him falling as I came out of the Room, and I hardly know how I got hither. I came down Stairs with the Prisoner, between 2 and 3, and saw a Coachman give him a Mourning Sword. The Prisoner told me, there was a Woman in the Coach, and so he went away. I have known him three Years, he was a good-natur'd, quiet Man.</p>
