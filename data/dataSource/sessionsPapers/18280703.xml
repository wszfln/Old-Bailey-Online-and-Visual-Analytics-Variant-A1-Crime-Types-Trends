            </rs>.</p>
               <p>TWO OTHER COUNTS, stating his intent to be to disable him; or to do him some grevious bodily harm.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BULLOCK WATTS. I am the prisoner's brother. Previous to the 26th of April last we had been involved in law transactions; there had been a Chancery suit. On the 26th of April he called, under the idea that I owed him some money, and he demanded money of me - I told him I owed him none, and that he, at least, owed me 150l.; but he rather came to borrow 100l. of me; his wife was on my right-hand, and he on my left; I was making a reply to his wife, and heard the report of a pistol; I saw the flash, and heard a wizzing noise by the side of my head- he was within four feet of me at the time - I heard the report, turned round, fell on him, and clasped my arms round him; he was at that time pulling out another pistol with his left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see the first pistol at all? A. Certainly - it was in his right hand; I immediately called my servant, and I grappled with him across the room; the servant immediately came to my assistance, and so did his wife; we overpowered him: I believe I said he was a vile wretch - he muttered something, but I do not recollect the particulars; I saw him searched, and two other pistols found on him besides the one he had fired; I cannot myself say whether they were loaded - they were not tried in my presence. I believe for the last twelve or fourteen months he has been decidedly insane; he was secured, and handed over to the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Where do you reside? A. In Chapel-street, Pentonville - I am an attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not this unfortunate man conveyed all his property, in trust, to you and others? A. Yes, to four trustees.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath can any one of those trustees act besides yourself? A. Yes; Winifred Watts was the acting trustee; I have got the instructions for the deed here - it was executed in March, 1827, and about a fortnight or three weeks after that I was sent for to his lodgings in Amwell-street, and the landlord told me he had been laying in a fit for some hours; a surgeon had been sent for, and attended him: some days after that I was sent for, and found him in bed in violent fits - Dr. Farr was called in, and I believe said he was decidedly insane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the deed was executed did you place him in the hands of Wheeler, a person accustomed to keep insane persons? A. I believe a month or six weeks after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Wheeler to get the deeds and papers from him before he took him? A. No; I told him to get them from him, because he had hawked them all about London.</p>
               <p>Q. You say other trustees besides yourself have acted under the deed - have you not filed a bill to compel them to act? A. To prevent his wasting his property, it certainly was done; by the advice of all his family; his family were defendants in the suit, but they were friendly defendants, and they desired us to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. In that bill have you not charged them with a conspiracy? A. It may be - Mr. Russell filed the bill; I have never seen it. I stated to the Magistrate that he was insane.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not then secure his person and not bring him here? A. If I had secured him, and taken out a commission of lunacy (as I have done since) I should have had greater reflections from his family.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say the commission of lunacy was issued by your recommendation? A. I mean to say I made an affidavit for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not make this affidavit because the Chancellor required to know why you proceeded against your brother, and had him in prison at the time? A. Certainly- I was not examined under the commission of lunacy; I offered some evidence to satisfy the Chancellor why I prosecuted him. I was present when the Inquest was held; I did not insist on being examined - I said they ought to examine me; I was partly examined - I believe I was sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, you are an attorney, you must recollect whether you were sworn? A. I do not recollect it at the moment; they did not take my evidence - they refused it; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030004"/>was asked several questions, but they said my evidence was so contrary; two other gentlemen proved he was insane when they saw him in the country - they thought that was sufficient.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not all his property conveyed to you, and you were to have 100l. a year, or something out of it? A. No- the deeds and every thing were given up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not insisting on the validity of that deed? A. No otherwise than securing the property for his family, and prevent his hawking them about London; I have made no attempt to establish the deed, except the Chancery suit I have named. When I turned round to speak to his wife he was not quite four feet from me - I was not looking at him when the pistol went off; I was turning round - the ball went into the ceiling, not immediately over my head, but just on the right-hand side; the ceiling is about seven or eight feet high; it happened in the kitchen, on the basement story; my servant came to say they were there, and while I went into the parlour they had descended into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. As he stood so near to you, would there have been the slightest difficulty in hitting you if he had meant to shoot you? A. I believe he did not fire directly, but that the pistol went off as he was raising it up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You believe he did not fire at you? A. Yes; as he was raising the pistol it went off, I think - I saw the flash - the ball was afterwards found in the ceiling, not over my head, but just in front, to my right.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Might it be done accidentally? A. That is a question I do not know how to answer.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. Do you mean to say you cannot say it might not have been accidental, when your own brother is in charge? A. It might have been so; I do not know that he always carried pistols about - I have heard he did so very frequently.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you know that he had a delusion about passing a place where they killed horses, and that he expected to be thrown into a caldron? Q. I never heard of it till now.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many pistols had he? A. Three; but I did not see the other two: I think from the noise I heard, that the ball must have passed within three inches of my head; he was suffered to go at large- my servant came in on hearing the report; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the pistol went off, did he appear cool or angry? A. He appeared in a trembling condition - his wife blamed him for his conduct; he muttered something, but I did not hear what; the servant had then gone for a constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, in 1802 I was churchwarden of Yeovil, and received a letter from the Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells, (the late Bishop) to look into the charities of the town, the church and charity lands; and in consequence of looking into them, has caused all this trouble and difficulty; the present Bishop in 1805 took it up - I was up in Langham place before his Lordship, and then this Tom, this brother of mine undertook the case, to carry it on, saying what a good partner he had, (Mr. Russell) and they would carry it through, and get my expenses; the church books have been in my debt 613l. ever since; they came to Yeovil, he was to recover it for me, and he drove me out of my mind, and drove me about the country - I have been dreadfully ill used, he pretended to take me up, and to go and put me into a madhouse; I had no peace nor rest for my life; he drove me to Bath, and after that, he persuaded me to sign a deed - after I signed the deed, they took away my property, all my goods and furniture, and every thing; he turned out my wife and family, and distressed them; I have five children and always took care of them, and never troubled anybody - I have been an honest industrious young fellow; he has pitched on all my family, and pitched on me at last, and distressed my children and wife and me; I have been worse than death for years; I knew no more what had been done than the dead - it is a hard case, he has been a very great deceitful man; he deceived me, and made so many deceptions, and drove me out of my mind; he would come one day and say one thing, and his partner come next day and contradict it; I have been like a shuttlecock kicked about from one to the other - I do not know where his partner is, but he is a man who has treated me shamefully, it is a disgrace to the law to have such men in the profession.</p>

            . I have been in the habit of attending lunatics for a great many years; I have seen the prisoner four times - the first time was the 29th of April last; I remained with him about twenty minutes - quite sufficient to ascertain the state of his mind; I say he is of unsound mind - I could not form an accurate judgment whether it has been of long duration; it appeared to me a disease of some standing, certainly; I can say certainly, for a month or two; I have seen him three times since, and examined him on all those occasions, and have not the least cause to alter my opinion - I conceive him at this present moment to be insane, and should say it is not at all likely that he will ever recover; I was examined before the jury on the commission.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and reside at Pentonville. I was called to attend the prisoner in February 1827, and found him suffering from a violent hemorrhage from the nose, in consequence of a termination of blood to the head, which was very probably caused by great excitement of the mind; I attended him again on the 12th of April 1827, in consequence of his being seized with an epileptic fit of a most violent description, and found him in one of those fits.</p>
               <p>Q. Are persons afflicted with epileptic fits, when they come to any age likely to become deranged or idiots? A. I believe that is the usual tendency, these fits are frequently precursors of that affliction; in April 1827, he was decidedly insane, and I considered the fits to be the cause of it - I gave it as my opinion in a very strong manner to the family, that he should have a person to look after him, or something very unpleasant might be the consequence.</p>

            . I am a glover, and live in Wood-street, Cheapside. I have known the prisoner from a child - I always considered him a very respectable, intelligent, and prosperous man, kind to his wife and family; I have known him till about Easter 1827 - in October 1826 I visited him at Yeovil, in Somersetshire; he was living with his wife and family - his conduct then was very different to what I had observed before; I made my visit as short as possible, conceiving him to be labouring under an insane state of mind; in Easter 1827 I visited him in Amwell-street, Pentonville - he was then in the care of a keeper, and appeared to me as deranged as he possibly could be; he came to my house a week or ten days afterwards, to my great surprise and regret, for I considered he ought not to have been suffered to come; his wife, who was with him, stated that she could not keep him in, for he was desirous of dining with me - he played with the meat and vegetables; and I considered him very malicious.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother. I am older than the prosecutor; I have been appointed by the Lord Chancellor to take care of my brother - I have never seen him with pistols, but it is notorious that he has carried them about for three years past - and last December I told him it was very improper to carry fire-arms; he told me that when he was in London he had occasion to go by where they boiled horses, and he carried the pistols to prevent his being thrown into a large furnace.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You know nothing of the prisoner? A. No - he was taken at a quarter before four o'clock that morning; I have recovered every thing of consequence but the body of one clock - some small articles have not been found.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. George's. On the 17th of June, a quarter before four o'clock in the morning, I was coming up St. James's-street into Piccadilly, and looking towards the Park I saw the prisoner coming towards me with a bundle under his arm; when he came up to me I said, "You appear to be a sailor" - he said he was; I said, "I suppose you are going on board." and he said he was; I felt the bundle which he had under his arm - he said it was nothing but his clothes, and that he wished to go down St. James's-street a little way, not to expose himself there; we came down to Berry-street - he put the bundle down on a step, and I immediately saw something shine, which was a small ink-stand - I then found a large candlestick; I brought him and the property to the watch-house - he made no resistance; the constable of the night examined the bundle, and all these articles were found in it and taken in charge by Turner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I take it for granted you stated the conversation to the Magistrate the same as you have to his Lordship? A. I did - I have stated all he said; he did not tell me he had found the property under a hedge, nor that he saw three men digging; when he was fully examined I heard him say he got it under a hedge, where there were three men - he said so at the watch-house when he was examined by the constable; he said he was coming from Uxbridge, and had seen three men under a hedge digging - that he made the best of his way up towards them - they left this property, and he took it; he said the three persons ran away as he was coming up.</p>

            . I am a house patrol of St. George's, Hanover-square. The prisoner was brought into the watch-house five minutes before four o'clock on the 17th of June; I saw the bundle opened, containing the articles which have been mentioned - I searched him, and found this stock of a centre-bit concealed between the lining of his jacket; he had made a hole to put it in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The stock was not of any use without the bit? A. No - I found no bit; it was carefully concealed in his jacket; I did not know him before - he appeared a sailor by his dress, but his hands did not look like a seaman's - he said he had not been on shore more than six weeks; I have myself been a soldier and a sailor.</p>

            . I went to the watch-house at five o'clock, and took charge of the prisoner and these articles - I was not there when he was brought in; Bissix delivered them to me - I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you examine the premises? A. Yes - I should think it would have required three persons to have done what I observed there; I found the glass of an ink-stand just by the door - I found a screw-driver in the field in front of the house, near the door by the hedge, and this scissor-case.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the account he gave of the persons being under the hedge? A. He told me it was by the road side - I found this box near the hedge.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030006"/>Q. Was it between the hedge and the prosecutor's house that the different articles were afterwards found, except the ink-stand? A. Yes - it appeared that the persons had gone from the house to the hedge, and dropped the things which I found; there are a good many officers about at four o'clock in the morning - there was no dirt about the bundle at all; he did not describe any particular spot where he had found it, but said by the road side - I went to the hedge about nine o'clock that morning, and found some persons at work in the road there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He did not describe any part of the hedge? A. No - I looked every where to find the centre-bit, and could not; I could see that persons had been lying under the hedge on the grass; there is a field between the hedge and the road coming from the house - there appeared to have been more than one person there.</p>
               <p>MR. FOX. These candlesticks are mine, I have no doubt - I had seen them in my room at a quarter to one o'clock that morning; this clock is my brother's, and was in my charge - these two ten-spoons and two forks I can swear to; the ink-stand is mine, it is silver, and worth 10l. and more; I cannot say whether more than one person had committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were the doors open, or only the pannels broken? A. They were open when I went down, but I was not present when it was first discovered.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up from my cousin's, at Uxbridge - he used to be ostler at the Bell; I wanted to see him before I went away again; as I came up the road I saw three men digging at the side of the hedge- as soon as they saw me they ran away and left these things; I brought them along till I was stopped; I had come home in the Buckingham East Indiaman.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the morning of the 24th of May I was with Smith, and saw the prisoner driving the cow - it was about half past four o'clock, as near as I can guess; he was coming towards us; I spoke to Smith, and as we went towards him to stop him he left the cow, and ran across the fields to Bethnal-green; Smith pursued him - I remained with the cow, and took it to Mash's field; Mash came in about five minutes, and claimed the same cow as I had seen the prisoner driving; it had not been out of my sight; I am positive of the prisoner's person - I had seen him before; he was about a mile or more from Mash's house.</p>

On Sunday, the 1st of June, Mr. Tollitt went out of town, leaving me in charge of the business; about eleven o'clock, shortly after he was gone, Wight made up a tray of fish to send to customers in Edgware-road, Cumberland-place, and other places; I looked at his tray, and found he was going to send some fish to Harley-street, and told him some of it was not proper to go there, and removed part of it - he got into a passion, and told me I did not know how to send out fish, and was no fishmonger; I told him it was of no use to make a piece of work on a Sunday, and what complaint he had to make he had better make to master when he came home; about half an hour afterwards he went out with a tray, and came back in about an hour with a lobster; I asked where he brought it from - he said it was no business of mine; he put his tray down, and was going out - I asked where he was going - he said on his own pleasure; I said he had better stop and do his master's business first: he then attempted to pass by me, to go out - I pushed him back; he attempted to pass again, and I struck him with my hand - he said he would get a warrant for me on the Monday, and make me pay for it; I told him I would answer any charge, but to let it rest till Monday; I then took down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030007"/>some fish to put in the ice, and while I was down in the ice-house, I heard him tell the servant that if I struck him again when I came up, he wished God might strike him dead if he did not stab me to the heart with the knife, which he then had in his hand, if he was hung to-morrow at Newgate for it. I came up into the shop in about ten minutes, and saw him standing by the block where we clean the fish, with the knife in his hand; he said to me,"You are no man - you are as frightened now as you can be, and look as white as a boiled maggot - you are no father of a child;" he then threw the knife which he held in his hand at me - it passed close by me: I jumped out of the way - it struck against the wainscot, and bounded back; I then saw him take another knife off the block, and thinking he was going to throw it at me, I ran to catch hold of him; he chopped at me, and cut me on the finger of my left-hand; I was trying to take it from him - he got hold of me, made a sudden turn, got out of my grasp, and stabbed me in the back with the same knife as he chopped me on the finger with; I said, "Oh! dear me - he has stabbed me!" I ran out of the shop, and as I ran across the road to the surgeon's, I felt something strike me on the legs, which I found to be a steel which was thrown after me; I did not see him throw it, I was in such a flurry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You resisted his progress in attempting to go out? A. Yes - I gave him the first push; I pushed him in, and then struck him. I am a weekly servant, and so is he - he is younger than I- I do not suppose he would attempt to fight me. I had heard him say he would stab me if I attempted to strike him; I saw blood on my hand, and on his nose - I cannot swear whether there was any blood on his face before my hand was cut, I was so flurried; I do not know whether I struck him or not before my finger was cut - I might have struck him in the face after he threw the first knife at me - I will not swear that I did not strike him several times before that; I did not hold him and strike him on the back of his neck.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I first saw the prosecutor on the 2d of June, at ten o'clock at night; my assistant had been and stopped the hemorrhage; I did not open the wound till next morning - I found a wound on the right side of the spine, about an inch long, and a quarter of an inch deep - it appeared to have been done with a cutting instrument. I attended him till about the 20th of June: I considered him in great danger at first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you have seen the instrument with which it was supposed to have been inflicted? A. Yes; it certainly appeared to have been made by a knife of that description; there must have been an artery severed by the hemorrhage; I did not see the artery, as the wound was bound up - I put an adhesive plaister to it; that is all.</p>
               <p>Q. And do you mean to swear he was in the slightest danger? A. I certainly do; an artery having been severed; we did not sew it up, but brought it together by compression, and put a bandage on; he was in bed for a fortnight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long did you consider him in danger? A. I could not decide that he was out of danger under a fortnight.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Tollitt. On the 1st of June Wight was placing some fish on a tray to go out; Bifield came from breakfast, and asked where it was to go - he looked at the tray, and told him he should not send the Cumberland-place fish with what was going to Upper Harley-street; Wight was vexed at that, and said Bifield was no fishmonger, and did not know his business; he still kept on scolding, and saying disagreeable words to Bifield, who told him to hold his tongue, and if he had anything to say to tell Mr. Tollitt of it - he still kept wrangling; Bifield would not speak to him, and he went out with some fish; he returned in about an hour - Bifield asked if he had any orders - he made him no answer; Bifield asked where he brought the lobster from; I did not hear his answer - after that he said he was going out; Bifield stopped him, and said it was not his Sunday out; and if he went he would kick him out of the shop; Wight went to rush by - Bifield stopped him with one hand, and hit him with the other; a scuffle ensued, and Wight said he would make him pay 7s. 6d. for that to-morrow, and pushed himself in Bifield's face, for him to hit him again, but he did not; about ten minutes elapsed - Bifield went down to put some fish into the ice-hole; in the mean time Wight took up a knife which I work with, and said to the servant-maid, "I wish God may strike me dead if Bifield hits me again, if I am hung to-morrow, I will stab him;" Bifield came up - he did nothing to Wight, but went to send some more fish out; Wight walked from one side of the shop to the other, and said, "Mark, you are no man, nor the father of a child - you look as white as a boiled maggot;" he then have the knife at him, but it did not hit him - Bifield crossed the shop to him; I saw Wight take another knife off the fish-block - a scuffle ensued; I heard Wight cry Murder! I turned away for a minute, and then heard Bifield cry Oh! I turned, and saw the knife sticking in his side, about his loins; I followed him across the road, and saw the knife fall from him in the road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner in a great passion? A. He was in a passion when they were quarrelling in the morning; he cried Murder! before the other cried Oh! I was about three yards from him when Bifield asked where the lobster came from, but heard no answer given; there was a carriage going by at the time - I believe no answer was given; I think Bifield swore he would kick him out of the shop; I saw him hit him in the face once before the prisoner went out with the fish - it was not done in play; I was close to them when they were struggling, and do not know what made the prisoner cry Murder! I only saw Bifield strike him once - I saw his nose bleeding when I came from the doctor's; it must have been from violence used before I returned - Wight came to master's service before Bifield.</p>

I know the prisoner, and saw her at our shop on Wednesday, the 11th of June, about nine o'clock in the evening; she came in and asked to look at some plaid ribbons - I showed her some; she bought two yards at 1s. 7d. a yard, and paid for it with a 5l. Bank of England note - it came to 3s. 2d.; I gave her the change - she gave me the name of Miss Keene, 19, Frith-street, Soho; she said it was for Miss Keene - I gave her four sovereigns and 16s. 10d., and made a bill out; I took the note to the desk and marked it - I afterwards delivered it to Avis on the Thursday morning; when we take money we always take it to a cashier at a desk in the shop - he gives change and stamps the bill; I marked the note myself.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On Wednesday evening, the 11th of June, at eleven o'clock, I found a paper parcel in the coal-cellar, containing two 5l. Bank notes, some sovereigns, and some silver; I cannot say how much there was - they were altogether, notes and all; I took it up, and gave it to master immediately - the coal-cellar is on the same floor as the kitchen; you go out of the kitchen into the cellar without going into the air - the cellar is under the street; the area is between the kitchen and the cellar; the area is not covered with a roof - there is some wood over it; I did not open the parcel - I saw master find the notes, some sovereigns, and some silver in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you take the parcel to your master? A. We were all in search of the money, and I could feel there was money in the paper.</p>

             re-examined. There is a door from my kitchen into the cellar without going into the area; the witness is mistaken - the kitchen is on the basement story; there is no way from the area to the cellar, it goes right under the stable-yard, not under the house: here is the paper the notes were found in - here are two 5l. notes, three sovereigns and a half, and 4s. in silver; there is written on the notes the name of the person I took them from - the note paid to Griffiths is the other one; it has the name of Clement's on it, which was on it before I lost it - both of those in the paper have the name of Lord Clifton's coachman on them; he had pointed it out to me when I took them of him - I took the note with Clement's on it of a person in Bond-street; I have made no mark of my own on them - I swear these are all my notes, and what I dropped from my lap in the bar; this is the ribbon I picked up as I followed her to the watch-house - the sweepings of the house are never put into the cellar; nothing is kept there but coals and fire-wood.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master sits there every morning counting his money; I went into the bar and began to sweep; he put his money up - I found the saw-dust too clean to throw away; I gathered it up, and put it on the top of the kitchen stairs - I went and scoured the bar out, and swept the parlour; leaving the saw-dust where it was - we had breakfast - the work was all done; I was going down stairs, and seeing the saw-dust on the top of the stairs, I said, "William, what is the reason you have not cleaned this away?" he said, he was not going to clean away my dirt; I went and threw it behind the fire - William saw me do it; between ten and eleven o'clock my mistress ran down stairs, and said,"What have you done with the saw-dust?" I said, I had thrown it behind the fire, she said, "Oh! your master has been so careless, he has lost some money among it;" I said, I saw nothing but some pieces of newspaper - master sent for a constable and stripped me, but nothing was found - on Tuesday, master came down, and said,"I don't care who finds the money. I will give a sovereign to find it;" I said, I should be glad to find it without the sovereign, or anything - nothing more passed till Wednesday afternoon; I went up to my mistress, she gave me 6d. to fetch some sheep's-trotters - I went to the bar to master, and said, I was going out for mistress; he said, I could not go; I went up to mistress, and she said, I was a fool for telling him I was going; so I slipped out, and master fetched an officer and took me; a gentleman said, I had thrown a bit of ribbon in the street; but I declare I never saw the ribbon - it is said the bill was found on me, it might, or might not, I cannot say; next morning the shopman came to the office, and said, he did not know me - the officer said,"Is not this the woman who bought the ribbon last night?" he said, "I believe so;" the officer said, "You believe, say you are sure" - I am innocent, I never saw him before, and he did not know me.</p>
               <p>RICHARD GRIFFITHS re-examined. I am positive she is the woman who paid the note to me; I had not seen her before - I did not say I believed her to be the woman.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

I saw the prisoner standing in Salisbury-court, and knew her before; in about a minute I saw the prosecutor come up to her, ask for his handkerchief, and say, "If there was a watchman or constable I would give you in charge;" I then said I was an officer, and took her; she denied having the handkerchief; as I took her down Fleet-street I saw her put her hand into her bosom, and pull part of the handkerchief out; she then pulled it quite out and gave it to me; she then said the prosecutor had given it to her for a certain purpose, which he directly denied - she had before denied having it - she again asserted at the watch-house that he had given it her - he appeared to be quite sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say, "Here is the handkerchief he gave me," and I would not give it, and that I would not go down a court with any gentlemen? A. No; she said nothing of the kind.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. All the ginger was in bags, having the proprietor's name on them? A. It was; I cannot say whether the pimento bag was marked; I was the last person on the premises at night.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HARKER. I have a partner. On the Monday week after the robbery, I got a search warrant, having advertised and received information from Thompson; I went with him and several officers to the prisoner's house, in Old Montague-street, Whitechapel; he came in while we were searching; I found some bags in the cellar, corresponding in every particular with what I had lost, the same quality and size - there was a piece cut out of them in the very identical place where my name had been marked; the hole was not filled up with another piece; in the corner of one of two I found some ginger of the same description as what I had lost, and in the house we found a small quantity of nutmegs, mace, and several other sorts of spices which I had lost; I also found a number of picklock-keys and a dark lantern; they were, I think, in the sitting-room; a small wax candle was left in our warehouse, which would just fit the nozzle of the dark lantern: I had seen the two trucks on the premises the evening before - one was brought back on the morning of the robbery; Evans brought back the other on the day of the search; but after the search; that one belonged to Mr. Ward.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many bags did you find in the prisoner's house? A. Three - I lost six: the holes appeared to have been recently cut; they were fresher than the rest of the bags: I found a piece of ginger in one bag; there are several sorts of ginger; the prisoner kept no shop there; there was an appearance of his dealing in old clothes, as there were a number of old black clothes bags up stairs, and all those bags smelt strong of spice; I saw no lodgers - the prisoner came in about half-past one o'clock in the middle of the day; there was a woman in the house who appeared to be the mistress; I cannot say whether she was his wife.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where were the bags which smelt strong of spice? A. In the bed chamber; I think there were four or five large bags - they had all had ginger in them certainly, for it hung about the sides of the bag; the prisoner denied having had any ginger in his house for years before.</p>

            . I am a labourer at the East India Docks. On Saturday, the 31st of May, about half-past five o'clock, I was going to work there, and saw a truck standing by the Tower gates with three bags on it; a young man was with it - the prisoner called out "Do you want a job;" he was not five yards from the truck, but he was not the young man - I am certain of his person: I said Yes - he said "Take hold of the truck and go on;" another person at the same time came and took hold of the truck with me - he was employed at the same time; we went on with the truck across Tower-hill to Old Montague-street; in our way one of the bags broke, by the wheel touching it, and something fell out; I looked round and found it was ginger - the prisoner then came up to assist in putting the bags right on the truck, and asked if either of us had a nail to secure the bag; I said I had no nail but I had a needle and if anybody had a bit of twine I would sew it up - he said never mind that would do; he took hold of the needle and stuck it into the bag - I said to the prisoner"Let me go back and pick up the ginger which has fallen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030011"/>down;" he said "No, never mind, go on" and I went on till we came to Old Montague-street; at the end of that street the prisoner came up to us at the truck, and pointing to a person in a white apron and fustain jacket, said"Follow that man" - we followed that man with the truck till we came to the house where the search-warrant was afterwards executed; we unloaded the bags, put them into the passage of the house - the prisoner then came up and said "Go on with the truck, follow that man;" we went on with the truck to the end of the street, and turned up towards Whitechapel-road - as we turned round the corner of a street, I recollected I had lent my needle to fasten up the bag; I did not go back for it - before I turned the corner of the street, I turned round and saw another truck at the door of the same house where we had left the bags at; this was about one hundred yards off - when we had turned the corner of the street, the man with the white apron said "How much is your charge" I said we should be satisfied with 6d. a piece; we were paid 1s. 6d. between us, and the man took the truck away up Whitechapel-road, which was the way I was going to the Docks; he was in front of me - I saw him lodge the truck at a wheelwright's shop near the London Hospital, and come away. About a week afterwards I read something in the newspaper and went to the prosecutors and communicated it to them the next day - I afterwards showed the officer where I had seen the truck left - he found it there, and I believe it to be the same; he took it to Mr. Harker's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you read in the newspaper anything about a reward? A. No - I read that a robbery had been committed; there was nothing about a reward - I never saw the prisoner before; he was about twenty minutes with me, sometimes in front and sometimes in the rear - he sometimes walked on the flags; he was dressed in a black coat - I made no bargain for the job; it was broad day light, five o'clock; I did not observe any names on the bags - the names might be turned inside.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the young man go away after you took charge of the truck? A. Yes; I believe he left of his own accord - the prisoner did not stop behind and pick up the ginger; I should think about a quarter of a pound dropped out - I did not know the man who helped me.</p>

I accompanied Evans to search this house, and took possession of the spices; here is some ginger, nutmegs, mace, pimento, and cloves, a small quantity of each; I found two phosphorus-boxes.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.

As to the keys and lantern I can give no account of them, except that I had a lodger named Day, who I am afraid has made a dupe of me; he appeared a respectable man, but has not been heard of since my wife told him these things had been found; he must have deposited them under the drawers - I know no more of the lantern than a child unborn; I bought the four bags in Petticoat-lane - I had three dozens cut in a similar way, to make door mats; there was not a word passed between Mr. Harker and me about spice.</p>

            . I keep the Waggon and Horses public-house, at Tottenham, and am a widow. The prisoner is my own brother; this letter (looking at it) is my writing; I had it put into the post, and sent to him.</p>
               <p>This letter was here read; it was dated Tottenham, 28th of May, and bore the post-mark of Upper Edmonton, 28th of May, at night; it was addressed to Mr. Ledge, No. 3, Old Montague-street, Whitechapel, and signed Elizabeth Green; it stated that she would be glad if he could come down on Thursday night or Friday morning, as her son was going out for a week or ten days' and requested an answer by return of post.</p>
               <p>Witness. I received this answer by post from my brother.</p>
               <p>This letter being read, was dated 28th of May, acknowledging the receipt of the former, and promising to be down to-morrow forenoon (Friday) as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. On the following day did your brother come down? A. He was down with me on Friday, the 30th of May, about twelve o'clock at noon, the day he mentions in the letter, and he never left my house till Saturday, the 7th of June, except to walk out in the evening; he was never out of my sight long enough to go to town; I am certain he was never absent above an hour; he always went to bed in proper time.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. How far do you live from Towerhill? A. We call it six miles from my house to Shoreditch - it is quite the lower end of Tottenham, within a very few doors of Edmonton. I remember Mr. Salt's house, which has lately been pulled down; mine is half a mile further from town; my brother slept in the room adjoining mine: he came to assist in the business during my son's absence; he went to bed first at night - I got up first in the morning; I was always the last person up. I saw him go to bed on the Friday night; I saw him go up stairs with the candle, and bade him good night; I saw him in bed that night - I always take the candles: I do not recollect whether I took his candle. I saw him in bed between eleven and twelve o'clock, and went to bed myself very soon; I was down between six and seven next morning, and saw him when he came down about eight o'clock; he could not have gone out at night, because my doors were all fast at night, and I found them closed in the morning; I unfastened the street door that morning.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went to bed, having fastened the house up - did you take your keys up with you? A. I did, and found them in the morning where I left them; I had locked my bed-room door; I found every thing as I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030012"/>had left it at night: I saw my brother come down in the morning in his shirt sleeves; he could not have gone out for want of the keys.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On the top of this letter, are the words,"letter, No.1;" is that your brother's writing? A. Why I do not know - I dare say it was on the paper when I wrote it; it might be a piece of paper that had had something written on it before - I cannot say whether they were there when I wrote it; I cannot tell whether it is my brother's hand writing - it may be, but I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. There is No. 2 at the top of the other letter, do you believe that to be your brother's writing? A. I cannot tell, it does not look like his; I cannot say indeed whether he wrote it or not.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When your brother was in trouble did he send to you for the letter he sent you? A. No, I sent it to him last Sunday.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Green. I remember the prisoner coming down there on Friday, the 30th of May, between twelve and one o'clock; he slept in the front room next to my mistress - I slept with my mistress, she goes to bed last - nobody could have gone out and returned without our knowledge in the night; the keys were on mistress's table - I saw her place them there, and they were there in the morning when she got up; she was the first who got up.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. Do you mean to swear you saw her place the keys on the table? A. Yes; I went to bed with her, but was always in bed before her; we go up stairs together.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you it was Friday the 30th of May the prisoner came? A. I saw him, I remember the day, because my mistress' son went out on Friday morning; I heard he was in trouble on the Tuesday week following - I have not often talked this over with my mistress, and have not mentioned the day of the week or month to her; the prisoner's wife sent for me on Sunday, but I had been asked about this before that, by the people who knew him - he slept in the first floor front room; it has a casement window, which opens inside - I do not think he could casily get out of the window.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is the casement window large enough? A. Yes; there was no appearance of a person having got out there - mistress always examined the doors and fastenings, the last thing at night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long did the prisoner stay at your mistress's? A. From the 30th of May to the 7th of June, which was Saturday; I always recollect the days of the month by the newspaper, which we have every day - I generally look at the date; my mistress's son had left the house on the day the prisoner came - he is at Tottenham; he came back on the Friday following, the day before the prisoner left - I was not desired to take particular notice when the prisoner came, or to notice the day of the month.</p>

            . I live at Tottenham; I am a char-woman, and work every Saturday for Mrs. Green, at the Waggon and Horses public-house. On Saturday the 31st of May, I went there at half-past six o'clock in the morning; the prisoner came down to where I was at work - he was slip-shod, and in his shirt sleeves; it was impossible for him to be on Tower-hill at half-past five o'clock, for I saw him come down stairs at half-past six; I saw him again there on Saturday the 7th of June - I did not see him leave the house; he was assisting the landlady as her son had gone to Leicestershire on the 30th.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. How do you know he went away on the 30th? A. I know I did not see him on the 31st, and the girl said he was gone; I think it was hardly halfpast six o'clock when I got there - I will not swear to five or ten minutes; it might be ten minutes to seven, or seven, when I saw the prisoner - it was not so late as eight; he could not have laid a-bed till eight - I have worked there more than two years, and go there every Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you distinguish the 31st of May from any other Saturday? A. Because it was the call-over day for the parish officers; and a woman asked me the day of the month - I saw young Green there on Saturday the 7th of June.</p>

            . I am a painter and glazier, and live at Tottenham. I saw the prisoner at Green's house about seven o'clock in the evening of the 30th of May; I staid there all the evening, and slept there - I saw him go up stairs to bed at half-past eleven o'clock; I walked up with him - I saw him there again the next evening; I heard no noise in the night.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. Do you live with your father and mother? A. Yes; I slept there because there happened to be a disturbance down the lane, about ground rent - my father was afraid of his things being seized, and removed some of the things from his house; I slept at the back of the house, and he in front - I got up at five o'clock in the morning, and went out; I let myself out.</p>
               <p>Q. You knocked Mrs. Green up to get the keys, I suppose? A. No, it is a spring-lock; I pulled it back, and drew the bolts back - I had no occasion to ask for the keys; I have slept there before, and could easily go out without disturbing anybody - there was a key left in the lock; I twisted it round, and opened it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Could you have let yourself in as quietly? A. No; all the other doors were fastened - I went to work at Newington all day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How often do you sleep there? A. Sometimes not for two or three months; if I have a friend come down, I go and sleep there - my father and mother slept at home that night; they had moved what they could spare to Green's for safety - there was no bed for me at home; I remember the date because Mr. Green went down to Leicester - he returned on the 7th on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? A. No; he returned on the Friday; I remember that, because we did not expect him that night, and the prisoner slept with me - he is at home now minding the house; he knew I was coming here - he had told me a week before that he was going to Leicester on the 30th, and that he should return on the Friday.</p>

On Monday last, at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I went out for about five minutes, and as I came back I met the prisoner coming out of the shop door with these handkerchiefs open in his hand - I gave an alarm, and attempted to take them from him; he avoided me - I cried Stop thief! and ran after him for some yards; he was so closely pursued, he threw them down - a neighbour named Chapel picked them up. and gave them to me; Hall stopped the prisoner - I had seen them safe a few minutes before; there are three pieces and three loose ones, twenty-seven handkerchiefs in all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He brought them out exposed in his hand? A. Yes; the prosecutrixs are not here - I have lived with them twenty-five years; the premises are their joint freehold - the handkerchiefs are worth 5l. 8s.; they cost that - I know the value is deteriorated lately, but they are worth that - I cannot say what they weigh; some of them are India - they sell for 7s. each; the British are from 6s. to 7s. 6d. each - we get about 1s. on each; these were bought since the fall - tolerably good handkerchiefs are sold at 28s. a piece, but not like these.</p>

On the 5th of June, I went to Covent-garden Theatre; I left there about twelve and went from there to Johnson's alamode beef shop, in a court in Drury-lane - I staid there about an hour and had a pint of porter; I went from there into the Strand to a watering-house, and had a glass of porter - from there I went down the Strand as far as Bride-lane; I had another glass of porter and might have stopped about a quarter of an hour at each place - from there I went to Fleet-market and rested myself on the settles of the market for near an hour, as I had been walking about all day on business; I went from there to a watering-house in Holborn, and had another glass of porter - I stopped there about ten minutes; I left there about three o'clock and then came back through Smithfield towards home - I went through Bridgewater-square; three women of the town accosted me in Whitecross-street - they asked me to treat them with some gin; Shaw and Smith are two of them - I made them no reply: Shaw then left the other two, caught hold of my arm and said I should come home with her, and see where she lived - I told her to go to h - I and he d-d, and tried to get away from her; with that the other two came and swore I should go and see where they lived, if I did not stop - I was then about passing a gateway; two of them got behind me and held my arms down, while the other got behind - they shoved me down the gateway into the first house we came to; Smith and Shaw came into the room - the other one who was behind, left after delivering me into the room, and I saw no more of her - they began to ask me for money, for gin, and so on; there were two girls in bed in the room - they jumped out of bed, caught hold of me and swore I should come in between them; perceiving their intention was nothing but robbery, I tried all possible means I could to get out of doors, but was prevented by the four women - in a very short time the two who had been in bed huddled on their clothes, and one of them swore I should stand some gin as I was preventing her from going to Billingsgate; I gave her 4d. to get some and as she was going out I tried to rush out with her, but was prevented by the three prisoners - Thompson was one of those in bed - the door was shut; I told them they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030015"/>welcome to the gin if they would let me go - they said"Stop, she will not be long, you may as well have part of it;" I said I wanted none, and tried several times to rush out at the door, but was prevented by them - they then said I should go if I paid 1s. and after struggling a long time I proposed to give them the 1s. if they would let me here my hat and let me go; they then said it was all d-d stuff, that I had got no shilling and they were used to such characters as me - I put my hand into my pocket and showed them a shilling; they then threw me back on the bed and swore they would have the shilling from my hand - I held it tight, and after a very severe struggle on the bed, either Thompson or Smith, by the advice of Shaw, bit my hand - she said "Bite the b-r's hand;" I then opened my hand and they took they shilling out, and during the struggle on the bed they took some halfpence from my trousers pocket; after they had got the shilling, I managed to get from the bed and endeavoured to get out, but was prevented by their well guarding the door - they then said they knew I had more money, they would stand none of my nonsense, and gave me a great deal of abuse; they threw me a third time on the bed, (for they had thrown me on when I first went in;) they began a severe search of my person, to see what I had - I hallooed out Murder! and Help! but no one came to my assistance; they swore if I made an alarm they would murder me, and several times put their hands before my mouth to prevent my being heard - all of them did so; Shaw was at the head of them - she sung out most to me, and used more violence and oaths than the others; after struggling for near an hour, they pinioned me back on the bed - Thompson and Smith held my arms extended back; Shaw knelt on my stomach and swore she would pull every bit of clothes off my back, but what she would get the money, and called to them to hold the - tight - my strength was exhausted; Shaw tore my clothes and took from my fob three sovereigns and a half; I saw the three sovereigns and a half in her hand, while she was on the bed - she opened her hand and exposed them; she then said "Hold the b-r tight while I go;" she jumped off the bed and was out of the room in a second - I struggled and got from the bed; I struck one of them, broke from the others and got outside the door to follow Shaw, but could see nobody but a man in a smock frock: I ran to the watch-house and gave an alarm - the constable of the night and two watchmen came to the place with me; I knocked at the door and asked for my hat which was knocked off in the scuffle: an Irishman came down from the upper part of the house and produced my hat; I asked for the girls - he said he knew nothing of them; we went to several public-houses, and in one at the corner of Old-street, I recognized the three prisoners and gave them in charge - I am quite certain of their persons; there was not above 3s. 6d. found on them all - we went and searched the room, but nothing was found; I was quite sober - I might have had a glass of spirits, or two glasses in the course of the day, before I went to the Theatre, and a pint of beer - I am certain I did not have more; a finger-stall, which had been on my finger, was found in the passage of the house - it was pulled off in the struggle; I had seen my sovereigns safe at the eating-house, and put them into my fob there - my silver was in my waistcoat pocket; I had a pocket-book, which they did not take - there was nothing in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner THOMPSON. Q. When you came into the public-house, did you not say, I was not one of those who stopped? A. She was attempting to escape - the watchman said "Is that one?" I was confused at seeing the three together, and said No, but with the same breath said"Stop her!" I could not recognize her at the distance - I had but a glimpse of her at that time; she went out at the door; I thought she was one but could not recognize her at the moment - I was at the time going in at one door and she was coming out at the other, and the other prisoners were trying to escape at the back part of the house; I am positive she is the person - I said at the place I was robbed at that if I did not get my money, I would hang them, as I was irritated; that was immediately after being robbed - I did not say so at the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SHAW. You met me at half-past eleven o'clock the preceding evening, and went with me to the Bull's Head public-house, Smithfield, gave me three glasses of gin and peppermint and after that wanted to gamble with a gentleman at the bar, but the landlord would not let you - you took me to a house of accommodation in West-street. Witness. I did not see her at any house, or ask her to take anything, or take her to any house - I was at the Theatre at half-past eleven o'clock; I was not intoxicated.</p>

            . I lodge in Scotch-yard, Whitecross-street, on the first floor; Thompson has occupied a room on the ground floor for about two months. I was ill with a bad leg on this night, and could not get rest; I went to sleep about four o'clock and was awoke by a noise and quarrelling; I heard a woman, who I thought was Thompson, call out, "Don't break all my things!" I heard, as I thought, a man's voice swearing bitterly half a dozen times,"I will do it;" when all was silent I got up and came down stairs, and opposite the street door was a butcher's chaise cart, in which I found a hat - I took it up stairs, and afterwards delivered it to Thomas.</p>

               <p>Prisoner THOMPSON. Q. Did you hear the man cry Murder! A. No - I heard a good deal which I could not understand; when he came for his hat he said he had lost 3l. 11s., and if he did not get it he would hang them.</p>

On the 28th of May I went with some friends to Old Bagnigge-wells - there was a concert there; I came away about twelve o'clock with my husband and a relation; my husband and I had a few words, and they left me in the street - I had drank a little, but was perfectly sensible; I lost my way - I was down by the Marsh-gate, New-road; I did not know my way home, and gave myself in charge to the watchman, telling him my husband and I had quarrelled and left me, and I did not know my way home - he took me to the watch-house; I do not know what watch-house it was - I asked to remain there for the night, as I did not know my way home; I sat there about half an hour - I then had the articles stated in the indictment on; the watchman thought me capable of going home; I came out and wandered about, not knowing my way - I was perfectly sober then, but was bewildered and frightened, not knowing my way; I did not ask the watchman to tell me my way, nor tell him where I lived - I live in Little Gower-place, Enston-square; I was frightened, and did not know what watch-house I was in - I wandered about for an hour, and met the prisoner Johnson about two o'clock; she put her hand on me, and asked me to treat her - I said I would provided she would see me home; I told her where I lived; I went into a public-house to treat her - she took me about for more than an hour; I said I was sure that was not the way home - she said, "Oh, Yes - I know a good shop where we can get it good;" I said, "For God's sake, see me home:" we went into a house, and had as much gin as came to 1s. 1 1/2d.; there were two or three others in the house; she said to them, "Come along," and they all partook of the gin; I drank about half a glass - we staid there about ten minutes; she came out with me: I had not been out of the house a quarter of an hour before Johnson and the male prisoner dragged me up a court; they said they were going to see me home, and fastened my scarf round me, that I should not lose it; they knocked me down, and rolled me in a gutter; the watchman found me lying there, senseless; they had struck me on the head, and tore my gown: my arm was bruised, and I was nearly stripped; I felt somebody taking my ring off; before that I said, "Where are you going to take me, for God's sake take care of me;" "Oh, you b-h, (said they) we will take care of you;" I said, "Take every thing I have, but spare my life;" my brooch was taken; I screamed Murder! in the passage, and the watchman came to me; he saw them, and took Johnson; I was quite exhausted in the struggle, and was taken to the watch-house, senseless, with struggling for my life; we had only taken three sixpenny worths of gin and water and a pint of ale; I recollect every thing that happened; I walked to the watch-house. I was stripped of my bonnet, scarf, rings, cap, comb, and all. I certainly told the Magistrate I was in liquor, and I say so now.</p>

I saw the prosecutrix and two prisoners come down Hart-street together, about two o'clock in the morning; they were forcing her along, as it were against her consent - they held her arms; she stopped opposite my box; I crossed over - she was rather noisy, objecting to go with them; I thought she was intoxicated, for she was all over mud, and her clothes torn; I said if she did not go on quietly I must take her to the watch-house; Johnson said,"No, don't do that - you seem to be a married man; she has been to the watch-house, and the constable of the night has been so kind as to discharge her - we are taking her home."

I heard a noise in Hart-street, and found Mara talking to the prosecutrix and prisoners; he was putting her cap and bonnet straight on her head; the prisoners said they knew where she lived, and would see her home; they went on about fifty yards, and then ran from her with all speed; we ran up, and found her lying there, with her bonnet, shawl, and cap stripped off; Mara ran and overtook the prisoners - I afterwards returned to where they were stopped, and found the shawl dropped down an area, in the way they had been brought to the watch-house.</p>

No. I do not remember biting the watchman's finger; I did not see Edmunds in the public-house - he laid hold of me immediately I came out - my arms have been black ever since: I did not see a creature about me but them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner EDMUNDS. She tried to bite me; I let her go, and walked away; this watchman came after me. Did I not walk back with you to justify myself? A. No; I took you back: I said what a shame it was to leave her in that way; Johnson said, "D-n her, we shall leave no more trouble with her;" I said, "How came you to rob her of her bonnet and things?" she said, "D-n her bonnet - here it is, and the comb, for you;" in Plumbtree-street one of them shoved the shawl down an area; the prosecutrix was fainting, and was carried to the watch-house. I saw nobody else running away.</p>
               <p>JOHNSON'S Defence. She came over to me in Broad-street, St. Giles', between twelve and one o'clock, quite intoxicated, and asked if I could get her anything to drink - she gave me 1s.; a watchman came over, and said,"What, mistress, have you not been home yet - you have been in the watch-house, and promised to go home;" she said she would go home when she thought proper - we went over and had some gin, which came to 1s. 1 1/2d.; she had not got the 1 1/2d. - the landlord said, "Take her out, or she is beastly drunk;" she followed me over, and asked me to get her a bed; this man was passing with an umbrella - she caught hold of his arm; two watchmen same, and said they would take her to the watch-house: at this time there were two men and two women with her; they went a little way, and then left her: we stopped, and he watchman came up; this watchman pulled her about; I said, "Don't ill-use her - let her go home; she says she lives in Tottenham-court-road:" we took her a little way- her bonnet fell off before we touched her, she was so intoxicated; this man left me; I could not get her on - she fell, being so drunk, and I left her.</p>
               <p>EDMUNDS' Defence. I met her - the rain poured; she asked me to hold the umbrella over her, which I did; two persons were there; she said she had been robbed of two rings, and they directly ran away; she began making a noise; these watchmen came up; I was going to move her on - she bit my finger; and about twenty yards further on she tried to bite me again; I left her, but ran back for my umbrella; I came away; this young woman followed me; I stood talking to her; when the watchman came up I returned with him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE PRATT re-examined. I did not lose sight of her till she was robbed; I saw her fall, and they both ran away; there was nobody near her but the prisoners; they were both going away together when I came up to them.</p>

I saw the prisoner drive the waggon into the yard on the 2d of July; there was another man with him - they began to unload the oats, and wanted me and the other man to help, as he was in a great hurry; we had our own work, and could not; they carried up two or three sacks; he then said he should leave the other man to finish, as he was going to join his benefit society, at the Grove House, to dine; he went away, and I never saw him again; the other man stopped in the yard some time, but did not unload, for master came and asked how much corn had been shot; the rest was not unloaded. The waggon remained there till after eleven o'clock at night, and then Wilmot fetched it home, after unloading it. I did not see the prisoner again till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did the prisoner arrive at your yard? A. About six o'clock in the evening; it was very near six; master is a stage proprietor; strangers are not allowed in our yard; the other man was not detained: the prisoner said he wanted to have his dinner, and would come again; I was absent at tea about ten minutes, and when I returned master was questioning about the corn.</p>

            . I am a coachmaster. On the 2d of July the waggon came to my yard, but only twentyeight quarters of oats were in it; I did not see the prisoner - the waggon was fetched about eleven or twelve o'clock; I found two men unloading the waggon between six and seven o'clock; they were in a hurry; I found the deficiency, and would not let it be unloaded; I sent my son to Thomas, to fetch the waggon; Wilmot came - only three sacks had been shot; he measured it, and two quarters were deficient; here is the delivery ticket - I have written on it "Only twenty-eight quarters."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The carman gave you this note with thirty quarters written on it? A. It was given to my wife by somebody; there has been no attempt to alter the figures: I followed the waggon into the yard almost directly it came; they had shot three sacks; I found nobody in the yard but two strangers; they said they had nothing to do it with it - I did not see the prisoner.</p>

On the 27th of May the prisoner was given into my charge by one of Mr. Thomas' clerks; he offered to give me 5s. to let him go, and within three hundred yards of the watch-house he tried to get from me, but I kept my hold; the clerk came to my assistance; he said he had done nothing.</p>

            . In 1827 I belonged to a benefit club, and on the 2d of July was at the club with the prisoner, at Grove House, Camberwell; the prisoner was there at a quarter to four o'clock - he was a member; he stopped there with me till half-past nine; a short thick man in a smock-frock came running, and told him something wrong had happened about the corn - he said there was something short; I did not exactly understand it; the man ran away directly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever seen the short thick man since? A. No; I should know him among a thousand; the prisoner asked him what was the matter, and he was off directly: the prisoner ran after him, to know what was the matter, and did not come back - he stopped out on the green till I came to him, which was in four minutes; the man ran towards town; I ran after him for half a mile; he ran by the Elephant and Castle, into the Borough: the prisoner did not return to the club, nor did I; the man came about half-past seven o'clock, as near as I can guess - we paid for every thing as it was brought to us: I knew the prisoner lived at Dock head, somewhere, but did not know his master's name; I once lived with him at Russell's, in Friday-street; I never saw him after this happened; he has a wife and family - he never came to the club again, and his name was scratched out.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHEFFORD re-examined. I got into my yard about five minutes after the waggon arrived; I saw there were more sacks in the granary than the corn would fill, and measured it.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Sepulchre's without. On the 4th of June, about eight o'clock in the morning, I went to No. 21, Peter-street, to apprehend two prisoners for another robbery; I was searching for the property in the room, and discovered this bundle of clothes - the prisoner was in the room; I asked her who rented the room; she said she did, and had done so for some time - I said, "Whose clothes are these?" she said they were her brother's, and that he was in a school; I asked what school he was in - she hesitated, and said I did not understand her - it was her brother-in-law's son; I said, "What school is he in?" she did not answer, but sat down, and began to cry; I said, "I have no doubt the things are stolen - you must go with me;" she then said, one Charley, a pot-boy, who lived in Holborn twelve months ago, left them with her the night before, and was to call for them that morning; I found the clothes belonged to St.Luke's school; her house is about a quarter of a mile from Noble-street; I went to the prosecutrix, who said she had also lost a black silk gown and apron; I went and saw Millen find the gown and apron in the same room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He took a young woman named Matthews out of my room; the property was not in the room then; it was brought there between the time of his taking her and returning. I mentioned nothing about any school.</p>

            . I live with my father and mother. - On Wednesday morning, the 4th of June, my father went out at six o'clock - I went out myself at ten minutes after six, and left my mother asleep; I shut my mother's bed-room door after me - it shuts with a latch; I heard it latch: I found the street door standing open - we always leave it open; the latch of the room door has no handle to it - it fastens inside; it cannot be opened outside without a piece of wood being put into a little hole - that lifts it up; I am certain I latched it, and tried it afterwards.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About half-past seven o'clock in the morning I was standing at my street door; that gentleman had taken a young woman out of my room to the watch-house; a lad came up to me, who I knew as a potboy at a public-house in Holborn; he had a bundle under his arm. and said, "Will you let me leave this with you, for I am going into the City, and will return for it?" I said, "I don't know, for I am in a deal of trouble, as a young woman has been taken from my house;" he said he would come for it at half-past four o'clock, whether he came or not I do not know.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Butler the Post-mistress of Hounslow; I have lived with her four years. Seven mails call at Hounslow every morning in their way to town; when the first arrives the guard rings the bell; I sleep in the second-floor front room - on the first guard ringing the bell, I get out of bed and open the first floor window, and he throws the bags in; I then return to bed - this was the constant custom. On the morning of the 19th of February I remember the guard ringing: I opened the window - the bags were thrown in, and I returned to my room; as the different mails came in I heard the bags thrown in - I knew all the mails, and heard the horns; I did not go to sleep again - one guard rang the bell, and I delivered him the London bag from my bed room window: I went down to the first floor front room about two minutes after the guard rang for the London bag, and found only the Gloucester set of bags - I expected to find six sets - the rest were all gone; I went directly and told mistress; the Stroud mail came to the door directly after - I went down stairs, opened the front door, and found a ladder lying in the road, just against the pavement under the tree, about nine feet from the house; I afterwards took it into the house - it was a shut up ladder - this is it (looking at it); it laid close against the foot-path - the coaches could pass without going over it; it is high enough for a person to get in at the window with - the foot-path is raised and the ladder leaned against it; I found the Newbury bag lying on the footpath against the step of the door, and took it in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The first mail passed about five o'clock? A. Yes, and the last nearly at six; the window was left open all that hour for the bags to be thrown in - I began to dress myself that morning immediately after the first mail arrived; I was in the room above, and heard all the bags thrown in - I heard nothing else; the ladder laid sideways, not across the road - the window has been left open for the hour all the time I have been there; I dare say that was well known to the people of Hounslow.</p>

            . I am Post-mistress of Hounslow, and receive letters both going into the country and coming to London. We throw the window open when the first mail arrives - the servant then goes up to dress; the other mails come in quick, and throw the bags in; this has been the case for twenty years. On the 19th of February the servant came and gave me information; I immediately went to the room, and found only the Gloucester set of bags - a ladder was brought in with the Newbury bag; twenty-nine bags were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. What inmates were in your house? A. My sister, who was ill, Mrs. Letitia, and Ann Bickham, who lodged there, and two little children - every one in the house was in bed; I did not take the bags.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Nobody else lived in the house? A. No - I secured the house the night before; I bolted the front door, as I always do: nobody sleeps in the room the bags are thrown into - a person in the room above could hear them thrown in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could anybody have got into your house except at the window? A. They could not - the bags must have been taken out at the window; I examined the house - every part was secure.</p>

            . I keep the Pembroke Arms public-house, at the corner of Pembroke-square, Kensington. In February last Bull rented of me a four-stall stable, a coach-house, a loft and dwelling-room adjoining - they are all at the back of my house, in my yard; I have frequently seen Smith on Bull's premises - I have seen them in the yard together both before and after the 19th of February; I have seen them together almost daily for two or three months; Bull took the premises for the purpose of taking in horses to bait, and to let horses and gigs - Smith did live at Kensington, about three quarters of a mile from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the mode of entering the loft? A. There is one way from the inside of the stable, and another from the outside, through a door, by means of a ladder; when I let Bull the premises I left him a ladder, expressly for the purpose of getting up to the loft - the ladder produced is the same; but when I let it to him it was one straight piece with thirteen steps: it is now cut in the middle, and folds too, with hinges - the steps were wider than they are now: I recollect seeing it on the 11th of February, but not after - I missed it on Sunday morning, the 16th of March; when I wanted it to get on the roof of my bowling-green shed, as some lead had been stolen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Bull live at these stables? A. He did - I cannot say whether he was there on the 19th of February; I had not seen the ladder after the 11th of February, but had every reason to suppose it was there - I did not want it till the 16th of March; Bull continued to live with me till then, and after - he took the premises in November; the yard is not open to the public - I gave him the keys of the gates; he kept them open in the day time; he appeared to live very regular, but never had any horses or chaises to let; when or how the ladder went I cannot say.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. You used the ladder on the 11th of February, and did not want it again till the 16th of March? A. No; I placed it in Bull's coach-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030023"/>house on the 11th of February, just by the side of the loft - I know it to be the same by one step, which I broke by letting a piece of timber fall on it, and by this nail in it - this step was always cracked; the steps projected about three quarters of an inch beyond the frame-work originally, but they have been cut to make them level with the frame, for the ladder to shut closer - it would not have closed if they had not been cut; Bull and I occupied all the premises - my back door opens into the yard; he had a horse and a chaise cart there, and sometimes two chaise carts, but he let none out - he had a green body to his cart, with a patent axle; he has bought horses and sold them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Your ladder had wider steps than the one produced? A. It had originally - one was broken on the projecting part of the frame, but the greater part of it remains; my customers generally went through the yard to the green.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Bull generally at home at night? A. I cannot say - I never saw him with any bags, nor any about; I have no reason to believe he was absent about the time of the robbery.</p>

            . I am driver of a music van. On the 19th of February, early in the morning, I was on the road to Inglefield-green and stopped with my van at the Coach and Horses public-house, a very short way from Hounslow - it was a very dark morning; I went into the tap-room, and as I went in two men passed me; and when I got in, there was another man finishing a glass of gin; as I went I said "Good morning gentlemen, it is a very sharp morning;" one of them said it was very sharp - one of them had a light coat on, and the other, who finished the gin, had a jacket; it seemed to be a light jacket - there was a light in the tap-room; I had to move aside to let the men pass me to come out - the man finished his gin and went out; he seemed about the size of Smith - I cannot swear he is the man; before I went into the tap-room I drew up alongside a cart which stood close against the door; it was a light chaise cart, with pannels - there were no other persons coming out of the tap-room; it opens immediately into the road - I saw a ladder in the cart - about two rails hung over the tail of the cart; it was this end of the ladder, because I could see some iron work about it - I stopped in the taproom for ten or twenty minutes; I heard it drive off - after the man went out of the tap-room, I proceeded on, and when I got to Hounslow, I saw a cart opposite some trees, about the middle of the town; I cannot positively swear it was the same cart, but it looked very much like it - there was a horse in it: I saw two men standing about, but nobody in it, and did not observe the ladder then; I did not take particular notice, but passed on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What time were you at the public-house? A. About five o'clock - I went through Smallberry-green turnpike that morning; and that cart must have gone through the same turnpike and must have known the number - I do not swear to Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you asked before the Magistrate to point out the persons you saw at the public-house, to the best of your judgment? A. Yes, and I pointed to the officer, and to an old thin man, who was taller than either of the prisoners.</p>

            . I am ostler of the Coach and Horses. On the 19th of February, about nine o'clock in the morning, I recollect a cart coming with three men; they had some hay and water, and some gin; they left the cart two or three yards from the door for a few minutes; it was a kind of light market-cart, with a stoutish horse - the tail of the cart was let about half-way down, and something hung half out of it; I cannot say what it was, for it was covered over - I think it was covered with a mat - it lodged just inside the tail-board; the men staid in the house a few minutes, had four glasses of gin, and went on with the cart towards Hounslow; it came from towards town: after giving their horse some hay I went and hung the three keys of our stable in the passage; the three men were with me, and saw me hang them up; there was a light three or four yards from where the keys hung - the passage leads from the tap-room; I missed those three keys eight or ten minutes after they were gone - they went through that passage to come in and go out: a man came with a music-van shortly before they left. (Looking at a key produced by Ruthven) this looks very much like one of the keys;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030024"/>many keys are alike; I missed the keys about three minutes after the van went. I have seen a cart this morning - I cannot swear whether it is the one the men came with - it resembles it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you hear of this robbery? A. Yes, that morning; two or three days after that two men were apprehended, and one was taken to Brentford, in custody; Bull came to our house, and demanded a horse and gig which were left there; I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think he was one of the men who had been there on the 19th? A. I thought nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you see Smith? A. I saw him at Bow-street; I never pretended to say he was one of the men; if this is our key it has been altered; there is a good deal cut out of the middle; another key was produced at the office, which I said was a little like one of ours - I have three fellow servants, who use the keys as well as me. I said what I saw in the cart was covered up, and looked like a coffin - I saw no part of it project over the tail; it was not my business to notice it: I did not say only three men were at the house that morning; I said the music van came just as they were going away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Two men were taken to prison? A. That was a few days after - they were taken on suspicion of robbing a waggon; their cart stopped at our house - Bull came and claimed it; I had no reason to believe he was the man who had been before.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When they went out, did one go out first or two? A. One went out with me, and two were left in the tap-room.</p>

            . My father keeps the Coach and Horses. On the 19th of February, in the morning, three of the stable keys were missing - the one produced is one of them; the interior of the wards have since been filed out - it is turned into a skeleton-key, but I know it by a mark on the face of the bit. I have locked up the stable twice a week for the last two years, and my attention has been called to this key - I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What enables you to speak to it? A. That grove and the faulty part on the face of the bit; I told the Magistrate I also knew it by the brazing - I believe, after I gave my evidence, Mr. Harmer said that was common to all keys; I then mentioned the grove and other parts; the ostlers lock up the stables, but if they forget it I do it; the other two ostlers are not here; I do not know whether they have been asked about the keys.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. You locked the stable about twice a week? A. Yes; I have known the key about two years.</p>

            . I am a blacksmith. I have a lock here whick I took off Woodward's stable door; this key fits the opening of the lock; the wards of the key have been taken out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. If the wards were there, you cannot say whether it would open it? A. Yes; I am certain of it; it is a very particular lock - there is no collar ward to it - I call it an uncommon key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate they might get a key at any stall in London to undo this lock? A. Not that lock; they asked the value of the key - I said they might get one at any stall for 1s.; a common key reduced to this shape would certainly open it; the key-hole is worn - most likely this is not the key which was first made for the lock, but it has been made as a make-shift. I never heard of a reward in this case.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do not you call all keys that are not straight,"fancy bits?" A. Yes - whether this has been one or not I do not know: this has no doubt been "burred" to fit the lock.</p>

            . I keep the turnpike-gate at Smallberry-green, which is a little on this side of Hounslow. - On the 19th of February, about five o'clock in the morning, I remember a cart passing through, towards Hounslow; I saw two men in it; it was a dark morning; there appeared something in the cart - I could not observe what; I did not particularly look at the back of the cart - there was something in it about the size of the cart: it appeared to be loaded as other carts are; I did not notice the tail-board- about six o'clock the same morning a cart returned, trotting very fast, with two men in it - they called the proper number; they drove very fast, which made me notice them; it was a dark coloured horse, and a dark cart; my lamp was nearly out - it appeared to be a light cart, for draft.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You change your number at twelve o'clock at night? A. Yes; every cart that goes through knows the number, and they often tell others the number.</p>

            . I know the prisoner Bull and his wife. About the middle of February I went to his premises at the Pembroke Arms - I went in, and saw Smith there, with Bull - I saw a ladder standing at the loft door: I saw Bull standing by the side of the ladder, with a fork, which he took out of the stable; he was holding it up close to the side of the ladder, to measure it, to cut it, to put it into the cart; I went down out of the loft - Smith was then standing at the side of the cart, with the same fork; I saw him hold the fork along the side of the cart; when he saw me he put it down, and asked what I wanted - I said I was come to see if they could pay the money for the use of a horse and cart which they had of Thompson; they had taken it away when Thompson was in trouble; I saw Bull put the fork to the side of the cart - it was a green cart; Smith said he could not do anything then, I must come again in a fortnight; I went up stairs, and staid all day with Mrs. Bull; when Bull came up he told me Smith could do nothing yet, he was short of money, but in the course of a week or fortnight, or it might be a month, he could, for he had a job in hand: I asked what - he said it was a job at the Post-office at Hounslow, and it was a "put up job" Smith was not present; I understood by that that they were going to rob the Post-office. He said they had a job in hand - Bulls' wife was present; I was not very intimate with Bull; I did not know him till Thompson was taken: I did not hear of the Post-office robbery till I mentioned that they talked of doing it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030025"/>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you married? A. I am - I have been married ever since 1812; I have no husband now: I do not know whether he is dead; I have not seen him for about four years; I do not always go by the name of Collins - I never lived but with one man; I went by the name of Wright - I go by that name now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you gone by any other name since you have married Collins? A. I do not think that question has anything to do with this; I never went by the name of Thompson - he was taken up for robbing the Tally Ho, Birmingham coach, and Smith was one of the party. -Wright's name was Wright Waller - that is not two names - it is one person and one name. I have not been living with a parcel of different men; I went by the name of Wright Waller; I know Kinsby - I never lived with him as his wife, or kept woman - I defy you or any one to say so- I have a room in his house, and pay for it, Waller was transported last January Session - I was never taken up for felony.</p>
               <p>Q. In January, 1826, were you committed by Mr. Hardwick, to the custody of Norris, on a charge of felony? A. I never was taken up for thieving - I have been in Clerkenwell prison, but not for thieving; I do not know who took me there; I was not there a month, nor half a month - it was about some wine which was brought into a house when I was in bed and asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoners put down the fork that you might not see what they were at? A. They did not mind me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you say a word before the Magistrate about Smith measuring the cart with the fork? A. I said he was there, as I do now, and that he held it by the side of the cart; I mentioned it before I heard the key mentioned - I cannot say at which examination I mentioned it; I never heard of any reward - I never saw the placard.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear you never heard of the reward? A. I do not know about swearing that; I was asked at the office by Mr. Harmer if I wanted the 100l. - I had not heard of it before; I never could find Smith afterwards - I went to Bull's after him, to ask for the clothes they took out of my box; I saw Mrs. Bull - she said if I would come down she would see and get me some things - I did not go for money.</p>

The prisoner Parry's brother-in-law was my apprentice; she used to come backward and forward for work which he did at home - we never delivered any of these articles to her; we have missed an immense quantity of goods from our back warehouse. On the 31st of May I went with Martin and Forster to Moon's house, in Creed-lane, and found a small quantity of brass claw feet and escutcheons - part of them were in a little box; Moon was at home, and acknowledged that she had bought a great quantity of such things of Parry, who was shewn to her, and that she had given her 5d. a pound for the escutcheons and feet; they were all quite new, and cost me after the rate of 30s. a pound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Which of the articles will you venture to swear to? A. I do not swear to any of them, but they are part of what Parry acknowledged to have taken - I have been told Moon said she was married, but I never saw her husband; Parry's brother never worked on brass - I have missed 50 lbs. weight of goods; I was missing things every day - nobody could buy them as old brass; they were not exposed for sale at her house - they are quite new and are made at Birmingham.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The things found, I suppose, are worth 2d.? A.

            . I am a City patrol. I went with Foster and Parry to Moon's house - I found Moon in the parlour, which appeared to be used as a shop; I asked Moon if she knew Parry - she said she did, and that a few days before she had bought about thirteen brushes of her for 18d., and had sold them in Petticoat-lane to people who came by in the street; I asked if she had bought anything else of her - she said Yes, some old brass at different times, about 2 lbs., for which she gave her 13d. or 14d. in all; not being aware that the prosecutors had lost brass, I said I was not looking for brass, but brushes - Mr. Barber and Forster came in at that moment, and said he had lost a great deal of brass furniture; we asked if she had any of it left - she went to the trunk and pulled out three or four of the brass things; I pulled out some - she said that was all she had left; she was questioned and said she had dealt with Parry for about three months - that she asked her where she got the things, and she said they were her father's or brother's, and said Parry had stated that what she gave 1 1/2d. for, her brother could get 2 1/2d. for, over the water; Parry said in her hearing that she had sold her a vast number of things at different times - none of the brass was exposed to view; I never saw her husband - her daughter was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Parry deny receiving 13d. or 14d. for them? A. Parry always said she did not give more than 5d. or 5 1/2d. a pound; she did not deny telling her she had them from her brother: Moon said she was no judge of the articles, and bought them by weight; nobody could buy them as old brass.</p>

            , JUN. I am in partnership with my father. We have lost a quantity of property, and Parry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030028"/>confessed to taking it; these articles cost 30s. or 33s. a pound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you in a large way of business? A. Yes. Parry's brother covered boxes with leather; he did not work on brass: we missed most of the property the beginning of April - her brother seldom came except on Saturday, to receive his money; Parry said she had been in the habit of taking articles of this description, and others which we lost, at various times, for the last nine months; she had been told if she confessed who she sold them to she would be dealt mercifully with - my father told her so, but she had before that said she had been in the habit of selling them; she had been brought back by the officer with some of our brushes, and I believe she told who she sold the property to, before my father promised to be lenient.</p>
               <p>MR. BARBER. I looked at her, and said, "Have you been robbing me in this way?" A. She said, "If you will be merciful I will tell you all;" I said I would recommend her as well as I could - when the things were produced at Moon's she said she had sold them to her; I said nothing to induce Moon to make a statement.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why did you not tell us this before? A. It did not strike you to ask me, or I should have stated it; I intended to recommend her strongly to mercy, but I could not let her go - she told me she had taken some things before; I said I would be lenient, and she acknowledged taking several things, but not that she had sold them to Moon.</p>
               <p>MOON's Defence. I asked if they were her own - she said Yes, and that her father sent her with them.</p>

            . I am groom to Mr. Elmore, of Duke-street, Manchester-square. On the 29th of June I was sent to Mr. Reed's, a farmer, near <placeName id="t18280703-26-crimeloc135">Harrow</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was the fight fair? A. No - Casey struck with a stick, and John had nothing but his fist; I cried out that it was not fair, and then all these others came up - they fought for an hour or better before the others came up.</p>
               <p>Q. What, before the others came up? A. They were so long between the rounds; the stick continued in Casey's hands all the time, but after about three blows were struck on John's head with the stick, it was lost; he cut him very much about the forehead with the stick, and after that the fight was fair: after fighting about an hour the others came up, and Long John was struck by Casey across the loins, with a hay-fork, which the others had brought up; one for him, and the others for themselves; some brought hayforks, and some sticks; they came from Mr. Reed's barn, which is about two hundred yards off; Long John was standing on his legs when Casey struck him across the loins with the fork; the blow knocked him down, and he never moved hand or foot after that blow.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time none of the others had done anything? A. No; I did not see whether one of them gave him the fork, or whether he took it himself; we were all obliged to run away then, for they all ran after us with their forks - Casey followed with the rest: Long John remained on the ground: I, and a person who was with me, ran into my mother's house - we returned to the spot in about twenty minutes, and found only the body there; Bell and a woman stood looking at it; Long John was not quite dead - he drew his last breath after we got there, as we were carrying him to a house; he did not speak, but appeared to be alive: the blood was running down his nose; he made a noise with his nose; we found some forks about, which we have brought here. The prisoners were all hay-makers at Mr. Reed's. I took the body to the Green Man public-house, which is about ten yards from where it began - he was dead then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. It was very dark? A. Yes, but I could distinctly see every thing that was done; I could see it was a black-thorn stick: I believe they had been fighting before I came up; the deceased was a stranger to me - I took no part in the fight; I had an elm walking-stick in my hand - my feet were blistered, as I had been driving a cart, which I am not used to - I could scarcely walk on my toes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you strike Casey? A. They ran at us, and as I ran I struck him on the knuckles - that was all; I did not see Casey knocked down by any one; the witnesses Nix and Arnold were knocked down while Casey and John were fighting: Barry and Hayes knocked them down- when I assisted to pull Casey off I put my stick back,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030029"/>and struck him on the knuckles as I ran away, to prevent the fork from coming into me; none of us fought with them; they could get the pitch-forks from the barn in two minutes; before we could turn round they were on us again.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and work for Mr. Reed. I was at the back door of the Green Man on the night in question; Long John went out at the back door: his woman was with him - a number of Irishmen came out after him; one of them spoke to him out at the door - they seemed quarrelling, but what it was about, or what he said, I cannot say; Casey lifted up his fist, and knocked Long John down, without saying any more - Long John then called out for help, to get the man off; I went to him, and saw these men beating him when he was down, and I assisted him: Casey was beating him - I cannot speak to the others; he laid on the ground - Casey and some others were beating him; I was in the scuffle about ten minutes, and then had a fork run into my cheek and under my chin - I was then struck down with a blow on my head, from a fork, and was senseless.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there? A. I cannot say - they were all fighting one among another, but after that I saw nothing more; Long John and the rest of the Englishmen were fighting with the Irishmen, for their lives - this happened near the trees, about twenty yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You work at Reed's? A. Yes - another Mr. Reed is the prisoners' employer. When the row began there was not above five men, but more came afterwards; Casey spoke to the deceased before he struck him; whether it was in anger or not I cannot say - I cannot swear that anybody but Casey struck him - he was a tall strong man; we fought for our lives, and struggled to get away as well as we could.</p>

I was in the tap-room of the Green Man with him - the prisoners were up in the clubroom; they did not seem to be in liquor - he was sober; he went out about half-past ten o'clock, for a certain purpose - I went after him, and just as I got to the door I saw Casey knock him down; I heard no words between them- I got up to go out as soon as he got up, and when I got to the door I saw Casey knock him down; he got up, and immediately struck Casey again - four men then came out to assist Casey; he assisted himself as well as he could, and when they got a little distance they all came up with forks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nobody to assist John? A. Only the two who got hurt; all the rest ran away; Casey's wife and Muiray were two of the four, and one is not taken; they would not let him get up any more.</p>
               <p>Q. A witness has said they fought for an hour before the forks came? A. No - there was a great skirmish, but not for so long as that; I was close to them - they tried to beat John, but as he was very strong they could not, till they got the forks; these men then fell on him. knocked him down, with the forks, and beat him as long as they could; Casey and his wife then got on him, and stamped on him; he lived for half an hour after that; Casey and the other two men struck him with forks - the fork struck him in the eye - I saw the whole of it; there was no fighting for an hour, nor any stopping between the bouts - Casey went away for half an hour, returned with a scythe and fork, and said to me, "Is he dead?" I said he was dead, but he was not - Casey said, "If he is not dead, I am come to kill him with a scythe and fork;" nobody but me was there then - he made towards the body, but a man came from the other side of the hedge to assist me, and so he went away without touching the body.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it last altogether? A. I suppose an hour, the skirmish with the fork and all; before he was dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. You have cohabited with the deceased eight years? A. Yes - there were four of us in the public-house; we had two pots of beer - we were there about an hour and a half: I did not say at the office that I had been there five hours; the deceased was quite sober - two others shared the beer with us; there was no quarrelling in the house: the prisoners were not in the tap-roop; I went out directly after John, to get him to go home; he knocked Casey down after Casey had knocked him down - there were five of them down; the deceased was very violent on this occasion - his right name was John Eales; we had been down there about three weeks - we went to hay-making; I saw John Nix strike a man with a stick, but I kept by my own man; the witnesses helped John all they could, when they tried to get him down.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a general row and scuffle, after the quarrel between the deceased and Casey? A. Yes - there were four on our side, and, I suppose, fourteen on the other - some others were on the other side of the hedge, but not with us; I do not exactly know how many there were on our side.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to RICHARD ARNOLD. Q. You saw Casey strike the deceased near the public-house? A. Yes, and he got on him as soon as he was down; Rackley was not there till I was beat out of my senses - I did not see him: I was wounded in the chin in less than ten minutes.</p>

            . I am carter to Mr. Gray. I was not at this fight, but got up just after, and was taking the deceased off the ground, when Casey came up, and asked who I was; he said he would kill me - I said, "I hope not John;" he said, "Who are you?" he came and looked at me, and said, "You are Gray's carter - is the man dead? if he is not I will kill him quite;" this was about eleven o'clock - I gave him good words, and he went away; I went with him a little way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you alone? A. No; the woman was with me; I had seen no part of the transaction.</p>

            . I was in the Green Man publichouse about twenty minutes or half-past ten o'clock; I saw the deceased and Arnold go out of the house - they went across to where there were some lrishmen and women, who appeared to be quarrelling; there seemed an uproar - I could not hear what passed - I said there was a fight, and ran over - the deceased was then stripped, and fighting with Casey, with his fist; just as I got up they were both down; the men there got them up again, and almost immediately they were down again - they were still<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030030"/>fighting with their fists; they continued to fight fair for five or ten minutes, but when some more Irishmen came running up the road, and threw stones over the hedge, where I and several young men were standing - I said it was time to run away; I ran to the house, and asked the landlord to let me in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. You heard an uproar before you saw them fighting? A. Yes; the deceased was stripped, and I think Casey was not stripped, but I was so confused I did not notice; I did not see the beginning, and cannot say who struck first; Casey would not let the man go when he was on the ground - they were pulled away by somebody; both seemed irritated: the deceased seemed to want to fight fair - Nix and Arnold were there; I cannot say whether they interfered; I saw nobody with sticks; but I returned a second time from the public-house, and then saw Lacey with a fork or scythe.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. I went to the Green Man; the landlord would not draw me any beer: I was returning to my lodging, and on the green, very near the Green Man I saw two men stripping, as I thought, to fight - I saw the deceased knocked down by Casey; I cannot say what he did it with - it appeared to be with something, not his fist; I had a stick in my hand, being a cripple - I immediately went up to the spot; several men were there - I cannot say who: I interfered with my stick; I had not been long among them before I got a severe cut over the eye, and two stabs underneath; I saw no more pass - I was fighting in among them with my stick, trying to rescue the deceased; I fought till I fell into a ditch, being blinded with the blood, which flowed from one eye into the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you perfectly sober? A. Perfectly; I saw Rattle with a stick; I did not see them strip - I did not get up to them when it first began; I did not see Bell till the deceased was picked up - his (the deceased's) coat and waistcoat were off.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. Had you not seen them fighting before Casey knocked him down? A. No: I did not fight - I kept them off from the poor man as well as I could, with my hands; I did not knock anybody down - I tried to do it; I was there about a quarter of an hour: there was not a general battle; I saw the Irish with forks - I did not see the deceased's party strike the prisoners; I saw the prisoners strike them repeatedly - they did not return the blows; I never saw the deceased before: I had lived there about three weeks, and came from High Wycombe; I never heard the deceased called the fighting man; there were about six English and fourteen Irishmen- I did not see the whole of the fight.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On the 30th of June, at one o'clock in the morning, I saw the deceased lying on a board in a stable quite dead; he had been very much beat about the face - the bruises were very considerable; there were two incised wounds on the upper lip and one in the under lip - that appeared a contused wound; the lower jaw was fractured - his month was full of blood, and there were punctures with a fork in his left shoulder and considerable bruises about the chest: on opening the scalp a great quantity of blood flowed out, and on opening the skull ten or twelve ounces of blood flowed; there was a considerable wound in the left eye, about two inches long, on the orbit ridge; I consider the suffusion of blood on the brain must have been the cause of his death; a blow on the loins might have brought on paralysis no doubt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. It is your opinion that he died from the suffusion of blood on the brain? A. Yes; he appeared to have been knocked about by very heavy weapons; I think the wounds on the lip were caused by the prongs of a fork - I cannot say whether the blow in the eye was caused by a stick or a fall.</p>

On the 14th of June last, before this business happened, the party of the deceased came up to the barn, which Mr. Reed allowed myself and my fellow prisoners to sleep in, and threw stones and brick-bats into the barn, and threatened to kill us. On the night in question, which was Sunday, I was at the Green Man; the deceased was there, and struck me first - he gave me a violent blow, and knocked me down; he also knocked Burke down, and beat him when down. After the deceased struck me I returned the blow; I then retired from the fight; the deceased renewed the fight - he ran over to where I was, and struck me a second time, upon which I instantly seized a pitch-fork, which laid in my way, and which I had used the day before, in hay-making, and I struck Long John with it: my fellow prisoners and myself were first struck by the deceased and his party, and a general scuffle then followed; I and my fellow prisoners were knocked down many times, and much cut by pitch-forks, which the deceased and his party struck us with. I declare, before God and my country, I had no intention to kill any one; I was almost cut to pieces by the deceased and his party.</p>

I am a labourer in the London Docks; in January last I lived in the Commercial-road. on the 19th of January, about nine o'clock at night, I was in North-street, Limehouse, waiting for a young man; the watchman was calling nine o'clock - I heard somebody cry Stop thief! and saw the prisoner at the bar run by me, with a basket under his arm; he was alone - I went after him, keeping very close to him, and about one hundred yards on, when he found I was very close behind him, he chucked the basket from under his arm; I let the basket lay on the ground, and kept in pursuit; I ran as far as Trafalgar-square, Stepney, and as he turned round I caught him, without losing sight of him - he had run<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030035"/>about two hundred yards altogether; I brought him back in the way he had run, and met a boy who lived at a public-house - he had picked up the basket, and was bringing it after us; it was him who had been calling Stop thief! the prisoner said nothing, but abused me very much - my friend, whom I was waiting for, heard me crying Stop thief! and followed; he assisted me in conveying him to Mile-end watch-house; he gave no account how he came by the basket: I left it at the watch-house with him. I then met Slater - he stated what he had lost; I took him to the watch-house, and he spoke to the basket; Mrs. Slater claimed the articles at the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When I ran by you why did you not stop me? A. I was standing on the pavement, and he was in the road - I was not near enough to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You said at the watch-house that you were down another street at the time? A. I was down no street - I stood at the top; there is a watch-box at the corner, and the watchman went out to cry nine o'clock: I never lost sight of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw Slater about half an hour after you took the prisoner? A. Yes - he was all over mud, his face and clothes, and every thing, and his fingers cut; the basket was all over mud, and the handles broken, as if it had been pulled to pieces; the prisoner's hands were dirty, and his fingers cut.</p>
               <p>MRS SLATER. The basket and property were delivered up to me afterwards, and are not here; I am quite sure they were the same - the basket, when I saw it, was broken all to pieces, and all muddy; the things in it were also muddy - they were worth 10s.</p>

            . I am twelve years old, and am errand-boy to Mr. Wasp, a shoe-maker. On Saturday, the 14th of June, between four and five o'clock, Mr. Finch brought a letter and wanted to pay the postage; I took the letter to the prisoner at the bottom of the shop, and asked him the postage - he said, 7d.; I then took the letter back to Finch, who paid me 7d., and went out; I was going to mark the letter as paid - the prisoner came up, and took it out of my hand, with the postage, and told me to go to my own board; which I did, and saw no more of the money or letter - there was nobody else in the shop; (looking at the letter), this is the letter; this "Paid 7d." at the top of it, is my writing - on the Tuesday following I was sent out on an errand, and was going to take my pan-pipe with me; but my master told me to lay it down - I laid it down between my board and the prisoner's; I returned in about an hour, and could not find it; I asked the prisoner if he had seen it - he said, master had taken it from me, and would give it to me in the morning; I saw Johnson the female servant, and asked her about it - she knew nothing of it; I at times put bread and butter on my board, and always found it taken away - some was taken on the 16th of June.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner did not abscond? A. No; he was taken on the Wednesday - he seldom has his meals at the shop; he stays at home all Sunday - he does not sleep at master's; I saw my bread and butter found in the same place as the letters - it was in the shop in which the letters are received; I sometimes seal the letter bags - master always tells me when to begin to seal; I do not mean to say he is always present - the letters are put into a drawer; the key of which was lost when I first went there - it had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030036"/>been found, and the drawer was locked on the Saturday in question; my mistress locked it - my master always managed the letters; we have a book to refer to, to find the rate of postage - a double letter to Tring, would be 1s. 2d.; I take in paid letters now and then - but have not done it since this has happened; I have been in master's service two months - the maid servant never marked letters, nor took them in; master's desk is sometimes left open.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. There is a box in which unpaid letters are put, is that locked? A. Yes; the key is kept in master's-desk; the paid letters are put through a slit into a drawer - the key of that is kept in the desk; the money is put into another drawer, over that - the money drawer has no lock; I saw the letters found under the further cutting-board in the shop, and my brend and butter was with them - we all work at that board.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Wasp. I first heard of Perry losing his pipe on Wednesday evening, the 18th of June, about a quarter to ten o'clock; I asked master about it - he said, he knew nothing about it; I then searched for it in the shop, and under the third board I found two letters - that produced is one of them, they laid together and were both open; I unfolded Mr. Finch's letter, and looked at the bill of exchange - I showed the bill to the prisoner and said "Dear me Thomas, do you know anything about these letters?" showing them to him; he said "I don't know anything about them" - I asked him to look at Mr. Finch's letter and he was so agitated he could not hold it; Mr. Thomas Wasp, Jun. was sitting in the warehouse and called me; I gave them to him - the prisoner staid about a quarter of an hour after this, then shut up the shop and went home as usual; after he was gone I took the candle and found another letter under the same board - it had fallen down; I found some bread and butter in the same place - next day (Thursday) the prisoner came to the shop as usual; I said "Dear me, Thomas, I have found another letter;" he said "Don't say anything about it now;" I had not put the letters or bread and butter there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was nobody present when the prisoner said "Don't say anything about it"? A. No; he had heard my master call me away the night before; he said nothing of the kind then; every body in the shop had access to the board - I have lived there twelve months; I never receive letters, nor seal the bags - the boy sometimes seals them; I never have received a single letter since I have been there - I never heard of the key of the drawer being mislaid; I did hear mistress mention it once - that is all; I know where the postage money is kept, because I saw Thomas once take it down - whether it is kept locked I cannot say; I do not know where the keys are kept - I did not know of the key being mislaid till after the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. When did your mistress mention about the key? A. About a week or a fortnight ago.</p>

            , JUN. My father keeps the receiving house at the corner of Chancery-lane; unpaid letters are put into a box at an opening outside the door - it is not always locked, for the key was mislaid for some time; the paid letters are brought in, and given to a person in the shop, who would put them through a hole at the top of the drawer - the postage would be put into another drawer above that; when we make up the bag we compare the amount of the paid letters with the money in the drawer - if they tally it is right; the money drawer is left open for the purpose of giving change. On Wednesday evening, the 18th of July, Johnson was in the shop talking to the prisoner; I did not hear what she said; she came to me and complained of the prisoner having had the boy's pan-pipe - she was searching for it; the prisoner was shutting up at the time - she found these two letters, which were brought to me (looking at them); they were open, and the wafers quite dry; I immediately told the prisoner it was a very serious thing, and whoever had done it would be placed in a very serious situation, and a very strict investigation must follow - he said indistinctly that he did not care what investigation took place; he kept shutting up the shop, and paid little attention to what I said - he was going away without shutting up the inside shutters, and was called back by Johnson to do them; he appeared in a hurry to get away - a customer came in after he was gone, and Johnson brought me a third letter; the letters were found on a shelf under the cutting-board - I did not place them there; the mark of 9d. on the third letter, to the best of my belief, is in the prisoner's writing - it is not the writing of any other person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where do you keep the keys of the letter-boxes? A. In a drawer in my desk, at the very end of the warehouse, for safety sake; the desk is not kept locked - no one has any business there: every body in the shop has access to it; the paid letter-box was locked on the 14th of June, I am certain, and it was usually kept locked, but the key was missing; it might be missing for six months; I did not get another lock, as there was nobody in the shop but my family, the prisoner, and Perry; I am seldom at home except for about two hours in the afternoon, to make up the bag. I believe inquiry was made about the house for the key, but I do not know - it might have been missing only three months; the boy may have sealed the four o'clock bag of letters, in the presence of some of the family, but not alone; I have at times been absent when it was sealed.</p>
               <p>Q. After you told him a strict investigation should be made, did he not return on the Monday, as usual? A. I understood so - he lived in Great Queen-street; there was nothing to prevent his carrying the letters away, or destroying them.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. A customer was in the shop when he left, was not that the cause of his leaving the inside shutters? A. He left before the customer came; he had lived with us about three months.</p>

            . Q. You showed the prisoner the letters that night, did not you? - A. Yes, before I showed them to my master; master spoke to him about it, and he said he knew nothing about it; he was going away without shutting up the inside shutters - I have at times put them up myself, when there was nobody to do it - I forget whether I called him back.</p>
               <p>JOHN WASP. I am the son Mr. Wasp, and reside with him. It is my duty to make up the letters - the bag is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030037"/>made up at five o'clock. On the 14th of June, I made up the paid letters: this is my money bill (looking at it) it is my writing: the paid letter drawer was locked that day, I am certain - to the best of my recollection the money tallied with the letters: sometimes there is a 6d. or so taken out to give change in the business, and if so I always ascertain that it was so taken out; I do not think it happened that day - I did not put these letters under the board.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The money drawer is always open? A. Yes, for we have to give change for almost every paid letter; the key of the letter-box might be lost for two months, not six; the key of the paid letter-box was found six or seven weeks since - I cannot tell when it was lost; I made inquiry about it, and have no doubt but I asked the servant about it, for I made a general inquiry; I never remember the boy sealing the paid letters; I am not absent once in two months; the prisoner never absconded, but was apprehended at our house - the boy has sealed the four o'clock bag, which are unpaid letters.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS here contended that this indictment could not be sustained by the evidence; the prisoner was not employed by the Post-office, according to the meaning of the Act, nor was the property taken out of the shop; which, in this case, must be considered the office, the letter never having been deposited in any letter-box. - The Court held these objections to be good.</p>

               <p>THOMAS WASP. The prisoner was in my service, and entrusted to receive postage of letters and monies paid at my shop. On the 19th of June I showed the prisoner this letter, and asked if the words "paid 9d." on it was his writing - he said Yes, and I knew it to be his; he did not say who took the letter in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where is the postage money put? A. Into a till, but this letter never belonged to me; if we have wanted change for the shop, I have known it taken from the postage at times, for a few minutes, but not often. I have kept the office twenty years; I do not believe it has been done twenty times in those twenty years.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. At what time do you close your box? A. At five o'clock; if a letter is brought after that it is left on the desk for the bellman, who calls at six o'clock; the money is laid on the letter for the postman to take away with him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Letters which are brought after five o'clock are put on a cutting board close to the door with the money on them, for the postman; anybody could take the money, and if brought before five, it is put into a box which is never locked; I recollect once there was 6d. or a 1s. too much in the drawer; the son asked Mrs. Wasp if she knew of it; she told him to look behind the desk to see if any letters had fallen down.</p>
               <p>MR. WASP. When a letter comes after five o'clock, it is put on the first counter, which is not near the door; people who bring them generally know where to lay them.</p>

            . I live in this lane. I saw the cart going along, with the prisoner in it, before the accident; he was driving faster than he ought - he was about one hundred and fifty yards from Mr. Evans' garden; I saw him fall back off the seat of his cart - I ran, and thought he would be thrown out of his cart; but before I could get up, he was out of my sight - the lane is nine feet ten inches wide where the accident happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When he fell, did he appear to lose the command of his horse? A. I cannot say, for I lost sight of him; I saw him hit his horse just before.</p>

            . I am a professor of languages at Harrow-school. I was walking out on the evening in question, and saw a cart passing very rapidly, and immediately afterwards, I saw the deceased child brought up in Buckingham's arms; it was done instantaneously - I did not hear anybody in the cart call out, and cannot recognize the prisoner as the driver; nor did I see the seat to ascertain whether it was broken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see his cart come against the child's cart? A. No; it is low, and might easily escape the observation of the driver.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the lane narrow at this spot? A. The street is narrow all the way through; I think there is scarcely room for two carriages to pass.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. As such, a person would be anxious to get out of the street as soon as he could? A. It was nearly at the end of the street.</p>

               <p>JAMES DEADMAN. On the 28th of December I entrusted John Hill, my servant, with a horse, cart, and harness, and he never returned; I saw my cart last Tuesday in possession of the prisoner - I knew it to be mine, by one wheel in particular; I asked him where he got it - he said, he bought it of a person who he named, and where he lived; that man is here - he said, he gave 4l. for it; I consider it worth 8l. or 10l., it cost me 18l. six months before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was your name on it when you lost it? A. Yes; but when I found it the prisoner's name was on it - the prisoner told me at the public-house, that he would give it up, provided I did not take him before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Being a respectable tradesman he did not wish to go to the office? A. I believe his general character is good; he told me directly that he bought it of Doddridge - I took Doddridge before the Magistrate, and charged him as an accessary, or something; the Magistrate would not entertain the charge, because the thief could not be found.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Osborne. On Tuesday, the 10th of June, I went into the loft, which is on the same floor with Pratt's room, and found the trap-door open, and a ladder by it; I had been there at five o'clock- the door was then bolted: I called to a fellow-servant, and said, "William, what can be the matter?" we stood there, and the prisoner came down in a great hurry, took hold of the ladder, and threw it down; I called out, "What is the matter? there is something amiss here;" he hesitated a minute, and then said, "All is right - all is right;" I said, "I will go and see;" I went up on the roof, and he went away; I did not go into Pratt's room, but there is a sky-light on the leads, which goes down into their room; I saw the prisoner in custody on the Sunday morning following - he has worked there a year and a half, and had a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard of the robbery, and went after the prisoner; he had been working there on the Tuesday morning, but did not return; I did not find him till the Sunday morning - I said, "I came to take you for stealing a watch from Mr. Osborne's yard;" he said, "Are you going to take me to the watch-house?" I said Yes - he said if I would take him to the yard he would make all right; I took him there, and he asked Mr. Osborne to forgive him - I asked him where the watch was, and he sent me to a pawnbroker's, but they denied it.</p>

            . I am clerk to Nicholas Brown and Algernon Wallington, of the Castle and Falcon Inn. On the 6th of June, the two prisoners brought a small box; I said to Jones "I want 2d." he borrowed 6d. of Edwards - I looked for the change, but they went off without it; as soon as they were gone, I missed a parcel which had been on the counter, it had come from Mr. Woods, for Lee and Sons, Coventry; I went to Jones' employers and waited till he came home, and gave him into custody - I said he had brought a parcel to our place and had a man with him; he said he had no man with him, but as we were going along, he said if I would intercede with his master he would tell me where the property was, and he told me part of it was at a pawnbroker's - from a place near his master's be took out these seven pairs of boot-tops; we then went into his master's office - Edwards was afterwards taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was through Jones you found the property? A. Yes: I knew he came from Mr. Weston's of Bond-street, at they have a mark on their boxes - he was not intoxicated.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he appear intoxicated when he first came? A. No: but when I took them they appeared to have been drinking.</p>

            . I am a smith: I know Mirk; I saw him at dinner-time, on the 5th of June; he went out afterwards - I did not see that he had any pocket-book or money; at six o'clock I went to our yard, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went out and saw the prisoner turn the corner of Love-lane; I pursued him to King-street, and saw him sitting down there; I had just glimpsed him as he turned the corner; Mirk and some women and boys were crying Stop thief! when I got to him he was sitting down scratching his head; I passed him and then went back; Mirk came up and said that was the man; he jumped up and ran away; I followed, but could not catch him; on the Saturday evening following, I went with the officer to the public-houses in the neighbourhood; we found him at the door of the White Swan public-house, in Ratcliff-highway, with two or three women; I went to speak to a shop-mate, and asked him to give me something to drink - he said he had no money; the prisoner came up and said, "I will lend you as much;" I then charged him with having stolen this money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the prisoner? A. I do not know. I knew him before, but it was rather late and dark - there were gas lights about; I told him I knew him; I dare say he had seen me at different skittle-grounds; I have not a doubt but he saw me the night he stole the money, and knew me; he had a full opportunity of running away on the Saturday night, because I had to go and call the officer, which took me five minutes; he did not attempt to go away.</p>

D.; I saw it had been a crest, because there was part of a scroll; I said I should detain him - he then said it was his father's crest which he had taken out, and intended to have his own put on; I asked his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030043"/>name; he said, Samuel Dyke - I the usaid I would go home with him, as he said he lived close by; he took me to a house in Robert-street, and in the passage he asked if Mr. Douglass was at home, who he said was his landlord - I then said he must come to me again, and in about an hour, he and Douglass came together; I had known Douglass for ten years - he said, he did not know anything of these things; and then my employer went to a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you tell the prisoner you would meet him at Marlborough-street? A. Yes; he was at large till then - I did not go to the office the first evening; I was sent for the next day.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not twice say at the office, that you would not swear to it? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. Had you had a dinner party the day before? A. Yes; my master has some of the deceased Lady Deubigh's plate, which was left him - I have brought some with the different marks on them; here are some with a star, and some with a dolphin.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it not a great thoroughfare? A. Yes, and particularly at that time; we have a passage about four feet from the window, and in that doorway they stood; the outer door was open - I missed them between eleven and twelve o'clock; we were shutting-up when the officer came.</p>

            . I live opposite the prosecutor. On the night in question, at near twelve o'clock, while the boys were putting up the shutters, I saw the two prisoners together; I took Williams for a person who was arraigned here last Session, but he is not; I saw them together from five to ten minutes - I watched them, and saw Williams go and look at something in the doorway, and while his hand was extended Downes took these prints, ran down Castle-street, and Williams after him - I pursued; I met Groom, and said, "I want your assistance - take that man (meaning Williams) into custody;" I went and took Downes with these prints; he had got them down, and was tying them up in this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see Williams do anything? A. No - he extended his arm, and Downes came and took them out; there was no third man, to my knowledge - there were plenty of people in the street; I swear that I was not reprimanded at Bow-street office for letting a third man go, nor was Groom, in my presence; we went before Sir Richard Birnie - I was on the opposite side of the street: I saw them together ten or twelve minutes - they were not in the passage two minutes: the street was not very much crowded - I did not give an alarm, or go into the shop. I believe there were three or four cases in which I was examined last Session which were acquitted- I do not know in how many cases the Jury desired I might not have my expenses; I had my expenses in two cases.</p>

            . I am an officer. Whittingham asked me to assist him; he ran down Castle-street, and took Downes, who was stooping down - he told me to lay hold of Williams, which I did; while Whittingham and Downes were struggling I saw some prints on the ground, which I took up - I did not see who they fell from; before Whittingham came to me I saw a man like Downes, about his size, carrying a bundle: but I lost sight of him: there were several persons crossing the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not this street very much crowded? A. Yes - I had only come up to Bear-street; the Magistrate said that the other man ought to have been taken as well, but I do not know that Whittingham heard it - he went to the gate part of the time; there was another man with Williams, and I took them both, but Whittingham said, "This is the man," and the other got off; he walked fast - he did not run.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might not the other man have been the party carrying the bundle? A. I should think he might be one of the party; Williams struggled a great deal, and Whittingham said, "Let the other man go - this is the man;" I told Sir Richard Birnie of the third man.</p>

I went up to the place, and found him and the prisoner in a row with some other persons; he gave charge of her for robbing him of 7s. 6d. - she denied it; she had dropped 1s. before I came up - it was given me to take to the watch-house, and in going along she dropped another shilling from her person - she stooped took it up; I took it from her hand.</p>

On the 15th of June, at five o'clock in the morning, I put my watch on the shelf, between two large pickling jars; I went out to work, and when I returned at night it was gone - there was not a soul in the house all day; I went to my son, and told him I had lost it - the prisoner's sister, Ann, came the next morning, and I accused her of stealing it; she put her hands together, and fell a crying, and said she was innocent; I said, "Who was here yesterday" - she said, "My sister Jane." On the 15th, (which was Sunday,) the prisoner was there and breakfasted; I got an officer, and went to the prisoner's father, and she was taken - she said, "It was my sister, Ann, stole the watch, or else how could she buy those clothes on Sunday morning;" I said, "You impudent hussey, how could she take it when I had it on Monday?" she then told me where it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He lives with my sister, and she goes out every night to help to support him; she told me to take watch to Mr. Newman's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does her sister live in the house with you? A. No - she comes to make my bed, and to wash up; I never slept with her in my life - she is nothing but a bad girl; they are a bad breed; I have only been there about a year and a half - I might perhaps get an honest woman to make my bed, but I seldom see the girl; she goes out on the town, but the bed is generally made when I go home - if not, I make it myself. I was robbed of some fowls once, and was here once - I never was at Clerkenwell, nor any where else for thieving; I am surprised you should ask me such a thing - I am quite angry that you should think I had been there, Do you think I look like a thief? I have never seen any of my family there - none of them have ever gone abroad.</p>

            . I keep the house. The prisoner came to hire my lodgings on the 20th of June, about twelve o'clock - I knew nothing of him; he took the books out of the house, and I saw no more of him; he was to have the lodgings by the quarter, but I sent to his reference and no such person was known - he was to come at five o'clock for an answer.</p>
               <p>COURT to HENRY SAUNDERS. Q. Was he a perfect stranger to you? A. Yes - he said he expected his brother and sister about five o'clock, but did not say where they lived; I made no enquiry about them, but I knew the house where he lived, as I had taken goods there before - I had parted with the books, expecting he would pay me for them, or return some of them; he took them to look at - I traced two of them to a pawnbroker's - he is not here; he felt great reluctance at attending - I did subpoena him; I know these two are two which he took away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought the books, and he was to come in the evening, or in the morning, for the money. Witness. There was no bargain - they were left on liking.</p>

The prisoner came to my shop on Sunday the 8th of June, and brought a number of upper-leathers - I did not see them particularly; I looked at one or two, and refused to buy them - but I firmly believe these are a part of them; I said, I manufactured my own work in general, and what I did not, I bought of Mr. Stokes - she said, she was in great distress, and her children were starving.</p>

            . I am a constable. A person came to me at a quarter before ten o'clock, and stated that a boy at the Duke of Gloucester had been robbed of a silk handkerchief; I went up to the house, but as it is a most desperate house, and I had nearly lost my life there, I did not go in alone, but waited till the watchman came up; when I went in I saw this boy up in a corner. and those characters would not let him out: I called him out, and said, "What have you lost?" he said a silk handkerchief; I said, "Go in and point out the man" - he pointed out the prisoner; he said he had given him 1s., and he was to return him the handkerchief or the 1s., but he had not; two or three of them said, "Why don't you give the handkerchief," but the prisoner took no notice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search him? A. Yes, but found nothing; the boy did not say anything to me about a milk-woman being there - there were not many persons round the house; the boy was in the house - I was told he had been crying for a quarter of an hour in the street: as I went in the prisoner seemed to be coming from the back yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had done work at half-past eight o'clock, and went to have a pint of beer; I came out to the door, and this lad said, "Tell John Harley I want him;" I went in, and said that person was wanted- this lad then came in, and I sat down; in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour the officer came and called this boy out, and in two or three minutes I was taken.</p>

From the description the pawnbroker gave me, I went to the first-floor back room of the house where the prisoner lived - she was a long time before she would let me in; I said I wanted her to go to the pawnbroker's - I at last got her out; she said I had no occasion to take her to the pawnbroker's, she was guilty and had taken the gown.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live with Mr. Mayhers. I saw the two prisoners going towards Mr. Elliott's shop, and went and told him of it; I did not see them again till they were at Mr. Oborne's shop -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030057"/>they were asked into the back room, and I suspected they had dropped something near where they had stood in the shop; I looked, and found this ribbon within two feet of where they had stood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what state was it? A. A little opened; they objected to being searched - they did not go into the shop after they had been in the room.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 10th of June, at the Feathers public-house, Hart-street, Covent-garden; I showed him this book, which I got from Mr. Reeves - he said he bought it of a man named Savage, for 3s.; I asked how he became possessed of the other books, which were pawned for 4l.; he said he had them from another man, named Savage also, and that both the men were in the country; I found on him six duplicates of Bibles and Prayer-books.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it dark? A. Middling; I could see the prisoner's yard from the privy - it was only a board fence which parted us.</p>

             re-examined. I called Hill, and said to him, "This is a pretty game;" but I did not know whether I should take him - I let them both go; the prisoner slept at home I believe, but went off the next day; when I went to his stable, he did not attempt to conceal anything - I sent for a light, and the corn was standing before the horse; it corresponds with what remained of Mr. Clark's - I inquired the next day, and the people in the town all said, they had no mixed corn; I do not know whether it is usual to feed horses with mixed corn - I have known the prisoner two or three years, and never knew anything amiss of him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was returning from the watch-house at a quarter-past three o'clock, and met the prisoner with these tools in his hand; I asked where he got them - he said from his lodging, No. 14, Peter-street; I said I would go there - I went on with him till I found he had passed the door - I then said, "You shall go before the officer of the night;" he threw them down and ran away - I retook him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I unfortunately met with a person familiar to me, who I considered to be a carpenter, he requested me to go to the watch-house with him, as he was giving another man in charge for an assault - having given the man in charge we came out of the watch-house, when he asked if I should have any objection to let him put a few things into my lodgings, as his landlord would put a padlock on his room door in the morning, which I agreed to do; he then told me to wait there while he went to No. 4, or 14, Peter-street; being inebriated I cannot possibly remember which; after waiting a few minutes he returned with the things found upon me, which he strongly desired me to put in my apron or handkerchief, but I, not being conscious of anything wrong, carried them in my open hands - he then told me to walk slowly on, and he would overtake me with some more; a watchman passing at the time inquired where I got them from; I told him from No. 4, or 14, Peter-street, which was the place I was told they came from; having just before been at the watch-house with the same man, and being fearful of being taken up, I attempted to run away; I had not been in the watch-house long before the person I had the things of came and said that there was no charge against me, as the things belonged to him: when the watch-house-keeper thought he ought to be detained likewise, but the nightconstable would not detain him.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Do you remember any person applying at the watch-house? A. Yes - there was a person called and said they were his tools; we sent him away - the Magistrate directed me to look for that man, but I could not find him: the prisoner said he brought the tools from his lodging, and was going to a job - I asked where he lodged - he said No. 14, Peter-street, and as he passed by there I detained him: he had been taken in a row before that, and after he had been in the watch-house this must have been committed.</p>

On Wednesday, the 18th of June, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was speaking to a woman who was going to Bristol, in the gateway of the Bull inn; the prisoners came up - Bigley knocked me down, and my hat fell off, and one of them took it up; they both ran away - I pursued and caught them: but my hat was gone - they had turned a corner; there was no other person in the gateway, but there was one or two about there - I went next day to Bigley's father, and asked if they would send my hat back, which was all I wanted; the old gentleman said, they were bad chaps - I let it rest till the middle of the day, and then got a warrant; I have never seen my hat since - I had been drinking; but I do not think my hat could have fallen off - I do not think it was a lark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You went to Bigley's father before you got the warrant? A. Yes; I had not heard that either of them were going to prosecute me for an assault - I walked to the gateway; the woman told me she was going to Bristol - I had part of three or four pints of beer, and had been playing at skittles.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If it meets your approbation, I will now make out my whole defence, as I have no one to plead for me - this morning when at this bar, I should have pleaded guilty, but for one thing; I wished my case might prove a caution to others, and I wished to place before the Judge and Jury the hardships I have undergone; this trial has nevertheless brought me from living in a state of adultery; in which, I am now sensible I have transgressed the laws of God and of my country; and I hope I shall bear with patience and resignation, by the will of God, the sentence you may pass upon me: I trust however, the Court will hear what I have to say, and that it will operate in my favour, when brought up to receive my sentence. In 1807, I entered His Majest'y service: I was then but sixteen years and nine months old - I served as private, corporal and serjeant at most of the battles in the Peninsula at Waterloo and other places, where I received a wound in my head, which has caused a great depression of my intellectual powers; I have not worn a hat for three years, and have undergone four painful operations - I have had two false passages made for my urine and a leader cut under my ham, which had made me a cripple: to these causes I may perhaps attribute my present degraded situation: but I did not know that I was committing this crime till last summer; when at Brighton, I heard that a gentlemen had been imprisoned for having two wives - only this led to an inquiry, which convinced me of my error; if ever pity dwell in your breast towards a poor individual, I trust it dwells there now, for I can truly say "I acknowledge my transgression, and my sin is ever before me."</p>

(and several others I mentioned) he said, "I don't know - I did not take them at all:" seeing him so obstinate I sent for an officer, and when he saw him he told me he had sold a great part of them to Retmire, a bookseller, living in Shire-lane; I went there, and brought him to Colebrook; who said, "That is the person I bought the books of;" he had said before that he bought books of one and another, and did not know that he should know the person again - I did not find any books at his house, but he said he had bought a great many volumes of Plays, and this Bible for half-a-crown; but he said it was imperfect, and wanted thirteen leaves; I have looked at it, though not particularly, but I believe it is all right; when the two prisoners were brought together, Colebrook said to Retmire, "You said you would give me so much a dozen for volumes of Plays," and Retmire said, "No, I said so and so;" these books were found at the pawnbroker's by the duplicates.</p>
               <p>Prisoner RETMIRE. Q. Did you not ask me if I had any Prayer-books or Play-books, or the Londinensis? A.

Yes; he said 2s. 6d., and that it wanted thirteen or fourteen leaves; Retmire then said it was sold out and out, and he could not get it; the title page is wanting to this second volume, but it is not in general bound in two volumes - that is the reason; I found nothing at Retmire's but the duplicate of these four Hebrew books.</p>

When I came home from work that day my son was absent; I went in search of him till one o'clock in the morning - when I came back he had been brought back by a gentleman, but had no pinafore on; we then went in search of Douglass. I saw the prisoner on the Friday following, and as he answered the description given me, I took him into custody; I told him to come with me, and if all was right I would give him a pint of beer; I took him to a neighbour's house, and sent for my little boy - he said, "That is the man who took my pinafore away:" the prisoner said he knew nothing about it.</p>

I saw the prisoner on the 17th of June; I was with my brother Charles, Christopher Douglass, and James Pinks; the prisoner said he would get us a bird'snest; we went down the New North-road, and he told Pinks to go through the ditch and get the bird's-nest; he then went on with my brother and Christopher Douglass, and told me if I did not go back he would smash my brains out - I went away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me take them into any house? A. No: you did not ask me to do anything; you only told us to take off our coats and go over a ditch, and said you would mind them - I did not go into any house; we all got over a wall; Pinks and Halls went over the ditch - you said you would go and get the bird's-nest, and would call out; I went with you as far as the turnpike.</p>

I said, "Oh! no, Mr. Rowley; it is perfectly safe here, let it stand;" I went home, and in the course of the evening it was brought back to my warehouse - I had not ordered it to be sent; I had my stock taken, and found a very large deficiency - I immediately ordered Fell to quit my premises in five minutes; he kept out of the way for about a fortnight - I went and sent for him, but could not find him; he was advertised by the parish, and taken - I know the cask to be mine by the carrier's brand-mark on it; it was one of one hundred barrels imported from Limerick; Fell had no authority to sell my goods.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the 24th of March, a little after three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw Fell rolling a barrel of pork from our cellar, towards Wapping-dock; I lost sight of him at near the gun-dock - he was going towards Rowley's; I went home and reported what I had seen - I went after him again, and saw him pitch it into Mr. Rowley's shop; there was a young man at the further end of the shop - I saw Fell talking to him; I then came away; and told master when he came home - I afterwards saw the cask, and believe it to be the same - it was full.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How near were you to the cask at any time? A. Within four or five yards; I did not particularly examine it - I did not see him take it from the cellar; I knew it by the brandmark.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to the warehouse to see if any casks were missing? A. Yes, and missed it - I had stowed it away a day or two before myself, and had seen it there that very day about half-past six o'clock - this one stood in front of the others.</p>

            . I am cooper to the prosecutors. - On the 24th of March, about half-past three o'clock, Fell asked me to go down into the cellar, to help him roll out a barrel of pork - we do not always use the crane; master was not at home - Fell first asked me, where Storey. the clerk, was; I said at the public-house: he then said"Come down and help me with a barrel of pork out of the cellar, it is a good time;" I helped him - he then asked me to roll it for him to Rowley's shop - I would not, and then he said he was the best man himself to roll it; and accordingly he did; he said "D - n your eyes, you are as bad as I am;" I had some suspicion that all was not right - I went over to Brown and told him what had happened; I did not see where he took it to - the brandmark on it was "Reading, Limerick." I did not see him take it more than twenty or thirty yards: it came back the same evening - I am sure it was the same cask, I can swear to it: he said I was as bad as he was, and liable to be transported - it was taken from a pile of about one hundred others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then it was not standing by itself? A. No; it was in the pile - my master allows me a piece of pork, when I want it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever fined 40s. for stealing pork? A. Yes, but Fell, the foreman, gave it to me; he and I were together - it was eighteen months ago; I did not tell master of this till I was taken to the Police-office - I was never taken up before - I had no quarrel with Fell.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Fell fined at the time you were? A. No - he went away; we were only going through the docks to give a bit of pork to the foreman of the wine<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030073"/>department, for some wine: I never told master that Fell was concerned.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to ROBERT LINKLATER. Q. Do not you know that it was Rowley who sent the cask home? A. I do not know; he came to me that evening, after it had come, and told me he had sent it home; he went over the way then - I made no charge against him at that time; he continued in his business: Fell was taken about a month ago, and the Magistrate issued a summons for Rowley, by my desire - there were three hearings; I do not think there were more - Rowley did not attend at one of them; he attended once as a witness - I went to the office one evening, in consequence of a notice, but he did not come, and nothing was done, as Mr. Humphries, my solicitor, ordered me not to do anything unless he was there; Rowley was there that night, and attended two or three times after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to an attorney named Dodd? A. No. I know him very well; he did not act as my attorney; I was never in Mr. Harmer's office in my life - I do not know where it is; I did not send Dodd to Rowley's at any time; I know he went there - that might be a week after the discovery - it was before any examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not Dodd now acting as your attorney? A. No: Mr. Humphries is my attorney - Dodd did not attend before the Magistrate, as my attorney; he may have been there; he told me afterwards that he had been to Rowley, and I approved of what he said, but I did not apply to him - when Rowley came to me, nothing passed about anything but the cask: I took hold of the chain of the crane and said,"The cask could not be taken out without this;' no other conversation passed to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not in the first instance forget that Rowley had called on you? A. Yes; I had entirely forgotten it, but I recollected it when he mentioned it: I do not recollect any other conversation passing.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Are you sure no conversation passed respecting his dealing with Fell for two or three years? A. Not a sentence; I attended all the examinations.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you understand by Rowley saying, you did not want it? A. I understood him to mean that Fell had received it as a present from some other person, and I did not want to purchase it - that was the impression on my mind; I said it was curious to take casks from my foreman without coming to me, as I did not live three hundred yards off - he did not say what he gave for it - Dodd told me he had information that Rowley had sent money to Fell, and ordered him to keep out of the way while I was looking for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that what you approved of? A. Why, I thought I could not convict him without having Fell, and I thought it was necessary for me to have information, whether he was out of the way; and Dodd said he would call to know that: I approved of his calling, as it saved me trouble; he said he would call and ask Rowley that; I think he called afterwards, and told me he had been to Rowley. I did not authorize Dodd to go to Rowley and say he should be prosecuted unless he paid 1000l.; on my oath I never did; nor did Dodd tell me he had made such a communication: Rowley did not say Fell had told him he had the cask from the master of a vessel.</p>

            . I am occasionally employed as attorney for the prosecutor; but on this prosecution I never was employed profssionally by him; I am subpoenaed here for the prisoners; I called on Rowley three times; I did not communicate with the prosecutor before I called - the first time was a fortnight or three weeks after the 24th of March; I saw Rowley in his counting-house, and told him I understood he knew where Fell, Mr. Linklater's late foreman was, as it was reported he had given him money to go out of town; he denied it, and asked if Linklater intended to prosecute Fell; I said I believed he did, but he was away - he then asked if he intended to prosecute him; I said I did not know; that I had no instruction to call on him, but I had merely called to get this question answered and to see some receipts which he had; the prosecutor's son is articled to me; I am continually calling on him: Rowley asked me if Fell could turn King's evidence against him; I told him he could - he said he did not care for that, as he had plenty of receipts for some empty casks which he had received, and he pulled one from a file - it was for empty casks, and signed John Fell; he then asked me how much property was lost from Linklater's premises; I said the books were at an accountants in the City, and I believed 2,000l. worth of provisons were said to be lost from the stock; he said he had not had above 100l. worth, nor so much, and asked me what would settle the affair; I told him I had no authority to call on him, and advised him to go to his friends, consult some professional man, and get the best advice he could; I afterwards saw Linklater, and said, I do not know whether I have done right - but I have been to Rowley's to get information about Fell and look at some receips: I called on Rowley again - he appeared much dejected, said he had been speaking to his friends, and asked me if the thing could he settled; I said No, he could not buy Mr. Linklater I was sure - he said, "If I was to send a friend of mine, who is a friend of Linklater's, would it nothave great weight?" I said it might, but I had nothing to do with it, I called as a friend; I called again, and there were two persons in the shop, one was a lad and the other an elderly person, whose name I understood to be Mitchell; Rowley then said he had been into the country. but had not found any friend who he could call one, who would go to Mr. Linklater on the business, and here the conversation ended; we were shut in the counting-house; the two persons were not present; when we came out into the shop, Rowley said, "I cannot find 1,000l.;" I said, I do not know what you mean, for I supposed he was going to make some evidence of my being there; I had said nothing about 1,000l.; I said in these peoples' presence, that I had no authority from Mr. Linklater for calling, and in point of fact, I was blamed by him for going there.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How long have you been a professional man? A. Nine years; I was not a friend of Rowley's - I saw Linklater the evening I had the first conversation, and told him about the receipts; I did not think there was any occasion to tell him more.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you conceal any part of the conversation? A. Rowley being a neighbour of Linklater's, I did not wish to irritate Linklater's feelings; the second interview was four or five days afterwards - I called to do everything in my power to avoid a prosecution; as Rowley had friends in the neighbourhood, I thought the best way would be to send an intimate friend of his to Linklater, to prevent a prosecution.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030074"/>Q. On your oath did you not, yourself, mention the 1000l.? A. Yes: Rowley asked what would settle it; I said I could not enter into it - he asked if 100l. or 200l. would settle it; I said No, nor 1000l. either: I mentioned one or two of these circumstances to Linklater, and he blamed me for going, as I had no authority; I did not mention the 1000l. to him - my object was to settle it without a compromise.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, did you not say, in the presence of the two persons in the shop, that it was Mr. Linklater's wish that Rowley should deposit 1000l. till his books were examined? A. No, nor did I say Rowley was to make up what was deficient; nor anything to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Rowley say, "If you have any proposition to make you had better put it into writing," and then he could consult his friends? A. I do not remember it, I assure you; if it did pass it must have occurred in the hurry, when he called me, as I was going out, and said, "I cannot find 1000l." - I swear I never heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you not say, you should commit yourself as a professional man by doing it? A. No: I went to Mr. Harmer to appoint a time for Linklater to come to him; I had told Linklater I should go to Mr. Harmer's, and he assented to it: I went, and Mr. Harmer told me he was engaged in the case, and next day I went with Linklater to Mr. Humphries - I did not attend at the office; I never told Linklater what had passed between me and Rowley, respecting making up the books and the 1000l. - I do not think I did, but really I cannot charge my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you went to Mr. Harmer, you had no desire to settle it? A. No; the truth is, Rowley's character had been pretty well blown about the neighbourhood, and it was known on 'Change, and if Linklater had not prosecuted, he would have suffered in his character himself.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were subpoenaed on the prisoner's behalf? A. Yes; I called the second and third time at Rowley's request; he said nothing more to me about money than I have stated.</p>
               <p>FELL's Defence. I never did anything but what the clerk directed; as to master's loss I cannot be accountable - I understand they have found 800l. worth since I have been confined; I was not out of the way at all - the clerk is the guilty man; he cannot be found: McNamara told me Dodd had him into the parlour, and gave him two glasses of wine to get all he could out of him.</p>
               <p>ROWLEY's Defence. Dodd came three times to me to make a compromise, and if I would do that they would forbear the prosecution: I said I was innocent, and would not give 1d., he might do his worst; I asked him to put it down in writing - he said, as a professional man he should be committing himself.</p>
               <p>MR. LINKLATER. I do not know where my clerk is now - he has been with two accountants, but has been unwell; I suppose he is at home - he left word that he was not well; I have not sent for him since I have dismissed him; there is a delinquency, but I have not proof to bring it forward; Fell was advertised for leaving his wife and child.</p>

             re-examined. Dodd never gave me any wine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He said you were as liable to be transported as he was? A. Yes - that was when I refused to help him to Rowley's with it.</p>
               <p>CHARLES ADAMS. I am shopman to Mr. Rowley, and have been so this twelve months; he has been in his shop till this morning, and has surrendered. I remember Dodd coming to him three times - he said he came from Mr. Linklater - that Linklater had lost property to the amount of 1000l., and wished. Mr. Rowley to deposit 1000l. in a certain person's hands till the books were examined, and then to make up the deficiency; Rowley asked him to give him a statement in writing, and said he would consult his friends - Dodd replied, that being a professional man be should commit himself by so doing; this was at the second interview - he came again after that, and I heard him say,"Have you done anything, but I did not hear the answer, as they went into the counting-house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How often have you seen Fell at Rowley's? A. Not more than three or four times, or it may be five or six: I never saw him bring anything but the harrel of pork in question.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it get back? A. Mr. Linklater said he would send his man for it, but Rowley said he would send it for him, and he sent it between five and six o'clock. When the pork came Mr. Rowley looked out of the counting-house, and told Fell to leave it and call some other time, as he was busy then, he would open it, and see what he could give for it - he was not in the habit of buying such things; I have seen empty casks there - I knew Fell was in the prosecutor's service: I never knew him bring any beef; Mitchell was present at the third interview; nothing was said then but, "Have you done anything?"</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. The cask came between three and five o'clock? A. Yes - it had not been examined when it was found by the prosecutor; a man named Edwards, who was in our employ, took it back.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the empty casks bought of? A. I went for some of them; I went to Mr. Linklater's, and asked for Fell - if he was not there I went to the public-house.</p>

            . I assist Rowley in his business, and know Fell; he is foreman to Mr. Linklater - I have gone there to give orders for empty casks, and Mr. Linklater's servants brought them. I saw Dodd at Rowley's once, but did not hear what passed.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How often were you at Rowley's? A. Almost daily for nine or ten months; I sometimes saw Fell there two or three times a week, when casks have been ordered; he came to cooper sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mr. Linklater respecting any order? A. I have: Rowley never sent me there for brands - I have been sent for the cooper.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Brides - Mr. Morris directed me to watch his premises. On the morning of the 22d of June, I was there and saw his warehouse apparently safe - Mr. Richardson lives next door; I went to his door and found it opened rather stiffer than usual: I got up to the shutter-hole, looked through and saw the back of a man - I informed Huckel - we both went to Richardson's back door and found it open; we went in and found five black bags there, and saw a large hole in the wall, which goes through to Mr. Morris premises, it was large enough to admit one of the prisoners to get through - Huckel left me there, and Mr. Morris took the property when he came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did you measure the hole? A. No - it was not large enough for me to get through, but I think the prisoners could; I did say at first that the man I saw seemed a tall man - I had not examined the lock of Richardson's door the day before, but it used to open very easily with a push.</p>

            . I am inspector of the nightly watch. Fishburn came and said he saw a man in Richardson's shop; I went and looked and saw the back door open - I ran round to the door and saw five bags there; I saw the hole in the wall - it was large enough for the prisoners to get through; I went with Skilling down the market to the end of Fleet-lane, and then to the Albion coffee-shop - I had left my hat at Richardson's shop; when we came out of the coffee-shop - Livermore was there and he said to Skilling "What does he do here? what is he looking for?" I said "Go about your business;" Skilling then nodded to me and I seized Livermore - he endeavoured to get away, and used all the violence he could; I was up and down with him repeatedly - he was rescued from me; I was knocked about severely - I had a black eye and my lip was cut; some firemen came up and assisted me - I had repeatedly seen Livermore before, but not Elvery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you spring your rattle? A. I do not carry one; it was just five o'clock - the watchmen were off duty; Livermore appeared to be standing there unconcerned - I had not been drinking anything that could affect me: I might have had a glass or two of ale, and a pint of porter, in the night - I heard Livermore say to Skilling "He is a pretty officer to go to sleep in the market, and lose his hat;" several persons tried to rescue him - no one took my part till the firemen came up; I called on the people to assist me, but they did not - I was with him alone some time, and held him by his neckcloth, till he was black in the face - he held me by the throat; I said I wanted him, but did not say what for, as there were persons round who would have rescued him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Sepulchre's. I was standing at the end of Fleet-lane, leaning against a post, at a few minutes to five o'clock on this morning; I could see Richardson's back-door; I saw two men come out of that door; they ran as hard as they could, and in running, knocked down a large hamper; they ran towards me as far as the first opening, nearly opposite the Fleetprison gates; I noticed their dress particularly - and in about fifteen minutes they came into the market again, and were within eight yards of me; they stopped two or three minutes - one of them said, "Do they call this Fleet-market?" the other said, "Yes, I believe it is;" I have known Livermore these twelve months; I went up to the premises and found Huckel; he came down the market with me; I described their dress to him - he went down the middle of the market, and I down the side, but saw nothing of them; we went into the coffee-shop, and as we came out I saw Livermore, who said, "Skilling, what is the matter?" I said,"Nothing, but that man (Huckel) has lost his hat;" Livermore said, "There is something more than that; there is a screw loose, I am sure;" I nodded to Huckel, who came up and said, "Hold you impudence," and seized him by the handkerchief, and he seized him; they struggled together, I assisted as well as I could, but the mob intefered and secured him; I followed him to Newcastle-street, where he met Elvery, who took hold of him, and hurried him up the street; I saw Elvery take his apron off: they then came down the street again, went to the place, and stood looking at Huckel, who was then being ill-used by the mob; I ran out to the watch-house for assistance, but in that time Huckel was released; I have no doubt whatever of the prisoners being the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What distance were you from the shop when you first saw them? A. About ninety yards; I knew them by their dress chiefly - nobody was near them; they were out of my sight part of the time; Livermore came up to me voluntarily, and said there was a screw loose, and so on - there were then sixty or eighty persons about; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030076"/>knew it was no use to call for assistance, for I will be bound full forty of them were thieves - I knew them before.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Have you seen them about the market? A. Yes; particularly on Sunday mornings; Huckel was not drunk.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you observe their dresses soiled? A. No; they both had aprons on when they came out of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did not you and Huckel take hold of Livermore together? A. I was some little distance; I did not mention Livermore's name to Huckel, as I did not know he knew him by name; he had a black coat and drab trousers; I had not seen him in that dress before, but I knew his person before.</p>
               <p>- ELMES. I am a night watchman of St. Martin's, Ludgate. The two prisoners had been brought into the watch-house soon after twelve o'clock on this night, for an assault; I let them out shortly after - they then both had white aprons on, twisted round them; they were not searched.</p>

            . Nathaniel Jerrom was going by me at half-past twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the 18th of May; I asked him for something to drink, and took him to the Sun - we knocked at the back door in Angel-alley - the prisoner and his brother, who is gone, came up, and turned his pockets out, and said, "Floor him;" the prisoner knocked me down on the step of the Sun publichouse - with that four or five of them came up belonging to the party, and ill-used Mr. Jerrom; I was not able to give any assistance; I did not see them take any money, but Mr. Jerrom said he had lost two half-crowns.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She knew where I lived. Witness. No, I did not know where he lived - I knew his friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not come and live in the same court, and say to me, "Graves, you was not one of them that robbed Mr. Jerrom?" A. No, I did not - as a woman I did not; he said he was very sorry, but he hoped I would speak as much in behalf of his brother as I could; I took breakfast with his sister, and they behaved very well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I met her in Shoreditch five days after: she stopped me, and said, "George, I have very bad news to tell you of your brother; there was a robbery done in Angel-alley;" I said, "Was I in it?" she said, "You was not," and she said she had mentioned every man's name that was in it. Witness. No; I do not know any man that was in it but the prisoner and his brother.</p>
               <p>JURY. The prisoner says you went to reside in the court he did? A. No, I did not; I have seen him frequently; I did meet him, but I do not know that he resided in that court.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell the prosecutor who it was? A. Yes, I did, and he said he should know the two men- they had certainly turned his pockets inside out; I said it was the two Graves. It was dark - there was a lamp; it was rather dark: I can swear the prisoner is the man who wrested me from Mr. Jerrom's left arm the moment the brother said "Floor her;" there was a gas-lamp about four yards off; five or six people came up to him after the robbery - I called out for assistance; they all made their escape after they knocked Jerrom down - there were six or seven in the court before the robbery; there were two females sitting on a step, who I believe were with the party; I do not know whether they knew of it after if had been committed. I saw the pocket turned inside out.</p>
               <p>COURT to NATHANIEL JERROM. Q. Was there a light there? A. Yes, at the bottom of the court; it enabled me to see the persons' features distinctly; he asked me to give him a glass of gin - I said I did not mind, and then he put his hand into my pocket.</p>

"Yes (said he) that is the man." I have seen the prisoner at the bar several times since, but he has another brother, and I should be sorry to take the wrong man; when I took the prisoner he said, "Brown, be so good as to let me go on my errand," and I said, "1'll be d - d if you do - I have a heavy charge against you."</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) Your memorialist says that the witness, Sarah Mitchell, has been a drunken and bad character; in the year 1820 she was transported for seven years, and afterwards sent to the Penitentiary; she now has no real place of residence. but prostitution with the prosecutor, as your memorialist has been informed and believes. Your memorialist submits it, and it may be obvious, that on and after the 17th of May last, the witness well knew where to find your memorialist, she having been a witness against your memorialist's brother, and convicted him for the offence last Session. Your memorialist's witness (Mary Ranson) will prove that at the time alledged your memorialist was in bed, as a lodger, and of good character.</p>

I have known the prisoner several years - he was in the habit of calling on me; I missed two books last Saturday fortnight - I advertised them, and they were brought to me by a pawnbroker; I suspected the prisoner, and had him apprehended; the duplicates were found on him - these are them: I had seen them safe about a week before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How do you know them? A. By the binding, and one of them has a wreath, which is peculiar; it is a coloured engraving stuck in it, and this volume has my private-mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not I heard you say, that people called at your shop, and read the newspapers, and you did not like it? - A. Yes. The books were all in my shop within a month.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and found some duplicates on him, which he said were his own. I found others, relating to these books, at his lodging.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long address to the Court, stated that he had purchased the duplicates of a stranger, at an eating-house in the Minories; and that the prosecution was brought against him because he had declared it his intention to bring an action against Mr. North.</p>
               <p>MR. NORTH. The prisoner has been a respectable man, but fell into misfortunes; he has been a clerk: what he means about an action is, a medical certificate was obtained some time ago, by which he was confined in Hoxton madhouse.</p>

On the 24th of June I was going home, and met the prisoner with my saddle and girths on his shoulder; I said"That is mine;" he threw them at me and turned down Red Lion-court, and ran as far as Old Fish-street - he was quite a stranger; I had seen them safe on a pin at my stable door, about two hours before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was your yard gate locked? A. Yes: I had a good many servants at work for me - the prisoner had got about one hundred and fifty yards off perhaps; it was between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day - I am satisfied none of my men had been there while I was out.</p>
