The plate was in my custody - I saw it all locked up ten minutes before I went to bed; the articles stated in the indictment were all in one cupboard, except the tea-tongs and caddy-ladle - the soup-ladle was an old fashioned fluted one, and had the crest on it. Next morning I got up about a quarter after seven o'clock, and found the hall door open, and a hole cut in it, large enough for a man to put in his hand and open the door - it was an outer door. I then went to the plate cupboard, found that door forced open, and missed the property stated in the indictment; I have since seen the tea-pot and soup-ladle at Bow-street. I do not know the prisoner. The spoons had the motto,</p>
               <p>"Be Trew," on them.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Merle and Co. refiners, who live in Little Britain. I have bought things of the prisoner at different times. On the 2d of April I bought some table and desert spoons of him - about thirteen spoons altogether; consisting of table, desert, tea, and two salt spoons - they weighed in the whole, seventeen ounces and seven penny weight; they were perfect, and had a crest on them, and the motto,</p>
               <p>"Be True." I think the word true was spelt</p>
               <p>"trew" - he brought them as old silver, and gave no particular account of them. I asked his name - he said Williams. He has occasionally sold me plate before, but he gave me the name at this time. The spoons were put in our common stock, and sold next day to a dealer; I cannot tell who it was now, as we had several who came that day. A table-spoon generally weighs two ounces, a desert-spoon about an ounce, and a tea-spoon, ten or twelve pennyweight. I bought nothing else of him. I saw him again about the latter end of April, he came in the afternoon with some old spoons for sale; we had received information, and he was detained.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have many people come to sell plate - A. Yes; he has sold us plate before. I never doubted his being the man. I paid him 4 l. 3 s. 10 d. for them. I think there were four table and four desert spoons.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Merle and Co. and know the prisoner perfectly well. On Wednesday, the 4th of April, I bought a tea-pot stand and soup-ladle of him, and I rather think a caddy ladle at the same time - they weighed twenty-three ounces and sixteen pennyweight; I paid him 5 l. 15 s. for them as old silver - they were put by with our common stock. They had a crest on them, and a motto. The prisoner was detained at our house about the 1st or 2d of May. He had come backwards and forwards to our house, about once a month, for the last twelve months, to sell old plate.</p>

My affairs were embarrassed in consequence of losing my licence - there was an execution in my house, and a man in possession for the Sheriff. I was in the cellar in the morning, the property stated in the indictment was then safe there; I left home about eight o'clock at night - there were about twenty-five men in the house, who had been customers to me - they had been there the principal part of the afternoon; there was a great noise in the house, but no dancing while I was there. I returned about twelve o'clock at night, found my cellar broken open, and every thing in confusion, all the Port wine gone, and the rest of the property. I knew the prisoner as a customer, he had been in the house several times in the course of that day and evening; I cannot say whether he was there or not when I went out.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's mother-in-law, and lived at the house; the men were dancing, singing, and making a great noise all the afternoon - there were twenty or more in the house - all men. The taproom was lit with gas, it was put out two or three times, and the room left in total darkness. The cellar door opened into the taproom. I stood in the bar, and saw the cellar door open, I went there, and caught the prisoner coming out of the cellar - he had his hands behind him; I shook him, he dropped a chisel from his hands, and got from me. I went into the cellar, found the bottles all thrown down, and the brandy cask turned over - a two gallon cask, which had contained cloves, was found under a settle in the taproom, facing the cellar door. The men were all in liquor, but they had not been served with sufficient liquor from the bar to make them so. When I seized the prisoner I said,</p>
               <p>"You have been in the cellar;" he said,</p>
               <p>"That I have not." I said I was sure he had - he got from me, and ran out. I am sure he is the man, I had known him for ten weeks. One might easily go into the cellar, and supply the rest with liquor while they were dancing.</p>

On the 27th of February there was a great noise in the house, twenty or more men were there, dancing and singing - I had known the prisoner about three weeks - he was one of the party. The light was put out two or three times during the evening, by a black man pouring beer into the pipe. I saw the prisoner run out of the house as I came through the passage; I was in and out of the taproom all the evening, and saw what they were served with - it could not have made them intoxicated - they were intoxicated.</p>

I saw Mrs. Acome lay hold of a man who stood out outside the cellar door, apparently just come out - she wrenched a chisel from his hand - he immediately ran away. Part of the wood by the edge of the cellar door was wrenched away. I observed the taproom in darkness once - the gas was put out. The party only had a few pots of beer, which could not have made them drunk; all the wine was gone from the cellar, and some shrub - the brandy cask was left running. I attempted to detain the prisoner, but he rushed out.</p>

            . I was in possession of this house for the Sheriff. I was in the bar, talking to Mrs. Acome, and saw the cellar door open a little way, soon after it opened wider, and the prisoner came out; I saw him on the cellar side of the door, Mrs. Acome seized him, and called for assistance, I went, saw him throw the chisel away, and picked it up. I found a two gallon keg of cloves running in the taproom, and an iron crow-bar laying by it; the brandy cask in the cellar was running. I know the cellar door was locked when Blyth went out. Nobody served but Mrs. Acome. There was a gallon of beer ordered by a man who had been a publican, and six pots were afterwards served among twenty-five or more people; they were perfectly sober, but at night most of them were in liquor; they must have been supplied with more than they had had from the bar. I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

I got the people out, examined<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060005"/>the cellar, and found it had been broken open. Mrs. Acome gave me the chisel, which I compared with the marks in the door, by the lock. I saw some chalk on the crow-bar which corresponded with marks on the wall. About a fortnight after I saw the prisoner, about two o'clock in the morning, by the Horse Guards, drinking coffee; he saw me, and ran away, I followed, crying Stop thief, but lost him. He was apprehended about a fortnight after.</p>

At the lower part of the house there is a taproom in front, a bar behind, and then a parlour; a person can see from the taproom into the bar and parlour. My bed-room is over the parlour, it has a window looking into Noble-street, ten feet from the ground - there are three small bars to prevent children falling out, but there is room enough for a person to get in. I keep my money in a bureau in the bed-room. I had been ill sometime before, and had never seen the prisoners in my house till I recovered, I then saw them two or three times every day, up to the 25th, except one day, which was the 24th - they were always talking together, generally about horse dealing. My attention was called to them by something that was said to me. I am sure of their persons. On Sunday the 25th, I saw my bed-room between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the window was then shut down - the door was open. About eleven o'clock at night I was sitting in the parlour, and heard a bag of silver fall on the pavement in Noble-street - my wife had heard something before. About an hour before dark I saw the prisoners pass my door in conversation together.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard a bag of silver fall - A. Yes; I went round into Noble-street, but did not see anybody - my wife was in the passage. In consequence of what we heard we went up to the bed-room door, and found it fastened inside. I called the watchman, who broke the door open. I found the window sash forced open, and the drop which secured it, wrenched off, and thrown on the floor. I went to my bureau, and missed a bag, containing 40 l. in silver, and 190 l. in notes, and a cash-box gone; they were mostly 1 l. Bank notes - some 5 l. and some 10 l. I gave information next morning at Hatton Garden, and had placards posted about. I do not know the numbers of the notes. I did not see the prisoners again till the 17th of April, when I saw Saxton in Goswell-street, with another person, I ran down stairs, and followed him to the end of Wilderness-row, he saw me, and ran down Wilderness-row - I lost him in an instant, and upon turning round, I saw Redding, apparently, looking after him; I collared him immediately, and said I detained him on a charge of felony. He said,</p>
               <p>"What have I been doing?" I said</p>
               <p>"Have you not been in Goswell-street lately?" He denied having been there for three months. I said,</p>
               <p>"Why the last time I saw you you had a snuff-coloured coat on, a black handkerchief, and very large whiskers," He said he never had a black handkerchief round his neck in his life. Walters came up, and took him to Old-street watch-house. Upon searching his pockets two skeleton keys, and another key were found. I returned home for an hour and a half, when Saunders fetched me; we went, and saw Redding at the end of Brick-lane, Old-street, with another person. I have since discovered who that person was - they were taken to Old-street watch-house. Redding said,</p>
               <p>"This is a do, for the purpose of defrauding your creditors." I had not told him what he was taken for: he was rather obstinate about being secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Redding was taken very near your house, and very near his own - A. It is not far off. I had circulated bills about the robbery; the bills, by mistake, stated it to be the 24th, instead of the 25th. The names of Tunnicliffe and Barlow are over my door - I took the house of them, it has been in that name for years, and I let it remain, as I married Mrs. Tunnicliff's daughter. I have no regular time for paying my distiller.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Redding's sister-in-law - A. I know her since this affair, she occasionally dealt with me; I had received a 5 l. note from her shortly before I was robbed. I understood from her that the prisoner lived with her at No. 41, Compton-street. I have been and searched there. I have no recollection of his sister's coming to our house the day after the robbery. The servant was sent up stairs before the bag fell, and when it fell my wife, myself, and servant, all went up together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you know that Saxton lived in the neighbourhood - A. I do not. I had had the money about a fortnight. I keep the house now.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At the time of the robbery, were you in any difficulty - A. Not the least, I could pay 10 l. for every 1 l. I owe. I take about 20 l. a day. Redding's brother was with him when he was apprehended. I did not know the woman was his sister-in-law till after the robbery - she had repeatedly given me the name of Holmes.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On Sunday night, the 25th of March, I was standing in the back room, about ten o'clock, and heard a crush in the room above, as if something was broken - I sent the servant, named 
               <persName id="t18210606-3-person110">

            , to ascertain what it was: she has left my service, and is not here. I saw the prisoner Saxton come in about the time I sent her up - I knew him before for about three weeks, while my husband was ill, I first saw him the day my husband was confined, he came every day, and Redding was along with him - I was perfectly acquainted with their persons. When the servant came down and spoke to me, my eye was still directed to the door, and I saw Saxton walk out; he had called for a glass of rum, which he sipped two or three times before he went - he paid for it. I went into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060006"/>passage, near the parlour, for a bason, and as I waited by the table I heard a bag of silver drop on the ground, apparently, under the window - the stones are rough there. I heard Saxton cry</p>
               <p>"Stop!" I knew his voice. I stood still, and heard the shutters unfastening from the wall - they are kept in Noble-street, against the wall; they go upon hinges, and fasten back. I called out to know if any one was putting the shutters to, and was told they were not. I saw through the passage window the prisoner Redding descend by the aid of the iron bars at the window and the shutter, I could not see the iron bars, but I saw him on the shutter, the lappel of his coat caught on the top of the shutter, his side face was towards me, and he appeared holding something. I saw sufficient of him to be certain of his face, his back was towards the shutter. My husband was then dosing in an arm chair, with the infant in his arms. I said I was robbed, took a candle, ran up stairs, and found the door fastened within, that I could not enter; I came down again, and

            , who now lives with me, went up with me; I do not know when my husband came up, as we were in confusion; the watchman broke the door open, when we found the window up, and the property gone. While the prisoners frequented our house I never knew their names or residence. Saxton was going to say something at the office, but Redding said - Hush!</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you go out of the house - A. Yes; the nearest light in Noble-street, is about twenty or thirty yards from the house - they are common lamps, and very dull - it was a very dark night. I was in the passage when I heard the voice, and was looking at the window, which was shut; my husband was in the parlour, which does not look into Noble-street. I saw the cash-box about eleven o'clock in the morning, he sometimes keeps the key, and sometimes I do. When I saw Redding's sister, after his apprehension, I recollected her well; I had known her for years by the name of Cresley, and have changed her notes repeatedly. I did not know she was his sister till after the robbery. I have no doubt of Saxton being the man who came out of the window - I saw his face. He had a blue great coat on, and a white handkerchief. I did not know his name - we called him the horse-dealer. I described them to the officers next morning, and we published a bill with a description of their persons. The cash-box and bag were found empty in the City-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What sort of a passage is this - A. A narrow one; two candles stood on the table, opposite the window, the outside of the window was dark. I did not suspect any robbery at first, but thought a drunken man might have fallen down; I was a yard or two from the window. My late servant now lives in the neighbourhood, and I could have had her here if I liked. On the Thursday before there was upwards of 500 l. there; we take from 25 l. to 50 l. a day.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you such a sight, as to be sure it was Redding - A. Quite certain. The other prisoner originally wore a snuff-coloured coat, and sometimes a black handkerchief. I did not bring my servant, being dissatisfied with her, as she was dishonest. We were not behind hand - we pay ready money for every thing.</p>

            . I am cousin to Mrs. Barlow, I live with her; I remember the prisoners, they came to the house regularly every day for about three weeks, once or twice a day; Saxton was generally drest in a snuff-coloured coat, and black silk handkerchief; the other wore a dark long coat. I was serving in the bar, I heard nothing, but about five minutes before the robbery, Saxton came in and had a glass of rum - I served him, he drank it at the bar, and was there four or five minutes. Mrs. Barlow called out from the passage, to know if the girl was shutting the shutters, I said No! and the girl said so too. Mrs. Barlow and I went up and tried the door - it was fast, and we came down. Mr. Barlow was in the parlour, and

             was shutting up the shutters in Noble-street; she was out of doors when Mrs. Barlow called out, shutting up the side shutters in Noble-street, that shutter was not by the passage, but a good deal lower down. I answered my cousin first, as I knew she was not shutting that shutter in the bar window. Mrs. Barlow asked if she was shutting the passage shutter. Parker remained in the house for a week after - we found the room rifled on entering it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was she shutting the shutter under the bed-room window, or lower down - A. Lower down, she was shutting the nearest window to Goswell-street. She was examined by the Magistrate once; I think it was at the third examination. She was five yards or more from the passage window.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did your cousin say that night, that she had seen any one at the window - A. Yes, and that she knew him.</p>

            , and what did I take him for; I said, on suspicion of breaking into Mr. Barlow's house; he said he had not been into Old-street-road but once for the last three months. I said he was at Barlow's house drinking, he said he believed he was once or twice - I went to search him; Mr. Barlow was present, and said, you have been in my house several times; he said he did not recollect being there more than once or twice. He took off his coat and threw it down, in the pocket I found three keys; I asked what the middle key was, he said it belonged to his room door. I asked where he lived, he paused some time, then said he could not tell the street - I also found a knife in the same pocket. I was present when Redding was brought in by Saunders, and I took his brother who was with him; the prosecutor said,</p>
               <p>"That is him," pointing to Redding; Redding said in reply,</p>
               <p>"Sir, I am a gentleman, I will make you remember this, I will bring an action against you;" he gave his name as Richards, his brother gave his as Jones, they would not tell where they lived. I asked Redding if he knew Saxton, who was locked up behind - he did not see him, he said he did not, and had not been at Barlow's with him. I sent them to the office in a coach, and took Saxton myself, and asked if he knew Jones or Richards (he had not seen them) he said, No. The Magistrate was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060007"/>not sitting, and I took them all to another watch-house; they appeared strange to each other, and still gave their names as Jones, Richards, and Saxton. Next day, I went to No. 41, Compton-street, and found some property, which I afterwards returned to Redding's brother.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the morning of the 26th of March, I was informed of this robbery, the prosecutor and his wife described the persons they suspected; the prisoner's height answers the description, but not their dress. I examined the premises, and went in search with the prosecutor several nights and days to look for them; he said he should know them if he saw them; his wife said she saw one of them drinking in the house, and the other descend from the window. On the 17th of April, in consequence of what the prosecutor said, I went to St. Luke's watch-house, and saw Saxton; he asked for pen and ink, and paper, which was given him; the bellman came by for the letters, he gave the paper through the hole, saying, it was too late to send it by post - it was written upon, I produce it (reads)</p>
               <p>"Dear James, I am taken on suspicion of the robbery, come to me at Worship-street office." I afterwards went with Barlow and Walters to the corner of Brick-lane, Old-street, Barlow pointed Redding out, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man." I collared him, and Walters took the other man who was in company with him; I searched him, and found a watch, a handkerchief, and knife; he refused to give his name, and asked what he was charged with, I said with felony; when he got to the watch-house, I told him the charge, he said,</p>

They all three told the Magistrate they had no residence, they were asked where they slept the night before, Saxton said, at No. 27, King-street, Soho; Jones said, in Carey-street, Deptford, and Richards said, at Shadwell; I enquired at No. 27, King-street, Soho, they knew no such person - it is a respectable house. I examined the premises the morning after the robbery; the bed-room window is about ten feet five inches from the ground, the bars would be an assistance to them, the top of the shutter is three feet from the window, they could stand on it and easily get in.</p>

I am a ship-caulker, and was in Bishopsgate-street about eleven o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner close behind the prosecutor; I saw him pull the handkerchief about half out, he got it out by the second attempt. I was about twenty yards from him, he crossed the road and looked behind, he gave me a kind of a nod, which I understood to mean I was to say nothing about it. I followed and overtook him near the Exchange without losing sight of him - he dropped it when I was within a yard of him.</p>

I received a very severe blow on the head, and was stunned for a minute; we both fell down together.

               <p>"You are the man who has committed the robbery or assault;" another came up and said, what are you going to do with that man, I said</p>
               <p>"I was going to take him;" he said, d - n your eyes, you shall not take him, and said to the prisoner, give me your stick; the prisoner had a bludgeon about two feet long - I had not seen it before, he had it in his hand, and gave it to the other, who beat me about the head most severely with it; he gave me eight or nine blows. which broke my hold, and both ran away - I followed; they crossed over into Wingfield street; my head bled very fast, indeed the blood ran down into my bosom. I went home, got my head dressed, and called on Lickfield the officer. I have since seen Mr. and Mrs. Foot. I saw the prisoner on the monday evening following at Spitalfields watch-house, and immediately recognized him; he is the man I am confident - I have not the least doubt of it.</p>

               <p>"You are the man I want." I did not say what for, as it is a dangerous place; when I got him out of the street, I said, I wanted him for robbing Mr. Foot; he said, he was innocent. I got Mr. Foot, who said he was the man. I fetched Steward, who also said he was the man.</p>
               <p>MR. FOOT. Steward has since seen my wife with me, she is the lady who was with me that night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (written) I declare myself innocent of the charge against me. I have hitherto maintained a character without suspicion, and as it was almost dark (as the prosecutor allows) when he was assaulted, he is more likely to be mistaken in the person that injured him. than that I should all at once become a character, directly opposite to what I had always been. I was not found in any bad company, but was taken up three days after, standing alone quietly at my own door. I made not the smallest resistance, being conscious of my own innocence.</p>

I took up my umbrella, and struck him immediately - another man was close behind me - I collared him, and called Watch! five or six times, but none came; the man whom I collared said he was not the man, and he would go to the watch-house with me; and the other man said he would go too. They both went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them snatched your watch - A. I believe the prisoner, but at the time I could not tell which, he is one of the two, and one of those who went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You indicted both parties - A. I did; there was not the slightest resistance; the prisoner is the man I struck, he accompanied me voluntarily; several people were passing, as the Theatre was breaking up - there was a blazing gas lamp close by. I do not speak to him with certainty.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure the prisoner is one of the two and the one you struck - A.He is, my Lord. I struck him as the man taking my watch.</p>
               <p>MRS. WERGMAN. I was with my husband, and saw the prisoner snatch his watch; I have not the least hesitation about it. After he snatched it Mr. Wergman forced himself from me another man came up immediately, put himself close to him, and he seized him - they went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Several people were passing - A. Yes; the prisoner surrendered voluntarily; I saw his face, and saw him do it. I saw him approach, and the other man standing ready to receive it. I was observing to my husband to take care, as I saw him approach.</p>

I took the prisoner on board as a servant, because he bore a good character at the hulks; he was nine months with me, and conducted himself very well all that time. I took him from the Retribution hulk, and employed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060012"/>him as a personal servant; he went away on the 7th of September, without my knowledge - nobody else went at the same time.

I have known the prisoner from the latter end of December; he worked with me from that time till he was apprehended. He came very regularly every day to work, Mondays as well as other days, and earned from 25 s. to 30 s. a week. I have no doubt but he would have continued with me, if he had not been apprehended. He came about seven o'clock every morning, and left about dusk, and sometimes brought his dinner with him. I believe he is single. I have had a dozen or eighteen watches about at times, and never missed any. I did not know him until he came to work for me. I am willing to employ him again, and have work for him now.

I had informed the watchman of it in the street, and the next morning, about nine o'clock I found him in custody, and have no doubt whatever of his being one of the men who threw me down - the property is not found - the watchman picked up part of the handkerchief, and I gave him the rest.</p>

            . I am watchman in Parker-street. On the 23d of May, I heard rattles sprung and cry of Stop thief! - I ran towards it, the prisoner was going towards Charles-street - not running; there was nobody else in the street - he came in a direction from the spot. I followed him to the corner of Charles-street, and stopped him - Crawley came up - the prosecutor was not there, and we let him go; he said he lived at No. 49, Charles-street. I afterwards saw the prosecutor, and at two o'clock in the morning we went there, and took the prisoner in bed.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Drury-lane, my box is ten yards from Parker-street. Between eleven and twelve o'clock, I head a cry, ran out, and saw the prosecutor in the kennel - he said he had been robbed. I saw the backs of two people a great way down Parker-street - I followed them into Cross-lane. Trimbey ran down there, and took the prisoner at the corner of Charles-street; he said,</p>
               <p>"Is this one" - I said,</p>
               <p>"I do not know - take him;" we took him to the watch-house, could not find the prosecutor, the constable of the night discharged him; we returned into Drury-lane, found the prosecutor, and by his discription, which answered to the prisoner, we went and took him again. I picked up part of the handkerchief within ten yards of where the prosecutor was stopped, and in the way he ran. I will not swear he is one of the two men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been in town but two or three days, and went to live in Charles-street. I promised to meet a man at the corner of Newton-street; I had been waiting there about a quarter of an hour when the watchman asked, if I had seen any man pass, I said,</p>
               <p>"No;" he said, then you are the man, and took me - the watch-house keeper said, Jones was tipsy.</p>

I immediately ran to the door, opened it, and looking up the street, I saw a young man running; I closed the door and pursued, crying Stop thief! - I kept within thirty yards of him till we got to St. Ann's-court, where he turned down - I came up with him, and found him in custody of the three witnesses - it was the prisoner. I saw this watch laying at his foot with the glass out, and the seconds hand knocked off with the fall; I knew the watch directly - it was the property of the executors, it hung about the centre pane, within reach of the arm through the broken pane. I have been in the shop nearly two years - it was there before I came; there was no particular mark, it has no maker's name, I had observed that before it was taken; the ticket was brought to me by one of the witnesses - it is in my handwriting. Mr. Robinson gave it to me; the prisoner was the man I pursued, to the best of my belief. I had no opportunity of seeing his face till I got into the court. It is worth 30 l.; the pane of glass was whole and safe before - I could not observe the face of the person whose arm was through the window.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WHITE. I live with Mr. King, a batter, at No. 10, St. Ann's-court. About a quarter before eight o'clock on Monday morning, I was washing the shop out, and heard a cry of Stop thief! - I immediately ran and saw the prisoner running up the court, from Wardour-street, as hard as he could, and stopped him. I saw the watch lay on the ground with the glass out - I did not see or hear him drop it.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in St. Ann's-court. I heard a cry of Stop thief! I immediately ran out, turned the corner, and White had the prisoner in his possession. I laid hold of his arm, and during that time he let the watch drop, I saw him drop it - it fell on my foot, and the glass came out; I picked it up, and gave it to Stephens - the prisoner was secured. I picked up a paper which I took to the shop, and gave to Dixon. I should know it again - that produced is it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see it fall from my hand - A. I did.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HOWARD. I am a constable, and live in St. Ann's-court. I was in my shop, and heard the cry of Stop thief! ran out and saw the prisoner stopped by White, and Robinson had hold of him. I collared him and saw Stephens coming up, and saw the prisoner drop the watch from his right hand - Robinson picked it up, he said it fell on his foot, it was not bruised - the prisoner said before the magistrate that he did drop it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOBY STEPHENS re-examined. I had not noticed the watch that morning. We do not move them from the window at night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got up about seven o'clock in the morning to bathe, it was wet, which hindered me. I was walking about, and stood up in Wardour-street- for three quarters of an hour under shelter, and heard a smash at the window as a cart came by. I saw somebody run from the shop, and ran after him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WHITE re-examined. Nobody ran down the street but the prisoner.</p>

On the 10th of April, about ten o'clock at night (I had been collecting money in the City) and was met in Lemon-street by a black woman, and went with her to a house in <placeName id="t18210606-21-crimeloc123">Wentworth-street</placeName>

I said, I wished to go away; the male prisoner M'Phelan stood at the door, and would not let me go out - he stood with his back against the door; a candle was burning on the table, he, with others, insisted on my giving them some money for drink. I said,</p>
               <p>"I would go and fetch them what they wanted" - my object was to get out. The man with the wooden leg, said, to M'Lachlan, that I owed him 3 l. (I had never seen him in my life before) she replied, he does, I saw him have it. I said,</p>
               <p>"I did not owe him any such money;" on which the other man with the wooden leg collared me, and with the assistance of the black woman, got me down on the floor; then the wooden legged man called out to the female prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Bring me a knife;" she stood in the centre of the room, and the male prisoner stood against the door - the black woman and wooden-legged man were on me at the time. I saw her go out of the room for the knife, he called loudly five or six times for it. I could not see whether M'Phelan moved to let her out, as the candle was put out, but in a very little time she returned; I cannot positively say she brought it, but I heard somebody come in, and the knife was brought. I still remained on the floor, struggling the whole time; the wooden-legged man then cut my left-hand pocket off; he then asked the others if he should cut my throat - I do not remember the exact answers, but they signified it was to be done - I think they said, do so, two distinct voices answered - I consider it to be the black woman and female prisoner. I put my hand to my throat, and received three stabs on my right hand, and lost my recollection - I was left for dead; when I came to, I found myself laying on the floor on my back, in the middle of the room; nobody nor any light was there. I searched round the room for the door, found it, and got down the two pair of stairs out of the house, into a kind of square. I found two landing places as I went down, but had not observed that I went up two pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060014"/>stairs. I was not quite sober when I met the woman - I had not drank much. I had been out collecting money most of the day, and was neither sober or badly drunk - I was not acquainted with that part of the town. As soon as I got out, I called Watch! I was then in a stinking ditch opposite the house. A headborough came instantly, and presently another. I had not left the house more than a few yards, and could not mistake it on account of the ditch behind it. I returned into the house with them; the door which I came out of, and which appeared a back door, was open - I had entered by another door; we did not re-enter at the door I came out of, but at the front, and I think that door was open. We went into a room on the ground floor, and found a candle had just been extinguished - part of the fire in the wick was visible and still smoking; we there found the prisoners on the floor, with their clothes on, standing up; the watchman held his lanthorn to their faces. I saw they were the two who came in to me - I gave them in charge, and accompanied them to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time your pocket was cut, what did you lose - A. One 5 l. note, and six 1 l. notes, and about 27 s. I have not recovered it. I have not been able to find the wooden-legged man and black woman. The prisoners were dressed exactly the same, as when they entered the room, except that the woman had a coat on over her other clothes, which I had not observed before - I am sure they are the people. I think I met the black woman about ten o'clock - it was two o'clock when I was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How had so much time been employed - A. It is some way from Lemon-street to Wentworth-street; we must have entered the house at half-past ten o'clock, and I think it was a quarter of an hour before I found myself overpowered, it took about ten minutes to go to the watch-house - I must have laid a considerable time insensible.</p>
               <p>Prisoner M'PHELAN. Q. Was I not asleep in bed, with my coat, waistcoat, and shoes off - A. He had his coat on I think, when I saw him - there appeared a bed in the room. The constable of the night detained them at the watch-house. I was in a very serious situation, from the effects of the struggling, and I was kept there, laying on the seat. I was locked in one of the places - there was no charge against me.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 11th of April, about two o'clock in the morning, the prosecutor came and said he had been robbed of 12 l. 7 s. 6 d.; the house not being on my beat, I called Endersbee; he described the people, and knowing a black woman, and wooden-legged man lived at this house - we went there; he could not point the house out at first, we went into two or three. Where he came to me he was about 100 yards off, there is a dirty back yard like a ditch, which leads into a square. I have seen the male prisoner at the house before, but not the female. I do not know what floor the black woman and wooden legged man lived on - it is a public-house in front; there is a backway leading to it. On the first floor we found the prisoners in a room, the candle was just put out - there was a bed laying on the floor, the male prisoner was laying on it with his coat off - there was no bed clothes. On going in, the man sat up, he did not appear to have been a sleep, he spoke as soon as we entered the door; the female was sitting on a coat or blanket, near the window, with all her clothes on. On going up with a light and shewing the prisoners to the prosecutor, he said, they were two that were in the room; my brother went up for the black woman and wooden-legged man, but came down without them. Hogarth was in a very confused state, his neckcloth appeared to have the print of a person's hand, and there were three distinct cuts on the back of his hand - I cannot find the other two.</p>
               <p>Prisoner M'PHELAN. Q. I was in bed with my coat, shoes, and hat off - A. His shoes and hat were off - there was a rug and blanket on the bed - it appeared to me that they heard us and laid down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MC. LACHLAN. Q. Was not I laying under the window on the same old clothes - A. She was sitting on a seat, with a coat thrown over her shoulder - her arms were not in it.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Wentworth-street; the house is on my beat, I went there with Tait - his account is correct. I went up stairs and saw the room in a very disturbed state; a chair stood on its back leaning against the wall, on its two hind legs - I know the black woman lived in that room. Hogarth appeared very much confused; his shirt was torn out of the pleats, and there were marks of a hand on his throat.</p>

               <p>MC. LACHLAN'S Defence. I had some words with my mother, and left her three days before. I went to lodge with this man and his wife, till I could make friends with my mother - he had only a few old clothes for me to lay on.</p>

I was constable of the night; the prisoner was brought to the watch-house; he said he had fetched the things for his mother to wash, and she lived at No. 18, Dean-street, and that it contained three shirts, but he did not know what the rest were. On opening the bundle I found them all wet, as if just washed - he got over a wall eight feet high, to get at them.</p>

I awoke about daylight, and missed my watch; she was still alongside of me; I asked for my property, she said I had brought none with me - I missed money besides, and my waistcoat. I got up, and was going for an officer, she called me back, and gave me my waistcoat. I found my watch in pawn,</p>

            . I live in Shakespeare-walk; my brother keeps a chandler's shop. On Friday night, the 10th of May, about eleven o'clock, the prisoners came to the shop - Holland had the watch - she put it on the counter, and said a sailor, whom she knew before, had come to her house, and had no money; that he told her to leave the watch for victuals, and to pawn it in the morning for 1 l.; she had some bread, butter, and bacon, which came to 6 s. I asked her if she was sure the seaman gave her the watch Hassell said she saw the sailor give Holland the watch. In the morning they both came for the watch, and asked me to advance 1 l. on it - Hassell said she would pawn it. I gave it to Holland, who gave it to Hassell. One of them waited while the other went and pawned it, and brought the money. I changed the 1 l. note, and took my 6 s. She was putting the ticket into her bosom, I said she had better leave it with me, for the sailor - she gave it to me - I gave it to the officer.</p>

On the 16th of May, about two o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me in the Strand, and said he had been robbed of 15 s. at a brothel in Swan-yard - he described the girls to me. I went with him to the house; I afterwards searched him, but found nothing on him. I searched a boy named Green, who was in his company, and found the duplicate of this watch on him. He said, in the prisoner's hearing, that the prisoner pawned the watch at Dry's, and gave him the duplicate - the prisoner denied it. I was taking him home, by the Magistrate's orders, but he took me to different places; at last he told me Green stole the watch, at Covent Garden, and gave it to him to pawn; he took me to the pawnbroker's. I went to the watch-maker, and found the prosecutor out.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 15th of May, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner, with another person, going down the Minories; I watched them to the middle of the Minories - the prisoner went into a silversmith's shop - he was in there two or three minutes - his companion waited outside. After he came out I crossed over, and followed the prisoner to Sparrow-corner, opposite Mr. Clarance's; while I waited there I saw him speak to his companion - the prisoner then went into Mr. Clarance's shop, and I saw him take the three pieces of print off the counter, near the door, and come out with them under his arm. I crossed over, he got into the Circus, and I secured him. I took him back to the shop, and Mr. Clarance claimed the property. He resisted, but I kept him.</p>

               <p>"Give it to him, and take care how you deliver it." I stood looking through the back parlour window - she gave him the 20 s. - he said to the servant, I want a half-sovereign - she said she had none. He then said the change would not do, and returned her the change - she counted it, and brought it to me - there was only 15 s. I told him it was the second time he had tried to rob me - he had kept ten sixpences back. I sent for a constable, he shifted the ten sixpences out of his sleeve, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here is the rest of your change."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. You kept the sovereign after he returned the change - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you had value for it.</p>

            . The prisoner lived in our service about a year and a half - she is single. I had no reason to suppose her in the family-way till a week or ten days before this happened, I then told her of it - she denied it. She slept in the front parlour, alone, and we in the back. I cannot hear what passes in her room - there is a wooden partition between us. On the <rs id="t18210606-36-cd208" type="crimeDate">5th April</rs>

At half-past five o'clock in the morning, I found a child in the privy - I saw it before it was disturbed; its two little legs stuck upright, the other parts were under the soil - it was exactly under the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in such a situation in which it might be, if it fell from any one sitting on the privy - A. I cannot say. It was taken out and examined by Mr. Watkins, Mrs. Bowers, the midwife, first saw it. I asked the prisoner, what she thought of doing such a horrid deed; she made no answer - she was in bed. There were symptoms of her having been delivered in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they more than what might be there if she had been delivered in the privy, and came to the parlour - A. I cannot say - I have not had a family myself; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060019"/>were marks of blood on the floor and bed - they were only marks of blood that might be after delivery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Were there not also blood marks on the privy - A. There was on the boards where she might have sat. The child appeared to have fallen with its head downward.</p>
               <p>MR. WATKINS. I am an apothecary, and have had a good deal of experience in the delivery of women. I was called to attend the prisoner on Friday, the 6th of April, and on Monday, I saw the child - it was a female; there is nothing that enables me to say whether it was born alive or not. It is very common for women to mistake the pains of childbirth, for an inclination to go to the privy; it is rather unlikely that the child should drop from her, but it depends on local circumstances, and the strength of the woman - the case is so seldom, it is not necessary to caution them against it. It is not uncommon for them to swoon away, or go into an unusual sinking at these times, and it is very likely they are not conscious of the moment the delivery takes place. I examined the child for marks of violence - I should have examined it before, but I was well aware there was great uncertainty in distinguishing between a still-born child, and one who died shortly after birth, and thought a surgeon of eminence should see it. I found no marks on it, that I should consider marks of violence; I should think them such as would have occurred by its falling down, or from natural causes. If she was delivered in the room, there would be other marks besides what there was; she might have been delivered in the privy, there was nothing to enable me to say it was born alive, and no more appears than a natural birth might have produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. I believe a head presentation is usual at birth - A. Yes, if born while she sat on the privy, it would fall head foremost.</p>

            . I am midwife of Marylebone, Infirmary. On the 16th of November, about three o'clock in the morning, I was first sent for to the deceased; she had then been moved from the sick house to the laying-in ward. I found her in labour - her pains had come on; she did not say she was in labour - she was delivered of a still-born child about a quarter after four o'clock. I left her about six o'clock, she was then perfectly safe with respect to her delivery - I had no apprehension at all of her life. I saw her again about four o'clock that afternoon, and found her much in pain, which is not unusual - I thought them after-pains. I had no apprehension of her being in imminent danger, and did not remain above ten minutes with her - it was only a visit. I saw her again next day, (Friday) between three and four o'clock, and found her very bad, apparently in violent pain; I remained about ten minutes with her - it was only a visit as before. I thought her in danger then, if she was in as much pain as she appeared to be - I did not tell her so, but told the nurse to fetch Mr. Goodyear, a surgeon of the establishment. I did not see her again alive; she died on Sunday morning early. I do not imagine that she thought herself likely soon to die.</p>

            , before she went to the workhouse. About three days before she went there, (I think it was in the early part of November) I saw her; she was then walking about, and appeared as usual. I saw her one day after - she was in the workhouse, she came to our house - I had known her a year and a half. The last time I saw her, was, I think, a fortnight before her death - she came into our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the circumstances of her death, or are you only come to say what you heard - A. Just before the Friday evening that I saw her, she ran out of doors - I stood at the window and saw her; this was on the Friday, as she went to the workhouse on the Monday following. I was listening at our window, and heard her crying very much, and heard the sound of a stick, as if it was striking on a person; she was saying,</p>
               <p>"Pray, Sir, don't." I did not see who she was speaking to, but I heard Mr. Disney's voice, very plain. I heard her say, do not, and he said,</p>
               <p>"I'll get a stick and knock you to the ground, if you don't open the door in the manner I tell you" - he was before slapping her with his hand, as I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you know his voice - A. I have heard him speak many times, and know his voice very well - this continued about three quarters of an hour. He stood scolding and beating her before she ran out - I heard him go from the door; then she ran out, and ran down the street - he went out after her. I did not see him take her, but saw him bring her back - his arms were round her waist, and she was holding to the railings; several people ran after her, and she turned round to them and said,</p>
               <p>"Pray don't let me go in with him, for if you do he will kill me" - her nose was bleeding; he said,</p>
               <p>"Ann, my dear girl, come in and I will not beat you again, nor hurt you;" he took her in, and then came to our door. I told him I had heard him beat her three nights very shamefully, he said, I was mistaken, for he never touched her, and that her nose bled from her wanting to get away, when he wanted her to go in. I saw her next morning - she shewed me her bruises; she was very much bruised on the temple, and her arms, where he had beat her with a stick. I saw her on Monday before she was taken away by the officers; she then shewed me the marks on her shoulders, neck, and ear; they were very black, and appeared to have been beaten with a whip, and she shewed me the whip.</p>

            . I am apothecary at the Marylebone Infirmary, and am a surgeon. I admitted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060020"/>the deceased into the Infirmary, on the 4th of November, as a fit patient; she appeared to be labouring under a common cold - she was brought from the Workhouse; I had no idea of her labouring under any thing else. I directed for her as for a common cold - I did not then know she was pregnant. I saw her regularly twice a day, with the rest of the patients, but apprehended nothing particular. On the 16th, I was called up about half-past two o'clock, and found her in labour - I told her of it; she denied positively any knowledge of it, and gave me, as she thought, a sufficient reason. I do not think she would have denied there being a chance of it, but gave me a reason, by which she judged she was not in labour. I sent her over to the laying-in ward - the midwife delivered her that morning, of a still-born child. I saw her in the morning, she was then vomiting, and had a constipated state of bowels, and some degree of fever.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not unusual after delivery - A. Yes, but not an unusual state preceeding the disease with which she was afterwards visited. I ordered accordingly for her - she appeared relieved, but afterwards got considerably worse, and next day (Friday) it was discovered, that it had brought on St. Anthony's fire in her left thigh, and the lower part of her belly; this made rapid progress, and towards Saturday evening, it formed several blotches of mortification, and on Sunday she died. I attended her diligently three times a day, and examined her after death with the other surgeons, Messrs. C. and J. Phillips, and Platt, who are eminent men in the profession.</p>
               <p>Q. From all you observed during the disease, and after death, what in your opinion was the cause of her death - A. That she died of St. Anthony's fire - it was at that period, an epedemic; we had three or four cases in the house, two of which died - in those cases the patients were not pregnant. I have not the least reason to suppose her death was occasioned by external violence; when I first saw her, she had marks on her posteriors, as if she had been flogged by a birch rod, but that did not appear at all serious - it disappeared; there was an interval of fourteen days, in which she was employed in the needle-room of the workhouse - from the 3d to the 14th she was in the workhouse. When I saw her in the workhouse, she was in an apparent degree of health, but afterwards appeared to have a cold, and was brought into the Infirmary.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do you believe the deceased died from natural causes - A. Yes, from St. Anthony's fire. It is possible labour might have aggravated the effect, but I have no reason to attribute her death to external violence, all that dispersed when she had the cold - I believe all the medical gentlemen agreed with me.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I examined the desceased after her death, with Mr. Goodyear, Mr. Platt, and my son. My opinion is, that her death was caused by the inflammation which seized her legs, and extended to her thigh; there were symptoms of gangreen on her thighs and legs, and mortification, the common process of it, had taken place - that certainly produced her death. I have no reason to attribute it to external violence, or injury to her person.</p>

On the 3d of May, I was in the passage, going to the door, as the chimney-sweeps were before the door, making a noise. I was going to shut the door, when the prisoner rushed against me and prevented me; he called me his old mistress and other names; he was dressed as a sweep, with black face and clothes - not in ribbons; he wanted to kiss me - I pushed him away; he then asked me to shake hands - I had a gold ring on, he shook hands with me, and drew the ring off. I ran into the street and said,</p>
               <p>"That man has got my ring off;" the people who had seen how he behaved to me, went after him. I saw him again at Bow-street the same night, but I could not swear to him. I cannot say he is the man, my sight is so bad; the ring was brought to me next morning by Johnson.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Eniker, who lives in Carey-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. I saw the prisoner go up to the prosecutrix, and ask for money - she refused; he got on the step of the door, felt her pockets, and tried to kiss her - she pushed him away; he pretended to shake hands with her, left her, and shut the door after him, and was out of sight when the old lady opened the door and said, she had lost her ring. I described him to the constable, and saw him in custody about seven o'clock. I knew him to be the man, he was not dressed up as the sweeps are, he carried the box; his face was black, and so it was in the evening - I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not often authorized me to draw a sample to oblige a merchant, without an excise order - A. I have, but they are never taken out in a handkerchief, or hat; if a merchant's clerk wants coffee, to shew his employers, we allow him to take a 1/4 lb. - it is done under the excise officer's notice, but we ought to have an excise order to draw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not authorize me to draw larger samples for my brother - A. His brother is clerk to the owner of the coffee, and I have done such a thing, but never allowed him to draw a regular sample for his brother, without the leave of my superior.</p>

He snatched it from me - I cried Stop thief! and another man stopped me, turned me round, and struck me on the back - my sister pursued him, and he was brought back in about seven minutes; his dress corresponded with the man who took my scarf - I have no doubt of his being the man. When we were at the office, before the examination, he said if I would not prosecute him, he would return it, if he could find it, and make any recompence - when I was before the Magistrate, I said I could not swear to his person, but his dress answered, I do not now speak to his features.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. It was quite dusk? - A. Yes. I only saw his back - he said he knew nothing about it, not that it was thrown at him.</p>

               <p>WM. MASON. I am an officer. I searched the prisoner's box, in her presence, and found the handkerchief in her bosom, and an apron round her waist, and on her person I found twenty-two keys, and 18 l. 8 s. - I found three books, three handkerchiefs, and an apron in her box.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took the books to read, and intended to return them; a misunderstanding took place about wages, she then took advantage of the books, and sent for the officer, who found them on the kitchen table. I had put on her old handkerchief and apron as mine were dirty - I have seven children dependent on me.</p>
               <p>WM. MASON re-examined. The books were given me by the parish constable, he is not here; I found the handkerchief and money in her box.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GRIFFITHS. I saw the books found, and am certain they were taken out of her box; she at first refused to give the key up. I missed the property, which was safe when she came into my service.</p>

I went in pursuit of the men; when I had got about two hundred yards, I saw the prisoner and another person talking together, by some posts, at the corner of Johnson's-street; I asked my brother watchman if he had seen two men run that way - he said No, and these two immediately started, as hard as they could - they must have heard me ask the question. The other man ran, and the prisoner walked fast away - I immediately collared him, and gave him in charge to the watchman. He said he had been to Kentish-town, looking for work; but at the watch-house he said he met the other two at Camden-town, and joined them as they were crossing the fields, not knowing what they were going about; and that he lived in Kennedy-court, Newton-street, Holborn.</p>

I had to collect 5 l. 10 s. from Colonel Frederick; the prisoner never accounted to me for any money as received from him.</p>
               <p>COLONEL FREDERICK. I am Colonel of the Surry militia, I paid the prisoner 5 l. in bank notes, for Mr. Willatts, at the office, I cannot swear he is the person - the man I paid wrote this receipt, in my presence, and gave it to me - I gave him a 5 l. note.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLATTS. The receipt is his hand-writing; it is dated the 30th of May - I am certain he never accounted to me for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Are you in business alone - A. Yes; my brother lives with me as clerk. I have my cash-book and the prisoner's collecting ledger. it is not entered in his book; he ought to enter money as he received it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not frequently happened that his receipts of the whole day have been entered in one large sum - A. He accounted to me once a day, he entered particularly every name he received from, and the amount - It never happened to my knowledge, that sums were entered in the gross, without the names - my brother never pointed out a transaction of that sort to me - I never desired the prisoner to give receipts in his name for money which never went through his hands - he never paid me money which was not entered in his book - I give no security for debts.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner here put in an exceeding long written defence, stating, that the charge entirely arose from the irregularity in Mr. Willatt's accounts; that he made his accounts up at night from memorandums he made on the cash he took, but cash being taken by Mr. Willatts, occasionally from his cash-box, which left him to remember the particular persons of whom he received the money - that he frequently gave receipts in his name for money that never passed through his hands, and he was frequently obliged to keep cash till next day to recollect who he received a particular sum from; he could prove mistakes had occurred; that Mr. Willatts had, at various times, written for accounts which were paid - he had frequently called at the office since he left.)</p>
               <p>MR. WILLATTS re-examined. He came into my service in August, 1819, and left the 20th of September, 1820. I saw him often afterwards. I preferred this charge in March. There have been instances in which I desired him not to enter in his book, money which he received; it was a cheque of 400 l. which I had lent a friend, it being a private transaction. I told him not to enter it.</p>

I have taken money from his box, but always entered it on a slip of paper which lay in it - I told him to enter on the notes the names of who he received them of, to prevent a loss by forged notes; but his cash-book was to shew who he had it of, and he was to enter it as he received it.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 5th of May I apprehended the prisoner at the Guardian Society's house, Cannon-street-road. I searched, and found nothing on her; I told her I took her for robbing Mr. Webb, with whom she formerly lived; the matron told me, in her presence, where to find the things produced, she said nothing to it.</p>

               <p>MRS. WEBB. She left us on the 27th. When I got up in the morning, the drawers were in their proper state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find them turned round, or were they put back - A. I found them turned round, and the kitchen poker lying on the carpet. The house is two stories high; our door is kept shut; we have no lodgers; there was nobody in the house but her. A little girl was to go to the house while I went out, but she could not get in, for the prisoner had left the house, with the children in it. I left it at ten o'clock, and returned between one and two o'clock. She might have gone out and returned if she pleased.</p>

I bought three bridles and a pair of reins, of the prisoner, for 13 s., on Tuesday, the 10th of April - another man came with him. I had bought of him before, and knew he had lived at Sadler's Repository, I exposed them at my door for sale, and

After being satisfied, I pursued them - they had walked away - I took them both in Bond-street. I saw Herod give the other something. I am sure they are the boys. The watch was not found on them; they turned down a passage between Bruton-street and Grosvenor-square, and were then out of my sight, and could there have disposed of it.

            ; we were stationed abreast of Hern Bay, Kent. On Monday night, the 23d of April, after twelve o'clock, we went on our station - it was the morning of the 24th. I was stationed on the beach, abreast of the town at Hern Bay, Sydenham Snow, was the officer, he was midshipman of the Severn, employed on the same service, and was an officer of His Majesty's Navy, and acted as a deputed officer of the customs. I was under his command that morning, he came to me about a quarter before three o'clock - it was his duty to visit us from one part of the district to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. After you saw him, how long had he left before anything happened - A. About three or four minutes; he had gone to the westward, and I eastward, and in about four minutes I heard a discharge of fire arms, and turning round westward, a whole body of musquetry was fired in a direction between him and me - I heard the whistling of the balls, and the balls heaved up the shingles as they were fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there only one firing - A. More; I retreated towards one of our men, (Wilson,) eastward, and there was a firing from another party. I found such a considereble firing there, that it was impossible for me to get to Wilson; that firing proceeded from another party, not the one that fired first, and I heard them, and I heard a sort of cheer, and cry,</p>
               <p>"Kill every *** on the beach;" these cheers proceeded from several persons repeatedly. I found several of them were following me, and firing at me; I heard the whistling of the bullets, and being before two fires, I retreated up the bill or bank, and there remained about half an hour or more till I had an opportunity of going down the beach, when I saw some of our party and joined them they had come to my assistance. I was armed with a pistol and cutlas - I discharged my pistol in the direction the firing came from.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first discharge your pistol - A. At the first beginning, after the first firing - it was after I was fired at, and as I was proceeding towards Wilson, I fired my pistol, and as I went towards him, I loaded my pistol again, (having my cartridge loose in my pocket) and fired it again in the direction of the smugglers. I was fired at repeatedly before I fired the second time. I loaded my pistol again but did not fire it - it was a very dark night; there was a very heavy lightening at intervals, which might make it appear darker.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity by the light the fire-arms made to see whether many people were assembled - A. Yes, by the flashes of their arms, I could see the number of men. I should think the first party was twenty or more - these was the party to the westward. To the best of my judgment, the party to the eastward was composed of the same number - they were more straggled; there were more continual firing from the eastward, than the west. I do not know what became of them. When I joined my party, I was informed something about Mr. Snow. The bullets<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060027"/>came very near me; they went in different directions; they were fired both above and below me - not in the air, they were fired at me.</p>

            . I was a seaman on board the Severn. On the 24th of April, I went on duty at twelve o'clock at night; my station was the next to the village of Hern eastward; I was next to North. I saw Mr. Snow first about a quarter before two o'clock - I saw him twice; he passed backward and forward to the men at the next station; and after he had passed me the second time, about a quarter of an hour or better, I heard a pistol fired - the report of the pistol came from behind me, about the village, in the direction Mr. Snow had gone. On hearing the report of the pistol, I fired to give the alarm to the next man - I fired in the air. I then heard a volley fired at the same place, where I heard the first fire - I saw the the flashes very plain. I could not tell how many pieces were fired; they fired at different times, perhaps five or six together; there must have been a great many - above twenty I am certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you guess from the report, if the fire was from pistols or musquettry - A. Both large and small fire-arms. I immediately loaded my pistol and ran on towards the fire - I had only a pistol and cutlas; the firing was repeated constantly in two directions; I heard the balls whistle past me repeatedly, and the shingles came against my trowsers. I ran as close as I could get to them, about fifty or sixty yards, and then I fired, and they opened a volley upon me. After I discharged my second pistol at them, I endeavoured to get nearer, but found the firing come so close on me, I was obliged to get up under the bank - they were then about fifty yards from me. I heard them sing out several times</p>
               <p>"Murder the *** and kill them;" the fire continued about eleven or twelve minutes; they fired right towards where they saw me fire from, as if at me, and the other party fired towards the village. I was joined on the beach by Parker, before the fire had ceased; I then got behind a boat which was turned up, and fired again off the boat's keel at the party - I could see them distinctly when they fired. We went along right up towards the village, where the firing was, and got abreast of the Ship Inn, and saw Norris, the landlord, at the window; he said something to me, in consequence of which, I ran down directly on the beach with Parker, and found Mr. Snow laying on his back; he sung out</p>
               <p>"Wilson, I am wounded, I am a dead man." I found him laying extended on his back, with his cutlas near him, and his hat on the other side; the tide was flowing, and the water was over his shoe-tops - if he had not been moved he must have been drowned - the tide was three quarters flooded, it would not have been above three or four feet higher. I observed his mouth had blood on it - it appeared to come from his mouth; two other men came down from the eastward station, and we carried him to the Ship Inn; when he was brought to the Inn, he begged us to send for the parson - one came, and I went out of the room.</p>

            . On the 24th of April, I was a seaman of the Severn, and was on duty. I was stationed eastward of Hern Bay; I heard a firing about a quarter before three o'clock, to the best of my recollection; it proceeded from Hern Bay - it was the report of several fire-arms.</p>

I cannot say whether it was pistols or what, I ran towards the firing as fast as I could, but could see no people at all. The firing continued; as I ran along the beach towards the bay, they fired behind the house at me off the green bank. I cannot guess how many people there were on the bank, the pieces fired at me were loaded - the balls came down and cut the shingles up into my face, as I ran along the beach; I did not hear them say any thing.

               <p>Q. During this time, did you see West - A. Yes; I saw him after the first conversation with Beer; I saw him passing my wife's father's house, and called to him; I knew him before. Nobody was with him, I asked him when he expected the boat to work, he said he did not know.</p>

               <p>Q. How come you to ask that question - A. Beer told me West was concerned in it - West said he did not know, but when the boat worked, he would let me know.</p>

There were pistols fired at that time, at the same moment as he snapped his. Where they were fired from, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he snapped before any body fired, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060029"/>cannot tell - A. I cannot; just as he snapped his, two pistols, S. Lawrence who had a pistol, and M. Lawrence, who had a brass blunderbuss, both fired in a direct way towards him, they were, I suppose, fifteen or twenty yards from him, I cannot say the distance - on their firing, the same persons advanced towards the working party - I do not know whether he had any thing but a pistol; I did not see him again.</p>
               <p>Q. What took place - A. There was a great deal of firing from our party - I think it was only from our party; they kept firing for two or three minutes. The working party at this time were taking tubs from the boat at the water's edge, to the carts. We were not quite close to the beach. Beer told me it was spirits of gin and spirits of brandy - they were put into the carts - the two foremost went away first, and Webster's cart stopped behind, to take up some tubs, which were scattered about; they were all carried away, to the best of my knowledge. Webster is a man who jobs about, carrying coals.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the party - A. I have something else to say - all the tubs I thought were taken away, but I heard West, Beer, and Lawrence say, they had not got all they expected the boat to bring. When they got them safe in the cart, they began to huzza, and cheer; and say,</p>
               <p>"All is right." The armed men then assembled round the cart; the two carts went away directly - they were filled. Webster's cart stopped behind for three tubs, which were taken out of the water; the carts went on from Hern, and we went after them, to some distance on the road, and then returned to Littleborn - most of the party went as far as Hern, and then dispersed. West parted from me at Sturry, about five miles from Hern. I saw West the next day, Wednesday, thatching, at Mr. Westbrook's; we were talking about the boats working; he said there were sixty-five tubs worked, and they expected eighty-one to come in all - but they had not got them all; he asked if we wanted any money - Homans was with me; he said, it did not matter just then - he said,</p>
               <p>"I have got but little," and pulled out 9 s., and said we might have it between us if we liked. I said, I would have none; he gave Homans 7 s. - this was all that passed then. I saw

               <p>Q. Did you communicate to any person, what you knew of this - A. Yes, to Mr. Stride, an officer, before any body was in custody. I cannot say what day it was - I communicated it two or three times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell Stride before you went, that you were going - A. Yes, two or three weeks before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you tell him two or three weeks before it happened, that you were to accompany them to Hern Bay - A. No, I told him about the boats working. I knew their pieces were loaded. I could not help their firing, if I had made any resistance, they would have blown my brains out. I fired myself seven or eight times - not more to my knowledge.

            . I have not seen her for thirteen years. I was married at Sandwich, it might be fourteen or sixteen years ago. I cannot tell how long I have been married this second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever in possession of some 5 l. Bank notes - A. That business was since this, it was three weeks or a month ago. Mr. Smith, the officer, who I went with to Hern, told me when I returned, that there was a charge against me; he told me so at the Marquis of Anglesea, public-house - I have passed many notes in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You may answer or not, how long before you was at Bow-street, had you passed the first note, that was supposed to be forged. - The witness declined answering the question.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When were you first married - A. I do not know. I have only been married twice. I was very young when I first married. I do not know what age I was then or am now. My mother tells me, that my first wife was buried at Deal. My second wife has her certificate to produce - she is here. I think I have been married above twelve years to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How many cartridges were delivered to you - A. Fourteen as near as I can tell; I know I had three in my pocket, in the morning, and one in my pistol, and I might have drawn some out of my pocket in loading my pistol. I was about fifteen yards from Mr. Snow when he fell - I did not see him fall, but saw him rush in among the company - I did not see him after. I knew nothing of his falling, only Edward Homans said,</p>
               <p>"There is a man fell." It was a finish night, the moon had been up about half an hour - I could see a man fourteen yards off. I gave information to Stride nine or ten days, or a fortnight before the transaction - it was after I saw West and Beer. I could not tell Stride exactly where the boat was going to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a 1 l. note from a 5 l. - A. Yes, and that is all. I do not know all the letters in the alphabet. I know a person is coming up to say I wrote a letter for her - (Mrs. Fuller). I have known her very well for seven or eight years - I can neither read or write.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in custody - A. Not at all, Homans and another are in custody. I have been to see them four or five times, and saw them this morning here.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not going to ask if you have been guilty of felony, but have you been in prison - A. Yes, three times; the first time was twelve or thirteen years ago, about some money that a man and I were partners in. The second time was about two years ago, for standing in my own defence, when a farmer suspected I had his things, and stopped my cart on the road. The third time was last summer, that was for a fine for smuggling. I was on board a man of war seven or eight years ago for smuggling,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060030"/>when I was taken with a pair of tubs on my back. I think they are the only times I was in trouble for smuggling.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not something about some oil once - A. I lent a man money to buy oil, and was taken up because I went out to see it measured. I was confined by the Mayor of Canterbury for two or three days - I was not tried for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw your father-in-law the morning after this transaction, did you not tell him you, yourself, fired eleven times - A. Not to my knowledge, if I did tell him I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q A. few days after this happened, you went to Mr. Snow's brother - A. Yes, to give information of the matter. I had told the Custom-house officer, it was to be done in the Isle of Thanet. I thought it proper to tell Mr. Snow, on purpose to save people's lives.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not go to Stride on the 23d of April - A. If I had, I should not have known where the party were going. I went to the House of Correction to see Smith and Homans - Smith's sister wished me to shew her down to him, and I went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not talk about this matter - A. Very little - we have not communicated together about it.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. You saw them this morning in the room with other witnesses - A. Yes, I did not know the goods were to be landed at Hern Bay till after we left Hoath; it was eight o'clock on Monday when I knew where they were to be landed; I went to Stride that night; I first knew of the charge about the notes when Smith and I came to London; I had been to London before, and in consequence of my communication, a Bow-street officer was sent with me to Deal, and on my return this charge was made - that was about a fortnight or three weeks after the 23d of April; all the prisoners, except Webster, were in custody when the charge was made - I was examined and discharged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there any understanding that you were to be discharged because you were to be a witness in this case - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You fired seven or eight times; did you fire at any body - A. Not at all; I bit the ball out of my cartridge and fired in the air; I made no objection to their taking fire-arms, if I had, they would have had suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Sidders, your brother-in-law, that you fired ball cartridges - A. Not to my recollection; I could not tell him, for I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. What party began firing - A. The armed party that I was with fired first, they were the right hand party, the other party fired a little, but not much; the two Lawrences and

               <p>Q. How came you to say you only applied to three - A. I only applied to three that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them it was no harm, no danger - A. Yes, I told Stannard in the morning he might have had 6 s. and not much trouble, he would not have carried arms. I was taken up on Sunday; I work in the woods as well as smuggle; I do not know the hide in the wood, I know no place where arms or tubs are hid - I was in custody before I gave information, I cannot deny the truth - I come here to save my life - I do not know how many times Griffiths fired - we were all straggling about on the beach; it was dark, we could not tell what each other did; the moon got up while we were in the fields, there was lightening. In all sixty-two tubs were run; I saw two tubs put into the cart - I searched one of the tubs, it was spirits of Hollands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. How long have you been a smuggler - A.

The tubs hold about two gallons and a half, they were slung two together with ropes, as smuggled spirits are - I took one tub to my house, it was seized, and a gun; it was one of the tubs that came from the wood.</p>

             went in and had a pint of beer at Sturry, and then went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see West after this - A. Yes, on Wednesday morning, he was thatching at Mr. Pembroke's. I was with Griffiths - we talked things over there, and he gave me 7 s. I did not hear any thing about tubs. Griffiths asked him for money, he said he had but 9 s. in his pocket, and Griffiths said he would wait till another time till he had it all.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the pistol which had been given to you - A. I carried it home, and fired it two or three times after. I put it into the drawers; Smith, the officer, afterwards took it away. I was taken up on the following Sunday, and have been in custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. What are you - A. I go with horses, but have not been this year. I have been a bricklayer. I have only worked two boats. I have known Griffiths six years - I had heard he smuggled, but was not with him, except this time, and one other, on the coast below Rickebar - I was not armed then. I was never accused of any thing, but was once before Mr. May, the Magistrate, for not doing justice to my master. Griffiths was on the right side party, I was with mine - the moon was up. I was apprehended in bed, by Smith, and a pistol was found at my house. I was brought to town on the coach, with West, Beer, the two Richardsons, and the last witness. I saw Griffiths at the House of Correction several times; Smith and I were confined in one room together. Griffiths was confined in the same prison for near a week, slept and eat in the same room, and talked together about this business; he came to see us last Wednesday, and talked about the evidence we were to give here. I think I saw him four times - he stopped about half an hour once, and sometimes an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How much money did Griffiths ask for - A. He mentioned no sum. I never charged him with shooting Mr. Snow; I only solicited W. Williams and Griffiths to assist in landing the spirits.</p>

               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Was Griffiths in prison on the same charge as you - A. I expect so; I was there a week or more before he came - he was afterwards discharged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you set off from Littleborn, did you know you was to go armed - A. No; when I found we were I was sorry I was there - we took them to keep the men at bay. I fired once, and fired my pistol off in the field.</p>

            . I keep the Ship Inn, at Hern Bay. On the morning of the 24th of April I was alarmed by the discharge of fire-arms, I got out of bed, looked out of the window, and saw a number of people on the beach, and a boat on the shore - there seemed to be twenty or thirty men; they appeared in motion from the boat up the road, and appeared to be carrying something. I saw no cart or horse - I could not tell what they were carrying - they passed on, and soon after I heard a person mourning on the beach, and heard him say,</p>
               <p>"Lord, have mercy on me!" and in the course of a little time four of the men belonging to the preventitive service came into the road; I called to them, and Mr. Sydenham Snow was brought to my house - I knew him before. He was first taken into my bar by four of his men, and then into the parlour; he requested a clergyman to pray with him, and I sent for Mr. Dornford, who came; I also sent for a medical man, and then sent to Whinstaple for another medical man; this was on Tuesday morning - he died at my house about eight o'clock on Friday morning.</p>

            . I am a Surgeon. I was sent for to Hern Bay, to the Ship Inn, and saw Mr. Snow - he was wounded in his right shoulder, and right thigh; the left shoulder was dangerously wounded - I arrived there about seven o'clock in the morning, the clergyman was there then; I did not leave Mr. Snow until his death.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060033"/>I had some conversation with him about his wounds. Immediately on my arrival, I found the wound in the left shoulder was mortal - he was paralyzed below. I did not apprize him that the wound was mortal; he expressed his apprehension that he should not recover, he said he considered himself in a dying state, and told me he should never recover, before I entered into any conversation with him - I believe he expected he should die, the clergyman had been with him. He stated to me, that in visiting his men, on returning from North, Parker, and Wilson, he desired them to give a good look-out, as he saw a boat near, as he was returning towards Hern Bay, he saw another boat, and desired his men to look-out; that as he had passed his centinels, and got down to Hern Bay, he endeavoured to gain the road, and a party of armed men rushed down on him; he received the small wound in the middle part of his left shoulder, from fire-arms; he attempted to fire his pistols, but they both snapped; he threw his pistols away, and drew his sabre, and while in the act of cutting and slashing, he received the shot in his left shoulder, the lower extremity became paralyzed, and he fell; he knew nothing further of what happened, till the party of armed men came to take the goods from the boat; when that was done, he was taken from the water's edge (his feet being in the water) by part of the blockade men - he mentioned Wilson's being the man who spoke to him, he was carried up to the Ship. He stated, that one of the smugglers stood over him with his legs extended, and said,</p>
               <p>"You *** you lay low enough" - he died on Friday morning. I extracted the balls, one from under his right arm-pit - that was a large pistol ball; the other appeared either a slug, or a duck shot - that was in the thigh. I can hardly tell what it was - I produce them. I saw his clothes, the cape of his great coat was partly blown away; his inside blue jacket was very much scorched - the person who shot him must have been very near.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When he called you up, did you see his cart in the yard - A. It was to the best of my belief; I did not go to the window to see.

I came down stairs, opened the door. I asked him how his father was at the window, he said, he would wait a moment, and I came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go that day - A. Nearly to Deal, I travelled alone, I will not positively say the cart was in the yard in the morning.

No; I am not certain that he brought the first note; I believe him to be the same, but did not notice him at the time; he came with this note, but I cannot swear to him. The person asked for a black silk waistcoat, which came to 5 s., he tendered me a 1 l. Bank note; I begged of him to write his name and address on it - he did so - I could not read it, as I can neither read nor write. I carried it to Mr. Harrison's shop, over the way, and delivered it to Thomas, the shopman, for change, he wrote on it, and put it into the till. I immediately stepped over the way, gave the person 15 s., and he went away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner, and say whether you are enabled to say he came on any day to your shop - A. He did; it was the next day, or the next but one, but I think the next day; he asked for a blue coat, I asked 1 l. for it - he gave me a 1 l. Bank note, I said,</p>
               <p>"Please to write your name and address;" he did so. I then carried it to my wife to write on it. She read what he had written, he said that was right; she put her name on it, and put into her pocket. He went away immediately with the coat - he had not got the silk waistcoat on. The evening after we took it we went to No. 8, Baltic-street, Old-street-road, to enquire for the prisoner, but could not find him - there was no such person there - we enquired for

               <p>"Yes, Sir, I am, but for God's sake don't hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the exact words you said, when you collared him - A. I told the officer, that was the man I wanted to take, for passing the note on me - the prisoner must have heard it. He said,</p>
               <p>"I am the man, Sir, but don't hurt me." I do not recollect his saying any thing else. We went with him along Grub-street, and in Grub-street, he gave me a 1 l. note, and I believe his words were</p>
               <p>"Put it away." I wrapped it in a handkerchief, and put it in my pocket, went home and took my handkerchief merely to wipe my face, and laid it down on my sideboard, went away and left it there. I went to Guildhall - I was absent about a quarter of an hour, returned and found the handkerchief laying on the same spot, and took the note out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you put your handkerchief on the sideboard, was your wife there - A. She was in the same room, and remained at home, and was in the same room when I came back for it. I made a cross on it at Guildhall, and gave it to the officer. (looks at one) I cannot swear it is my cross - I gave it to Sidwell in Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You cannot swear the prisoner came the first time - A. No, I believe him to be the same sized man. After he was apprehended, he said, he sold his watch in the street to a stranger for 2 l.; he made the same statement at Guildhall; he gave me the second<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060037"/>note of his own accord. I believe he gave it me that he might not pass it, as he found the others were bad. I shall always think so - he did not resist.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He did not at all deny being the person who was in your shop - A. He said he was the same. I told him I had been to No. 8, Baltic-street, and I think he said in his flurry, he put down the wrong direction. I did not particularly notice what he said, as I was flurried myself. I did not use him roughly when I collared him.</p>

He came for a blue coat my husband asked 23 s., but took 1 l. for it - he paid a 1 l. note for it; my husband asked his name and address. I do not know that he made any particular answer, but wrote on the note. I then took it, and put the two first letters of my name on the Britannia, without taking the note up, (looks at it) this is it - here is my mark. I read the address he put on it, to him; it was</p>

Warner went up, slapped him on the shoulder, and said, this is the lad I am looking for. I immediately laid hold of him and took him into custody; Warner asked him, what he had done with the coat that he had bought from him; he said he had got some money in his pocket, and would pay for it if he would let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Warner say anything to him before that - A. Not to my recollection; the prisoner said, he sold it for 14 s., and he had some money in his pocket, and if Mr. Warner would let him go, he would pay for it. Warner said, he could not do that. He begged us to let his father know, and said his father lived at No. 8, Bartholomew-square, Old-street, and that his name was

            . I keep the Moors Arms, public-house. On Saturday, the 10th of March, the prisoner came to my house for a pint and a half of gin, and tendered me a 1 l. note. I asked her name, she said John - I asked her what? she said Joe. I knew there was no such name in the place, and asked if it was Jones - she said Yes. I put the name on the note, and was going to give her change, but my wife thought I had better not. I returned her the note, and told her to get change at the butcher's or baker's - she went out with it in her hand, and left her bottle.</p>

            , who keeps a chandler's shop, at Redmond's-row, Mile End. The prisoner came to oar shop on the 31st of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, and asked for some tea, sugar, butter, and cheese. I weighed them all up, and put them on the counter; she then asked for change for a 1 l. note, which she produced. I looked at it, took it to the candle, told her it was bad, and asked whom she had it of - she said she knew whom she had it of. I asked her again, and she said she did not know. I told her she knew it was bad as well I did, and she had tried to pass it on me - she said she did not know it. While this conversation was going on, a man came in, and asked for a small quantity of cheese, which I gave him - he then asked what was the matter, and I told him. He asked her if she knew whom she had it of - she said she did not. He asked her if she was married - she said she was. He said, perhaps she was a poor woman who had a large family, and did not know who she had taken it of, and I had better give her the note, and let her go about her business - I refused. He then left the shop, and went outside. I then heard some muttering outside, and told my husband I wished there was an officer near, for I would have her taken up; he said he would fetch one, at that moment the door opened, and two men came in, one asked for tobacco, the other pretended to be in liquor, fell against the shop door, pushed it wide open, caught her by her two shoulders, and ran out with her. She had left the note in my hands, I took it in the parlour and saw a name on it very much blotted, with the words - and Co. Limehouse, or Wapping, I put it under an image on the shelf, it remained there till the Tuesday following, when I gave it to Christian, went to the office with him, and found her in custody (looks at one) this is it, it is the number 129,76, and there is H.

            . I am an officer. I went on Sunday morning to apprehend Holding, I met him and Wade in the street, and asked where they lived - Holding said they had no lodging, and were out of employ. I ascertained they lived at No. 71, Crown-street; we took them there, up stairs, and Holding produced the key of the padlock, which was on the door, and the key of the common lock, and unlocked the door, and there we found the two pair of shoes, a crow-bar, and some skeleton keys.</p>

               <p>MR. WILLIAMS (in continuation.) At the time this letter was written, I had no idea of this remittance. On the 26th of April, I complained to the prisoner about a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060042"/>deficiency in money matters, and he produced this paper to me to sign. I believe I heard of Mr. Clark's remittance next day - I refused to sign the paper.</p>

             shall assist you, in case any thing shall have escaped your memory.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAMS (in continuation). I afterwards received a letter from Mr. Clark, complaining of not having received an acknowlegment of the money, and that was the first I knew of it. I read the letter to the prisoner, and remonstrated with him, and said, I should be ruined; he said, He should make it all right, I should lose nothing by him; he lived on the premises with his family, and had the charge of all the property there - I live at Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he remain with you after this - A. I scarcely got sight of him after but once, he went out before I arrived, and returned at night after I was gone, and he absented himself entirely on the 5th of May - his family remained there. Messrs. Sunters, my other clerks, principally kept the books, with the prisoner's assistance, when the prisoner left, the book that passed through his hands, for the cash account was missing - I never consented to his taking this bill out of the letter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You had two modes of keeping your accounts, one private and the other public - A. No, I occasionally wanted other assistance than I could procure myself, but the prisoner did not supply my wants - he procured assistance from my own friends.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, has he not in numerous instances, procured assistance from his own friends - A. I consider them my friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not procured for you, bills and acceptances from persons you never knew, to the amount of thousands - A. I most positively deny receiving from him anything but what he effected to bring from a Mr. Harris, and between me and Mr. Harris, I cannot account. I did not know but all the paper he brought, came from Mr. Harris, till lately. He brought me some bills accepted by one Walby, said to be a friend of his - it was some time in March. I never recollect telling him he must get me assistance elsewhere, when Mr. Harris could not accommodate me. If I had Eddington's book, I could tell better what I have received, but without it I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is a book, look at it - A. There are two others. I have no secrets. I had no private transactions with him that I do not wish to be known.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not a private account kept of money, he accommodated you with - A. Not to my knowledge; he had the care of the books; he did in some instances procure accommodation for me, that is, he exchanged acceptance with a friend, on my responsibility and not his.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not procured 1800 l. from his own mother, out of which you have paid 500 l. - A. His mother holds my acceptance for that amount, but I never had the money. I gave her the bills about a month or six weeks ago, they are to the amount of 1300 l. I have no doubt but the first money that came into his hands, he paid himself with; he did not say he took the 62 l. to settle the balance - he never made any claim on me. Mr. Carter called on me, and said, If I gave an undertaking for the safety of the prisoner's person, he would attend and make up the books; he offered to settle it by reference - this was a fortnight after his absence.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not desired him to keep an account of what money he procured for you, by his own means, on a separate slip of paper - A. No, he kept account on paper, (looks at a paper) this has my mark on it - No. 8.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, looking at that, I ask you, was not 751 l. procured as stated on that paper - A. Yes, but allow me to explain, the prisoner furnished 38 l. 15 s. of it, but I never asked him, the paper is his writing, I put the mark on it when it is sent me to examine, (looks at another paper) it appears by this, that 21 l. was advanced by him; he paid forty guineas for a horse for me, but I will answer for it, he paid himself, so much money went through his hands, that unless I have his books, I cannot answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not since you ordered him not to open your letters, frequently told him to open them as heretofore - A. By no means, he procured me assistance from Mr. Wallis, who is a friend of his; I first heard of Wallis at the end of March last.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this bill for 259 l. dated May the 22d, 1820, accepted by Wallis, is not your endorsement on it - A. Yes, it is, but I did not know him in this transaction; Eddington brought it to me as from Harris.</p>
               <p>Q. When these slips of paper were brought with others to your counting-house, were they not by your direction put under a stone to conceal them - A. No, they were generally filed; I never burned any accounts, he appeared at the Mansion-House, and Mr. Harmer gave me notice he was ready to meet the charge.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Would you have been glad to have had a settlement from him at any time - A. It was my most anxious wish; he brought all money to me as from Harris, I had a general guarantee for all paper that came from Harris; I am not distressed for money, but able to meet every thing, and have many thousands over; I had an unexpected demand for 1800 l. and Mr. Eddington said, he thought he could get some money from a private friend, and I understand since that he got it from his mother, he had my acceptances, but I never had half the money, the slips of paper are merely accounts sent to me to shew the current entry of the day; the bill received from Mr. Clark was not entered any where, he kept it an entire secret.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When Mr. Clark wrote for you to acknowledge the receipt of this sum, did you examine the books - A. I did, and asked the prisoner what had become of it, he said, he should account for it, this was on the 25th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not absent himself - A. His family were in the house, he came home at night; he was in my counting-house on the 27th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, but that was merely a look-in, I told him I would not be put off, I did threaten to prosecute him, or to send for a constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060043"/>MR. ALLEY. Q. When did you go before the Lord Mayor - A. On the 5th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner breakfast with you that morning - A. Yes, he did; I did not take him up; a sheriff's officer arrested him, and said we could not take him out of the sheriff's hands.</p>

On the 29th of May, at night, I saw my house fastened, I have a flap door made partly of wood and iron, that was safe, and my street door was safely locked - I was the last person in the counting-house; but not the last person at the street door, the flap door was safe. I had a considerable sum of money in my counting-house, in notes, gold, silver, and copper - there was 1 l., 5 l., and 10 l., notes, some of all those amounts, but none higher than 10 l. - there was upwards of 100 l. in silver, and about 30 l. in guineas and sovereigns, the halfpence were done up in a 5 s. papers, the paper was not marked - my young man,

            , did them up. I know one 1 l. note particularly and will swear to having marked it that night, and there was a French 5 d. piece, or demi franc, which I knew - I was awake about four o'clock, it might be that time, but I am not certain, and was out of bed. - I heard nothing then, it was just getting light; I went to bed, and went to sleep, and I heard the servant man get up, about five o'clock, and in consequence of an alarm from him, I went down stairs to the counting-house, I looked through the counting-house door, which is glazed, and there saw the iron chest broken open - I had locked the door, and taken the key up stairs, part of the copper, and all the silver, notes, and gold were deposited in the iron chest. I found them all gone, and the cash-box, which was in the iron chest, lying on the floor - I missed about 300 l. - on examining the premises, I found they had entered by the cellar flap, and from thence to the shop, by a trap door, which leads into the shop, they had broken the door leading from the shop into the counting-house, which I had left locked, and had the key; I then observed the door leading from the shop to the passage, broken open, and an iron till, behind the counter broken open; there was nothing in there that night.</p>

               <p>Q. On searching the counting-house, did you observe any thing else - A. A quantity of bills were taken out of the cash-box, and thrown over the floor, I missed none of them. On the table, under the iron chest, I observed a great quantity of tallow dropped.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you go to this room before the windows were open, could you see - A. Yes; There is a glass door without a shutter, I can always see there without a candle, by day-light. The drops of tallow appeared as if they were dropped from a candle being held up to see into the chest, they were not there the night before, I found also a piece of candle which was not there the night before, we had none so thin. I got Ellis and Furzeman from Bow-street, we went with a search warrant to Holding's father's house, No. 7, Grafton-street, six doors from my house, it is rather a short street, we found nothing. In consequence of directions we got there, we went to Crown-street, Soho, and in Crown-street, we saw the two prisoners, it was about twelve o'clock in the day, we had been no where but to Holding's father's. Ellis took one, and Furzeman the other - we got a search-warrant, about eleven o'clock, we went to No. 71, Crown-street with the prisoners and saw the person who keeps the bottom part of the house - the officers asked, in their hearing, which was the room the prisoners lived in (I think it was Ellis) she said the front room, two pair; the officers went up with the prisoners, I followed behind, and saw Holding produce two keys and unlock the door himself, it was locked and padlocked; Ellis and Furzeman began to search the room, I stood at the door, and did not take particular notice - I saw Furzeman take a 1 l. note from a pair of trowsers which laid on the bed, I knew the note to be mine, it was in my iron chest the evening before, and I had written on it; I am confident of it. One of the officers then produced a bag from the chair, which was full of money, and was in my iron chest the evening before, there was 20 l. of silver in it. The French piece was produced at Bow-street, it was the same sort as the one I had, and the same date of the year, I know it by that, and its general appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Holding's father lived near you, did he (the prisoner) know your premises - A. I believe years ago, he was in the habit of coming for butter, but I have not seen him there lately. I have frequently seen the prisoners about the house with another person standing at the corners, I only knew them by sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARCHBOLD. Q. At what time it was done you do not know - A. No; if the chest had been broken after I got up, I should have heard it; I cannot be sure it was four o'clock - my window curtains were down - I drew one up, and saw it was getting light; the watchman was standing opposite, he leaves at five o'clock. There is a sky-light to the counting-house, there would be no occasion for a candle to examine the chest by daylight, any one may search the boxes in it without a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop quite dark - A. No; there is a light over the door, it is perfectly light in daytime, and so is the cellar; the light comes through the grating; a light would be no help to them by daylight. I sleep on the second floor, nobody sleeps on the first. I thought the money as safe as in the Bank. Mine is two houses thrown into one - there is an inner communication between them.</p>
               <p>Q. They must be adepts in house-breaking to do it - A. I had no idea that any one could break the counting-house open without being heard.</p>
               <p>Q. A drunken man could not do it - A. No; I think none of my bills were taken, but I do not know what quantity I had. I never saw Holding in my house myself. His father is a bedstead turner, and I believe a respectable man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you judge by what the flap or doors were broken with - A. By an iron crow-bar; they broke off one of the bolts. If they had been in the house overnight, and broken out, there would not have been those marks.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 30th of May I went with Furzman and Mr. Brown, to Holding's father's; in consequence of what was told us,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060045"/>we went to Crown-street, and saw both the prisoners in the street, and apprehended them. I took Holding - Wade heard what passed. I asked him where he lodged - he said he had no lodging. I said he must have a lodging somewhere - he said, No, he was out of employment, and lodged where he could. Having had previous information, we took them to No. 71, Crown-street, and saw a person in the shop below; we then went up two of stairs with the prisoners - Mr. Brown followed us - Holding produced two keys, when we came to a door which was locked and padlocked, he unlocked both the locks; I proceeded to search the room, and in a table-drawer I found this canvas bag, containing 100 l. in Bank notes - there were five 10 l., nine 5 l., and five 1 l.; also eighteen sovereigns, two half sovereigns, and eight half crowns. About that time Furzman said something which drew my attention to Wade, who was taking something from his hat. I saw Furzman take from his pockets and hat, some papers of halfpence - there were eight papers. On this Holding took a paper of halfpence out of his pocket, and put it on the table. I then searched Holding, and took from his coat pockets seven other papers of halfpence, and some loose, also 2 s. 6 d. in silver, out of his breeches pocket. I found a hat-box standing under a bedstead turner's bench, and in it a tea-caddy, filled with silver, so that part of it ran into the hat-box, it was so full - there was 69 l. 19 s. 6 d. and a half-franc, in it. Furzman found a crow-bar up the chimney, also one picklock, one skeleton, three or four latch-keys, and seven or eight door keys of different descriptions. I found three small keys, a drawer key, and a latch-keys in another part of the room, and a box with some tools that are used by turners. Holding works at that business. In the course of the day I went to Brown's premises, and next morning took the crow-bar there - the flap of the cellar appeared to be forced by a crow-bar, and this fitted the marks; I fitted it with the marks, they corresponded; I tried both ends, and they corresponded with both ends. I tried the crow-bar with the lock of a door, but will not positively say it fitted. It is a common instrument of house-breaking.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go through the premises where the persons must have been - A. Yes, I could see in the counting-house by day-light without a candle. There are shutters, but a large space above them, whenever it is light out of doors you can see there notwithstanding the shutters - the prisoners gave no account of the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Holding produced the keys of the door of his own accord - A. Yes, without the least hesitation - made no resistance; we searched some time before we found the property - the crow-bar and keys were up the chimney, completely out of sight - there had been no fire lighted there since they were put there, apparently; a kettle stood there and some cinders, apparently fresh burnt - there had been a fire there lately, if these were put there before the fire was lit, the crow-bar would have appeared smokey and sooty - it is an ordinary sized one, but one claw is broader than the other, which I never saw before. I found another crow-bar on the premises, that could not have made the marks on the flap, it might have been used in opening the iron chest, or one of the doors. I never saw one that would make marks like this - it has an extra purchase; they had forced it down under the flap, so that it cut marks with the pressure, both on the flap and the cill of it - and it is fresh broken.</p>

            . I went with Ellis and Brown in search of the prisoners, I met them in Crown-street - I took Wade - we took them to No. 71, Crown-street; Ellis asked Holding where he lived, he said, he had no lodging, that he slept where he could - Wade must have heard it, as he was close to him. Ellis went into the shop and asked the people if these two men lived there - it must have been in Wade's hearing, for I was with him, and Holding must have heard it; a man came out and said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, they lived in the two pair of stairs front room;" we proceeded up stairs with them - Mr. Brown followed; Holding produced the keys, unlocked the door, and I locked it inside. I went towards the table, and saw Wade put his hands to his hat as he sat on the bed. I went to him and found four 5 s. papers of halfpence in his hat - he used a very bad expression. I searched him again, and found two more 5 s. papers in each pocket, which made eight, and in his breeches pocket which he had on, I found a 1 l. note; he said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Brown, you need not look at this, it is my property." Brown looked at it, and said he could not swear to it; there was a pair of blue trowsers on a chair close to Wade, before I searched the pockets, I asked whose trowsers they were; Wade said,</p>
               <p>"They belong to me," and in the pocket I found a 1 l. note; he said,</p>
               <p>"That is mine." I shewed it to Mr. Brown; he said,</p>

I went to the table drawers and found a phosphorus box and matches complete, and in the chimney I found the crowbar and keys, about the height of my arm up the chimney - it is a wide chimney, the bricks run up so as to make a shelf, on which they laid; there was no appearance of soot at all on them, but a little under them. I saw Ellis compare the crow with Brown's flap - it fits exactly at both ends.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found nothing on Holding - A. I saw him pull a paper of halfpence out of his pocket, and told Ellis to search him, as he (Holding) was going to mix them with what I found - they were all tied up in the same kind of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. The phosphorus box is a common one - A. Yes, working men generally use tinder boxes. The brick work in the chimney appeared to be built on purpose to put the things on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could one person do what was done to the house - A. No, two might. I found a rattle in the cupboard of their lodging. I have known them used, to draw the attention of the watchmen to another spot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WADE. Q. Did I say both notes were mine - A. Yes.</p>

            . I live at No. 71, Crown-street, Soho, and have lived there ever since the 14th of October last. On the 30th of May, Holding lodged there, and for two or three months before; Wade came backwards and forwards with him - they lived on the second floor; I lodge in the third pair front, over Holding. On the night of the 29th of May, or the 30th, between three and four o'clock, on the Sunday morning,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060046"/>I heard a noise of persons coming up stairs - it was quite light; I should suppose it was only two persons. I heard them go into the two pair front, they unlocked the door, went in, stopped a little while, then both went out again, at a few minutes past four o'clock. I came down stairs at six o'clock, the door was then locked, and padlocked. I had heard nobody else come up to the door after they went out, we have many lodgers - the street door was never fastened till after this affair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Holding lived there with his wife - A. Yes, till within a fortnight of that time, but his wife was not there then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Wade sleep there after his wife left - A. I have seen him there frequently, but cannot say he slept there. The house was very quiet, and I can swear I heard the feet of two persons, and two went out. I saw the door was locked when I came down, but did not hear them lock it.</p>

            . The prosecutor is my brother, I make up the half-pence, and should know my making up again (looks at some of the papers found on Wade) I wrapped them up in such papers as these are, I am sure of this by a dent on the corner of the paper, which I make always as a private mark, to know it again, and here are three more - (looks at those found on Holding) - here is an old halfpenny in one paper, which I remember putting in, and my mark is on the paper, they are not all done up by me, but were all packed in the same paper, which is some sheets of the Antijacobin Review, I can speak to one found on Holding, and two found on Wade, the rest are packed in the same papers, and the pages of the work correspond, it is all the same sheet, there are sixteen pages to the sheet, from 427 to 443 - it is the paper I used in folding them up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never put halfpence in that sort of paper before - A. I believe I have, and paid them away; I remember packing the one with the old halfpenny, on Monday the 28th, and remember the particular place the old halfpenny was put in, on the right side; I do not remember packing an old one before, it is flatted out just like the old one I put in.</p>

On the 29th of May, about half-past eight o'clock at night, I met Holding, and remained with him till half-past twelve, at the Black-Lion, in the Vinegar-yard; he drank very freely of gin and water and other liquors, and was insensibly drunk, I am perfectly satisfied of it, I walked with him to the top of Bridges-street, and left him there in company with a male and female, I thought him not capable of conducting himself - neither him or the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say about the other prisoner - A. They were both with me at the public-house, I left them at the top of Bridges-street at half-past twelve.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did Holding live - A. In Grafton-street; I do not know where he lived on the 29th of May; I am a licenced hawker, and live in White-Hart-yard, Drury-lane, when I am at home; I have lodged there three years; I did not drink much, as I had a bad hand, and the doctor desired me to abstain from drinking; I believe the landlord's name is Drake; he is not here; I heard he was in trouble in less than thirty-six hours after; I have been in the gallery of this Court before, but in no other way; I have been charged with assaults three or four times.</p>

            . I assisted Upton in taking Brett, at No. 9, White Horse-court, White Horse-street On the following morning, I was taking him from the watch-house to the office, and on going up Holborn, we overtook Mrs. Epps, she asked if he would take a little porter, he said, Yes; we went into a public-house, and had a pot of porter, she said,</p>
               <p>"I am sorry for you, Brett," he said,</p>
               <p>"You are are you, I suppose so." I told him it was a pity he gave himself to keep bad company, he said it was too late now; I asked why - he said he supposed the others had said enough; I asked what he thought he should get for the candlestick, he said,</p>
               <p>"I do not know, I only wish we had taken them all;" that he was equally guilty with the rest, and what they suffered, he should wish to suffer likewise.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you guess whether it was loaded - A. Yes; I found myself struck on the shoulder, it could not be a bullet, for I was struck in more than one place, it must be shot, or something of that sort, they did not lodge in my flesh; he was quite close to me, when it went off, it made my shoulder black, that was all, it did not injure me in any respect whatever; it was a kind of a horse pistol, I asked what he was about, I do not know his exact words, but I believe he said I had been a great rogue to him, I heard no shot pass me - he had been in my employ about nine months, he dismissed himself; he came and asked for money, I said I could not get it, and he summoned me - I had been arrested and could not pay him, and at this time I owed him 2 l. 17 s. 6 d.; he was most likely in great distress, he was a sober, honest man, I never noticed any thing wrong in his mind, I think he was not above three yards from me.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Shoe-lane. On the 3d of May the prisoner offered two tablespoons in pledge, about four o'clock in the afternoon. On examining them, there appeared some marks erased; I got him into a private room, and asked him how he came by them - he said he was sent to pawn them by a man, who was waiting outside. I asked the man's description - he said he was a tall man, in a blue coat; I looked out, but saw no such person. I stopped him, and told him they were stolen from the London Tavern - he made no reply. They were claimed.</p>

I did not know who he was. About the middle of the court I saw him take it quite out - the others were with him; I laid hold of him immediately, but have never seen the gentleman since - I was quite alone. The other four went on as soon as I took the prisoner, and the gentleman got out of my sight. I took him into a fruiterer's shop - he resisted very much; while I was getting my handkerchief from my pocket to tie his hands, he rushed out - I secured him again on the step, and as I took him along he threw the handkerchief down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you swear I took it - A. I do. I asked him if was marked, he said No, and it is marked C. F. 6 I live in Upper Rupert-street.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Still-alley, Houndsditch. I saw the prosecutrix - her bundle was then gone. I had a heavy load on my shoulder. She complained of being robbed of a bundle; the man was then gone up the court; I did not pursue. I had seen the prisoner pass me directly before that at the corner of Fire-ball-court, with a bundle. I knew him well before, and am certain of him. I went home, and next morning informed the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I running - A. Yes; rather swiftly. I knew where he lived.</p>
               <p>DAVID M'COMBIE. I am an officer. On the evening of the 4th of April, between seven and eight o'clock, I was on duty in Houndsditch, and was informed the prosecutrix had been robbed. I went up, and found her quite exhausted. Fire-ball-court is a dangerous place to pursue in. On the 2d of June I was in Castle-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! towards Bury-street - the prisoner came running towards me, he jumped aside, and was stopped close by Fire-ball-court.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you in your mind any persons who were likely to have stolen them - A. Yes, the day before I saw two men pass my house as I sat at dinner, about three o'clock, and as I returned from fastening the horses up at half-past four; I saw the same two men going to the field, about fifty rods from the field, they were both strangers to me, but I hear Luck worked in the neighbourhood; they noticed my dog; they did not stop, but walked on; I came up as far as Eltham; I got tidings of the horses, and went to Bromley; I found the horses at Worship-street, on the Monday following, at Nottage's stables; they were the same; I then went to Clerkenwell Prison, and saw the same two men I had seen about the field; they were among ten or twelve others, I pointed them out as the men, and am certain they are the same two men who were loitering about the field - it was the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. You never saw the persons before - A. No, Quintenden had a smock frock on, and Luck a drab coat; Quintenden had his frock on in prison, but I knew him without that, I had no conversation with them in the road; Groombridge fair was held the day before, it is above four or miles off; I am not quite certain what day the fair is held; it is common for horses to stand about the gate, but I could see where they went out at the end.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Luck managed them entirely - A.

            . I am an officer, and assisted in taking the prisoners in to custody. On Saturday, the 19th of May, a little before eleven o'clock; we went to the Basing-house, Kingsland-road, and stopped a few minutes looking about; I looked through the door into the parlour, and saw the prisoners sitting together, nobody else was in the room; we came away; I spoke to the hostler; the two horses in question were in the stable there; I did not then take them, not knowing them to be the men; Gleed and I were outside the door; Garton went into the parlour and Quintenden came out; Garton secured Luck; Quintenden was walking towards Shoreditch church; Garton called to us to take him; we walked sharp after him; he turned round and saw us, and then ran; we followed, calling Stop thief! he was stopped about two hundred yards off, without my losing sight of him; he had a coat on which I produce, it had some white horse hairs on the flaps, which he would have from riding a grey horse; I found a steel on him, and there appears to have been some tinder in the end of his handkerchief; I took him back to the public-house, and told him we took him on suspicion of stealing two horses; Luck was there; I heard no answer made; I went to the stable, and took the horses to Nottage's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He had a dark coat on - A. Yes, he was coming out of the tap-room, I think he saw me; I think he had a smock frock on over his coat; I did not take the coat off till I got to the office.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the Basing-house, and stood at the gate, while Attfield and Gleed went down the yard, I went into the house, and just as I got inside the door, I met Quintenden with a smock frock on - I turned his frock aside, and saw what sort of coat he had on; I said,</p>
               <p>"You have brought two horses here this morning," he said,</p>
               <p>"No; I did not, the man in the parlour brought them." I jumped into the parlour, saw Luck, and said,</p>
               <p>"You have brought two horseshere this morning;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have" - Gleed came in, I told him to pursue the other, he was brought back in about four minutes. When we got to the yard of the lock-up house, I was going to put them in separate places, Luck said,</p>
               <p>"Let us both be together, and we will tell you where we brought the horses from, and who we brought them for;" they both said they brought them from a place between Maidstone and Chatham, but they did not know the name of the place, or the person they belonged to; this was a conversation between them, both spoke - I locked them up together, Quintenden's coat then had a great many grey hairs on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was it - A. A little before eleven o'clock in the morning. I told Quintenden my business the moment I saw him; both said they neither knew the parish or place they brought them from; Luck said Quintenden had been with him for a fortnight, they were very anxious to tell their story, and Quintenden said I am sorry for it. I took a pocket-book from his coat pocket, but Luck was wearing it at the time, and had it on when he was apprehended, but Quintenden now has it on at the bar.</p>

               <p>"We came together, and let us be together" - I do not know who spoke first, but one of them said, they took the horse on Friday night, about eleven o'clock, out of a field between Chatham and Maidstone, Luck said, that in the pocketbook, I should find the name of the person they were to take the horses to in London, there was</p>

I have the front room, up stairs; the prisoner lodged in the same room; I lost my watch on the morning of the 31st of May, he had gone out very early in the morning; I missed it from the chair when I got up, it was silver; I have had it ten years, and gave 5 l. for it; it had a steel chain. He never returned, he had lodged there three weeks, and did not say he was going - I found him the same day at High-gate, in custody with the watch.</p>

About half-past three o'clock in the morning, I was going down Highgate-hill, the prisoner came towards me, in a direction from Hadley; I stopped him, and searched him, and found the watch in his waistcoat pocket - he could not tell the maker's name; I asked where he came from, he said, from Barnet, about three o'clock - I said, that was impossible; and I was sure he had stolen it, and gave him in charge; I found it belonged to Bowers.</p>

On Wednesday morning, the 23d of May, about noon, the prisoner was standing at the door, looking at the things. I asked her to walk in, and she did, and enquired for some puse velvet - I found I had none; she then asked to see some silk shawls, I shewed her a variety - she stood at the counter; she made choice of three silk shawls - they were put on the shelf; she then asked to see some muslin, I shewed her some, she told me to cut off five yards, which I did. While I was looking for the muslin, I saw her put her handkerchief over a silk shawl, and put it into her arms, the handkerchief covering it. She then asked to see some stuff, which I shewed her; she desired me to cut nine yards, which I did; she then said she was going further, and would call as she returned, and my young man should carry the things for her to Fleet-street, and her aunt would pay for them. She was going out, I followed her to the door talking about different things; she went as far as the next house. I then told her I wanted to speak to her - I found the shawl in her handkerchief; an officer was sent for, who took a scarf from her pocket, which was on my counter when she came into the shop. I had shewn her a variety of scarfs; the shawl cost me 2 l. to sell again; the scarf cost me 1 l. - I have valued it at 10 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Which of you is lesse - A. My partner, the rent is paid by the firm. The handkerchief covered the shawl; she must have known she had it - it is a yard and a quarter square. It could not be a mistake, I saw her do it. The scarf is two yards long and half a yard wide.</p>

I live in the one pair back room, and let the rest out - the street door was kept latched. On returning, I found my door was locked, but the window open - it lets into the yard. I believe I had left it closed, and shut it close a quarter of an hour before I went out. I missed a handkerchief and great coat; the prisoner lived in the house, and occupied the kitchen. I saw the things again the same night, concealed under the cieling of the wash-house - they were worth 15 s.</p>

I was informed the prosecutrix was robbed - I went there; the prisoner came home about eight o'clock, and I asked him how he came to take Mrs. Jackson's things - he denied it, but soon after said, I should find them under the bulk in the wash-house; he shewed me where they were; the window was eight or nine feet from the ground. I questioned him about the handkerchief - he denied it at first, but afterwards took me to a house in George-street - he went in and brought it out to me.</p>

Soon after, another woman came up, and asked me to pay 1 s. for the room also, but without giving me time to take out the money, the woman I first went with, took me by the neck, and pulled me backwards; the other woman held me by the throat, and stopped my mouth. I pushed towards the window, and found it was too fast down to throw it up; they threw me against the posts of the bedstead, the others stopped my mouth; the prisoner held me and cut my pocket off, with a pocket knife, and cut my finger in doing it. I had five half-crowns and 6 s. in that pocket, after I had paid them. I had 22 s. when I went into the house - I gave her 2 s. They then all three ran away, leaving me in the house. I ran down after them and called for assistance, the watchman came up and took me to the watch-house. I saw the prisoner there two days after, and am sure she is the woman, I picked her out from five or six others; she denied it, and said,</p>
               <p>"You never saw me," I said,</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 30th of May, about eleven o'clock at night, the prosecutor was brought to the watch-house, by a watchman, and said, he had been robbed and ill used in a house at the back of the George, public-house, George-yard; his hands were bleeding, and his handkerchief torn off his neck; there was a pane of glass fresh broken in the top room of the house, (which is the first floor), and some glass on the ground - I did not know whether it was done with that or not - his fob pocket appeared to have been torn; he said, it was cut with a knife. I went to the house directly, but nobody was there - I told him not to make a noise in the neighbourhood, but to meet me at the watch-house some other evening - he came to the watch-house on the evening of the 1st of June, before ten o'clock - I took him with me into two or three houses by the spot where he was robbed, where there was a quantity of prostitutes - he did not fix on any. I then took him to the watch-house, and went out alone, and brought in four girls; the prisoner was one, he immediately identified her, and said, what part she took in it - I found no knife or money on her; the house is in a very dark situation, I think I could not distinguish a person's features there at half-past nine o'clock without a light.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The girl called me to fetch the beer, which I did, and went home directly; he told my mother if he had 2 l. he would not appear.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my box is in Crown-street, about one hundred yards from where the prosecutor was robbed; I observed a man run from me, in a direction from that spot, with his hat in his hand, he was of the prisoner's height, and ran as fast as he could; I thought there was something wrong, went out of my box, and heard a woman calling in a low voice, Stop him! I sprung my rattle, and went after him, down Circus-street, without waiting for her; a number of people came out, hearing the alarm; I could not see the person; I came back out of a court, the prosecutor stood there with some people; the prisoner came up, she said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man who robbed me!" I laid hold of him; the shawl was not found; she was positive to him, and I thought, by his size, that he resembled the man who ran by my box.</p>

I declare before God and you, I am innocent of stealing this watch; in the beginning of May, I met a young man whom I knew some time ago, and who used to call on me to procure him a situation when I was in business; by accident I met him on the second or third of May; I had not seen him for two or three years, he said, he had been abroad most of that time, and expected to go again; we talked on different subjects, and he being a trifle in my debt before he left the country, I asked him to lend me two or three pounds; he said, he could not, but would call on me in the evening; I said, I had got a bed for a few nights at the Compasses; he said, he knew the house, and had slept in every room there, a few years ago; I described my room as having two steps to go into it; he said, he knew it; when I returned in the evening, I asked the landlord if a young man had been, he said No; I went to bed, and next morning he came up into my bed room, and sat down on the prosecutor's bed; we conversed together; he said, he was sorry he could not lend me the money, but if I met him in Percy-street, Bedford-square, he would oblige me; he got up, and said he had to go to Pentonville; I said, I would walk with him if he waited while I dressed; he said, he was in a hurry, and wished me good morning; I afterwards went and met him; he said, he was sorry he could not oblige me, but would pawn his watch; I said, I wished for no such thing; he gave it me, and said, he wished me to pawn it, as he wanted money himself, and told me to ask for 4 l., which I did; they would only give me 2 l.; I returned, and gave him the ticket; he gave me 1 l., and the ticket, and said, as he was going to leave England, it would be useless to him; I have lived in great credit; have been in business; and had the honour of serving four Sheriffs of this city,</p>

Twelve months; the prisoner's salary was to be left to our option at the end of the year; he was to be remunerated the same as two other servants, according to the value we set on their services; he did not have a percentage on what he sold, nor guarantee ns twenty percent on bad debt; he has entered the cloth as sold to Harris; the credit has not yet expired.</p>
               <p>Q. To what extent has he got orders for you in the course of the year - A. Perhaps 5,000 l.; I do not know but what there were many customers whom we never saw.</p>
               <p>Q. This conversation was on the 26th of April; he did not then deliver you a written account of the affairs with the house claiming an account with you - A. He delivered an account the following day; said there was deficiences, and those were the amount of them, he was charged on the day pervious with receiving monies, which he had not accounted for; we had then only discovered a deficiency<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060059"/>of 15 l.; I suspected from his manner there were other deficiences, and asked if there was more, he said yes, and asked if it was 50 l.; he said, yes, and more; I asked if it was 100 l.; he said, yes more; I said, is it 150 l.; he made no reply; he stated, that he had been tempted to it through the persuasion of his brother, to whom he gave the first 50 l. of his deficiency.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your application to him to settle accounts with the house - A. It was to ascertain where, and from whom the deficiency originated; Mr. Edenborough did not press him for security in my presence - I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you prepared to swear whether you yourself pressed him for security - A. I have asked if he could give security.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you, he had an acceptance of Mr. Elphics in his pocket, for 215 l., and if you gave him a statement of claims on the house, he would give you that as security - A. He said he had a bill of 215 l. but did not say by whom it was accepted, and said, he would settle our claim, but not that he would give us the bill.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you propose to settle with him merely as a clerk - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Were not instructions given to Messrs. Adams and Tillyard to draw up an agreement in such a manner as that he should not be a partner when you entered the firm - A. He proposed that he should have a per centage on what goods he sold; instructions were given to prepare an agreement to that effect, but Mr. Tillyard stated that it would make him a partner. We had the opinion of counsel, who agreed with Mr. Tillyard, and the prisoner was called into the counting-house, and told distinctly, that that agreement was done away with. We probably might have rewarded him in proportion. It was not agreed to, but left entirely to us.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he sell goods to old or new customers - A. To both, but mostly to old ones. If the agreement had been entered into, he was to have two and a half per cent.; his deficiency exceeding that amount four times; according to his own account he is 457 l. deficient, and he has received about 130 l. from the firm as wages, as he wanted it. He did not produce Elphic's bill to me, but Mr. Elphic demanded it at the Mansion-house, saying, that the prisoner got it from him wrongfully.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Do you know Gilbert, of Shoreditch - A. Yes; he is a customer. He observed to me that it was a pity to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not reply, that if you did not prosecute and convict him, he would take all the trade away to another house - A. I think I did.</p>

            ; we live in Queen-street; the prisoner was our servant or town traveller; he collected orders, and received money due to us. Povall was a customer of ours; we lent him 15 l. on the 12th March; I have never been paid that money; I told the prisoner to collect it several times, about a fortnight after I lent it; and when he came into the counting house I have said,</p>
               <p>"Povall has not paid that 15 l., he is a regular man, he borrowed it for a week, and it is now a fortnight, I wish you would call for it." He said,</p>
               <p>"He is a very good man, I wish to make a more important customer of him, I will notice it, and bring it you shortly." In about another week I spoke again about it; he said I had better give him the I O U, and he would call to-morrow. I asked him after that about it, and he said, he would bring it to-morrow. He never said, he had received it till I charged him with it, which was about the 24th of April; he then changed colour, and said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Bartlett, I will walk a little way with you." He walked out with Mr. Bartlett.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. He has been four years with you - A. Between three and four. Our firm changed about twelve months ago, and our present servants are subject to a fresh arrangement; the prisoner was to be rewarded at the end of the year according to the value we estimated his services at; before that he had a salary; there never was a specific agreement. He had been about two years and quarter with us. I proposed that he should have 400 l. for that. He was not satisfied, and I said, I will make it 450 l. and call it a year and a half, and gave him 450 l. His sales during the last year may amount to between 5000 l. and 8000 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not repeatedly told him if he wanted money, to take it, and charge himself with it, without asking - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Refer to your book and say what money he received for you in April - A. I cannot say what he received himself, as sometimes customers called and paid at the house; I believe he did receive some money in April, but I really will not swear that he himself paid me any money in April.</p>
               <p>Q. When you called him to account about this, did you not press him for security - A. Certainly not; I never heard a word about security; if he had offered it I would not have accepted it. He paid me nothing on account of Povall; he flatly denied having received it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what time was he to make up his accounts - A. Every day, on coming home, he was to deliver me an account and the money.</p>

            . The prisoner never accounted to me for this money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How much cash did he render to you after the 15th of April - A. The cash transactions are entirely under Mr. Edenborough's direction; he never gave me any money.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he meet you about these transactions - A. On the 26th of April. On the 27th he gave me a written account; this 15 l. was among it. He was never told to take money whenever he wanted it, nor was he to lend money to customers without Mr. Edenborough's leave.</p>
               <p>Q. Would he not have to lay out money for his expences - A. No. If he met a customer, and took a glass<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060060"/>of ale with him, and mentioned it, we should order it to be paid out of the petty cash.</p>
               <p>Q. You told Mr. Gilbert that unless you prosecuted him, your trade would all go to another house - A. Since my last examination I have recollected myself; the substance may be the same. I stated that we were bound to prosecute him for the good of the public; and if he was let at large, he would do us all the injury he could; and that he had abilities to do it. I said he was a most excellent salesman, and so I say now.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he make any disclosure to you till the 28th of April - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was not my intention to say any thing, but I shall not do justice to my character, unless I do - I entered the service in 1817, from a respectable situation; I was to have a per centage on what I did; it did not turn out as I expected, and I found, scarce any thing entered, but what orders I got myself, I was at a great expence in obtaining customers, paying for refreshment, and so on. I represensted my disappointment to Mr. Edenborough, who certainly behaved honourably to me; he told me to go on with my exertions, and I should not be disappointed - we never came to a settlement till last July, I supplied myself with money from my friends. In July, Mr. Edenborough said</p>
               <p>"Gooden, here is so and so, your sale is so much;" I said, I should be a considerable loser, if I had no more, as I had incurred a debt of 300 l. with my friends, he said, he could give no more, and I left the service for about ten days, they sent to know my terms, I reduced them to writing; Mr. Edenborough said he could afford me only two per cent; I am certain I have sold 15,000 l. worth of goods, and there was a considerable balance coming to me - I can prove I was in the habit of lending customers money to take up bills with, as they did not like to apply to the principals, not knowing them - my expences have been 10 s. or 15 s. a day, and Mr. Bartlett has been round with me, and paid those expences; his motives were strictly honourable - I cannot call persons to say I have lent them money to take up bills, as it is a delicate thing - I met Mr. Bartlett on this business, and sent him an account of the matter; I was asked if I had received this 15 l., I said, I had, and I was to make out an account and pay it over; they said, they had a particular reason for not making out an account of my commission, and I cannot settle without it - they wanted security for it, but I was not prepared at that moment, and they introduced an officer.</p>
               <p>- GILBERT. I am a tailor, and live in Shoreditch. Mr. Bartlett called on me and said, the prisoner was an excellent servant, and if he was not prosecuted, he might be a great injury to their house.</p>

On the 2d of May, about half-past seven o'clock, I went to the Fortune of War, public-house; Morgan sat down and went to sleep, I stood up in the room, and saw Buckle's hand down at his right hand breeches pocket. I awoke him, and asked him to feel his pockets, he felt and said,</p>
               <p>"I have lost my money, I have been robbed in this house;" the prisoners were cracking nuts together. Morgan said, if they would give up the money, he would say nothing; Turner said, I was a scoundrel for saying such a thing against a modest woman like her. Morgan went for an officer; I put my foot against the door, and said, Nobody should go out without being searched. Turner insisted on going, and went out - Buckle did not offer to go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they in house before you - A. I cannot say, for I was rather intoxicated - Morgan was sober. He paid me no money that night, there was some conversation about it before he got to the house; he said he would pay me when he got there. I sat down by the fire-place next to Morgan. The pot-boy and I had a few words about an hour before the robbery. Morgan was in the room then, he was asleep when I was turned out - I was not out ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Turner run into the street to go away - A. He went towards the street, and came back with another soldier, he was in his regimentals. The prosecutor was asleep when I went out and when I returned.</p>

On the 13th of May, about twelve o'clock at night, I was alarmed by the dog barking - I sleep in the house.

               <p>"Here are the carpenters coming," supposing they had come to call us up; he said,</p>
               <p>"Master, it is robbers and thieves." (I could not distinguish by the voices, that it was more than one person) I told him to go down stairs, and I would meet him at the bottom; but while we were going down, they escaped out of the window. On getting down, I found two windows broken open, which I am quite sure were fastened over night, by shutters and a bar across. I found the shutters of one window open, and the glass taken out; a man could then undo the fastening, and enter the house - it was all secure when I went to bed at ten o'clock. I went out, and found they had broken the carpenter's shop open - it is about twelve yards from the house; I found nobody and went to bed again. The prisoner had worked as a carpenter for Mr. Byng two years before, and was acquainted with the place. The house is about 300 yards from Mr. Byng's dwelling-house, and enclosed with it by the park wall - it is all in the farm-yard, and is the farm house. I sleep there as bailiff, merely as his servant - I have no tenancy in it.</p>

               <p>"Chiltern," who was to come that morning. I found the prisoner holding a stick over my head - I knew him before; my watch hung over my head - it was moon-light, and there are no shutters to the room. I am certain of him, he said,</p>
               <p>"Hush," and asked if I had any money, I said, No; another man was with him. When I said, I had no money, the other man said,</p>
               <p>"Take and tie him;" the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"No, we won't tie him, he seems to be quiet, we won't touch him." Then they asked me if any body was in the next apartment, I said, No; the other man took a few halfpence out of my waistcoat pocket - my breeches were under my head, they did not feel for them. I saw the prisoner reach his hand over my head, and take my watch; he then said to the other man,</p>
               <p>"Do you go down stairs, and tell the others to keep back." I had no conversation with the other man - they both went out, the prisoner following him. Dumble came to me, and we went into the yard, but could not find them. They had taken two panes of glass out, which was entire when we went to bed; they could then undo the fastening - it was a casement window, that must be the way they entered. I had known the prisoner about a year, he lived about half a mile off, and had worked at Mr. Byng's with me. I declare on my oath he is the man. I have never found my watch - it was silver, and it is worth 40 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You have not seen me for upwards of two years - A. No; not till that night. I had not seen him for a year together then; he had not lived in the neighbourhood for the last two years. I am certain of him, we were quite intimate together when he worked at Mr. Byng's. The moon was nearly full.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not work there above four months - A. No, I saw him at Mr. Byng's, and in the neighbourhood for a year together. They were about four minutes in the room after I awoke. I recollect his voice and features too.</p>

On the 12th of June, about a quarter past four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoners came to the shop together; one of them asked to see some Italian net; they both looked at it and did not like the colour, and wished to see another. I shewed them three more pieces; they would not suit. They then asked to look at some satins; I shewed them two or three - they did not suit. They then asked to see some Persian of the same colour; I shewed them two pieces - they would not do (I had been watching them particularly all the time). They then said, they would look at some white Persian, and bought three-eighths of a yard, which came to 9 d. One of them observed, that was a handsome shawl which one of the men was shewing, and asked the price - I said, two guineas, and shewed them some other shawls. Every thing I had shewn them remained on the counter. I opened one or two shawls out, they thanked me for my trouble, and said, perhaps they would buy another time. I observed Williams hold up the end of the shawl as if to conceal the actions of the other. I took 1 s. for the Persian, and went to the end of the shop for change - I returned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060064"/>and gave them 3 d. I believe Williams bought the Persian. They then left the shop - I missed nothing, but went after them on suspicion. Williams was following the other out, but had not got out - Knight was just out of the door. I saw my fellow-servant bringing her back, and a piece of silk drop from her (Knight). He said to her</p>
               <p>"Stop, I believe you have something which does not belong to you;" and as she returned at the threshold of the door, the silk dropped from under her cloak; there were twenty-five yards of it - it is worth above 5 l. - it cost between 6 l. and 7 l. Williams wished to go, saying, she had nothing to do with it. They both inspected all the goods.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Has Mr.

             the whole of the house - A. Yes; I found Williams had left her Persian behind, it might have been dropped by accident - I found it in the place where she sat - it is common for people to go shopping together - Knight had a large cloak, which concealed it all, and took it with the roller.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutors. I saw the prisoners come in together, (they had been there together the day before), Salthouse was shewing them goods - I saw Knight rolling up the silk, which was about a yard undone - they looked at the goods, and while he was shewing the shawl to Williams, I was watching, and saw Knight take the roll of silk - I left the counter on the opposite side to them, and went towards the door; Knight passed me, and as soon as she got outside the door, I told her I believed she had something which did not belong to her; she said, she had not - I brought her into the shop, and about a yard in the roll of silk, dropped from under her cloak; I picked it up, and she was stopped. Williams was coming out at the moment I laid hold of Knight; she was stopped, and asked what was the matter - I took them both to Marlborough-street, and on our return, found Williams's Persian on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the way Williams held the shawl up - A. It was unfolded, she held it about the middle, as if to help fold it up; it naturally took Salthouse's view off Knight - the silk cost 5 s. 6 d. per yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What size was the shawl - A. A yard and half wide, and nearly three yards long - it was extended at full length, there was nothing unusual in her manner of holding it - I should have thought nothing of it, had I not suspected them.</p>

On the 12th of May, between four and five in the morning, I stopped the prisoner on Dock-hill, with a bag; I asked what was in it; he said, his working tools, and that he was a mason, and worked at the London Dock Basin. I took him there; they did not know him; he shewed me the spot where he said he had worked; they said he never worked there. On his way to the office he said he did not steal them, but gave a black man 10 s. for them.</p>

I secured them; Delamore was very loth to come out, and kept shoving up the shavings there, as if to conceal something; I looked under them, and found a bag and a handkerchief full of new nails, and an apron with some, making three parcels. I took them to the watch-house, and told Mr. Parker.</p>

I then asked Delamore how he came to steal them - he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060065"/>" That boy stole all the nails," (meaning Pocock). Then Pocock said, he did fetch them from the place, and Delamore sent him for them, and he was going to sell them in Gee's-court.

On the 29th of May, about eight o'clock in the morning, while I was talking to Mr. Gosling, a pawnbroker in Shoreditch, the prisoner came to pawn this saw - I asked, if it belonged to him - he said, it did; that he, was a cabinet-maker, and had worked some time with it. I detained him. He then said, he picked it up in Finsbury-market that morning, and afterwards that he found it in a cart.</p>

            , of Church-street, Spitalfields. On the 23d of May, he sent me to receive 7 l. 18 s. 6 d., from Mr. Wilcox - I received it, and was returning home, about eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner with my fellow apprentice, and two more boys - Smith, my fellow apprentice, called me over, and asked if I had got the money, I said, Yes; but I was paid all in gold - he asked what gold, I said, seven guineas and a half; he asked me to let him see a guinea, for he never saw one - I gave it to him, and he asked the prisoner to lend him a pin, to match with it, to see if it was gold - he gave him the pin, and asked him to let him see the guinea, he snatched it out of Smith's hands, with the pin, and ran away towards Whitechapel; he brought it back, after running about eighteen yards, and asked the other lads if they would go to regulars - he did not produce the guinea, they said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, Yes" and all three ran away - I was going after them, and Smith stopped me, and said, he was sure they would bring it back; I waited half an hour, and they did not, I have never seen it since - I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Smith put it in my hand, to see if it was gold, I turned round in a joke, not intending to keep it, and came back; he said,</p>
               <p>"I thought you was going to keep it, you are welcome;" I ran a little way, and dropped it in a puddle, and could not find it.</p>

On the 12th of May, between four and six o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in and had a glass of beer in the lobby, drank a little, then put it down, and asked me to change an old shilling for a new one, as he wanted to make a present of it. I drew my till out, found I had none, shut it, and took a bag out of my desk, in which there was six half crowns and some odd silver. I turned the silver out on the counter, and as I was sweeping it back into the bag, I missed four half crowns - it was not out of the bag a minute; nobody but him was near enough to take it; a man came in and stood behind him, but could not reach it. I was pushing the money about, and he pushed it about too, to look for a new shilling, and I suppose slipped them up his arm; if they had dropped I must have heard it. I charged him with taking them, and heard them fall from his right arm into his right-hand coat pocket. I lifted up the hatch, and laid hold of him and the other man, and called for assistance - the other man pushed me on one side and ran out. I held the prisoner fast, and took the four half crowns out of his pocket. He was taken into custody, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n the woman, what does she want more, she has got her half crowns" - he produced no shilling to me.</p>

             of Southall; we went into the Blue-coat Boy, public-house; he paid me 17 l. 10 s. for them, he gave me two 10 l. notes; I gave him three 1 l. notes, and he gave four half crowns, and put his name and address on them. I had a 5 l. note of my own, I put his notes in with it, in my memorandum book. I then had 25 l. I parted with him, came down St. John-street, and met a man whom I knew - we went into this house; I had two half crowns before, which made six. I had a glass of gin with a master milkman, and gave the lady a half crown to change - she gave me 2 s., one was very black, I asked her to change it; she pulled out thirty-five or forty shillings - I said, I wanted a newer one; she ran her hand into my pocket, and took four half crowns out, and left one in. When the officer was fetched, he took my pocket-book, and would not open it before a respectable person, but I declare there was 25 l. in it, and when he returned it to me at the watch-house, it was empty. I said,</p>
               <p>"Where is my money?" he said, there was none in it. I said,</p>
               <p>"You are a pretty fellow to rob me so;" he brought up some shabby fellow, who said he had not opened it. He has robbed me of 25 l., and the man who paid it me, is here to prove it. The master milkman is Smith of Compton-street, Goswell-street.</p>

Having information, I set a watch outside my door to inform me when any one came to the house. On the 30th of May, at ten o'clock at night, the bell rung - I went out, and found Samme running across the yard - I asked where she was going, and what was the matter - she said, it was only a friend come to see her. I went into the servants' sitting-room, by the door where she came from, and found Ballard sitting there in the dark, eating. I told her to bring a light, which she did, and on looking round, I found a bundle on the floor - I asked him what it was - he said, it was given him for Mary - I opened it, and found a dirty shirt, a pair of stockings, and two empty bottles - he said the shirt and stockings came from James (Mr. Stringer's coachman, of Enfield). for Mary, and the bottles he knew nothing of, but they did not come from James - I had them taken into custody. The officer searched Samme's box, but found nothing. Next morning we went to Ballard's premises at Enfield, with a search-warrant - he said he lived there, and his wife and family were there. I found a plated inkstand, a Delft butter-boat, and some pieces of carpet in the room his wife was in. I do not know that I had seen the inkstand for twelve months before; the carpet had been locked in the store-room, and was merely cuttings; I might not have seen them for six or eight months. Samme lived two years with us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRRICK. Q. She ran from the yard - A. No; from the anti-room into the kitchen - the door opens into the stable-yard. Ballard had come in at the kitchen gate, and the anti-room is close by. Samme had no light in her hand. The shirt and stockings were not mine, but I knew the bottles by the corks - they were empty - the marks were on when it came from the merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Barnes char at your house - A. Yes, I understand some pieces of carpet were given to her, but not these, they were smaller.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Walters. I know Mrs. Walters gave Mrs. Barnes some pieces of carpet - it might be eight or ten months ago, when we were cleaning the house down - they were in the store-room - she said Mrs. Barnes might have them, or we might do as we liked with them. I remember some of these produced were among them (pointing them out).</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to swear that that piece was was given to Barnes - A. Yes.

I followed her out and secured her three doors off, and took them out of her apron - she went into fits, and made a sad piece of work.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Newman. On the 6th of June, when my master was out, the prisoner came and asked if my master had cut the glass - I said, I knew nothing about - he went to the place, took three pieces - he measured them and said, they were three feet and a half, and took them away.</p>
               <p>Mr. NEWMAN. I saw him next morning in Cranbourne-alley, and took him. He said, he had sold it for 2 s. - he had said nothing to me about any glass when he called - he had worked for me for five days about six months ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got a job and wanted three squares, and called there - she said, there was none in the binn. I went and found three, and told her to tell Mr. Newman I would pay in the morning. I met him in Ryder's-court, and told him I would pay him, but he would prosecute.</p>
               <p>MR. NEWMAN. I never gave him credit - I said, I would prosecute the first man I found out.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 26th of May, about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, I was in Whitecross-street, and saw the prisoner about six hundred yards from these stables, with a bag on his back. I watched him up a court - he knocked at a door - a naked child opened it. One Tee, who keeps a horse and cart, lives there. I asked what he had there - he said corn; that he worked for a corn-chandler close by, and brought it from there. I said,</p>
               <p>"Take it up, and go to the place." When he got in the street, he said he was Smith's hostler, and brought it from him, and begged I would let him go - it was oats, beans, and chaff. I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060076"/>him to Mr. Smith, who asked, how he could do it - he said he took it from the granary.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Were you set to watch - A. No - he did not say they were not his master's, or that they were his perquisites.</p>

            . The bag is not mine - I asked how he could be so ungrateful as to rob me - he said, he took it out of the granary - he never pretended that he had a right to them - he had been eight years with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you settle with him - A. I deliver him three bushels at a time, and he is to pay me for it. If horses go away without eating their corn, I do not allow it him - I never gave him leave to take any - I expect him to pay me for the corn whatever he makes of it. If I receive the amount of the corn I am satisfied.</p>

She asked, if I knew of a lodging - she said she was in trouble, having lost her place on Wednesday, and was one night at a watch-house, and the next at a coffee-shop, in George-street; that she was very hungry, and had nothing to pawn but the pelisse on her back; and as she was never at a pawnbroker's, in her life, would I do it - I went and pawned it for 2 s., and she bought some victuals with it - I went with her to her mistress's door, for her to beg to be taken back.</p>

               <p>"nothing" I took him into a public-house, and took this muslin from under his jacket; he said, he found it - I left him in charge, and went to look for Austin; and saw her and Davis sitting in Mr. Benstead's shop, in Little Bath-street; I took her, she asked Davis</p>
               <p>"What does this mean" - I took them both, and on coming out, Davis said to Austin,</p>
               <p>"I am afraid he is taken;" I found nothing on Davis, and discharged her - she followed us to Hatton-garden, and was taken - Benstead's shopman claimed the muslin.</p>

Above twenty-five years; I never agreed to give him a per centage on the customers he introduced; I engaged him in December 1818 to travel; he was to have 20 s. per week, and 20 s. per day for travelling expences; I have his books here, he gave them to me to arrange; he objected to give me one book; I apprehended him on the 5th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when you first engaged him - A. I took him quite against my friends' consent, and my brother particularly objected, and I said to him,</p>
               <p>"I don't wish my brother to know you are with me; but if he finds it out, tell him I allow you a commission," but I did not; I have received about 1300 l. from him; he was not in the habit of giving me money without saying who he received it of - he never claimed any money as due to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving a sum from Mr. Locker, of Northfleet, which was not entered - A. Perfectly well, the prisoner kept the book, therefore I could not enter it; I never said, he had not paid me Mr. Locker's money; I have a clerk, named Edwards, who has robbed me - I have released him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I agreed to have 10 per cent. commission on country orders, and 5 per cent on town; I travelled for his brother fifteen years; I have a wife and ten children who I brought up in the paths of honesty.</p>

About four o'clock I saw the prisoner go down behind some new buildings without anything, he came back soon after with these things on his shoulder, and was stopped; a chissel was found on him at the watch-house, which corresponds with the marks on the shed door - he said, it was his.</p>

            . I am constable of Pancras. I know Richard Holt by seeing him on this occasion. On Saturday the 21st of April, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I was going up Oxford-street, and saw the prisoners in a gang of seven, and pointed them out to Cooper, and desired him to watch them, and I watched myself - they turned into <placeName id="t18210606-185-crimeloc1066">Bond-street</placeName>

                  Richard

            , and I saw Corbett following him. I saw Corbett take a pocket-book out of Holt's pocket, and give it, I think, to Hutchins. I saw it pass between them, and I think Hutchins took it; he was close to Corbett; Wyatt was obstructing Holt in his way at the time; I saw Hutchins make a motion, as if he was putting something under his coat. I was on the opposite side of the way, and had been watching them for two hours. The rest of the party then joined them, and they all went down Brook-street, except one, who continued leaning on a post, looking at the gentleman; that was neither of the prisoners. As soon as I could, I ran to the gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060081"/>and told him he was robbed. He said, he was not; but felt and missed his pocket-book - he went into a shop, and I declined following them till I got his address. I then went immediately and got further assistance - I went in search, but could not find them. I took them on the Monday, in the act of picking pockets - I waited in Bond-street, and saw them come into the street together - Fowler and Saunders were with me. I pointed them out. - Fowler took Wyatt; Saunders took Corbett; Hutchins turned away down the street - I followed and took him. We found nothing on them - they were taken to the office - I am certain they are the men. Holt appeared against them as the person robbed, and described himself as 
               <persName id="t18210606-185-person1838">
                  Richard

            . When I took Hutchins, he asked what I wanted, and what use was it my going to tell the swell - he said, it was of no consequence, it was only for an attempt, and he could get bail for 1000 l. I took him at that time in the act of attempting a gentleman's pocket. I saw Holt's pocket-book taken plainly; it was a red book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HONE. Q. There were seven of them - A. Yes; sometimes together and sometimes apart - a great many people were passing - I think three of them were dressed in blue and another in green. I knew the prisoners before personally, and cannot be mistaken. I have been beat about by several gangs, and did not think two persons sufficient to take them - I went on Monday prepared for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How came you to know Holt's Christian name - A. He appeared by the name of Richard. I went after them the instant I got his address.</p>

On the 21st of April I was with Colton, and saw the prisoners and three or four more, and watched them from Oxford-street - I think they were there half an hour. They then went into Bond-street. I saw Corbett follow a gentleman, who I afterwards found to be

             - I was on the opposite side of Bond-street, and saw them there for half an hour; I then saw Corbett go behind Holt, take a red pocket-book out of his pocket, and give it to Hutchins - I believe it was taken from the outside pocket; the other four were close round surrounding them. Wyatt was just before Holt; I had observed them together all the time. Colton said it would not be safe to apprehend them, so we went and told the gentleman - he felt and missed his pocket-book - they went down Brook-street - one of the four remained, leaning on a post at the corner of Brook-street. I am certain of their persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HONE. Q. Are you a constable - No; I met Colton promiscuously, as I was going to St. Anne's-street on business; we walked up Oxford-street; he pointed them out, and told me to watch. I am not in the habit of accompanying him. I passed and re-passed them several times, and saw their faces. I am positive Corbett took the pocket-book. We watched them above two hours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Do you ever find your way to Chancery-lane of an evening - A. I sometimes go to chambers to bail above, for a lawyer in Gray's-inn. I do not stand there - I am not in the habit of bailing people. I think I could pick out all the seven men. I may have given bail four or five times in my life; I never go before the Judge, nor do I swear. I was never rejected.</p>

I left him with Mr. Mullett's porter, and went over to Wadmore's. They searched the books, and assured me nothing of the kind was ever taken in. Wadmore said nothing had been brought there but rubbish - I said,</p>
               <p>"Did you ever take in any furniture?" - he said,</p>

I went there next morning, and found the furniture of three four-post bedsteads, which were given up, and the carpet.</p>

            . I was going up Whiteheart-yard, into Drury-lane, and saw the prisoners come out of a house, and follow a gentleman all the way to Chancery-lane; the gentleman went into a house, and they stood under the Rolls gateway, and there saw Mr. Petch, and followed him along the Strand, to Newport-market. I saw Read take a handkerchief from Petch's pocket; he turned and took it from him. Jones ran away - he had been following close with Read all the way. I took Read to the watch-house, and in three quarters of an hour, I saw Jones by the New Church, in company with another, and took him. Read made so much resistance, it was a quarter of an hour before I could handcuff him.</p>

I saw them try several people's pockets, but the crowd was so great, I coud not tell whether they succeeded - I watched them till half-past ten o'clock. Ward had gone away for half an hour, and returned about half-past ten o'clock; a gentleman in black, stood opposite the box door; they went behind him, Smith put his hand in the gentleman's pocket - Ward was covering him. I saw his hand go down into the pocket, and come up with something, which he immediately shoved into his shirt - they both ran away on seeing me. I told the gentleman he was robbed, he missed his handkerchief, and followed me. I took them in Drury-lane - the gentleman was then gone. I found the handkerchief in Smith's bosom.</p>

I was by Mr. Benstead's shop, and saw the prisoner and another, as I was delivering my beer, about one o'clock - I saw them walking up and down by the shop - I returned in about five minutes, found them still there, and saw the other, who was about twelve years old, snatch the print, which was piled up on the step - they got into Warner-street, and then the boy said</p>
               <p>"You take it," and the prisoner put it in his apron - I went and told Benstead; I saw him at the office, and am certain of him - I noticed him very much.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Mann. On Friday before the 12th of June, a pair of boots were delivered to the prisoner, to take to York-place, and next morning Mr. Mann asked if he had delivered them; he said, he had, and the gentleman was going out of town, but would call before he went with further orders; the other pair were delivered him on Saturday night; I found both pair at his lodgings on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Being tired on Friday night, I could not go so far; I was afraid to say, I had not delivered them; I had no opportunity of taking them on Saturday, as I had a pair to take to St. Luke's church; Sunday I was going out and could not take them, I expected a holiday on Easter Monday, when I meant to take them, but my fellow servant had a holiday, and I could not.</p>
