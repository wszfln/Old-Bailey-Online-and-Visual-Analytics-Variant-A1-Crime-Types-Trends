We got a warrant and search'd Parnell's house , her husband went backwards into the yard and run away; in the house we found some lead old and new; in a closet we found a large quantity of pint and quart pots, squeez'd together and the names ras'd out, so that we could not tell who they belonged to, and amongst them the two pots mentioned in the indictment. They were produced in court, and depos'd to by both Buckland and Hodges, their names upon each. We took the prisoners before the Justice, there Nesbit said, she never sold any but what she sold to Parnell. Parnell said, she never bought any but what she bought of Nesbit.</p>

               <p>Dudsdon. I cannot tell that; then they chas'd me out of the street, with the cry, d - n him, kill him, altho' there were three watchmen, and two chairmen, standing at Drury-lane play-house passage at that time; the watchmen came to my assistance.</p>

            . I know Mr. Morris to be a very honest man. Mr. Warner had an action of mine against one Sadler; he and I were at Morris's house on the 24th of Nov. there he had a little supper of beef and pudding, he ask'd me to stay to supper. I came there between five and six o'clock, and said to him, this Warner has lost my prisoner, and takes no care to get him again. Mr. Morris sent for Warner, saying, he was a very good customer to him, and had been there about an hour before; he came between six and seven, and about eight we went to supper. After that Mr. Morris said, I'll go along with you to serve Mr. Warner, to take this person; there was a dispute about taking him without a constable; we went on Saltpeter-bank and watch'd for this Sadler, his time being to be out about one in the morning, he works at the glass-house, so do I: we went into the black Lion and had some beer, but what quantity I cannot tell; we were together till four in the morning.</p>

I carried him to the constable at the next door: he was carried before the justice, the justice asked him if he had any money to have paid for the buttons if he had bought them; he said he had lost it a gaming at such a house. I went to that house, he had been there, and had had only a pint of beer. When he was about to be committed, he then said he had dropped the buttons in the constable's coal box, we went and found them behind the box.</p>

I ordered my servant to knock at the kitchen door, and tell the prisoner we wanted some plates out of the kitchen; she opened the door and we burst in; I took the man in bed and charged the constable with him. I asked the girl some questions. When I got them to the watch-house, she would not give me any account of the things. I took her to a little place backwards in the watchhouse, then she said if I would discharge the man she would tell me where the things were. I went back with her home, she took me backwards, and in the necessary house she had wrapp'd the things mentioned up in rags, and tuck'd them in a hole under the stairs, which go up over the necessary.</p>

I was so frighten'd, that I could not pull off my cloaths, so he pull'd them off, the same coat and waistcoat I have now on; then he took out one of my buckles from my shoe, and look'd by the light to see if it was silver, he saw it was not, then he gave it me again; then he took a stick and beat me out of the house, and said you thief come no more in my house: so when I was in the street, I went backwards and forwards till five o'clock to watch his door.

Said the prisoner to the prosecutor, if you are an honest man you owe me ten shillings. The prosecutor said, he ow'd him not a farthing; saying, he had not been in the house five minutes. Then said the prisoner to a woman, go fetch the man's cloaths. She did, the prosecutor put them on his back. Then said the prisoner, must not I have satisfaction for the money you have had of me? said the prosecutor, I owe you nothing; said the prisoner, I will make it up very easy, you shall give me a quartern of brandy; we had a quartern of brandy, the prisoner and I drank it, the prosecutor drank none; he gave the prisoner a shilling to change, the prisoner kept it all and gave him no change.</p>

               <p>This foreigner came into my house at past one o'clock in the morning, he sat down, I was smoaking a pipe; he ask'd me if I had got any beer; I told him I had none in my house, but I would go and fetch a pot. Said he, then go and fetch two, and by the time we have drank them it will be light enough for me to go about my business. We sat about two hours, he told me, he had two pieces of India handkerchiefs, which he had left in a house at Wapping, and if I would lend him a trifle of money, he would be up in the morning and redeem his coat and waistcoat, which he would leave with me for it. He laying the case so plausible to me I gave him the money, he put it into his pocket. Then he said, could I sit down a little longer; said I, the woman is sitting up with the child, and I must go and take my rest; so he went out, and I did not see him till about nine o'clock, when he came with the watchman; then he said, where are my cloaths, they were brought down and he put them on. I ask'd him for the money before he put them on, he told me he had three half guineas just at hand, where he had left them, and that he would come and pay me; we drank a dram together.</p>

I live at the Windmill in Rosemary-lane, near Tower-hill: On Sunday night, the 17th of March the day kept as a patron to our country, I and some others were at the prisoner's house and had a dish of fish; I sat up with a child that was ill to put it to sleep, and the prisoner was up too; between twelve and one o'clock in the morning a man knock'd at the door, I thinking it was my husband, the prisoner got up to let him in; it was the prosecutor, I had the child in a blanket in my lap. He said, shipmate, let me have a pot of beer. Friend, said Mr. Bunn, I don't sell beer, but if you will have a pot, I'll send for a pot for you; he sat down. The prisoner was going for a pot, he said, you may as well bring two pots, so Mr. Bunn brought two pots in; we drank about for the space of an hour; said he, I am come from India, and have some handkerchiefs to dispose of, and if you will help me to customers, I'll make you a present. Mr. Bunn said, I want nothing of you. Said the prosecutor, if you will lend me six shillings I'll leave my coat and waistcoat, so he tied his coat up in a handkerchief, and pull'd his waistcoat off and flung it down upon the coat; as it lay on the dresser the prosecutor took a knife out of his pocket, and began to piddle with it on the bar. The prisoner said, give me that, I don't think you take it out with a good design; so he took it out of his hand and shut it up, and put it into his waistcoat pocket that lay on the bundle; saying, friend, when you have the other things you shall have the knife. Mr. Bunn said, friend, I'll freely give you the half gallon of beer, or you may call and pay me when you will. The gentleman went out between one and two o'clock, saying, I'll go for the handkerchiefs, Mr. Bunn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175104170012"/> would have had me go and lay down on the bed and not go home, but I went home.</p>

The prisoner follow'd her, and said, I would not have you be uneasy, leave somewhat that is good with us, and I'll take care of the house if she goes to bed. She staid about two or three minutes and then went down. I heard my wife crying after this, so I went down, and she was accusing the prisoner with taking the money, mentioned in the indictment, out of the bar in the back room. Gibbs fell on his knees, and wish'd he might everlastingly burn in hell flames, if ever he saw the money; and likewise took his hat, and wish'd his eyes might fall into it if ever he saw it, or knew where it was. There were three more men in the house, Mr. Corbet, Mr. Smith, and

I held him all this time, he began to pull me by the coat, and trod on my toes, and said, he wanted to speak with me; he took me out into the yard, and said, if I would never speak of it, he would tell me something to my profit. I said, if you will tell me where my money is, I'll never hurt you. Then he said, he watch'd when my wife went into the room, and he open'd the bar and took the money out, and went and carried it into his wife's green-stall, and had laid it upon an upper shelf. Mr. Smith and I went and look'd there, and found it accordingly. He was lock'd up in my house all the time.</p>

            . On the 13th of March my husband had been ill, he went to bed before nine<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175104170014"/> o'clock ; I believe the prisoner had been in the house some time before my husband went to bed, but he being in another room did not see him. He came down stairs about twelve o'clock in a great passion, and said, why don't you turn the people out of the house? I hurried him up again, and bid him not be angry, saying, I could do better with the company than he could. I went up stairs with him, and staid there about four minutes; the prisoner follow'd us to the stairs foot, and desir'd my husband would not be angry, and said, he would look after the house if my husband would trust him. I heard the door open when I was up stairs, I said, I had left them in the dark, and I must run down, I came directly; they call'd for something in the house, and I served them; there were Corbet, Smith, and another person, I don't know his name.</p>
               <p>Altham Corbet. I was in the house on the 13th of March: I had been at the White-bear in Pickadilly to supper: I attend St. George's hospital, we were going to Hydepark corner: Coming by Mr. Duncombe's house, I saw it was not shut up. I said to my acquaintance, we will go in and drink a pint of beer, and we went in; the watchman,

            , was there, and told me, he would go with me, if I would stay there till he came back again; he was going out. I staid till twelve o'clock, the prisoner was in the house before I came in: I remember Mrs. Duncombe's going up stairs to her husband, and the prisoner told her, he would take care of the house, because I was there and did not care to go home, it being late.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all the reason you had for staying?</p>
               <p>Corbet. I was playing at cards with a man that was there, and had lost a little money, and was in hopes of winning it back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of the prisoner's going backwards?</p>
               <p>Corbet. I do, for the space of two or three minutes, while Mrs. Duncombe was gone up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go out of the house after this?</p>
               <p>Corbet. I can't say I did, for I was employ'd. I remember Mrs. Duncombe coming down stairs, and asking him; if he had let any body into the house; he said, no; she said, he must have the money then. Then he wish'd as before mention'd, and she lock'd the door; he continued in this story of denying it about half an hour; Mr. Duncombe came down without his stockings, he ran about the room like a mad-man; he and the prisoner went out together into the yard, and when they return'd Mr. Duncombe said to me, you may go home for you are very safe, for Mr. Gibbs has confess'd it to me. Gibbs was then in the room, and heard it; I then said, I insist upon your prosecuting him, to Mr. Duncombe; then Gibbs fell down upon his knees, and beg'd for God's sake, I would not hang him, this was in the hearing of all the rest of the witnesses; he confess'd it before us all, saying, when Mrs. Duncombe was up stairs, he went into the bar and saw the key in the till; that he took the purse out, and did not know whether it was gold or silver.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not Duncombe say, he would give a free pardon, and a bottle of wine, to any body that would tell-where it was ?</p>
               <p>Corbet. He did, there was a bottle of wine drank, the prisoner took share of it, but they were not friends, for I insisted upon the prisoner being prosecuted; I saw the money afterwards in a green purse.</p>

            . I am a watchman: I was at the house the 13th of March, I used to light Mr. Corbet home, and was there before he came in; I went with another gentleman, and returned between eleven and twelve o'clock; there were the prisoner, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Corbet, I staid there better than an hour; Gibbs went backward, and presently after went out; Mrs. Duncombe heard the door open, he made a stay out for about six or seven minutes, and was just got in again when she came down stairs. She ask'd him who he had let into the house; he said, no body, to his knowledge; then she said, he must have let some body in, or out, for she had lost twenty-three guineas; then she double lock'd the door, and said, no body shall go out; saying, she would clear all the rest but the prisoner; he then wish'd terrible wishes, saying, he knew nothing of it; at her crying her husband came down, he stamp'd about the house, saying he was ruin'd to all intents and purposes, when she told him what was lost; the prisoner and he went out into the yard afterwards, and came in again, and Mr. Duncombe said, he had found the money, for Gibbs had told him where it was: this was in Gibb's hearing. Then Mr. Duncombe and Mr. Smith went out of doors, and brought in a green purse with the money in it; there was silver and gold in the purse; then the prisoner fell down on his knees, and desir'd forgiveness of all in the house.</p>

I went to bed, and the next morning the door was open again; then I went up and searched about and missed ten buckskins, which were put there over night, and I believe were there when I went to search about. Then we imagined the prisoner had stole them; we sent about for him, but could hear nothing of him till about a fortnight after; then we sent to him to come to us, he came, we taxed him very hard, and threatned to send for a constable, also we told him we would make it easy with him if he would tell us; he owned the fact, that he had opened the door and taken the ten skins away, and carried 5 of them to Wantage in Berkshire, and the other 5 he sold at Wheatly in Oxfordshire. I went to the last named place, and there I found them at one Mr. Radford's, four of them were cut into breeches, and one whole skin produced in court. There were the workmens private marks upon all the skins, I don't chuse to swear to the breeches, but I do to the whole skin.</p>

            . I live at Ipswich, which is about nine miles from Hadley, I was present when the prisoner at the bar was apprehended at Seymore, with a quarter-master and some dragoons, we got to his house, and when the soldiers were properly planted I knock'd at the door; his wife said who is there? Mr. Nodes, I said yes; said she, I'll come presently, the door was barr'd, I could not get in, then said she what do you want, I said, to see what you have got in the house; after we were in she fell down on her knees, and said for God's sake don't ruin me; looking behind a bed where was a maid servant in it, I ordered the candle to be held, so that I could look round it, which stood close to the wall. I saw something white, at last I saw it stir; said I, come out, said the prisoner, I will, said he, it is to no purpose to make any resistance for I know I am outlawed. I have been in his company abundance of times, I never knew he worked at his trade these eight or ten years, and we always called him John Baker of Hadley.</p>

             was saying to me this fellow has abused me, for only saying, how can you lye in such an idle posture, or to that purpose, meaning the prisoner; the prisoner to this made use of some indecent words, then several words passed between them; I then went to wind up my watch, she had a candle in a candlestick in her hand, she jumped up and ran towards him upon his indecent expression, and I believe flung the candlestick and candle at him, but I did not see it, my back was towards them; I heard the candlestick fall, and saw it on the ground very near the place were the prisoner stood: at that time the prisoner had a german<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175104170018"/> flute in his hand, and as she ran towards him then I heard a blow, but did not see it given, it light on her left temple: she cried out most terribly, I put my watch in my pocket and took hold on her ; she could not speak plain, but made a strange noise ; I set her down upon a bench; she would have told me something, but could not speak to be understood: there was no blood, but a little nob on her temple; we anointed the place with spirits of wine, she continued much the same for a considerable time, sensible all the time, and went twice to the vault with one of our maids leading her : the first time of her going was in about ten minutes after she received the blow; after this she sat holding her hand to her forehead. We got her something to drink, she shook her head and took in very little of it, she was let blood and bled very well, she died in about four hours time after the blow given, the german flute was produced in court. I do think that blow was the occasion of her death.</p>

            . I am porter, and was there that time, but I was asleep in the hall at the beginning of it, when first I awaked, I found the prisoner and deceased in a sort of a quarrel. I saw the deceased in a violent passion run towards the prisoner, who was between three and four yards distance; she threw the candlestick at his face, I can't tell what words had passed between them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the candlestick hit the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Smith. I believe it did: I think he saved it with his hand as it was coming to his face: He was sitting at the same time, and had a musick book before him, with a german flute in his hand: After she threw the candlestick, she follow'd up to him, endeavouring to strike him with her hand; then he struck her across the temples with the flute, he seem'd to strike with some resentment; I ran and took hold of him, she attempted to strike him over my arm, till Mr. West came and took her away; after this she talk'd a great deal, but I could not understand any thing she said, but yes and no; she lived about four hours after; she went twice to the vault, and did not seem to be much affected with it, till about two hours after the blow was given; she could walk very well; I take the blow to be the occasion of her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she much given to passion?</p>
               <p>Smith. She was much.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Grosvenor-street : I was sent for to Sir Paul's on the 26th of March, about one or two o'clock in the morning, I found the deceas'd extremely bad with convulsions; she had been blooded before I came, I found her in the agonies of death. I was told she received a blow on the side of her head, and from the symptoms I had had, I found the scull was fractur'd; she liv'd about half an hour after I came there. I opened her scull that evening, and found a fracture on the left parietal bone, above an inch long through both tables of the scull, that is the very thinnest part of all the scull; under that I found a considerable quantity of coagulated blood, by the weight of which the brain could not perform its functions; her scull was remarkably thin, as thin as I could expect of a person five or six years old.</p>

Then Mr. Cloves, Ebit, and Batt, went after her; there were more there who staid with me; I know I had my watch in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175104170019"/> pocket about ten minutes before.

I call'd out, there is my watch, it lay on the ground close by her. The next morning we carried her before my Lord-mayor, she was all over fresh mud; my Lord ask'd her how she came to be so muddy, she stood at a stand, and said, she could not tell.</p>

Geattus got up and came to the watchman's lanthorne, he was very dirty; he said, gentlemen, this is using me very ill, I can take a jest as well as any body, but this is carrying it too far to push me down, and daub my cloaths.

We went in search of her, up one alley and down another, for near an hour, at last she was taken. The watchman that had her in custody knew her, and said, she went by the name of Shrewsbury Nann. Her handkerchief and cloak were all over mud at that time. She was taken to the watch-house, and then into a little room backwards to be searched ; she turn'd her back to the light, and made a sort of a squat to the ground, and then rose up, holding up her hands, and saying, now search me: Then instantly Mr. Geattus saw his watch on the ground, and took it up. I know this is the same woman that met us, and push'd Mr. Geattus down. I saw her by the light of a lamp.</p>

I am certain there was more when taken out of my shop. I described the particulars of the till before I saw it; I know nothing who took it, the prisoners did not own the taking it.</p>

            . I live in Shore-ditch, and was sitting at a publick-house door at this time: I saw Burling go into Mr. How's shop, the other lad was not with him; he came out with the till under his arm, and walk'd on in the middle of the highway as unconcerned as could be; I thought it to be a log of wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the other prisoner?</p>
               <p>Elsigood. No, my Lord. I never saw him before I saw him at the alehouse.</p>
               <p>Wilkinson Glover. I saw the two prisoners and another person together on the 7th of March last, about three or four o'clock as I was at my shop door, Burling had the till under his arm at the corner of George yard within a door of my house, I was not quite near enough to hear what they said. I went up to them to see what they had got, they had got two hats put into the till over the money to hide it, the till having a partition in it, and as they walked along neither of the prisoners had a hat on. I took hold of Burling, Bowles ran away; I took off one of the hats and saw it was money. Somebody called out stop thief, then Bowles was stop'd; then I sent my boy out to know who had lost a till, and the prosecutor came, there were in the till four shillings and eight pence half penny in half pence, and one shilling and six pence in silver.</p>

            . I stop'd the watch, I happened to be at an alehouse, the prisoner came in and said he had been robbed of seven guineas and a half, but happened to save his watch in the sob of his trowsers, and that he had pawned it for 15 shillings, and if any man there would take it out he would sell it; he said he had bought it at Portsmouth, then he said he bought it in Jamaica; he asked five pounds for it, then he drop'd at once to thirty shillings; we thought proper after we had fetch'd it out of pawn to stop and advertise it, then the prosecutor came and owned it.</p>

               <p>Bridger. My son dodg'd round, but never left me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do to Levet?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I had business enough to guard the blows off, I had not time to observe.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear the pistol go off?</p>
               <p>Bridger. It was after I was down.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was it that was beating Levet?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I am not certain who it was.</p>

               <p>Bridger. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there in the whole?</p>
               <p>Bridger. There were five. After they were gone my son came to me, to contrive how he should get me home; he propos'd to fetch a horse, I said, I could not ride; he got help and led me home.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the person to you who fir'd off the first pistol?</p>
               <p>Bridger. He was within about five or six yards of me and my son too.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the pistol go off after all this beating?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I lay on one side when they were beating me.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you, in this miserable condition, be able to look about you, so as to see and hear what pass'd between your son and other people?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I was all the time in my senses, as I am now.</p>
               <p>Coun. Then the first use of your senses would have been self preservation, to endeavour to shelter yourself?</p>
               <p>Bridger. They beat my body more than they did my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you endeavour to croud your head under your body, or your face to the ground?</p>
               <p>Bridger. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the pistol go off very loud?</p>
               <p>Bridger. Yes, a great bang.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loaded?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I cannot say it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was search made the day after to see if any bullet could be found, or appearance of shot, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell any of your neighbours soon after, who it was that had done you this hurt?</p>

               <p>Bridger. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the three prisoners live with their father, and follow their own business from the 28th of October to the time they were taken up?</p>
               <p>Bridger. As far as I know they did. But how could I tell, when I was not out of my bed?</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not order your son to go and complain to a Justice of peace?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I order'd it a safer way, to have them secur'd, by sending to Mr. Legg.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you many blows before you was knock'd down?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your scull fractur'd, do you imagin, before you was knock'd down?</p>
               <p>Bridger. No, I believe that was after I was down ; I did not know my scull was broke till after they had left me; I felt the cold draw into my head, then I put my hand up and felt the sharp edge of my scull.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you many blows given you after you were down?</p>
               <p>Bridger. Yes, sir, several.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your going onwards, the way home with Levet, accidental?</p>
               <p>Bridger. It was not a set design'd thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the second pistol that was fir'd</p>
               <p>Bridger. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know it was a pistol?</p>
               <p>Bridger. I believe it was, for they had no guns.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of sticks were they that they had?</p>

            . I was called up on the 29th of October in the morning to go to Bridger's house, I found him in bed with six wounds on his head in different parts, with a large contusion on his right shoulder and both arms, and a rib or two broken, he was greatly bruised from his shoulders down both arms, and down the greatest part of his body, particularly the right side of the body. I bound him up and put on a proper defensative plaister, he was so shiftless he could not assist himself at that time, being a heavy man: on the 31st of October I called in Mr. Leech to my assistance, the Sunday following we discovered two fractures on his head, extending in length some inches, we extracted some pieces of the skull, the wounds were very large, we looked upon his life to be in great danger, the last time I dressed him was on the fifth of February.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leech. I happened to be then in town on business of my own, so I am not very positive, but I think it was the 31st of October, I was sent for to Mr. Bridger's, I found him with six large wounds very near as long as my finger on his head, three or four of them were open, two of them were sewed up, the surgeon endeavouring to get the poor man well as soon as possible; I was tearful the skull was fractured, and advised the gentleman to cut them open, we took out more than 20 pieces of the skull, we had a quantity of matter came very freely from under the skull for some weeks, a spoonful may be each time of dressing, it worked out thus; by keeping a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175104170030"/> hollow thing like a shell over the wound, to keep our medicines from pressing upon the brain, so it discharged without opening the skull more; we had great success, the skull was broken in different parts, from the very forehead to the back part of the head; one side of his skull now lies the thickness of a half crown above the other, it lies upon it; as to his body he had a very violent contusion on his shoulder, but particularly his right arm and his body near the hip, he was all in a continued spot of black on his shoulders arms and body, I did not examine the ribs; when they are broke there is seldom any thing more done to them than putting a bandage upon them: Mr. Harssey told me there was a rib or more broken; we attended afterwards together the whole time, wh was about two months.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think a person beat in this manner, affected as he must be, could be capable of recling on one side, and observing what passed at a distance between other people?</p>
               <p>Leech. Had the skull been broke first I don't apprehend he could ; I asked him, how he found himself during the action? he said he found himself down, and they were thumping him blow after blow, till at length he gave up.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for a person whose skull is fractured to have his understanding to give such a particular account as he has?</p>
               <p>Leech. I have known persons that have had a fractured skull, and the symptoms have not appeared till near ten days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his back bruised much?</p>
               <p>Leech. I believe great numbers of strokes were given on his back, his back was not stripes, but one continued black, and it was much more on one side than the other ; it is probable he did not lie on his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side was bruised most?</p>
               <p>Leech. The right side was worst.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he as to his understanding?</p>
               <p>Leech. The man always answered pretty reasonable, but we would not suffer people to talk much to him.</p>

             these eight years, I am keeper of that park, he has been employed in it as an under keeper a little more than half a year, I never knew any harm of him in my life, I believe he would not wilfully forswear himself, and for all that I have heard of him he is an honest man.</p>

               <p>Levet. Because he has shot some dogs lately in the forest, that got among the deer and rabbets, they had used to like him well enough before that.</p>
