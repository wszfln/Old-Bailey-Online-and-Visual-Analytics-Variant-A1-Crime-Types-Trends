               <p>Whittworth. No; I never saw her before to my knowledge: I did not miss any thing then ( this was on a Saturday) but on the Wednesday morning following I received a letter from Mr. Griffice, my comb maker, who lives on the other side of the water, the contents of which were,</p>

            . I am a constable, and was sent for by Mr. Nugent, at the Nag's head in Cheapside, when I was told that the woman they had got there had been attempting to rob the larder where they keep the victuals. I laid hold of her (the prisoner at the bar) and found she had got a parcel of things in a handkerchief, amongst which was this parcel of ivory combs mark'd with a shopkeeper's mark; some of them were loose down her bosom. In the handkerchief also was this parcel of thread. She said she bought the combs of a comb-maker on Snow-hill. I sent a person thither with some of them, who return'd and said they were not made there, but was directed to Mr. Bowers, near Aldgate. I asked the prisoner where she had the thread, who said she bought it in the street. Then I secured her, advertised the goods, and went to Mr. Bowers; he sent me to Mr. Griffice, who said the combs were of his make, and sent to the prosecutor's.</p>

Having drank plentifully, going out of the room, saw the lace of the stay hang down upon the stairs; I laid hold of it, and down came the stay and petticoat with it.

               <p>Andrews. I knew her near a year before; she had pledged some of her own wearing apparel with me before, such as aprons, stays, and other things. She asked me but six shillings on the knives and forks. I asked her who was the owner. She said they belonged to one Mr. Groves, who belongs to the king's kitchen at Kensington, and he had desired her to pledge them with whom she pleased, for his conveniency when he came to town. She gave an account also where he lodged. I not being satisfied about her account, sent to Kensington Gore, to know the truth of it; but seeing them advertised in the paper on Monday morning, I sent to justice Fielding, and he ordered me to come when the prisoner was examined.</p>

After we had drank pretty late, Mr. Cooper insisted on my staying at his house all night. He took a hammer and chissel and broke open a door to let me in, that his wife should not know of it, she being upstairs, and put me to bed, where he kept me all night, till four o'clock. He gave me these things, in order to make money of for the present, and said he would let me have money to fetch them again; but I have no witnesses of it; there were only he and I together.</p>

            . I live in Spital-Fields, and am a barber and peruke-maker. I have known the prisoner between two and three months: He work'd at a loom in my back room, in which he weaved silk and worstead; he lodged in my house about two months, and always behaved very honestly with me. My wife and I have trusted him with every thing in our house when we have gone out, and never missed a farthing; he always came in at good time on evenings.</p>

Before the prosecutor went to bed he had two half guineas in his pocket, which I saw. I got him up the next morning, and as I was putting on his stockings, and the thing belonging to his wooden leg, I missed his watch string, so asked him about it. He said he had it in his breeches the over night. Then I said, I'll see if your money is safe; I looked, and a half guinea was missing.</p>

            , who had three or four hundred deal boards for scaffolding at buildings that he was about; there was one in Bloomsbury Square: I know the boards mentioned in the indictment are Mr. Gray's property, but it is impossible to say where they were taken from; I have seen them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see them?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I saw them at a chandler's shop in Parker's Lane, the latter end of October; they had been used for scaffolding.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the man's name where you saw them?</p>
               <p>Bailey. His name is Wright; it is not far from Bloomsbury Square.</p>
               <p>Q. How many boards did you see there?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I believe I saw nine there, but there were but six of Mr. Gray's, which were ten or twelve foot long; some mark'd T.G. and some E.G. which is his father's name. When the prisoner was before justice Welch, he asked him how he came to take the boards away? He replied, they were old boards, and but of little use.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Bailey. This was about five or six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether they were boards belonging to the scaffold ?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I cannot tell whether they were fixed or lying loose; we have many lying loose on the scaffold; this I know, they were scaffolding boards, and my master Mr. Gray's property.</p>

               <p>Wright. I live in Parker's Lane, and keep a chandler's shop. A labourer who lodged at my house told me these boards were the property of Mr. Gray. Then I sent for Mr. Bailey, who came, and said they were his master's.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by them?</p>
               <p>Wright. I believe I bought them of the prisoner at the bar, who brought them to me by two at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of the night did he bring them?</p>
               <p>Wright. He brought them between seven and eight at night.</p>

               <p>Wright. No; the second parcel that he brought I found were marked; then I inquired about them; the first two parcels were fit for nothing but to burn. He told me they were old flooring board, which he had from a house where he was at work.</p>
               <p>Q to Bailey. What sort of boards were they, new or old?</p>
               <p>Bailey. Some of them had been but little used.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wright. What did you give for them?</p>
               <p>Wright. I gave a groat a piece for them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bailey. What are they worth a piece?</p>

Then she wanted me to make a pair for her against the next night. After that she went away, and upon a lower shelf I missed a pair of pumps, which made a vacancy. I had lost four pair of shoes from that shelf a little before. I went out, and just by Ludgate I stopped her with this pair of pumps in her apron.

About a fortnight before I took the prisoner up, which was on the 5th of November last, I was suspicious of somebody in my house robing me, having lost 5 or 6 guineas out of a bag lock'd up in my own chamber, which is up two pair of stairs; but as to the money in the bag I was not quite certain of the sum, only I supposed myself deficient 5 or 6 guineas. I thought it necessary to come to a certainty, so I put exactly 18 guineas and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050007"/> a 36 s. piece into the same bag, lock'd it up in the same drawer, and let it lie there a week, and when I went to look at it, there were but 14 guineas and the 36 s. piece, but I found the drawer lock'd as usual. After that I thought I must take some method to know the money again, so I put in 15 guineas, 2 half guineas, 2 36 s. pieces, and 2 moidores, to the amount in all of 22 guineas; I put it down on a piece of paper, and marked each piece with a small cross on the standard side, and determined to look at it 2 or 3 times a day. The money was all safe on the Sunday night. The prisoner came to work, as a journeyman, on Monday morning, and went away in the evening. I had look'd. and found my money right in the morning, and also in the afternoon, but at going to bed at night there were only 20 guineas; two were missing, and the drawer lock'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put this money to the other, or by itself?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. I put the 22 guineas there, and took the other money away. On missing the 2 guineas, I challenged my maid with it, who declared herself innocent; then I suspected the prisoner, so went with a constable to his lodgings, and charged him, but he denied it. The constable searched him, and found 2 guineas upon him which were my property, and of my own marking, as the others were [the two guineas produced, and inspected by the court and the jury.] I have some of the others in my pocket to compare, if the court pleases.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. I don't know he spoke a word all the way he went to the compter, he never confess'd any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have the two guineas been since that time ?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. After he was committed the alderman order'd me to take them.</p>
               <p>Council. I should have thought them to have been order'd into an indifferent person's hands.</p>
               <p>Macquistin. They were order'd into mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the constable here?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. He is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner your apprentice?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. He had been.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he serv'd his time out?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. He had 22 Months to serve when I had him discharg'd from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a quarrel between you and him?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. If you urge me to do it, I shall tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray speak out the whole matter?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. Then the reason why I discharg'd him was, about a month before, he went out in the hight and left the door open, and I was alarmed by my door being open in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he rob'd you of any thing?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. No, he had not as I know of; but I thought that as he had got this method of opening the door and going out, I was not safe in my person or property, so I was determined to get rid of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever go out and leave your door open at any other time?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. I know of no other time than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do'nt you think it possible that a person in going out might accidentally in pulling the door after him leave it open?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. He might, but I think he had no reason for going out of my shop.</p>
               <p>Council. This shews you had a great dislike to him from this single instance, which might be purely accidental.</p>
               <p>Macquistin. Supposing I had been rob'd, who should I suspect but the person who went out of my house?</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a character did you give him before the alderman when you was there?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. The alderman was not there, his clerk was. I told him that the prisoner had gone out of my house and left the door open, and I could not think myself safe in my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you thought the prisoner to be a very honest man?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. I did say, I did not know that he rob'd me.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a place was this money taken out of?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. From out of a drawer of a double chest upon chest; I always lock it, and put the key into a buroe and lock it up there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lock broke?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to enquire for the prisoner, did he offer to secrete himself?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. He was thunderstruck; it was near twelve o'clock at night when I went to him. I laid hold of his collar directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see before you saw the prisoner in that house?</p>
               <p>Macquistin. He was the very first person I saw; I called out and asked if Will was at home, that being his name. The mother (as I thought) called, and said he was. I have heard since it was somebody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050008"/> else that lodges in the house, not his mother. I told her he must come to work in the morning, I had a job to do; then he appeared, and I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Samuel Lane. I am a constable. I searched the prisoner, and found two guineas and six pence upon him. I said to his master, here are two guineas, do you know this money. He looked on them, and said here is my mark on both of them, and I will swear to them as part of my money, taken out of my drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. did you look at the marks?</p>
               <p>Lane. I did, and saw them; these are the two guineas here produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Lane. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I kick'd a piece of paper before me, and took it up; there were two guineas in it, which I put into my pocket: this was in my master's house.</p>

               <p>John Watson. I live in King street, Grosvenor-square. Happening to be in liquor, I was pick'd up by some bad women, went into a house with them on the 2d of November at night, and was rob'd of upwards of 30 l.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of money was it?</p>
               <p>Watson. There were 26 guineas, a 36 s. piece, a moidore, and half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you pick'd up?</p>
               <p>Watson. I was at Smithfield market that day, but at three o'clock next morning I found that I was in Swan yard, opposite Somerset-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in a house?</p>
               <p>Watson. I was, but not in a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you there?</p>
               <p>Watson. I do not know, neither do I remember a step of the ground as I went; I was very much affrighted to think how I came there. Looking about me, in a court or yard I saw a light through the sash: Then there came a watchman with a woman, and opened the room door; I had the candle in my hand. The woman came to me, and said, "Get you gone, you have been robbing the house, and if my husband comes home, you will get knocked on the head, or something or another."</p>
               <p>Q. What was her name?</p>
               <p>Watson. Her name is

               <p>Q. What did she offer you that for?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. She said, Brown, here this is a gentleman that looks as if he would not be so ridiculous as to expose himself, saying, he would not advertise himself to make himself look scandalous.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she come by that money?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. I can say so far, she was rustling about his pockets, and she said she took it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she say so to?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. She told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you she took it out of the man's pocket? in your examination before the justice, you did not say one word of her taking the money.</p>
               <p>S. Brown. I really have forgot whether she said she took it out of his pocket or no; for she was a little surprised, and took herself away; I followed her as far as Temple-Bar, she had some rum, and treated a watchman with a pot of purl. I followed her, but she got from me, and I went to my landlord but could not find her; she has absconded ever since, till she was taken up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.</p>

               <p>Q. What part of your house were they taken from?</p>
               <p>Day. From out of a place we call the buttery.</p>

               <p>Day. I saw the prisoner at the bar take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Day. She was my next door neighbour. I lay below stairs. We were in bed, the buttery is just by my bed's head; she threw a hanging shelf down which gave the alarm, I got up and went to the door, and saw her taking the things out; she was putting them out at the window; I seized her about five minutes after, at a neighbour's house, and charged the constable with her; she at first denied it, but afterwards she owned it, and fell on her knees and beg'd I would forgive her, and said she would forsake the place of Highgate, and never come there again.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she get in?</p>
               <p>Day. She or some of her accomplices broke the window; I did not see her get in not go out; but I know she must get in at the window: the window was broke enough to get at the turn-buckle of the casement to open it, which was done; then there was room for any-body to get in, it is eighteen inches wide; it is very likely she had somebody with her, I do not know how she could get the goods out herself.</p>

The prisoner at the bar brought these Hudson's Bay martin skins to our house, and said there were a large quantity of them just come from abroad, of different sorts, that these were he had brought on shore, and mine was the first house he had been at. I asked him if he was a furrier. He said no, he was quite a stranger in town, and knew no furriers. I asked him if he knew any journeymen. He said no; and making a very good appearance, I bought them of him.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen her last?</p>
               <p>Parker. I had seen her in the stable over night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the stable door locked?</p>
               <p>Parker. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your stable joining to or near your house?</p>
               <p>Parker. It is near my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your mare again?</p>
               <p>Parker. I overtook the prisoner at the bar as he was leading her along the road with a halter at Kensington, about the middle of the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he no saddle ?</p>
               <p>Parker. No, nothing but a halter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Parker. He was a stranger to me, I can't say but I had seen him before. I asked him where he had that mare, he said he was leading her along for a man; then I took hold of the halter, and of him likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you, can you tell?</p>
               <p>Parker. I do not know that he did; I told him the mare was mine; then we got a constable and secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he point out any man that he was leading the mare for?</p>
               <p>Parker. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that time had you seen the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Parker. I had seen him about three or four days before at our house; he carried hard-ware about.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him?</p>
               <p>Parker. No, none at all.</p>

            . I came up from Berkshire with the prosecutor after the mare, and found the prisoner leading her along by a halter at Kensington, in the road. The prosecutor took hold of the mare. Said the prisoner, what do you mean. The prosecutor said this is my mare, and I will swear to her; the prisoner said he was leading her along for a man. Then we sent for a constable, and took him before justice Fielding. He said, he was perswaded to do it by two women that were along with him, as we were carying him along; that he bought a halter at Abingdon the night before, and then went to Buckland and lay in the rick yard till he saw the carter had suppered up his horses. and when the servants were all in the house at supper he went and took the mare, and rode away with her.</p>

               <p>I have a mother in London about seventy years of age; I wanted to come up to see her, and I took the mare to come up upon, but not with any intent to sell her, neither did I offer to sell her. I beg for mercy, and that I may be sent to serve his majesty, either by sea or land.</p>

            . I was servant to Mess. Windle and Quinton, at the Green Yard; they have a very large manufactory of all sorts of flint glasses.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. I do, he was teazer there.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. That is to Stoak the fire, and keep it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of any glasses being taken away by the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. Yes, two baskets, which contained about ten dozen of drinking glasses.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they before he took them away?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. They were in my master's yard, laid by in a convenient place, till he could take them away by night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they before they were put in that convenient place?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. They were in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought them out of the warehouse?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. The prisoner at the bar did.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. Very well, for I was with him at the time; we were partners in it, and he brought them to our house. Then one Persia Hart came and fetched them away; she bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was she to give for them?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. She gave two shillings and six-pence a dozen for one parcel, and two shillings for the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they worth?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. The parcel for which she gave two shillings and six-pence, were worth four shillings and six-pence per dozen, and that at two shillings were worth three shillings and three pence, or three shillings and six-pence per dozen, to sell to the trade.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that he and you took them away from your master's yard?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. That was about six weeks ago; it was about the 1st of November.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050012"/>Q. What did Mrs. Hart do with them?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she keep a shop?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. No, she did not; she told me afterwards she had sent them into the country.</p>
               <p>Q Did your masters, or either of them, know of your taking them away ?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. No, at that time they did not know they were stolen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That witness gave me the glasses out of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of you proposed the first robbing your masters ?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. We were all of us very willing to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been servant there?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. He had been servant there about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. I had been servant there on and off till May last these six years.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your employ?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. I was sometimes porter, and sometimes employed in the mill.</p>
               <p>Q. What was this man's character, during the time he was there?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. I never heard any thing ill of him in my life till this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman pay ready money for the glasses?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. She did, and was always drawing us in for more as fast as she could.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. I do not know the exact time, but it was in November; he had been in gaol on suspic ion before that, but nothing being found against him, he was discharged. After he had brought them, he gave Mrs. Hart an account of them, and she came in the morning and fetched them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any money paid?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. In what capacity?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. He was sometimes packer, and sometimes porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any particular place for packing up goods?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. Sometimes they are packed up in the warehouse, and sometimes in the yard. About seven or eight weeks ago the prisoner and I took out glasses several times, and carried them away.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity at a time?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. I cannot directly say how many; I know he took six dozen and brought them to my house at night about eight or nine o'clock, and left them there with my wife; I was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know that he carried them to your house?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. I found them there when I came home; they were packed up before to be brought, and it was the same basket which I saw packed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of your master's people know of his bringing them away?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they worth per dozen?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. They were worth four shillings and six-pence per dozen, they were the best glasses.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not his business to pack up glasses to send to customers?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not your master a variety of baskets belonging to his warehouse?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. Yes, he has a great many dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear positively that was the same basket which you saw pack'd before, as you speak of?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. I cannot say it was the same basket; they were the same goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not one glass like another?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to one particular basket from the rest?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember his bringing glasses to your house</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. I do, several times.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that he brought some?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. He brought a little basket to our house about two months ago; there were glasses in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. Mrs. Hart, a Jew woman, came and fetched them away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they been at your house before she came?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. They did not stay long before she came. She brought her maid (named Brown) along with her sometimes, but she took these away herself.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what money was paid for them?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. No, I do not; the prisoner has brought several dozen of glasses in his pockets at dinner and supper times to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of glasses?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. Drinking glasses.</p>
               <p>Q. How often?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. A number of times, but I cannot tell how many indeed; he has brought half a dozen at a time.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your husband?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. He is sometimes one thing, and sometimes another; he did work there.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a basket was it which the prisoner brought to your house?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. It was a little basket.</p>
               <p>Q. How many glasses were there in it?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner brought the glasses to your house?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. I am sure he packed them up to bring.</p>
               <p>Q. By what are you sure?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. Because I heard my husband say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell who brought them?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. Upon my word I cannot tell who brought them, whether my husband or the prisoner, for they were both together when that was brought; but it is out of my power to tell how many basket of glasses they brought in all.</p>
               <p>Council Your husband just now denied bringing the last basket.</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. That basket Robin brought I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that brought?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. I cannot tell that; the prisoner has often told me he has packed up glasses to bring, and has laughed and said, he would not have his late wife know of it, for she would tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came with Robin when he brought the basket?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. I cannot tell, he came to me and told me he had left a little basket, and that the Jew woman was to come and fetch it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when he brought it in?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. I was then in the kitchen, and he put it in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you in the kitchen see what was done in the shop?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. I believe it was night.</p>
               <p>Q How far is your kitchen from the shop?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. It is just by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner bring that basket you speak of alone?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. There came none but himself, and my husband followed him a little after.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to let the baskets be brought to your house?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. Because they made a frequent practice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purposes were they brought there?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. Because they were stolen goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when Mrs. Hart took that basket and glasses away?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose order was that?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. By Robin's order; they used both to go together. He used to come to our house on Sunday mornings, and take my husband with him to Mrs. Hart's.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. Because my husband has told me so, and I have seen them go together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your husband committed to prison once?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. No, never in his life; he was never in custody before this.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you once in Newgate?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050014"/>E. Hambleton. I was, for buying two pounds and a half of sugar in my own shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your husband run away for it?</p>
               <p>E. Hambleton. No.</p>

            . I did live servant with Mrs.. Hart, and have been at Hambleton's house with her twice, to fetch-away glasses; she used to hire me as a chairwoman, and to work plain work.</p>
               <p>Q. How many glasses can you say there were?</p>
               <p>M. Brown. I believe about nine or ten dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that you fetched glasses from thence?</p>
               <p>M. Brown. I believe it is about a year ago, or better; she has gone on above a year and half buying of these people.</p>
               <p>Q. What people?</p>
               <p>M. Brown. These three people, Swingwood, the prisoner, and Hambleton: I have been with her to all their houses, have seen her pay for them, and take them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Mrs. Hart live?</p>
               <p>M. Brown. She lived in Gravel Lane, Houndsditch.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she use to do with the glasses?</p>
               <p>M. Brown. She used to bring them home to her house, and sell them to Jews that hawk about the streets; she is a Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she use to give for them?</p>
               <p>M. Brown. She used to give two shillings per dozen for what she had of Swingwood, and half a crown for what she had of Robinson; I have seen it paid to Robinson in his own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where they were brought from?</p>
               <p>M. Brown. I saw the prisoner come out of the glass-house with some in his pocket, from Mr. Quinton's back gate, by his garden, and deliver them to Mrs. Hart.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago?</p>
               <p>M. Brown. That is about ten months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were Mr. Quinton's glasses?</p>
               <p>M. Brown. I knew he worked there. When I went once with Mrs. Hart he said,</p>
               <p>"Why do you bring this person with you; can she keep a secret?"She answered, I know her very well, for she has been with me so long, she will not tell. I did not know that the glasses were stolen till that time he came out of his master's gate with some. When I came home, I said to Mrs. Hart, I fancy he does not come honestly by them, or why did he ask you whether I could keep a secret.</p>
               <p>Mr. Windle. All these glasses, manufactured at our glass-house, are my partner's and my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner your servant?</p>
               <p>Windle. He was</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give him leave to carry out glasses to sell?</p>
               <p>Windle. No; there never were such privileges given to any of our servants; he has sometimes had bills and receipts with him, to bring the money for them, but he never carry'd any out to sell by our order.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, any of these glasses, which the witnesses have been speaking of, to be your property?</p>
               <p>Windle No, for I saw nothing; I only speak by the information of other people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you trust the prisoner to carry out glasses?</p>
               <p>Windle. I did, as a porter, and he was to deliver those glasses to the people where the bills mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not these be glasses which you delivered to him for that purpose?</p>
               <p>Windle. I apprehend not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he lived with you?</p>
               <p>Windle. I cannot say exactly, but I look upon it to be three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he behaved?</p>
               <p>Windle. He behaved very well, as we thought, till about three or four months ago, when we had occasion to suspect him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon whose information?</p>
               <p>Windle. Upon his not giving an account to us when we asked him concerning the glasses which were stolen. There was one Levi, a Jew, who was another servant of ours, as a labourer, had told the prisoner if he would get glasses out of our warehouse, he would sell them for him; and he never told us of it, which was his duty, being our servant. We have suspected the prisoner above twelve months, but we never could catch him before, so we were obliged to abide by the loss.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever give orders to any of your servants to carry out glasses to sell?</p>
               <p>Quinton. No, never; neither are there any among us that give orders to any servant so to do.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner in your service?</p>
               <p>Quinton. He was packer, and used to carry out parcels of glasses to customers, with bills and receipts<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050015"/> at the bottom; to receive the money for small parcels; but this was but very few times.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to apprehend he was concerned in stealing glasses?</p>
               <p>Quinton. I had reason to suspect him; some time ago we lost a box of glasses, so I took him along with me to examine some that we suspected; I looked at them, and told the prisoner that the greatest part of those goods were mine. He looked at them, and said he did not think they were. I said, do you not remember this and the other remarkable glass? He said, no, he did not think they were ours, which made me suspect he was concerned in the thing, and from that time I had a bad opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any glasses upon him?</p>
               <p>Quinton. No, I never did, nor in his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him take any away?</p>
               <p>Quinton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When this charge was made against the prisoner, did not you disbelieve it, from his former behaviour?</p>
               <p>Quinton. I did disbelieve it at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Even after the information you had received, was you not desirous of still keeping him in your warehouse?</p>
               <p>Quinton. I'll tell you the reason of that; I said, Robin, there is an information against you that you have been concerned in stealing glasses and things from us a great while, on which he cry'd and seem'd to take on terribly; he said he never saw any thing taken, and that now as his character was gone how should he get his bread.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you receive the information from?</p>

               <p>Q. Was you in liquor?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I was a little in liquor, yet I could have gone home by myself, but my friend called the watchman to go with me. As I was in <placeName id="t17591205-23-crimeloc119">Bedlam-Passage going out of Broad-Street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Who knock'd you down?</p>
               <p>Stevens. The prisoner at the bar, I believe; I know I was knock'd down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else near you?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No, only the prisoner and I together.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be certain who knock'd you down?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I am very certain it was the prisoner, I knew him again four or five days after, tho' he was not in his watchman's dress.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dress'd when he went along with you?</p>
               <p>Stevens. He was in a watchman's dress, and had a great coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you knock'd down with?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I was knock'd down with a large staff or stick, I was struck on my left cheek and my nose, which made me incapable of going out for two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to you after you was knock'd down?</p>
               <p>Stevens. He took me home notwithstanding. I was to give him six pence. I had a shilling or two in my other pocket loose, so I gave him a shilling, and he was to have brought me six-pence the next morning, but he never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I had five guineas and a half and a 36 s. piece in my pocket, but do not know who took it out of my pocket, it was in a green purse in my side pocket; I am morally certain he knock'd me down.</p>
               <p>Q When did you miss your money?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I missed it the next morning; the first thing I did was to look for my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you be certain who was the man that took the money out of your pocket, as well as who knock'd you down?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I cannot say that; I can only say I had the money in my pocket when the prisoner took care of me. When I was knock'd down I was stunn'd with the blow and fall together, and not sensible of what might be done to me; when I missed my money I was sensible of my being knock'd down, and that there was nobody but the prisoner near me; then I sent to Mr. Barber, in order to find out the watchman, and he found him on the Monday following about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was you knock'd down?</p>
               <p>Stevens. On the Wednesday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did your friend Mr. Barber give you, when you sent to him?</p>
               <p>Stevens. He said he could not tell where he lived, but by enquiring of Mr. Tudman, the beadle of the ward, he found him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not to be found upon his stand?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No, the prisoner absented himself from his duty, so Mr. Tudman sent for him to pay him for his watching, and appointed me to be there. I knew him assoon as I saw him; he was secured and taken to the compter that night, and next morning carried before my lord-mayor. I was present, and charged him with knocking me down, alledging that my money was taken from me. He owned he went home with me, but not that he had knock'd me down, or took my money. At the time that I charged the constable he denied that he had ever seen me in his life, or ever went any where with me. He also offered to make it up with me, and offered to give me so much a week; I have, witness here that heard him.</p>

               <p>Q. DID not you examine your pocket at the time you gave him the shilling?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to charge him that night?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I did not know that I should have occasion to charge him with robbing me, not knowing then that I had been rob'd.</p>
               <p>Court. You had sense enough to give him a shilling, and desired him to bring you six pence the next morning.</p>
               <p>Stevens. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you at that time recollect he was the man that knock'd you down?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I am sure he is the man that knock'd me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why did you not charge him that night?</p>
               <p>Stevens. Very early in the morning I recollected I had been knock'd down. The prisoner said I fell;</p>
               <p>Q. What company had you been in at the house where you came from?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I had nobody but Mr. Barber, and his wife with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get in liquor with this man and his wife, or where did you get in?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I had been in company before at the sign of the Mansion-house, opposite the Mansion-house; but I had been there but half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you made fuddled?</p>
               <p>Stevens. It was by what I drank at Mr. Barber's, I drank but part of a tankard of beer before. I was very well when I came in.</p>
               <p>Court. It is very odd that a man should be knock'd down by another, and reward that man that knock'd him down with a shilling; and again it is as odd that the same man should go home with him afterwards. What company was you in at the Mansion-house?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I was only with my fellow servant. I travel for Mr. Maltby, who is a linen draper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce your money that evening before your fellow-servant?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No. I am sure I had it when I went into Mr. Barber's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been before you went to drink with your fellow servant?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I went immediately from my business at Mr. Maltby's.</p>

            , the prisoner at the bar, was with me that night, I am upon the same stand in Broad-Street with him; he is a spare man, so was put with me that night. I know that night he was absent from his stand for about two hours and a half, or three hours; when he came back, I asked him where he had been; he said he had been at Mr. Barber's, and had been with a job; I asked him what job; he said he had been along with a gentleman home. He said first of all the gentleman thought of going in a coach, but he thought afterwards he was capable of going home without a coach, so discharged the coach, and took him with him. He was afterwards taken in custody at Mr. Tudman's, and I and another watchman were charged with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you miss the prisoner from his stand that night?</p>
               <p>Renew. I missed him about ten o'clock, and he came to me again after one; when we were charged with him we took him to Mr. Barber's, and there the gentleman said he had better own it, but he denied it; at last he made a proposition, that if Mr. Stevens would take so much money down, he would give him a note to pay him so much a week till all was paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050019"/>Q. What said the prosecutor to that?</p>
               <p>Renew. He would not make it up, and the constable said he could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he there charged with knocking the prosecutor down?</p>
               <p>Renew. He was; Mr. Stevens charged him with it. At first he said he never knew the man, nor never went home with him, and afterwards, before my Lord-mayor, he own'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether my Lord mayor would admit the prosecutor to take his oath about who knock'd him down?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord-mayor made no difficulty only in this, that as I was in liquor it was dangerous to grant me my oath as to my being certain of his robbing me; I told his Lordship, I was sure he knock'd me down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Woodward. The first time of my seeing the prisoner was in the constable's custody, charged with knocking the prosecutor down and the robbery. I told him myself I thought his case look'd dangerous, and advised him to make an end of the affair rather than go before my Lord-mayor, for then it would be too late; so after some time he called me out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Woodward. At Mr. Barber's; the constable was against his going out, but I told him I would take care of him; when we came out, he asked me if I thought Mr. Stevens would make it up; I told him I knew nothing of that, but thought his case was dangerous; he said, I have not all the money by me, but I will pay part of it down, and I'll pay him the other part weekly, tho' I am innocent too; these were his words, and I told him I thought he was both a knave and a fool. The prosecutor never accepted of his proposal, tho' the prisoner urged the thing several times, saying he would pay part down, and give a note for the payment of the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be there?</p>
               <p>Woodward. I am an acquaintance of Mr. Stevens, and he desired I would go with him.</p>

            . I keep a publick house; Mr. Stevens was at my house on the 15th of November last.</p>
               <p>Q. What condition was he in when he first came into your house?</p>
               <p>Barber. He was in liquor, but I did not observe it till he went to get up to go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you, or do you not know whether he was in liquor when he first came into your house?</p>
               <p>Barber. Then he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he when he went out of your house?</p>
               <p>Barber. In liquor to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he more in liquor when he went out than at coming in?</p>
               <p>Barber. He was, so I thought it necessary to take care of him when he went home, and delivered him to the prisoner, desiring him to see the gentleman safe home; the prisoner undertook it, and I saw them go past Broad-street church.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is his home from your house?</p>
               <p>Barber. I believe about four or five hundred yards; it is in Daget's-Court, the farther end of Broad Street Buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. After this did the prosecutor ever acquaint you that he had been knocked down and rob'd?</p>
               <p>Barber. He did the next day, which was on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>
               <p>Barber. He told me he had been knocked down and rob'd of his money, and asked me whether I knew the watchman that went home with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you who he believed the person was that knocked him down and robbed him?</p>
               <p>Barber. He said he believed it was the watchman that I sent home with him. I did not know the prisoner's name, so I inquired among the watchmen and found him out. There was one Berry, a watchman, that was opposite our door at the time, who was to have fetch'd a coach for Mr. Stevens to go home in, but the prisoner, being a younger man, out-ran him, and got the coach. Then Mr. Stevens would not be persuaded to go in it, but said he would walk home. When I found he would not go in the coach, I desired the prisoner (he being a watchman belonging to the ward) to take care of him, and see him home, thinking there was no danger. He took his lanthorn and staff with him, and I saw Mr. Stevens walk very well as I stood at my door.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What did he give the coachman?</p>
               <p>Barber. He gave him a shilling, but would not go with him.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What did my Lord mayor do in regard to giving him his oath?</p>
               <p>Barber. My Lord-mayor was a little tender as to that, till he heard the prisoner wanted to make it up with Mr. Stevens; then I believe it made him think the prisoner was guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. What hour of the night was it when he went out of your house?</p>
               <p>Barber. The watchman was going one o'clock when he was first called, and I believe it was better than half an hour after when they set out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050020"/>Q. to Renew. What time did the prisoner return to his stand?</p>
               <p>Renew. It was pretty near two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. to Barber. What time did Mr. Stevens come to your house?</p>
               <p>Barber. I believe he came in about half an hour after eleven o'clock on the Wednesday night, and went away on Thursday morning as I have mentioned.</p>

               <p>I went home with Mr. Stevens, but I do not know any thing of what he says.</p>

               <p>Parker. This was the day before the Thanks-giving-day, about six o'clock in the evening. He said, "It is a fine evening, and the weather is warm," and walked a pretty way with me. Then he took hold of my arm, dragged me a little way out of the path, took me round the middle, and then pulled my breeches open.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he take you out of the path?</p>
               <p>Parker. But a very little way; it was about as far as from where I stand to the door coming into the court [which is about six or seven yards.] Then James Brown, the soldier, came up (I was turning myself from the other) and said,</p>

            . Parkor has been my servant five years last October, and is a very honest, faithful servant. Since this affair, I have inquired in my family (as he is in some measure charged with the most heinous of crimes by these men at the bar) whether he had any followers came after him at any time: I was told he had nobody came after him, and I do not think there is the least room for such a thought of him. A servant that has lived in my house twenty-five years informed me, that he was never out of my house after nine o'clock since he has been with me, except on a benefit night, when he has gone to a play with the maids; he is an honest, sober, faithful servant as ever lived - I would mention to your Lordship the reason why he was in the Park at that time: I sent him the evening before Thanksgiving day with a brace of pheasants to Great Queen Street, and ordered him also to go to the white house, which is joining to the Gatehouse, Westminister, and after he had been at these places it might be about six o'clock. I have inquired since, and found he delivered his messages punctually; I mention this to shew; that he did not loiter away his time. When the soldier Brown was before justice Fielding, he desired to be admitted an evidence, which was granted. Then he could readily tell where to find the other prisoner, who was taken and brought there; then he (that is,

               <p>Q. How old is that child in your arms?</p>
               <p>F. Moses. She is almost four years old. The prisoner at the bar did live in Woolpack Alley, which but a step from my house; my child went to school with his sister-in-law, and he used to fetch and carry the child to and from school sometimes; he lodged at Ann Davids's, his sister's house. About six weeks ago she came home, and was very red and hot in her face; after that she would not go to school any more, but was taken very bad; she tumbled about, and could not make water.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she gone to that school then?</p>
               <p>F. Moses This was about four or five weeks after she had first gone to school. Then I took her in my lap, looked at her, and found she was much swelled. and began to break out in her private parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that she was torn?</p>
               <p>F. Moses. She was not torn, but she had the soul disease.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the midwife say upon inspecting her?</p>

             did to her. I found her abused and torn terribly, and was very sore upon her private parts. She was more like a woman than a child, her parts being torn open. I went to the school, and beat the prisoner well. My child was always crying out, of her bowels and her limbs, and she could not make water. I found upon her under petticoat something like spots of blood.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you understand that your child had the foul disease?</p>
               <p>S. Jacobs. That you must ask the surgeon, for I do not understand it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever declare to any body, after you found your child in this condition, that she had the foul distemper?</p>
               <p>S. Jacobs. No.</p>

               <p>S. Jacobs. It was about a week afterwards; it was the day after I found it out, when I beat the boy.</p>

               <p>S. Jacobs. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to Mrs. Davids?</p>
               <p>S. Jacobs. I said I wanted to take the child away. She said she would make me suffer for it, that I spake like the rest, and one had catched the pox of the father, the other of the mother, and the other wanted money.</p>

             brought her child to me about two months ago (this is the child that is here) and complained it had got the foul disease, by a ravishment, and desired I would let her have a few medicines for the case; I did not examine the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not?</p>
               <p>Davis. Because the child refused it, and cry'd and said I should not; so I never examined her so far as to absolutely know the case was either a ravishment or the foul disease; the second time she lay in her mother's lap, I just look'd withinside her thighs and saw a few pimples that were broke out.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether there was a laceration?</p>
               <p>Davis. I can not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it you did not look farther?</p>
               <p>Davis. I did not chuse it, thinking they had surgeons of their own, and I thought it most requisite for them to do it. I gave her some medicines to cool the heat of her body. I could not cleverly say she was a patient of mine. The mother came and had a shilling-worth of medicines now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you or can you not say whether she had the foul distemper?</p>
               <p>Davis. I cannot say it was that, I apprehend it might be occasioned by heat of body. I asked the child several questions; she had but one symptom of a venereal disease, and that was the scalding of her water.</p>

               <p>Q. What business do you follow?</p>
               <p>Wright. I am in the coal way. On the 27th of October last my house was broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you first know of it?</p>
               <p>Wright. The girl told me that a light was taken out of the window, about 6 in the morning. I went and saw the light lying on the coals. This was a window to the back kitchen belonging to my dwelling-house, even with the ground. When the light was taken out, there was room enough for the biggest man in this court to get in. I missed a hat, a peruke, and two pair of stockings, from out of another kitchen, which that kitchen goes into. I had wore my hat and wig the day before; this was on a Sunday. I had a suspicion of the prisoner, and took him on the Tuesday following he had work'd for me about 8 or 9 days, and lodged some nights in that time at my house. I took him at the Castle alehouse in Field Lane, and charged a constable with him, he having ran away with some coals sack and all. I asked him how he could serve me so; this was at my first going in. He made little or no answer, but said he should be glad if I would not be angry, and he'd be three halfpence with me. I said I was going 2 or 3 doors farther, and would be back again by the time he had got the beer drawn and a toast put in it. I went and got an officer, and when I returned, I was told the prisoner was gone to the necessary house, where I found him sumbling about his pockets. I gave the constable charge of him, on suspicion of breaking my house and robbing me; he quiver'd like an aspen leaf; we took him before justice Fielding, and the next day I had an account of my wig being found at the Castle, behind a water tub, just by the necessary house; it was delivered to me by the maid servant; the prisoner told me he had pawned the hat and stockings for want, at a pawnbroker's by St. Giles's. When I went to him in the prison, he owned he was the person that broke open the house, and took the things, between 2 and 3 in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it that you went to him to New-Prison, and he made this confession?</p>
               <p>Wright. That was on Wednesday the 30th. I had him next day before Mr. Fielding again (the perule produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Q to prosecutor. Did you ever make any overtures to the prisoner, in order to make this matter up?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, but his father did to me; he asked me what I would take for the hat and wig.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not tell the father, that if he would give you 4 or 5 guineas you would drop all prosecution.</p>
               <p>Wright. No, that I did not; the father proposed it to me, and I said I would not, nor could not, without offending the law.</p>

               <p>I had been from Clerkenwell to the Borough, and as I was coming back again, a gentleman said I have got an old packing case; if you will make it a little less I will pay you for your labour; I said, I had no too about me; he said if I had a saw, he could help me to a hammer. I went to this place, (what Mr. Scott says is true) but there was nobody there or I would have asked them to have lent me one. I tell the truth, I took the saw in my hand with intent to do the job and then return it, not with intent to keep it the least in the world; I should not have been gone half an hour with it.</p>

            . The prisoner and I were partners together, in buying and selling cloaths. I was with child, and not able to go about the streets on my business, so I nursed a woman in the house where the prisoner and I lived. When I dropped partnership with the prisoner I had six shillings of my own, and at the christening I had three shillings given me, which nine shillings I had laid upon a chest of drawers in the room where the woman lay in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it put into any thing?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. No, it lay loose upon the drawer; I put it there in the afternoon, and I missed it in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when it was taken away?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. I was up and down stairs, nursing the woman; it is a publick-house, and there was no servant to attend business but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been in that room the day you lost it, can you tell?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. She had been there backwards and forwards all day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you missed your money, what did you do?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. I fell a crying. I was not able to pursue her, for I was delivered in three days after; I was obliged to go into the Lying-in-Hospital. After I got up I went to the prisoner, and asked her to give me some relief, and help me to some of my money. She said, call upon me next week, and I will give you six pence or a shilling. I called, but she would not give me a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she acknowledge she had taken your nine shillings?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. Yes; there are witnesses enough of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say she had done with it?</p>
               <p>M. Kelly. She said she had drank seven shillings of it the very same night that she took it away. I took her before justice Welch, before whom she acknowledged that she took it away.</p>

               <p>My husband is on board one of his majesty's ships, serving his country. I hope you will take compassion on me, and give me till to-morrow to produce my witnesses. She and I were partners. I gave her eleven pence a day when I earned twenty-two pence, at the time she was not a nurse keeping. She said she would never come against me, and I gave her a crown in her hand in the Round-house, besides a leg of mutton.</p>

               <p>Wintle. I did, on the 18th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought that?</p>
               <p>Wintle. Brown, otherwise Everitt, brought it; she came into my shop between eight and nine in the evening, and pulled two tea spoons out of her pocket, saying, do you buy old spoons; I said yes, and went to weigh them. She said you need not weigh them, for I have got some other business with you, and gave me this letter (producing one.)</p>
               <p>The letter read to this purport:</p>
               <p>"Sir, I hope you remember the time you met</p>
               <p>"me in Morefields, the time of the princess of</p>
               <p>"Orange's death; that I proved with child, and</p>
               <p>"went into the country to my friends, till I could</p>
               <p>"hide my condition no longer; and as I draw</p>
               <p>"near my time, I hope you will assist me, and I</p>
               <p>"shall for ever be bound to pray for you; if you</p>
               <p>"please, come to Mrs. Sherron's, a chandler's-shop,</p>
               <p>"in Little-Newport-Street, the corner of a</p>
               <p>"court, near Cranbourn Alley, up one pair of</p>
               <p>"stairs, at Mrs. Brown's."</p>
               <p>I read it, and said, what do you mean by bringing me such a letter as this; she said, give yourself no such airs, for there is the girl at the door, that you got with child; upon that I called my wife down stairs, and then said to the prisoner Brown, does this letter belong to you, I know nothing of it; then she said it is Mrs Edwards's, and called her in; I said to my wife, here is a girl come to accuse me of geting her with child, whom I never saw in my life. Then I sent my girl for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Edwards say when she came in?</p>
               <p>Wintle. She said I was the person that got her with child. The constable came, and I asked him what I must do; he said, take them before my Lord-mayor, but we found he was not in the way; then I told the constable, if he would put them in the compter I'd bear him harmless. The constable asked her her name; she said she was with child by me, and her name was 
               <persName id="t17591205-32-person327">

            ; then he clap'd that down in the letter. Brown said she could get bail. In going to the watch-house a fellow jostled against the constable, and Edwards made her escape. As soon as I had called my wife, Brown said, take notice how long you detain us. Upon this I imagined she pretended to bring an action.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050029"/> The other said to the constable, what do you detain me for, I fancy I can find the other at the door. They went, and found the other that had gotten away, opposite the door, on the other side of the way, at the corner of the Old-Jury; then he brought them both to the shop, when Brown said she was not concerned, only in bringing the letter. When we were going to the watch-house, a man jostled the constable and Edwards got away a second time, but we kept the other. About two o'clock came in one Higgins, a lawyer's clerk, who gave bail for Brown's coming in the morning; she was to bring the other with her, but came without her, and said Edwards was waiting at an alehouse in Fleet street, so the constable went and found her there; then they were both brought to my shop, and we went before the present Lord-mayor, who committed them both to the compter, and bound me over to prosecute them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Edwards say when she was got with child?</p>
               <p>Wintle. She said, that at the time of the princess of Orange's death I met her in Morefields, in the month of February, took her to a tavern, between eight and nine o'clock, was with her an hour and a half, treated her, was concerned with her twice, and gave her four shillings, and that I would have treated her with a coach home; that then she lived with a relation in Chiswell street, and refused the coach, but watched me home, to know where I lived. My Lord-mayor said, it was very odd, if that was true, you should never call upon the gentleman till now, what did you do with yourself before this time. She said that six weeks before she lived in Leicester-street, after that in Kensington, but had been removed into Parliament-street. His lordship asked her where she lived before that, but she made no answer to that. Then the other prisoner Brown was called, and asked how she came to bring such a letter to me; she said she knew the girl two or three years ago, by drawing beer at an alehouse, upon which she brought the letter for her, and that she had helped her to wash for three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether or no the charge that this letter imports is any part of it truth?</p>
               <p>Wintle. No, it is not, not a word of it; I never saw either of the parties in my life, till they came to my shop, as I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention the tavern or sign where she said you were together?</p>
               <p>Wintle. No, she said she did not know the tavern nor the sign.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever in Morefields with her?</p>
               <p>Wintle. I never was in Morefields at such time as she speaks of in my life, nor never was in company with her in my life; I never saw either of them before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this whole accusation, contained in the letter, true or false?</p>
               <p>Wintle. It is every part of it false; I never knew either of them in my life.</p>
               <p>As nothing could be charged upon Brown, otherwise Everitt, but carrying a letter, and the fixing it upon the other, were she ever so guilty, would not be sufficient to prove this indictment, for no person can be said to conspire alone, they were both <rs id="t17591205-32-verdict166" type="verdictDescription">

I told him Mr. Barber was in the country. He said he wanted a hogshead of sugar, and accordingly I sold him one. Then I said, you are a stranger to me, therefore my masters will expect the money for it, please to walk into the compting-house, and leave me a direction where you live; he left me a direction, and told me if I came with the sugar in a cart, he should be at home about four o'clock inthe afternoon, and would give me the money; accordingly I went, but when I came there he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was his house?</p>
               <p>Dukes. It was in East-Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you find at his house?</p>
               <p>Dukes. His wife; I asked her what time she expected him home; she said she could not tell, but she expected him home soon. We put the hogshead of sugar into the shop, and I waited there upwards of an hour; I came away, and the next morning I went again, but saw nothing of the prisoner; on the Monday following he sent me a letter (producing one.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it to be his hand-writing?</p>

               <p>Q. Did he give a right direction, for the sugar to be sent by the carman?</p>
               <p>Dukes. Yes, and he said he would pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner on the Monday after ?</p>
               <p>Dukes. I went to his house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not at that time offer you some money?</p>
               <p>Dukes. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not offer to pay you fifteen or sixteen guineas, in part of that debt ?</p>
               <p>Dukes. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he at any other time?</p>
               <p>Dukes. No, I asked his wife for part of the money, if he could not give me the whole, and said if he did not like the sugar, I would take it back again, and he should be at no expence for the cartage.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did she make?</p>
               <p>Dukes. She told she could say nothing to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there never an offer made you to pay you in part?</p>
               <p>Dukes. No, never; I asked him and his wife to pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that?</p>
               <p>Dukes. That was on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did he give you?</p>
               <p>Dukes. He said he had not quite money enough, but he was going out, and should get a little more; that I should have some the next day, and he would call and pay my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask for the whole, or part then?</p>
               <p>Dukes. I asked for the whole thirty-four pounds and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had offered you any in part, should you have taken it?</p>
               <p>Dukes. I should.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had offered you five pounds, would you have taken it?</p>
               <p>Dukes. I should; I would not have refused to have taken any part of the money.</p>

               <p>Q. If a person comes to your servant, and promise to pay him for goods, and gets them, and does not pay for them what do you think of that?</p>
               <p>Macmurdow. I should think my servant should take care and have the money before he delivers the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man gains credit with your servant at your shop, by pretending to be acquainted with you, and your servant delivers him goods upon promise of payment of ready money, and he does not pay at all, do you think that an honest man ?</p>
               <p>Macmurdow. I should think my servant must be really persuaded that he is an acquaintance of mine before he would deliver them.</p>
               <p>Council. That is not an answer.</p>
               <p>Macmurdow. A man may be a rogue in pretending to do it, but I should think my servant a very great fool to deliver goods upon such a contract, without taking the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever authorise the prisoner at the bar to make use of your name, in getting any credit from any of your customers where you have dealt, to get goods?</p>
               <p>Macmurdow. No; I do not know that ever I gave him the use of my name for any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a man should buy goods, and not keep his payments, should you think that an honest man?</p>
               <p>Macmurdow. There is many an honest man that cannot make good his payments at all times.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he live then ?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. In East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep a publick shop?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Dukes's coming there in June?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What day?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. It was on the 18th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come for?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. He came to my master the prisoner, for money for a hogshead of sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the 18th?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. That very morning I had been at the King's-Bench, for a rule for my master.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was a rule?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. Because I had never seen such a thing before, I opened and look'd into it.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a rule?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. A rule of court I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master in prison then?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a thing was that rule?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. It was a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to call it a rule?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. I think they call it a rule, and I remember it was on the 18th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. It was on a Monday, and after I came from bringing the rule my master had a friend drinking a pot of beer with him, when this Mr. Dukes came in, and my master asked him if he would drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master confined at home then?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go for a rule?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. I do not know any farther.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sent you for the rule?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. My master did.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. I own by this he must have been a prisoner. I find upon the return of the habeas it appears he was committed by Sir

               <p>Q. What did Mr. Dukes say when your master asked him to drink?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. He said, he did not care if he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it you heard pass between your master and Mr. Dukes about paying any money?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. He asked my master for money for a hogshead of sugar; my master reply'd, he could not pay him then, by reason he had just paid the king his duty.</p>
               <p>Q. Duty upon what?</p>
               <p>S. Osborn. Upon soap; my master made soap. He said if he would take what he had in part, which was about 15 or 16 guineas, he would give it him, and would in a few days pay him the rest.</p>

             was brought in there on the 15th of August last. I saw him in about an hour after he was brought in, and found him quite senseless, with a very considerable bruise on the fore part of his head; from the appearances and from the symptoms, I had geat reason to conclude his scull was broke, and on removing the scalp I found it so, in two places.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the scull was it?</p>
               <p>Potts. They were both in the fore part of the head, and no doubt both produced by the same blow; the two places were little more than a finger's breadth distance. I trapan'd him immedi ately.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that? It is necessary the jury should know.</p>
               <p>Potts. That is making a hole in the scull, and taking a piece out.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he die?</p>
               <p>Potts. About the middle of October.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he die of?</p>
               <p>Potts. Of that fractured scull.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain of that ?</p>
               <p>Potts. I have not the smallest doubt concerning it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you make any judgment whether he was fuddled at the time that he received the fracture ?</p>
               <p>Potts. It is not possible in those cases to distinguish that, for the symptoms produced by the pressure of this bone, so totally deprive a man of any kind of voluntary action, that it is impossible to know whether he was fuddled or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him make any declaration?</p>
               <p>Potts. No; when I first saw him he was incapable of speech, and after that he became capable in a very particular manner, but I never heard him speak sensibly at all during the whole time; I only speak for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did you see him?</p>
               <p>Potts. I certainly saw him every other day, and sometimes every day.</p>
               <p>Q. For how long did you see him every day?</p>
               <p>Potts. Perhaps for the first fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time did you never find him in his senses ?</p>
               <p>Potts. During that time I did not perceive he was; they appeared to me to be clearly lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body attend him besides you?</p>
               <p>Potts. My young man saw him every day; if he had been sensible he would have asked him some question or other, which he never did.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after he was brought in might it be before you saw him?</p>
               <p>Potts. I believe I might see him within the hour.</p>
               <p>Q. From the nature of the fractures and trapanning, whether you think he could be in his senses or not, so as to know what he said?</p>
               <p>Potts. That is impossible for me or any body to answer. I could run over a great many hard words, but I cannot answer that: Sometimes very bad fractures do not deprive people of their senses, and sometimes very trifling affairs of fractures render them totally deprived of their senses.</p>

               <p>Q. COULD you form any judgement when he came into the hospital whether he was in liquor, or whether his insensibility proceeded from the blow?</p>
               <p>Gordon. There is no forming any judgement of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear any questions asked him?</p>
               <p>Gordon. The people about him have asked him who threw him out of the window, but I did not give any attention to it, thinking him not in his senses.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has asked him any questions when you have been there?</p>
               <p>Gordon. I have been there when the sister of the ward has asked him who threw him out, and he has mentioned the word Tipton, only the word Tipton.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you heard that question asked?</p>
               <p>Gordon. I cannot pretend to say how often; I have heard it asked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him use any continued discourse at any time?</p>
               <p>Gordon. Never. I have heard them ask him whether he would have any food; he has said, yes or no, and to the other question he has said Tipton; yet at no time I thought him sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. When he answered Tipton, did not you apprehend he was in his senses?</p>
               <p>Gordon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why?</p>
               <p>Gordon. Because he did not appear to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he in other particulars?</p>
               <p>Gordon. I never asked him any questions.</p>
               <p>Q. Why so ?</p>
               <p>Gordon. Because I did not think him capable of giving any sensible answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him not to be in his senses all the time?</p>
               <p>Gordon. I did.</p>

            . I know the prisoner at the bar; he lived in Arthur Street, Goswell Street, at the Fox and Bird Cage.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. I lived at Mr. Manning's, a baker, in Arthur Street.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is that to the prisoner's house?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. That is about eight or nine yards from it, facing it, a little on one side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the deceased?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. I did, by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him last?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. On the 15th of August last I saw him sitting in the window of the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before that day?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. No; this was about four or five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What window was it?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. It was the middle window up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a window?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. A sash window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sash up or down?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. The sash was up.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a road along that street ?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. It is a road way, a paved street of rough stones.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he sit in the window?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. He was sitting upon the window seat, leaning with his elbow. [She described it as leaning his elbow on the bottom of the window, higher than the seat he sat upon.]</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen him sitting so before the accident happened?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050035"/>S. Clark. About five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. I saw him lying on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him sit down in the window at first?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. No, I did not; but I saw him sitting there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him all the time?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. No, only about five or six minutes; after I had seen him sitting I heard the fall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body in the room?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. I only saw Mr. Blower in the room besides.</p>
               <p>Q. How wide is the street?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. It may be twelve or thirteen yards wide.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you near enough to hear what was said?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. I heard some high words, but I do not know who they were between; I did not take notice of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether they were between the deceased Walker and any body else?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How many voices did you hear in the room?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you observe at that time whether Walker was sober or fuddled?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. That I cannot tell. for I did not give ear at all to what they were talking of; they were talking aloud, but I did not think what would happen.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you about at the time?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. I was sitting at work with my needle at the window in my room, and heard a talking very loud; they were at a play, which I believe they call rolipoly, that was said afterwards; I did not see them at it, but I heard them. When I heard something fall, I ran down stairs directly, and there saw Walker lying in the street. I looked up directly, and said to Mr. Tipton, how could you fling a man so out at the window?</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Tipton ?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. He was then looking out at window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Walker lying upon the ground when you was looking from your own window?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Tipton at the window then?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. No, I did not; but when I came down he stood looking out at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Tipton say when you spoke to him ?</p>
               <p>Clark. He d - 'd me for a bitch, and said he did not come out at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he came from ?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. He said he was coming from Mr. Strong's along the penthouse, and fell down.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Mr. Strong live?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. His house is next to Tipton's; there is a penthouse under that window all along, which joins both houses; it is shelving, but people may walk along it, if they take care.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Walker on that penthouse?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed next?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. I saw Tipton come down to his own tap-room, and fling up the window; he stood and swore, but I went away to my own room, my child crying, so heard nothing of what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Tipton in the room, while Walker was sitting at the window?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How then came you to ask him how he could do so, to throw the man out of the window ?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. Because he is a very dissolute man in swearing and cursing; I have seen him in passions several times, which gave me reason to think so; I had no other reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any body saw him fall?</p>
               <p>S. Clark. I can't tell whether any of the other witnesses did or not.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was this before the accident?</p>
               <p>H. Parlament. This was I believe about a fortnight before; when there has been a squable amongst other people, who was going, and they have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050037"/> had words amongst themselves, Mr. Tipton has taken it up.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he take him up?</p>
               <p>H. Parlament. He took him up with one hand under his legs, his head lying on his left arm, and said d - n your soul I will burl you out of the window, putting his legs out as far as his thighs.</p>
               <p>Q. What size was the deceased?</p>

            . I am a Nurse belonging to St. Bartholomew's hospital; the next day, when Mr. Potts ordered a double watch to be with the deceased, I was one, and on the 24th of August, his master Mr. Andrews came in the morning and said to him, do you know me, Will; he said, yes; then, said he, tell me how the affair happened, and inquired of him whether he jump'd out at the window, or whether he fell out, or how it was; he said, he flung me out; his master said, what he, and he replied, Tipton. Then his master asked him who was in the room besides Tipton and he, and he said Blower; then he asked him if Blower touch'd him, and he said, No; he asked him how he flung him out, and he said he took me up in his arms and flung me out so, putting his arms out. [She describes with her hands how he described it to her.]</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any declarations at any other time?</p>
               <p>E. Gosling. Once at another time I heard him say something of it. I asked him one day, and said, Will, will you tell me how this affair happened? He seemed to be very solitary, and told me he would not tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he died?</p>
               <p>E. Gosling. I believe it was three weeks or a month before he died: I was with him eight weeks before he died.</p>
               <p>Q. What were his words?</p>
               <p>E. Gosling. He said, no. I said, why will you not tell me? He said, it was of consequence, and of great consequence. I said, will you sooner suffer, and lose your own life, than tell who did it? He answered, yes, he would, and said no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing any other time?</p>
               <p>E. Gosling. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon him at any time to be sensible ?</p>
               <p>E. Gosling. He was sometimes in his senses, and sometimes not; oftentimes he would give a rational answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak intelligibly?</p>
               <p>E. Gosling. He spoke very intelligibly at the time his master asked him those questions. I can't swear he was ever a very sensible man in his life time, but he gave rational answers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him to know what he talked of?</p>
               <p>E. Gosling. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that you asked him that question?</p>
               <p>E. Gosling. That was about three weeks before he died.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the 24th of August to the beginning of October, had any body come to visit him ?</p>
               <p>E. Gosling. Nobody but his acquaintance to look at him.</p>
               <p>Q. Would he ever converse with them?</p>
               <p>E. Gosling. Sometimes he would speak to them, and sometimes not; he appeared upon a sulkish order. Sometimes he would give a rational answer, and sometimes not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this conversation between you and him, after that between him and his master?</p>
               <p>E. Gosling. It may be about a week or fortnight after that.</p>

               <p>Andrews. He being out of his time, I had no command of him. He was not used to that sort of liquor, which might take effect upon him; but I left him as sober as ever I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you go away?</p>
               <p>Andrews. It was about one o'clock.</p>

            . I was one that watched in the hospital, and watched the deceased Walker.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there the night he was brought in ?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. I was; the nurse was out, and I was in her place. After the operation was over, two or three friends came in to see him, and asked him how he came by this accident. He said, Tipton sing him cut at the window. Twice the first night, and the next morning, upon the return of the nurse, he desired something to drink, so we lifted him up, and gave him something. Upon that, a patient seeing him lifted up, asked him how he happened by that accident. He answered, Tipton flung him out. The person in a minute or two asked him again, and he said Tipton. Some days after, his scull was trapanned again. I was by when Mr. Andrews his master came and asked him some questions; it was in a morning, and the other person also was present: The deceased then had two people constantly by his bedside. His master asked him how he did, and if he knew him. The deceased said, you are Mr. Andrews, my master. He said, Billy, how happened this accident, had you no quarrel with these people? He said, no, but I scored false. Mr. Andrews said, did you fall out of the window, or how was it? He said, no, Tipton took him in his arms, and flung him out so ( extending his arm.)</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. I cannot recollect the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the surgeon had been there that day?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. No, it was before their time of dressing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he was sensible?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. Sometimes he had intervals of sense, but I do not swear he was sensible, though he was sometimes; generally he was not sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you look upon him to have been in liquor or not, at the time he was brought into the hospital?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. At that time I look'd upon him to be very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish his being in liquor, or was it from the effect of the blow he received in the fall?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. I never heard any bad language from him but then, when he cursed and swore during the operation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he curse and swear the second operation?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he used to complain at any time?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. He always expressed a very great sense of pain.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the question, Who threw him out, or Did Tipton throw him out?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. The question was, whether he fell out, or whether he had been flung out; he said, Tipton flung him out.</p>

Mrs. Andrew stoop'd down to the bed to him and said, Will, do you know me, and he answer'd yes; she said, who am I, and he answer'd, Andrews, Mrs. Andrews; she said, who did this to you, and he answer'd, Tipton. It was towards twelve o'clock, and as the surgeons were coming, I and Mrs. Andrews were put out, and he was trapan'd; when he saw them put me out of the ward, he called Mother, Mother, several times, very loud, I heard him a pretty way off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you spoke to him then?</p>
               <p>M. Guidner. I had not, but I went every day after that, to see him, according as my time would permit; I went very often, and his sister too.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find him as to his senses?</p>
               <p>M. Guidner. Sometimes not sensible, and at other times very sensible; he would take me by the hand and ask me to kiss him, and said God bless you several times; they were afraid of his being put into a fever, by talking too much.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it the master and mistress and you were there?</p>

            . I am a nurse belonging to the hospital, but was not there the day the deceased was brought in. The next day I was there, when he said he was very dry, and desired to be lifted up to drink; a person that was by asked him who threw him out of the window, and he answer'd Tipton; the same person stood some time longer and then asked him again, when he said Tipton a second time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in the hospital?</p>
               <p>A. Cooley. He was nine week and some odd days; I was with him all the day, and every other night.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition was he, as to his senses?</p>
               <p>A. Cooley. At the instant he was lifted up he seem'd to speak the two words sensibly, but he did not continue so, sometimes he appear'd a little sensible, and at other times out of his senses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he mostly in his senses, or mostly not?</p>
               <p>A. Cooley. He spake but little.</p>

               <p>Q. What people attended him?</p>
               <p>A. Cooley. There were two people with him night and day for the first fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he then as to his senses?</p>
               <p>A. Cooley. He was very bad, out of his senses at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Potts. Did you perceive him at any time to have any degree of sense, so as to conclude him rational?</p>
               <p>Potts. He was so very ungovernable, and so irrational, that we were obliged to confine him with what we call a strait waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. I should be glad to know whether you have not in your practice met with persons extremely delirious, who have mentioned particular persons names, as to the recollection of a mother, or any thing of that kind, that might seem to import sense, notwithstanding they were at the same time delirious.</p>
               <p>Potts. They will call out to particular persons without doubt. I can only speak what I said before, that he never gave me a rational or sensible answer, he never gave me any thing like an intelligible answer in my hearing, but these people staid with him a great deal longer than I did; I do not speak this to invalidate what they have said.</p>

            . I was at the prisoner's house that day, I came there at twelve o'clock, his house is in Arthur-street; I had been to take this house of Mr. Tipton some time before, as he was going to leave it, and I was about leaving mine; I had been that day in Petticoat-lane, and met with him at the sign of the crown, a house called my Lord Mills's, I don't know the name of the place; he said, Blower, will you go home along with me; with all my heart, said I, and went along with him; we went up one pair of stairs, and he asked me if I would have a game at rolipoly; I said, with all my heart, and we had a game; I had never seen the game but once before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you play with?</p>
               <p>Blower. Mr. Tipton.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased in the room when you went there first?</p>
               <p>Blower. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been there when he came in?</p>
               <p>Blower. We had been there about half an hour; when he came in we had no discourse, but just how<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050041"/> do you do, and how do you do, for he used Mr. Tipton's house and mine too.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do upon coming in?</p>
               <p>Blower. He sat down on a chair or a bench, or something of that nature.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he play?</p>
               <p>Blower. He never played while we were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his sitting in the window?</p>
               <p>Blower. I do, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the window did he sit?</p>
               <p>Blower. The last time that he sat in the window, he sat in the seat of it, with his arm out upon the ledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he sit before he went to the window seat?</p>
               <p>Blower. Before that he sat upon a chair, in which I believe he scored f or us some time. Mr. Andrews came in, and he played two rubbers with me. After that he said he could stay no longer, and desired his man to go home, as his business was in great haste.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go home?</p>
               <p>Blower. No, he did not. As soon as Mr. Andrews went out of the room, there was one

             came up stairs and sat down, and I believe he might score for us; I cannot say whether he did or not, but he went out of the room. Then there were only us three, the deceased scored for us; he scored so long that I believe he was in liquor, and when he was in liquor he was quite helpless, you might carry him by his head and legs, and it was impossible to awake him; he had done scoring for us: I told him he did not score right, and desired him to sit down, and we would score for ourselves. He went and sat down in the window seat, with his arm over the window. I took no farther notice of him. We were quite still, and had not an angry word all the time we were in the room, neither one nor other of us. He sat there I believe the best part of an hour; at that time it might be about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he there?</p>
               <p>Blower. He was there about three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. What liquor had you in the time you were there together?</p>
               <p>Blower. I believe we might have about four shillings worth of brandy and water, or rum and water; but I believe it was brandy and water.</p>

               <p>Blower. What became of him I could not tell, for really I did not miss him. Mr. Tipton missing him said, d - n my blood, the first man that goes out of that window again, I will make him suffer for it. I asked him the reason of that. He said, they make it a common practice of going over the penthouse from the window into the next house. Then I did not take any farther notice of the man. In about a minute or two after Mrs. Tipton came upstairs (the person was out of window) and said, how can you play? Why? said I. Said she, there is a man lying dead in the street, and the mob say he was flung through the window; we went down stairs directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you doing when she came up?</p>
               <p>Blower. We were playing then, I was going to bowl. I went down stairs, and Mr. Tipton after me; I went and stood in the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Mr. Tipton?</p>
               <p>Blower. I believe he might go out at the door; the mob said, d - n him, d - n him, making such a noise, that I could not stay in the tap room any longer. I went backwards into the kitchen, and sat down there, and after a little time Mr. Andrews came into the kitchen (he was headborough) to make inquiry how it was. I said, go your way, take care of the man, and send him to the hospital, for I will not stir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Tipton meddle with him in the club room?</p>
               <p>Blower. I don't believe Mr. Tipton ever touched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it possible if any person in that room had taken this man and thrown him out of the room, but you must have seen him?</p>
               <p>Blower. I think it is impossible but I must have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body lay hands on him?</p>
               <p>Blower. I never saw any body touch him, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man in liquor?</p>
               <p>Blower. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue your gaming without stoping?</p>
               <p>Blower. We did, and when Mrs. Tipton came up we had bowled twice a piece, which was after this man was gone out of the window, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you played after he sat in the window?</p>
               <p>Blower. We played for almost an hour and half after he sat there.</p>
               <p>Q. How large is the room?</p>
               <p>Blower. It is but a small place; I believe it is not six yards over. I was never up stairs there but once in my life before. They tell me Mr. Strong's men have gone backwards and forwards there over that place from one house to the other.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050042"/>Q. How long had he left off scoring?</p>
               <p>Blower. He had left off scoring, and continued sitting there half an hour and better.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue playing all the time?</p>
               <p>Blower. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of play is it?</p>
               <p>Blower. In the middle of the room there are fifteen or sixteen brass nails on the floor, and there is a bowl almost in the shape of a bowl dish, which runs round, and comes in any where, where it happens, and knocks down pins which stand upon the brass nails.</p>
               <p>Q. Does one bowl such a number of bowls, and then the other, or how?</p>
               <p>Blower. One bowls first, and then the other.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you were bowling, when Tipton said he would make them suffer that went out at the window again, what was you doing?</p>
               <p>Blower. I was just going to bowl, and he had just bowled before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before?</p>
               <p>Blower. I do not believe he had bowled a minute before, nor nothing like it; I bowled as soon as the pins were set up again.</p>
               <p>Q. How many might he knock down?</p>
               <p>Blower. He might knock down four or five.</p>
               <p>Q. Who set the pins up?</p>
               <p>Blower. I believe we both set them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the deceased was not in the window at that time you were setting up the pins ?</p>
               <p>Blower. I am not sure he was not; we were both very eager of play.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he sitting from the pins?</p>
               <p>Blower. He was sitting just by them.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were the pins from the window?</p>
               <p>Blower. They were about two yards and half from the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to the pins do you stand when you bowl?</p>
               <p>Blower. We do not stand half a yard from the pins; the bowl has a bias, and it runs round; when he was bowling he stood on the other side of the pins, not that side which the window is of; the pins were betwixt him and the window when he bowled.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he bowled, can you say yes or no, whether Walker was still in the window?</p>
               <p>Blower. That I cannot say, I did not miss him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive the deceased had moved?</p>
               <p>Blower. No, I did not; we set up the pins, and fell to play again assoon as they were up.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you take upon yourself to say, Tipton did not move near the window?</p>
               <p>Blower. I don't believe he moved near it, but I can't be sure, for I never thought of any such thing happening.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it is possible for a man to be in that room and another fling him out of the window, without your seeing him.</p>
               <p>Blower. I think it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the room was he in when he called out?</p>
               <p>Blower. He was between the pins and the window then.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the window?</p>
               <p>Blower. About two yards from it.</p>
               <p>Q. What posture was he in?</p>
               <p>Blower. He stood still, but seem'd to be in a passion about it; he stood upright, as I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. In what position was you?</p>
               <p>Blower. I was stooping down.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was your face?</p>
               <p>Blower. My face was towards him and the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how long it was between Tipton's bowling and his calling out?</p>
               <p>Blower. It might be a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that was the most?</p>
               <p>Blower. I don't believe it was more.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Walker at the time of his calling out?</p>
               <p>Blower. He was then out at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him out at the window?</p>
               <p>Blower. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. After you missed Walker out of the room, did Tipton go to the window ?</p>
               <p>Blower. Yes, he did, and look'd thro' the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say then?</p>
               <p>Blower. I did not hear him say any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body call to him out of the street?</p>
               <p>Blower. I did not hear any body call to him. I went to the window as well as he after him, but the penthouse being almost a yard broad, we could not see the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see?</p>
               <p>Blower. There was a croud of people there. Mrs. Tipton came up to us.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did she come up after you missed Walker?</p>
               <p>Blower. She came up in a minute or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself with certainty, and of your own knowledge, to say that Tipton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050043"/> did not throw this man out of the window?</p>
               <p>Blower. I swear I never saw him touch him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear he did not go towards him, before he went out at the window?</p>
               <p>Blower. I can swear I did not see him meddle with him; we both went towards him, we always went round our pins, and he was very near us.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you can swear you never saw him touch him, will you swear he did not touch him?</p>
               <p>Blower. No, I will not swear that; he might touch him when my back was towards him, but I cannot think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance of time was it between your seeing Walker sitting in the window, and people crying out and the like, as you mention?</p>
               <p>Blower. It might be two or three minutes. I did not miss him till Mr. Tipton spoke as I have mention'd; and he told me it was usual for people to go out of that window upon the penthouse.</p>

               <p>Bradley. The room is on the first floor, and our workshop is on the same; there is a penthouse that runs along before that window and also our workshop window, we are used to walk along that penthouse from our shop to that window, the two houses are together.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house do you mean?</p>
               <p>Bradley. Mr. Strong's house and Mr. Tipton's.</p>

               <p>Q. How high is the lower frame of the window, to step out upon the penthouse?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. It is but a trifle of a way, not far; I have several times went out at that window, two or three times in a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a place where you could walk safe along?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. I have walked safe along it several times, and another person may do it; I only put my hand against the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. How wide is it?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. I believe it may be a foot and a half wide, or more; I worked in the next house, and was a lodger in the publick house, and sometimes when I was lock'd out I used to go that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any body else that ever went that way besides yourself?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is that penthouse?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. If a person was to hang by his hands upon it, his feet might be two or three feet from the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Walker fall?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him after he fell?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. I saw him in a few moments after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. I asked him who threw him out of the window; he said, Tipton and Blower. This was as soon as ever he could speak; whether he was in his senses or not, I cannot say.</p>

            . I saw Walker at that middle window.</p>
               <p>Q. What day, and what time of the day?</p>
               <p>M. Dhwith. Betwixt three and four in the afternoon of the 15th of August, the day he fell down.</p>
               <p>Q. In what posture did he stand?</p>
               <p>M. Dhwith. I was very busy washing at my own shop, facing Mr. Tipton's house. I went to the door to throw out some water, and saw Walker sitting. I said take care or you'll be down. I went in again, and I never saw him more; he had one leg out at the window, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you called to him to take care?</p>
               <p>M. Dhwith. Because I had known him a great while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think him in a posture likely to fall?</p>
               <p>M. Dhwith. I don't know; he might sit out at a window and not fall.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe how he was sitting?</p>
               <p>M. Dhwith. To the best of my knowledge he sat with one leg out of the window, and I saw him no more till I saw him in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his legs touch the penthouse?</p>
               <p>M. Dhwith. I don't believe they did, they were too short; I held up my hand and said, take care, you'll be down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make you any answer?</p>
               <p>M. Dhwith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say one leg was over the window, where was his body?</p>
               <p>M. Dhwith. He sat right up, cross the place, cross the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that did he fall down?</p>

               <p>Q. to Blower. When you saw him sitting in the window seat, the last time you saw him in the room, how was he sitting?</p>
               <p>Blower. He was sitting in the window seat with his arm leaning on the frame.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him sitting cross the window frame?</p>
               <p>Blower. No, I never did.</p>

               <p>Blower. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. to M. Dhwith. Do you know anything more that is material?</p>
               <p>M. Dhwith. I can't believe otherwise than that Tipton threw him out at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you believe so?</p>

            . I saw Walker near 4 o'clock. I went right against the house of Mr. Tipton to fetch an empty basket, shutting the door after me. I saw Walker out at the window. I catch'd the basket up and look'd at him, he was holding by the frame of the window, standing on the penthouse, he was in his shirt, with neither hat nor cap on, but I took the basket and went along.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Walker ?</p>
               <p>Cambridge. I had seen him before. My master filled the basket with rubbish, and I carry'd it a little way. When I came back again, I saw people running to this house, and said to my master, I cannot think what is the matter at Mr. Tipton's, there are a great many people there. My master went to see what was the matter, and I saw the people running very thick. My master came back to me and said, I wish you had not sent me. I asked him why, and he said because Tipton had push'd a man out at the window; then I said I saw him out at the window before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it that you saw him on the penthouse, before you saw the people running?</p>
               <p>Cambridge. It was about five minutes; he was holding by the frame of the window, with his back towards the street.</p>

               <p>M. Thomas. I was facing the window, standing at a door; he was with his knee on the ledge of the window, with his foot just out, and his right-hand upon the penthouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue looking at him?</p>
               <p>M. Thomas. I did not continue any time at all; I went home about my master's business.</p>

               <p>Q. Which knee was it?</p>
               <p>M. Thomas. His right knee was upon the ledge, his right foot was just over the ledge, and his right-hand down on the penthouse.</p>

               <p>M. Thomas. To the best of my remembrance it was about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before the bustle began, or before you heard it?</p>

            . I have measured the distance from the penthouse to the street, from the top of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050045"/> the penthouse next to the window cill is 13 feet 10 inche to the ground, and from the top of the penthouse to the window cill is 6 inches, 3 the cill, and 3 the brick work; a person may very well put his hand out and lean upon the penthouse.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you measure it?</p>
               <p>Hubbord. I measur'd it to day twice; the penthouse is 2 foot 2 inches wide, and I believe it is about 12 foot 8 from the penthouse to the ground.</p>

               <p>Hubbord. That I did not measure, but I believe it is 10 or 11 inches, that is, from the window seat to the sash cill of the window, the lower frame; the place where the deceased's head lay is sideways, I do not mean right forwards into the street, but slantways, 7 foot 5 inches from the middle of the window, and it is 5 foot 3 inches from the penthouse, that is, the drip-edge.</p>

            , at Guildhall, last sessions; it was for an assault committed by them on Langrin, the prisoner at the bar. The two prisoners at the bar gave evidence on that trial against the three defendants I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners sworn?</p>
               <p>Shaw. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the evidence Langrin gave ?</p>
               <p>Shaw. He swore he went into the house of Davis (who at that time kept the Crown alehouse in Crown Court, Fleet Street) and called for three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050046"/> pints of beer, the first he drank himself, the second he drank part of, and the third pint that was brought him was water; that when he put the pot to his mouth, Davis gave the bottom of the pot a chuck, which threw the water upon him, struck against the side of his face, and knocked out two of his teeth, which he then shewed in his hands: After that Davis knocked him down against the fire place, and as soon as he got up again Mrs. Davis struck him on the back part of his head with a pint pot that she had in her hand, which caused a large swelling, which he then shewed in court, on the back part of his head, and said that he never had that swelling there before; that Davis spoke to Griffice in Welch to beat him, the said Langrin, and that Griffice did knock him down three times in the house; that by reason of this beating, and what happened to him that night, he was obliged to lie by for near three months, and said he was not able at that time [meaning the time of his giving this evidence] of working as before.</p>

             gave on that trial?</p>
               <p>Shaw. Carter swore he came accidentally into that house, at that time, for a pint of beer, which was brought him; that just after he came in he saw Mr. Davis bring Langrin a pint of water, that he saw Langrin give Mrs. Davis three halfpence for it, and did not see her return it to him again; he said, when Langrin was going to drink the water he saw Mr. Davis chuck the water out of the pot upon Langrin, and struck the pot against his cheek, which knock'd one of his teeth out, and that he saw the tooth afterwards; that afterwards he saw Davis knock Langrin down, and when Langrin got up he saw Mrs. Davis strike Langrin a violent blow on his head with a pint pot, which she had in her hand, and said he saw Griffice knock Langrin down in the house, but did not name the time. I remember Langrin said he had known Carter 11 years, and when Carter was asked how long he had known Langrin he at first said he had known him 2 years, and being asked again that question, then he said he had known him no more than 3 years.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this trial?</p>

               <p>Q. Is what Mr. Shaw has said here true or false?</p>
               <p>Davis. He has said the truth; the two prisoners swore what he has related.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Langrin's coming to your house ?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Davis. It was the 9th of November was twelve months; I then lived at the Crown in Crown-court, Fleet-Street, but I left that house in January last.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you draw him a pint of water?</p>
               <p>Davis. No, I did not; he began to quarrel, and I did not chuse to draw him any more beer, then he said if I would not, he would draw it himself, and taking a pint pot went down into the cellar; I was afraid of his doing some mischief, in letting the liquor out, so took a candle and went down after him; there was a butt of water stood all the same as a butt of beer, with a cock in it, fronting the cellar stairs; when I saw him going to that, I was very well pleased, and he went up with a pint of water, and I after him. I step'd on one side while he drew it, and he did not see me. I was behind him, and saw him give my wife three half-pence, I whispered her, and said, you should not take it, for it is only water, so she gave it him again; he put the pint to his mouth, and finding it was water said. what have you given me here, d - n you, what have you given me here, and flung it in my face. I had said not a syllable to him, neither did I meddle or make with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you chuck the pot in his face?</p>
               <p>Davis. No I did not, I stood behind him.</p>

             I was as sober as I am now. When he threw the water into my face, my wife went to him and desired him to get out of my house. He then went into a box, aad laid his head down on his arm for 2 or 3 minutes, and nobody minded him; then he jumped up and went out into the court (nobody said any thing) where he cried murder as loud as he could.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Davis. I remember this affair; it was last Lord-mayor's day was twelvemonth, at night. Langrin gave me three halfpence, and my husband told me he had got only water, so I returned him his three halfpence again, and he flung the water over my husband's face; but my husband never touched him nor the pot while it was in his hand. I took hold of his shoulder to put him out of the house, but I never struck him either with the pot or any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband talk Welch to Mr. Griffice?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Davis. I do not understand Welch. Griffice sat drinking with another man at the time, but he never stirred out of the box, neither did he strike him; and as to

            . I have known Langrin between nine and ten years, I work'd with him about that time at one Mr. Levit's, in Salisbury-Court; we used sometimes to fit bare headed, and he had then a bump on the back part of his head, I can't tell how it came. [The prisoner shew'd his naked head, and on the back part of it was a bump about as big as half a middling orange.] That I have seen as it now appears near ten years ago; he always was a quarrelsome man.</p>

               <p>Carter's Defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Langrin told me the trial was to come on. I went to one Gregory at Limehouse, who gave me an order to take 4 s. 6 d. for him at the court of conscience at Guildhall, and going to receive it Langrin met me full-butt; and gave me a subpaena and a shilling. I went to an alehouse, and asked a stranger if I must appear to it, who said I must, or else pay 40 l. or suffer one year's imprisonment. I went out of the way that I might not hear his examination, and when he had done I went into court and gave mine.</p>
               <p>Langrin called Erick his brother, who gave him a good character.</p>
