I am a cycle agent, trading as Buckingham and Adams, 46 and 48, Queen Victoria Street—on 26th January Francis called, and said he called for advertisements for Cassell and Co; he said he had a book which would be sent round to all the principal hotels—he showed me the book, and wrote Buckingham and Adams on the inside of the back of the cover; he said they were shortly going to press, and he offered me the half-page for £2—I beat him down to £1—I gave him a cheque for £1—when I parted with the cheque I believed Cassell and Co, Belle Sauvage Yard, were the publishers bf this book—I drew the cheque to the order of Cassell and Co—it is endorsed Cassell and Co—I got this receipt, signed "Agent, A Francis"</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not examined before the Magistrate—there is no indictment for stealing an umbrella; there will be; the umbrella has been identified; no one has charged the prisoner with stealing it—Francis said he had the use of Dr Harcourt's office at 31, Brooke Street for two months past—I have endeavoured to get Dr Harcourt here; he is not here—he said, "This does not look much like a fraud, when I have taken orders for it today"—I believe all the people mentioned in the counterfoils have been communicated with; there are similar cases to these—Mr. Smith, of Old Broad Street, declined to come, but we have got his receipt—I know of one instance where a person who gave an order said he would pay after publication of the book—he wanted to come as a witness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a married woman, I and my husband keep the Post-office at East Barnet—on 1st October a man (not the prisoner) came in for 5s. worth of postage stamps—he gave me half a sovereign—I had not sufficient change, and went into my back parlour to get silver, after locking the shop drawer—I opened my cupboard, and took the cash-box out of the drawer; I heard a rustling of paper in the shop—I looked through the glass door, and saw the prisoner in my shop, emptying my counter drawer into a black bag which he had—the counter drawer contained postal orders of the value of £40, and stamps, the property of the Postmaster-General—I did not see the first man then—I came towards the shop; the prisoner met me as I came into it—he clutched me by the throat tightly, pushing me back to the table where my cash-box was standing in the inner room—he lifted the tray containing £42 18s., belonging to the Postmaster-General, and £19, my own private money, from the cash-box, and put it into the bag—I was struggling with him at this time; he continued to hold me with his left hand, and prevented my calling out—I repossessed myself of the postal orders he had' then from the drawer—just then I heard my sister's step coming up the stairs—the prisoner then beat me violently about the head, face, neck and hands, with some instrument; I don't know what—I became insensible—when I came to I found the man was gone, and my sister was standing by my side—one of the postal orders was bespattered with my blood—as soon as the prisoner came towards me I recognised him as a man I had seen about two years previously, when he called to inspect the water tank—I asked him if he came from the Barnet Company—he said no, he came from the London District Water Co—my sister, Miss Crick, was present on that occasion, and saw him—I did not hear anything of the Water Company afterwards—in October, sixteen days after the robbery, some persons were brought to me for the purpose of identification—the prisoner was not one of them, and I did not identify anyone—on 12th April I was taken to Bow Street, and I picked the prisoner out from others as soon as I could speak—as soon as I had sufficiently recovered from the effects of my injuries, I gave a description to the police of my assailant—I was for a considerable time under the doctor's hands; he is still attending me—I got much worse after the first fortnight—I am still suffering—I am lame, which I was not before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am timekeeper to Mr. Fortescue, a contractor, who was doing work in March in Brady Street, Mile End Road, and the prisoner was employed in carting away rubbish—whenever a load of rubbish was carted away I signed a separate ticket, and gave it to the carman—the tickets were dated—he employed three carmen, Smith, Pulbrook, and Crittler—these tickets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were brought to me on 22nd March—they represent twenty-seven loads—sixteen of them are signed by me, the other eleven are not, nor did I give them to anybody—they are larger than my tickets, and they do not correspond with my numbers—I never had the book with these numbers in it—here are forty-three tickets for the week ending 29th March, twenty-two of which are genuine and twenty-one are not—I never gave them out; they came from the same book as the others—all the tickets I used that week were numbered 23,000 or upwards—the prisoner's carmen took out sixteen loads the week ending March 22nd, which correspond with the tickets, and twenty-two for the week ending 29th March—I enter them as the loads go out—the prisoner came there once, and took a load away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The practice was for the carmen to report to the prisoner or his wife, or whoever took the management, how many loads were taken out—he was dependent upon them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's clerk—it is part of my duty to receive the tickets, which are brought in on Fridays by the carmen, for the rubbish they have carted away—on Friday, March</p>

               <p>22nd, I found these tickets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under the door, and next day Mrs. Madge came for the cheque represented by them, and I handed her a cheque for £2 odd; she signed this receipt—this account was delivered with the tickets; it is for £2 9s. 3d., and purports to be an account of the money owing to Madge by my master for carting twenty-seven loads this "hire of cart" means that Madge had not enough carts, and we let him have one, and deducted the amount—on Friday, March 29, Mrs. Madge brought me these two bundles of tickets marked "F and G"—Mr. Fortescue and I had then been examining and inquiring into the previous transaction—Mrs. Madge came again on the Saturday, and I had the cheque drawn out, but it was not paid because Mr. Fortescue was not there, and I knew that he did not mean paying—these fictitious cheques are from a book we were using eighteen months ago—the prisoner was not in the service then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was the practice to leave the tickets one day, and come for the money the next—I had seen Mrs. Madge there on previous occasions; she brought the tickets, but Mr. Madge usually came for the money—she would know that the tickets were left there to be checked—the account for that Friday showed forty-three loads—when she came on Saturday she said, "Have you found my tickets under the door?"—I said, "I don't recollect," and I opened the door and found this account—I did not notice that it was made out, "Debtor to Mrs. Madge," but my attention was called to it at the Police-court—I have seen her write; it is in the same writing as the receipt, which is signed, "Mrs. Madge"—I do not know whether her name is Emma—the cheque is payable to E Madge—I should say that the endorsement is in the same writing.</p>

I am a builder and contractor, of Hackney—in March last I was doing work at Brady Street, Mile End Road—I employed the prisoner to cart away rubbish at 2s. 3d. a load—he has worked for me several years on and off—I did not know Mr. Madge—I paid for the carting on the production of tickets signed by him—on March 23rd I signed this cheque for £2 9s. 9d. to pay Madge on the faith of the twenty-seven tickets being genuine, and of the prisoner having carted away twenty-seven loads—I afterwards examined the tickets with my clerk Underwood, who called my attention to the tickets not being the right numbers, and that it was not Wingrove's writing on them—the book from which the forged tickets were taken has not been in use for eighteen months or two years—I put the matter in the hands of the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I paid the prisoner's wife latterly more than in years gone by—I said before the Magistrate, "I believe he does not write, he has to make a mark, and his wife does all the business;" but I believe that was a mistake, because I have turned up a quantity of bills signed by himself—his wife usually made out his bills—I believe the endorsement on this cheque to be hers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs Lewis and Allenby, and have the control of the counting-house business I knew the prisoner at Warwick's, the jewellers, many years—MR. Arthur Lewis sent for me on 8th July, 1887, and asked me to get a diamond bracelet, which was stated to have cost £325, which had been left with us as part security for a large amount of money owing to the firm—the prisoner was there, and Mr. Lewis asked him what he considered the value—he gave me no answer, and Mr. Lewis said, "Do you think you can sell it?"—he said for about £80 or £90 in trade—I said that I could not take less than £130—Mr. Lewis asked him what his commission would be—he said he should be perfectly satisfied with 5 per cent—I handed him the bracelet, and he wrote this memorandum, and signed it; it is dated July 28th, 1887—this "5 per cent, commission" in red ink was put by Mr. Lewis—I saw the prisoner several times afterwards, and had conversations with him, but no alteration was made in the terms—after January 5th, 1888, letters passed between me and the prisoner; until I saw this document (<hi rend="italic">A pawnbroker's contract</hi>) I had no idea that the bracelet had been pawned—I saw the prisoner on March 29th, 1889, in Marlborough Street, where he was charged on another matter, and that was the first time I knew that it had been pawned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoner a few days after Christmas Day, he had not sold the bracelet, and I pressed him to return it—after January 3 he asked if I would take a lower price than £130, and I have a faint recollection that £100 was mentioned, but I would not entertain it—it would have been very cheap at that price—I know that it was eventually sold for £60—two bracelets were deposited with us as collateral security for a debt, and the payments were not kept up—the estate went into liquidation and then we endeavoured to realise it—he returned it in December, we kept it for a few days, and then gave it back to him to sell—there was no written document; the terms were precisely the same as on the first occasion, except that he wished me to fix it at a lower price—I refused, but said, "If you sell it shortly I will give you extra commission"—MR.

I carry on business with Israel Joel on Fish Street Hill as fish contractors—Barnard has been in our employ about five years—on 6th April, in the morning, he took out fish of ours, among which was 29 lbs of soles—I saw a sack of soles at the station—the soles were worth 29s.—the sack was not ours.</p>

I am a flower-seller and am single, and live at 23, Shalor Street, Drury Lane—on 6th April I went into the Sun Public-house and saw the prisoner there, and his brother and another young man—there had been a dispute between the prisoner's brother and my aunt, and I said something about who had struck her—the prisoner's brother said he would do it again—the prisoner did not speak to me, but struck me with a glass tumbler on my right eye—I fell unconscious, and she had</p>

I am a bill discounter, of Wardour Street—on 28th January the prisoner brought me this bill of exchange for ££300, to be discounted—I gave him a crossed cheque for ££230, payable to his order—that is 46 per cent, I think, but it is 22 1/2 per cent, on the amount—he said nothing at the time about doing the bill for anybody else—he was introduced to me, and asked me whether I would discount this bill—I told him I did not care much about discounting six months' bills—he said, "Oh, the parties are all right; you have nothing to fear"—he produced a paper, I think the <hi rend="italic">Echo</hi>, showing that Osmond or Shearman was on the County Council—I said 12 1/2 was the percentage for a three months' and 22 1/2 for a six months' bill—I asked him to accept the bill—he endorsed it, and I gave him a cheque—on the 29th, the next day, he brought the cheque back, and asked me to make it "Pay cash"—I altered it accordingly, and he took it away—it has been returned by my bankers—it has been endorsed "John Watson"—that he gave as his name—I passed on the bill to my bankers.</p>

I am one of the firm of Miller, Wiggins, and Naylor, solicitors—in 1887 I was instructed by Freeman to act as his solicitor in respect of a claim he made on the Phoenix Fire Office in reference to a fire on his premises, 3, Cropley Street; that claim was resisted by the office, and referred to arbitration—I acted for him up to the conclusion of the arbitration—after the award was made I saw Freeman shortly after 20th June, and read him a copy of the award which found the claim to be fraudulent—I asked him what he proposed to do in reference to our account—he said he should not pay anything—I said, as he had been unsuccessful, I should be willing to make any reasonable arrangement he thought fit—he was very angry, and refused to pay a farthing—during the litigation I had applied to him for money—I received these letters from him (<hi rend="italic">One, of 7th April, said he was sorry to say he was disappointed in money matters that day, but that he would call on Monday; another in June that he had tried his utmost to raise more money for Counsel, etc, but had failed to do so; that he should be willing to appear if the solicitors could see their way to go on with the case.</hi>)—he told me once that it was very difficult for him to find the money—I sent him this letter on 23rd May (<hi rend="italic">This said that as he was unable to provide more money for Counsel they might appear for him before the arbitrator, and that their costs and expenses should be paid out of any money coming to him from the Insurance Company</hi>)—Freeman answered in one of the letters already read, I believe, and asked me to do the best I could for him—I did so—before June I had sent in my account, at Freeman's request—on 28th June I served a writ on Freeman for our costs—subsequently we obtained judgment under Order 14—on 15th August I presented a bankruptcy petition against him; that came before Mr. Registrar Brougham—Freeman was present—there were several adjournments from August to October, and on the last occasion the Registrar intimated that he must make the receiving order—I said I was prepared to leave the matter in the Registrar's hands, and to accept any terms he thought fair—the Registrar advised Freeman to accept my offer, but Freeman said he could pay nothing, and then the order was made—after the public examination I received instructions from the Chief Official, and acted for him as solicitor in applying, before Mr. Justice Cave, to set aside the deed—the prisoners were called as witnesses—Mr. Justice Cave's decision was to set aside the deed and hand over the lease to the Chief Official Receiver—the day after the application for the discharge by Freeman was appointed to be heard, and on that occasion he stated to the Registrar that the mortgagee would pay my claim in full—the Registrar said he could express no opinion on that, but adjourned the application—I had had a communication in Court on the first occasion from the prisoner to the same effect—I have nothing to do with this prosecution; I have simply acted under the direction of Mr. Brougham—the prosecution is conducted by the Treasury, not by me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Freeman came to me and mentioned a client of mine</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188905060056"/>
               <p>as a friend of his, and asked for advice—Mr. Mauro made out the claim against the Phoenix, I believe, for Freeman—I thought it was a good claim on what Freeman said—he said the office had offered £50 on account of his claim—possibly Mauro told me that—I was not consulted about that; it had already been declined as absurd—on what he told me I thought he was right in declining it—Freeman paid me from time to time money to meet out of pocket expenses, £31 in all—at that time the £31 had been exhausted, and I said in my letter of May I would go on, with or without Counsel, as he could not find any money, and that I should be rewarded out of the amount recovered—the arbitrator found the claim was fraudulent—I have not read the policy recently; I do not know that it says that, "If the claim be a false estimate it shall be deemed fraudulent"—the word fraudulent there has the same meaning as it ordinarily has—I was not asked to advise whether the £50 should be taken—that letter refers to another matter—if a man honestly made a false estimate it would not be a false estimate—I did not want my costs in full; I told Freeman I would take any reasonable sum he liked to offer—I delivered to him a bill of costs for £94 5s. 10d., down to 15th May, 1881; credit, £31; balance, £63 5s. 10d.—the reference lasted five or six days, full days, except the last one—on 27th June I issued a writ for £66 8s. 10d; I took out a summons under Order 14—went before the master, and applied for judgment, subject to taxation—I made an affidavit in support of my application, in which I swore he was indebted to me £6s. 5s. 10d.—that was to get summary judgment after taxation—I got judgment for the amount, for which the bill should be taxed—the bill was taxed afterwards, and the master took off £22 8s. 10d.—my affidavit was strictly correct—Freeman was at the taxing with his solicitors, Harmer and Smith—I then had a claim of £44 and £6 10s., the costs of the judgment—£49 2s. was the amount of the claim, including the taxation—I had to have £50 to make him bankrupt—I sent him another bill of costs, which he owed, £5 16s. 6d.—the last item of that was June 21st—we commenced our action immediately he said he would not pay a farthing—the first bill could not be included under the other bill, under the Statute—we did not include it because he said he would not pay—this bill has never been taxed—the £22 was deducted from the £90—the second bill made the amount over £50—I believe Freeman was not represented before the Registrar, he appeared in person—this petition was considered on the very point of the second bill being untaxed, and Mr. Registrar Brougham decided that it was in order—it was returned four or five times, and the matter fully gone into—Jacobs, Wilson, myself, and I think another man, were the only creditors—I don't know that the Official Receiver has in hand enough to pay me and everybody else 20s. in the pound—I cannot say if the lease of 3, Cropley Street, has 54 years to run—the ground-rent is £10—I should think it was worth between £300 and £400—that would pay my bill and all the official costs—I received a letter, in which I was told the bankruptcy could be annulled—I told Freeman if he was not prepared to pay cash I should be quite satisfied if he handed me the lease of his house—the Official Receiver got the deeds—I acted before the Official Receiver in the motion before Mr. Justice Cave—I had no information from Freeman about this lease, all the information I had was got from the public examination.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> No information I got from him was disclosed to anyone—I had nothing to do with the prosecutor; it was the Official Receiver—in the bill of costs all charges for work done was taken out by the taxing master, and a fee of six guineas put in for the whole—that was the difference—I was content to take whatever the taxing master allowed—Freeman has been represented by three different solicitors throughout the action.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs Clutton, of 9, Whitehall Place, surveyors—they are agents for the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, the freeholders of 3, Cropley Street—the Phoenix Fire Office paid money to us with reference to Freeman's insurance of that house—in January, 1889, Messrs Clutton had in their hands a balance of £85 on account of those payments—two previous payments had been made by Freeman under the policy, the last one in September, 1888—on 7th January, 1889, the two prisoners called, and Wilson produced this authority, dated 24th September, 1888, to receive the money—I knew Freeman had become bankrupt—I asked him if he had authority from the trustee in bankruptcy—he said, "This is my trustee," pointing to Wilson—I said, "If that is so, I will have a cheque drawn for a proportion of the amount due, the further instalment, and in order to save time you had better give a receipt now, and I will send the cheque on if it is all right"—I prepared a receipt, which Wilson signed—the word "trustee "was written after the signature—ultimately that receipt was returned to the prisoner—I saw it destroyed—before sending the cheque I caused inquiries to be made at the Bankruptcy Office, and in consequence I wrote to Freeman—(<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that he had been informed that no receiver had been appointed, and that he could not reconcile this with the statements they had made</hi>)—they came again; I asked them how it came that they made such a statement to me, describing Wilson as trustee in bankruptcy; I said I had ascertained at the Bankruptcy Office that the Official Receiver was still trustee, and that it was a very serious thing to make a statement of that kind—Wilson said he had mistaken the word trustee, and that he supposed the meaning of it was mortgagee—I have no recollection of the word mortgage or mortgagee being used at the first interview—the statement that Wilson was trustee was in answer to my statement that I required consent of the trustee in bankruptcy before I could pay over the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Wilson said, "I thought it meant mortgagee"—I don't think a person could make such a mistake, he did not say "mortgagee"—whatever he wrote was at the request of the cashier and myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He first signed his name "Wm Wilson," and I said, "We shall want the words 'Trustee in Bankruptcy' written after your signature"—I do not think he was likely to make a mistake between the two terms.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Serjeant C</hi>) I examined the warehouse on the morning of the 29th—I went to the upper part of the house, and found that the cord of the skylight had been forcibly broken and the window dropped; no glass was broken—there is a piece of waste land at the back of the warehouse—a scaffold pole had been placed up in the corner leading to the leads or flat; a person could climb up by that pole, and so get to the skylight, and they could get down into the warehouse by a sort of ladder formed by shelves about 18 inches apart—there were boot and finger marks on those shelves—I completely examined the inside of the warehouse, and found altogether five doors and drawers forced—I compared this chisel with the marks on the drawer and letter-box, and they exactly corresponded; it is an ordinary iron chisel, and was found in an area in Piccadilly by the witness Wyers, who gave it to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, The Parade, Forest Hill, and am manager to Messrs Austin, grocers—on 18th April the prisoner was in their service, and had been for some time—on 17th I saw a half sovereign, three half-crowns, and two shillings marked by Police-constable Bunting—about a quarter to two on the 18th I left the prisoner in sole charge of the shop—no one else was there, and I came out—I left 17s. in silver and a few coppers in the till, among it one half-crown resembling a bad half-crown, which I had noticed two or three days before—when I came back the prisoner said, "Since you have been gone to dinner I have sold two gammons of bacon; I have been busy"—I sent the prisoner out to dinner, and I examined the till and found 47s.—there were two half-sovereigns and the rest in silver—one of the half-sovereigns was one I had seen marked the day before; I also found two marked half-crowns and two marked shillings; so that I found all the marked coins with the exception of one half-crown—the peculiar half-crown was not there—about five minutes after the prisoner went to dinner, Detective Sampson came in and said something to me, in consequence of which I</p>

               <p>asked the prisoner, when he came back, about a quarter past three, for change for half a sovereign—he gave me 10s. of silver, which I looked through—I discovered one marked half-crown and the peculiar half-crown—later in the afternoon, about six o'clock, I was called into the back room when Mr. Austin and the prisoner were there—MR. Austin said to me in the prisoner's presence, "Was there a sovereign in the till?"—I said, "No"—the prisoner said, "I believe it was a Jubilee sovereign"—I said, "There was no sovereign"—I came away and heard no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Austin and his two brothers have seven other shops—I have been with them about three years; and at the Forest Hill shop about 15 months; before that I was an assistant—Austin purchased the business in November, 1887; and before that Mr. Smith had it, and the prisoner was assistant to Mr. Smith, I understood—I heard the prisoner say he had lived with Mr. Baynes, and that he was a member of the church choir for many years; and that he had obtained a distinguished prize at the Board school—the shop opens at half-past 7, and closes at half past 8 four nights in the week, and on Wednesdays at 5—the 18th was the Thursday before Good Friday; it was a very busy day—I live at the shop, and I open it—the prisoner comes to the shop at 8, after having, breakfast—as soon as he came I went to my room behind the shop, and had breakfast; the prisoner had entire control of the shop then—I took half an-hour, or a little more—when I came back the prisoner went out for orders—on the 18th he went on his round from 9 to half-past 9, I should think, and got back about half-past I with orders—there are two tills, one on the grocery and the other on the provision side of the shop—I put out no silver for change when I went to breakfast—he might not give a customer change out of his pocket without coming to me—it has never been done without the prisoner coming to me first—one might give change out of one's own pocket—Bunting marked the coins in the shop after it was closed in the presence of Sampson and myself; he stamped them all in the left corner of the crown with a very fine punch—I saw each one—he made no note of where he had marked them, nor did I—six coins and no more were marked, Sampson took charge of them—Sampson told me someone would bring them all and pass them all at once—the prisoner said he thought he had sold one of the gammons of bacon and several other articles to a lady who came from "Torresdale, "that is a house at Forest Hill—I did not see Mrs. Leverington there—I heard she asked to have the account reckoned up when she had spent 15s. 4d., and then she bought more, which made it 17s. 6d., and that was put down and then she made more purchases, which, added to the others, made up the amount except 1/2 d—according to that, if she did what was right, every coin should be marked—the prisoner did not say he had sold two gammons, one when I was at breakfast and one now—he said, "Since you have been at dinner I have been busy, and have sold two gammons of bacon"—he did not mention that she came from Torresdale, and had bought a great many other articles till I had counted up the till—it was an extraordinary thing to examine the till before he came in from his round; it was not usually done—there is no emptying of the tills at fixed times, and no testing the amount of copper; we take no account of it—the tills are started empty in the morning, with the exception of coppers, and if I go to my breakfast without taking anything, they are empty, except</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188905060064"/>
               <p>for coppers—having counted it at 1. 45, about 2. 30 I counted it again—no one else was present on either occasion—I found a marked half-sovereign, two marked half-crowns, and two marked shillings, five out of the six coins in the till—I did not call the prisoner's attention to the fact that a marked half-crown was missing—I said nothing to him about it—I waited till Sampson came—he came about twenty mintues to 3, and asked me the result—the prisoner knows the sergeant—he was not there when the sergeant came—I did not wait for the sergeant before counting, because I might have taken more silver from other customers—I did not take down the denomination nor description of the coins, nor count the coppers; there were very few coppers there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 16, Cross Road, Wimbledon, and am a general dealer, principally a buyer of drapery stocks—between eleven and twelve p. m. on 9th April I met two females in the Strand, and went with them in a cab to a house in Baron's Court, Waterloo Road—after a time they left me, and I was sitting on the side of the bed, when Harper seized me by the throat; I did not see him till he did so—I was thrown on my back on the bed, and while Harper held me down and knelt on my chest, Lanagan rifled my pockets and handed the contents to D'Arcy—I had started in the afternoon with £8, and I had something like £7 at this time loose in my pocket—I made as much noise as I possibly could, and the police rushed in and caught the prisoners in the act—they released me, and some money fell—I picked up a half-sovereign which dropped from the hand of one of the prisoners, I could not say which, I was too upset at the time.</p>

I am head-waiter at the Elephant and Castle—on Saturday, February 2nd, a man named Dudley, who I knew, came there with the prisoner Alcock, and handed me this cheque to change, but Alcock was not present then—I gave it back to Dudley—I was then upstairs in the dining-room—Alcock came up while I was there, but the Inspector came up before that—I was there when Dudley and Alcock were taken in custody—the Inspector spoke to me, and I did not part with any money.</p>

On 30th March I was cashier to Mr. Levy—I saw the prisoner in the shop that day, and Mr. Osmond instructed me to go with him, and take a parcel to the Garibaldi public-house, Camberwell Road—when I got there the prisoner took the parcel out of my hand, and said he was going upstairs to get the money out of his box—he did not return—I waited about ten minutes, but never saw him or the parcel—I afterwards identified him at the station from among other men.</p>
