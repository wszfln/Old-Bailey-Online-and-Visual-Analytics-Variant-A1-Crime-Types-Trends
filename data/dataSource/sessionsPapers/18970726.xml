On June 18th I was at the corner of Grafton Street, Tottenham Court Road, when the prisoner came to me and said, "I am sorry I could not see you last night at Scotland Yard; I had very important information to give you; at a public-house in Wardour Street I saw a man who had just come out of prison; he had a bag full of silver, but no money; he offered it to me, but, of course, I refused to take it. He wanted to get rid of it, having no money. I took him to a lodging in Charlotte Street, and became responsible for his night's lodging; he is now in bed, but I will go and wake him up and bring him out. You will know him, because he will be carrying the bag with the stuff in it; then you can arrest him, because he has got the property, and you can charge him with burglary"—I said, "Very well, go and fetch him out"—then I went to Tottenham Court Road Police Station, com-municated with the police, went to the lodging-house, and saw the last witness—I was away a few minutes at Great Whitfield Street—when the prisoner came back he said, "He got up, but he won't carry it away from home. That is the man who committed the burglary; you can arrest him"—I said, "No, I should like to know more about it"—he said, "You know him very well, and where to find him"—I said, "I can find him in the morning"—he said he wanted some breakfast, and I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and left him to get it—he joined me again, and said, "Come with me; we are bound to find him"—we walked up Hampstead Road, in the direction of Mr. Davison's, the pawnbroker's—I said, "We have walked up here, and you said you knew the man; how is it you have not found him? Are you going to find him?"—Mr. Davison called a policeman, and gave him into custody—I instructed the officers to take him to the station—he was charged with having in his possession stolen plate.</p>

I am the medical officer of the Bromley Sick Asylum—I was there when Forbes was admitted on May 29th—she was apparently over fifty years of age—I examined her—I found a large bruise on her left cheek, a small one on her right cheek, a large one on the centre of her chest, and one large bruise each side of her chest—her back, from the shoulder-blade downwards, was covered by a number of bruises, which partially coalesced, forming a continuous area—the outer side of each arm, from the shoulders to the wrist, were also covered by a continuous area of bruising—the outer side of both legs, from the hip joints to the knee and the joints, were covered with bruises—there was a small bruise on the inner side of her left-hand joint—she was very weak, her heart was strong and regular in action, but the valves were incompe<lb/>tent—the abdomen contained a twelfth part of albumen, showing an old inflammation of the kidneys—I attended her till June 14th, when she died—she constantly complained of great pain on the left side of her chest—I examined her repeatedly for fractured ribs, but could find no sign—she gradually became weaker, and died—I made a <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination—I found the remains of most of the bruises I have described—on opening the chest I discovered a fracture of the tenth, eleventh and twelfth ribs, on the left side, immediately underlying bruises—on the right side there was a fracture of the seventh rib, also under-lying a bruise on the right side of the chest; the heart was enlarged and the mitral valve diseased; the muscles were healthy; the kidneys weighed three ounces instead of four and a-half or five ounces; quite one half of their substance had been lost by old inflammation—on the left side of the face was a severe bruise, but not deep—
death was from exhaustion, the result of extensive bruising, and four fractured ribs in a woman who was suffering from bad kidney disease—the union of the fractures was in a cartilaginous stage, which implies an interval of between fourteen and twenty-one days from their occurrence—the bruises could have been caused by a kick with boots.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I have no fixed residence. I have been walking the streets all night. I am a dock labourer. I have seen the body in the mortuary. It is that of my mother. Her name was Johanna Forbes. She was the widow of John Forbes, a coal-porter. She had been married twice. She was fifty-two years of age. She last lived at No. 3, Merchant's Row, St. Anne's Street, Liraehouse. She occupied one room on the first-floor front. I occupied the same room, and so did Johanna Sullivan. Johanna Sullivan was a friend of my mother's from childhood. I did not live with her as my wife. I cannot say whether Sullivan was older or younger than my mother. I could not say whether she was about the same age. We three had been living in one room for about five months. I am twenty-five years of age. There was one bedstead in the room. I slept on the floor. On Thursday, May 27th, I came home from work about 7.30 p.m. I was sober. My mother told me she had been having a row with Johanna Sullivan. Sullivan was in the room at the time. I said, 'Been rowing again, you are always rowing; I told you this morning not to have no row.' They were both sober. I went out, and returned in about ten minutes. They were still jawing. I then went out, and returned at nine p.m. Thoy were both jawing. I went out again. I met Johanna Sullivan in the West India Dock Road about ten, or half-past ten. I could see that she had had a drop of drink. I took her into a public-house and treated her. We walked across the road. She went before me, and two policemen took her to the station; I do not know what for. I went and had another drink. I then walked towards home. I met my mother with Mrs. Johnson. They both went into Limehouse Police-station. They did not speak to me This was about 11.30 p.m. I went home, and my mother and Mrs. Johnson returned, and went into Mrs. Johnson's kitchen. I asked my mother if she was upstairs. She said, 'No.' Mother got nasty, and jawed, and carried on. I did not answer her much. She struck me. I did not strike her back. I left, and went and had another drink. I then went to the Police-station to see if I could bail Johanna Sullivan. I was told it was too late. I went towards home, and later on I got locked up. The next day I appeared at the Police-court, and I got
ten days' imprisonment for insulting a policeman. I do not know what became of Johanna Sullivan. After the
ten days' imprisonment I went home. Neither my mother nor Sullivan were there. I heard my mother was in the Sick Asylum, and that Sullivan was locked up. I have not seen Sullivan since.

I am ten years old, and live at 24, Albany Street, Regent's Park—on July 13th, about one o'clock, I was going to school, towards Euston Station, and saw three of them attack the prosecutor, and snatch his watch—thn prisoners are two of them; I knew them by sight—Claney lived opposite me, and I have known Brown about a week—the prosecutor called out "Police!" and the prisoners ran away—when the watch fell, Claney said, "Pick it up"—I am sure the prisoners are the two who attacked him.</p>

I am a chimney-sweep, of Cornwall Road, Tottenham—I was one of the party who drove up to the Fox—as I was going to the Fox I saw a disturbance—Ames made a remark about deceased's white boots—he replied, in a joking manner, "They are Jim Smith's," or some Smith's, "fighting-boots"—Ames pulled off his coat, and said, "Come on, and have a fight along with me; I will fight you"—Thompson took off his coat—the deceased followed in a joking manner, and pulled off his coat—the prisoners put themselves in a fighting position—it looked like a trick, to my idea—Thompson was in front, but I never saw him strike the deceased—they all struck one blow; it sounded like the lot—they hit him on his head, and he fell on his back; blood oozed from both ears—he staggered before he fell—he had no chance to strike, or put his bands tip; I thought it was all done in a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>, but when I saw blood I said to Ames," You have killed the man; you had better fetch a doctor"—Ames and Hodge went into the public-house—I followed them in—Ames made a dirty remark, and shoved me on to the counter—Ames said to his friends, "We had better clear out of this"—there were about half-a-dozen men and women there—Hodge and Ames went towards Palmer's Green Station, Wood Green—I said I should follow them till I met a constable—Ames said to Hodge, "You go by train; I will look after myself"—they said to me, "If you go you will have to look after yourself"—on the road Ames said, "You know me?"—I said, "I have no recollection of you"—when I got to the water-trough he said he would put me in it if I did not go away—I said, "I don't care if you kill me; I shall follow you"—when we got to the Cock public-house they asked me</p>

               <p>to have a glass of ale and settle it—that is about half a mile from the Fox—I stood by the door while they went in—a constable came up; I stated my case, and gave them in custody.</p>

I am a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, And Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians—I practise at Wood Green—on June 7th, shortly after eight p.m., I went to Wood Green Police-station—Barrell was lying on the floor unconscious, and bleeding heavily; his breath smelt of alcohol, and a little blood was oozing from the orifice of the left ear—I observed a bruise on the left side of the back of his head—I advised his removal to the Wood Green Cottage Hospital—the same evening I saw him again—he was dying, and I informed the police of the fact—on June 9th, with the assistance of Dr. Campbell, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—besides the external in<lb/>jury on the back of the head, I found a lacerated wound behind the left elbow-joint, about an inch in length, and down to the bone—they might have been caused by his falling backwards on to the ground—on the covering of the skull was a discolouration corresponding to the external bruise, and extending downwards to the base of the skull, which was fractured—death was caused by hæmorrhage, due to the fracture and the pressure of a clot of blood, causing compression of the brain—the in<lb/>jury might be caused by a heavy fall on the road.</p>

This is a serious charge against you, and I caution you that what you may say may be used for or against you in evidence"—he made no reply at the time, but on the way to the station he said, "I did not think he was hurt"—on June 14th, about 7.15 p.m., Demant surrendered himself at Wood Green Police-station—I knew he was coming, as I had made in<lb/>quiries with a view of arresting him—I told him he would be charged with others in causing the death of Barrell, and I said, "You are de<lb/>fended by a solicitor I am given to understand"—he said, "Yes, I say nothing."</p>

After Mrs. Bryan left I believe I went and got the bread and butter and some cheese out. After that I think we began quarrelling because I had had some drink, and my husband struck me about the head. I do not remember any more till he said, 'Oh,. Maggie, you have done something. Then I saw him throw a knife away towards the fire-place. It was the knife produced. I said, 'What have I done, Arthur?' He pulled his shirt away, and showed me his chest, and I saw a cut of some kind, and then he ran out. I do not remember any more till I heard the bell ring and a policeman come. I afterwards went to the Middlesex Hospital with a friend, and she saw my husband. I did not go in and see him, but she saw my husband, and I waited outside with my children. If I struck my husband with the knife, I did not intend to do any harm to him. I have no recollection of taking the knife up and stabbing my husband. There was no one else in the room besides my husband, myself, and the two children."</p>

Block, as I knew a lady friend of mine was ill, and I wanted to see her—he told me I should not go up there, because of meeting the prisoner, perhaps, who was friendly—I said, "I have to go out, anyway, and I shall go up there," but he said I should not, and I said if he insisted upon my not going where I liked I would not obey—he said I must leave or obey—he asked me for the key twice—I then put it on the table and left—I went to 24, E Block—I did not know the prisoner were there—we stayed five or ten minutes, and went out together—I did not tell him till we got out, when I said I had had a quarrel with my hus<lb/>band, and he told me to leave—you said I had done a foolish thing to leave him that hour of the night—then we went to look for a room for myself—we were together till 7.15 a.m., when you went to work—I went to look for lodgings—the next night I went to Stepney Green Buildings at eleven o'clock—I walked up the steps, and knocked at 89 three or four times, and there came no answer—one of the men who had followed me said, "What do you want here?"—I said, "It is my place, I live here"—he said, "Why, don't you know there was a murder here last night?"—I said, "No"—he said, "A man was murdered here last night"—I said I did not know—he said, "What do you want here?"—I said, "I have come to see the children"—he said, "Oh! your children are all right"—I said, "Where are they?"—they told me at my sister's; so I wanted to go down, but he detained me, and would not let me pass; he said I must wait up there, and I waited for about ten minutes; then a detective or a police-sergeant came up, and took me to the Police-station, where I passed the night—when the question of separation arose between me and my husband on Saturday, May 29th, he threatened to take his life.</p>

I am house physician at the London Hospital—I saw the prosecutor when he was brought in between six and 6.30 a.m. on June 2nd—he was wearing a pair of trousers and a coat, or something round his throat—there was a transverse wound, dividing the largest cartilages and the larynx completely; the cartilage was also split verti<lb/>cally and a great deal bruised—the wound was about four inches long—immediately above was a smaller one parallel to the larger one, and deeper on the left side than on the middle line, but it appeared to be a superficial incision—the larger wound divided the thoroid cartilage—it divided the windpipe—it was two and a-half to three inches deep—great violence must have been used—it was probably done with a blunt instru<lb/>ment—my opinion is not positive, but it probably was inflicted by some<lb/>one else—it was straight across, commencing from left to right, or from the side close to the edge of the bed—I formed my opinion from the smaller wound, because it was superficial—a left-handed man would be more likely to inflict it that way, and a right-handed man from right to left—a man lying on his back unconscious, the bleeding might stop itself, and he would recover consciousness.</p>

Bruce Road, where the prisoner occupied two rooms—I found chemicals in bottles on the mantelpiece—the prisoner was remanded, and the follow<lb/>ing week discharged—I kept possession of the bonds—he never claimed them—on Friday last, July 23rd, I received another warrant from Bow Street Police-court for the prisoner's arrest on the present charge—I arrested him that day at his house in Bruce Road—I read to him the warrant—he said, "Very well; I may as well tell you now that I got these bonds from" a man whose name and address he gave; "I am sorry I ever met this man; I wish I had never seen him; the man has always misled and deceived me from the beginning;" and "Mr. Holmes has been refunded this £45 by this man."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 60, Inworth Street, Battersea—I was in the employment of Messrs. James for twenty-two years as a leather-cutter—I first saw Barnett in July, 1896, when he came to the firm to purchase some goods—he settled the price he was to pay for them with the manager—he had a conversation with me when the manager had gone—he asked me if I could make it better for him—I understood that he meant could I make it better for him by giving him better stuff than he had bargained for—I did not consent at first—he went away—he came back the next day—he suggested the same thing again—I finally gave way, and promised to give him some better stuff', and also to let him have four sacks full of pieces of leather that he had not purchased at all—he came a day or two afterwards for the sacks—I was to receive 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the four sacks—there was no arrangement as to the better quality—he took the four sacks away the next day or the day after—I had taken the stuff that was in the sacks out of the stock—it was not my duty to enter up the goods that went out, but it all ought to have been charged up—I ought to have reported the sale to the manager, and he would have made the entry—I did not do that—when Barnett took the sacks away he handed £1 to Costa—he had paid 10s. down—Costa and myself divided the money—we had 15s. each—Barnett came back in about a fortnight, and asked if there was anything further—I said, "No"—he asked when there would be—I said I did not know—he went away—he came again in about a month, and asked if there was anything else—I told him "No"—he asked me if I could make up a parcel and let him have it unbeknown to the firm—I gave way, and made up the parcel.</p>

I was on duty in Victoria Park Road at 12.16 on July 16th—the prosecutor came up to me, bleeding from his right ear very much, and also from his nose and mouth—I went with him to a coffee-stall at the corner of Frederick Road, Victoria Dock Road—there were several men there—the prosecutor did not identify any of them—while we were waiting there two men came up from the direction in which the prosecutor had been robbed, and from the direction in which they ran off—immediately they came up the prosecutor touched Taylor on his-arm, and said, in broken English, "You are the one that robbed me and stole my watch"—I told Taylor he had better go to the station—when the prosecutor pointed him out, and said, "That is the man who hit me, and took my watch," he made no reply—I took Taylor to the station—I did not take Eagle, as I knew where I could find him—Taylor made no reply to the charge—he was brought before the Magistrate the same day—the same evening, at 10.40, I was in Freemason's Road; Eagle came up, and asked me how Taylor got on—I told him I should arrest him—I had been looking for Eagle all day—he said, "I have heard that you have been looking for me, and I may as well go to the station with you quietly"—he made no reply when charged.</p>

I am eighteen years of age. On Saturday evening, May 29th. about midnight, I was in the New Cut, Lambeth, and left the Crown public-house when it closed, I was in com<lb/>pany with some male friends. On leaving the Crown I met Henry Meekings, and we walked as far as the Engine (the Railway Tavern), in the Blackfriars Road. We met Patrick Barry there, and as he appeared to be the worse for drink, I agreed to see him home. When we got as far as St. George's Circus, he turned back to go to Union Street, and I accompanied him. As we were going along two men came along drunk, and the four of us collided together in the Blackfriars Road. Then we stopped, and one of the men we met said to Barry, 'What! do you want to fight?' and I replied, 'I am going to take him home.' After that the man now known to me as Coughlan said, 'Do you want to fight?' Barry said, 'No, I do not want to fight; I am going home'; and with that Coughlan let out, and hit Barry in the mouth, and then Coughlan ran away. I was getting Barry away, when Sullivan hit me, and I turned round and hit him back; Sullivan fell down on the pavement, and Barry and I then walked away."</p>
