I said T. H. and produced the stamp that made them; then she gave the buckles to me, and said they were my property.

On the 17th of April, about two o'clock, the prisoner and a girl came to my house, and she asked me if I would buy a pair of silver buckles; they both looked very suspicious of not coming honestly by them; the boy delivered the buckles; she asked sixteen shillings for them; the boy said they were his own, and if I would buy them, he'd buy a frock of me, which was hanging up; I said I must go and weigh them: I went out and brought in a neighbour : he took the prisoner, and the girl got off: then I took the buckles, and went about to enquire of the silversmiths who had lost such, and the third shop I called at was the prosecutor's ; I asked him if he had lost any buckles ; he said he had; I asked what marks were on them; he said T. H. then I said, here they are, and delivered them to him. (She is shewed the buckles, but can't say they are the same, but that they were like them, and had the same mark.)</p>

We went to the house and met him at his room door with his key in his hand, all over mortar on his back ; we desired to go into his room, he would not deliver his key to us for some time, at last he did to Mr. Legier, he was then in the street ; I held him whilst Mr. Legier went up into his room and found the lead in a sack; then I went up, and we found the other piece under his bed, we put them together, it made four foot in length, and three in breadth, when together.</p>

We went to the house and the landlord went up with us and opened the garret door on the right-hand-side; then the prisoner was coming out of his own room on the left-hand-side, he was locking the door, we brought him down stairs into the street; there was a little boy, who said, he had seen him on the top of the house, the prisoner's cloaths seemed as if he had had some lead on his back, part of them were all mortar ; we asked him for the key of his room, he would not deliver it at first, at last he did; then we went up and found part of the lead in a sack behind his door; then we locked the door and came down and took him before the justice; after which we came to his room again, and found the other piece under his bed, we laid them together and they matched; one end of the lead was about 3 feet wide, the other about 2 feet 10, each between 5 and 6 feet in length, it tallied with the place on the house where taken from: we searched his room but found no instrument with which it was cut.</p>

            . I was below with the prisoner on that day, but I cannot say what part of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at home when the men came to search the house?</p>
               <p>Keen. I was, and went up stairs with them, and opened another garret door opposite to his apartment, he came out and locked his door, they laid hold on him; the other door was not locked that is next to it which goes out upon the leads on Mr. Pew's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he lodged there?</p>
               <p>Keen. I believe on and off about twelve months; for the time he has been there I never knew him to be guilty of any thing of this sort.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his business?</p>
               <p>Keen. He has been a gentleman's servant, since that he has been a Bricklayer's labourer: when they took hold on him, I said, he is my lodger, I don't think he is such a person, but if you take proper means you shall see every thing, then I went to the prisoner and desired him to deliver the key.</p>

            . I live in Wych-street, and am a brush-maker ; one Mrs. Worster, that lodges at my house, was at an Alehouse over the way, the prisoner came and asked for her, I sent him to her: she came over in about half an hour, with a piece of lawn in her hand, and desired my mother would lend her four shillings, to pay the prisoner for it: my mother said she had not so much, but in about half an hour she should have it: we suspected it was not honestly come by. In the mean time I went to Mr. Eyres in York-street, Covent-garden, to know if they missed such things.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go there?</p>
               <p>Pennel. Mrs. Worster had before this acquainted me, that the prisoner was servant to Mr. Eyres.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the lawn with you?</p>
               <p>Pennel. No, my Lord, she carried it with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175205140007"/> her to the alehouse again. I asked Mr. Eyres, whether he allowed his servants to carry out things? he said, no. Then I told him, I tho't he had been robb'd, and told of the affair, he sent two of his servants with me: then I went and told the woman, if she would bring the lawn, she might have the money, she came over, and brought Turner up stairs into her room, and then came down with the lawn in her hand: my mother deliver'd the lawn to the two men; they said it could not be honestly come by, for it must cost more than was asked for it. Then they went up to the prisoner, and asked him how he came by it? he said he would give Mr. Eyres an account of that, we took him there. He told Mr. Eyres, that he took it out of the shop-window. Mr. Eyres asked him, if he had taken any thing else? he said, no: we search'd his pockets, and found a piece of muslin, and a piece of nankeen ; then he said, he took them all out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Willeton produc'd about a yard of lawn.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pennel. Is this the lawn you speak of?</p>
               <p>Pennel. It is; here is a mark upon it, that I made, to know it by again.</p>
               <p>Q. to Willeton. Is this Mr. Eyres's property?</p>
               <p>Willeton. We have so many pieces, that I can't swear it is his property. About the 14th of April, this Evidence Pennel, came to Mr. Eyres's, and asked master if he allowed his servant Turner to carry out goods, as mentioned before, telling him the case? Mr. Eyres sent me and another fellow-servant to his house with him: after having staid about half an hour, we were taken up stairs to Turner; he had agreed to sell the lawn for 4 s. 6 d. I asked him how he came by it? he made me no direct answer, and seemed a good deal in liquor. I desired him to go back, and give Mr. Eyres an account, he did, and told Mr. Eyres, he had the lawn out of the shop. His pockets appearing pretty bulky, he was ask'd what he had there? we search'd them, and there found a piece of nankeen, and a remnant of muslin, (Produced in court) he was asked, where he had them? he said, from out of Mr. Eyres's Shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he at Mr. Eyres's?</p>
               <p>Willeton. He was employed as a porter 6 or 7 years. The day after his confinement he endeavoured to cut his throat, and has done it in such a manner, that he speaks with much difficulty to be understood.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prisoner. Do you hear and understand what is deposed against you?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. to Willeton. Had you any suspicion of the prisoner before this affair ?</p>

I said, I had not; he swore I had, and he would blow my brains out, I begg'd my life of him, and said I had no more: after he found I had n o more, he admitted me to come nearer to him; then I ask'd him, if he would not go to some house and drink ? he made use of a great many desperate words, and at last was prevail'd upon to go to the Turk's-head with me, just by Marybon bason, he drank share of 2 pints of beer there: he had got his bayonet and sword, (note, the prisoner was a soldier) There were only a woman and two boys in the house, I beckon'd to the woman to come in the kitchen, and I told her the affair, and ask'd her if she had any body she could send for an officer, she was aftrighted, and said, she had no body to send, but that she know'd him, and where he was quarter'd, and desired I would do nothing farther at that time. I went and sat opposite to him, look'd him full in the face, that I might know him again, and ask'd him, if he had at that time any intent to have shot me? he made this reply, d - n your eyes, I would have blow'd your brains out. I said, are you loaded? he said, yes, with a ball, and pull'd out six or seven more, and shewed me near half a pound of gunpowder.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been from you between the time he stopp'd you, and the time of your being in that alehouse?</p>
               <p>Pratt. From that time, to the time of being in the alehouse, he was never from me, except the time I beckon'd the woman into the kitchen to ask her for somebody to send for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you with him in the alehouse?</p>
               <p>Pratt. I staid there, I believe, about half an hour at least, the woman begg'd of me to let him go, for he had got his piece, and was going to blow the ceiling down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say in answer to your question, that he would blow your brains out if you offerred to resist, in the hearing of any body else?</p>
               <p>Pratt. He did before the woman and the two boys.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask him to drink with you?</p>
               <p>Pratt. I thought to take him into the house, in order to get some-body to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him to be foolish.</p>
               <p>Pratt. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he present his piece?</p>
               <p>Pratt. He put it to his shoulder, and presented it to my breast.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the woman's name that keeps the house?</p>
               <p>Pratt. Her name is Pitt.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here ?</p>
               <p>Pratt. No, she is not. I went and acquainted the prisoner's officer with the affair, and the prisoner absconded for about two months, to that I could not see him in that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was his quarters?</p>
               <p>Pratt. His quarters were at the Green Man, in Marybon Parish.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to his quarters?</p>
               <p>Pratt. The very next day, in the morning, and saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you take him up then?</p>
               <p>Pratt. I had not a warrant against him then, I could not. I went for a warrant, and when I returned, he was gone.</p>

               <p>I was coming from guard that day, with all my arms and accoutrements upon me, and my grenadier cap on: going to my quarters at the Green-Man, I had happen'd to stay along with two or three of my comrades. I was singing as I went along: I met the prosecutor, I said, who is there? said he, a friend: then said I, let's see who the friend is, he came up within about 20 yards of me; said I, have you got any thing to do me damage? said he, I have nothing but a stick, and then said, what is the reason you ask me? I said, because about three months ago I was almost murder'd in those fields, and was obliged to be carried to the Hospital, and lay there near a month. Said he, what do you want further ? I said, nothing; then he said I'll throw my stick away; said I, have you any half-pence about you, if you have, we will go and have a pint of beer together, he asked me where I was going, I said, to my quarters, he asked where, I said at the Green-Man, he said, he had just been drinking there, and said, he did not care to go back; then I said, I would go along with him, which I did, and we staid in that house almost an hour ; there were several people there all the time, he there abused me and called me all the names he could think of.</p>

               <p>Richards. I staid better than a quarter of an hour, the soldier was very much in liquor, and the prosecutor said, he had stopped him in the fields; afterwards the soldier said, I did, but not with an intent to rob you; then the prosecutor said, No, I believe not, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else hear this besides you?</p>
               <p>Richards. There was another chairman, that brought the lady with me, we went there to have a pot of beer ; the next day after I brought my lady from the play: I and the other chairman went to the Turks-head again: between ten and eleven at night the prosecutor and another soldier and the landlord at the Green-man came with a gun loaded to take the prisoner, said Pratt to them, we will hang the soldier for the reward, I asked them the reason they brought the gun, they said, for their safety, because a man was abused in the fields the night before.</p>

            . I am a chairman, and was in the Turk's-head drinking part of a pot of beer along with the other witness, we had carried the Dutchess of Bridgwater's daughter home from the play, when the prosecutor and the landlord at the Green Man came in between 10 and 11 o'clock, I can't tell the day of the month; they had a gun loaded and seemed to be very much fuddled ; they play'd tricks with the gun, and said, We'll do for the soldier, we'll hang him, and have the reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Which said so?</p>
               <p>Cravie. The prosecutor said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say so?</p>
               <p>Cravie. In the open tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. To who?</p>
               <p>Cravie. To none in particular: They told how they had taken out a warrant for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the soldier before?</p>
               <p>Cravie. I never saw him in my life before to day, as I know of.</p>

            . I am the landlord at the Turk's-Head; I was not at home when the soldier and prosecutor came in together: the morning after this fray was, the prosecutor came down, he had a pint of beer, and told me he was going home and met a soldier about the middle of the fields going towards the country, that the soldier levelled his piece at him, and asked him, who he was, and what business he had there? that he replied, he was going home; then the soldier said, he should not go any farther without he would let him know who he was; then Pratt asked him, what he desired of him: he said, he had received damage in, or near that place, and may be, he might be one of them that did it; then Pratt answered he had nothing but a stick and he had thrown that down, that when he came near, the soldier asked what money he had in his pocket, he answered, as much as would pay for a pint or two of beer and you are welcome to take part of it, then they came to my house; I went with him to shew him where the soldier lodged, going along, I said, what do you think his intention was to have done you any damage? he said, I don't believe the fellow had any intention to hurt me, but he threaten'd me, that if I stirred he would blow me to pieces; we went up to Mr. Dixon's, there the soldier quartered, he was at home: I had never seen him before ; I asked him the meaning of his last night's proceedings,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175205140010"/> he said, he did not know he had offered any violence to Mr. Pratt, saying, he was in liquor. Mr. and Mrs. Dixon were desirous to have the soldier moved out of their house, and he said, he was willing to go any where else ; so we went to the constable to have his quarters changed, but the constable then was not at home. Pratt went there along with us.</p>
               <p>Morduck Mackenzey. When we heard there was a warrant out against a soldier to whom I belong, we went to his quarters, there was the prosecutor along with the landlord, he told us much the same story he has now; I asked him if he thought the soldier had any intent to rob him; he said, he did not think he had, and that he took nothing from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Mackenzey. This was at the Green-Man in Marybon-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it?</p>
               <p>Mackenzey. I think it was before Christmas, I do not exactly know the time. I asked him what he thought to do in this affair ? he said, if he was paid for his day's work he had lost, and what expences he had been at in looking after him, he did not know but he might forgive him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever abscond?</p>
               <p>Mackenzey. He did his duty every day when it came to his turn, he was called upon the parade as an honest soldier, and never absconded a moment from the company.</p>

Before we came into St. Ann's Court we saw a Jew with an old hat in his hand and a blue bag, we asked him if he would sell that hat; he said, yes, and ask'd two shillings for it: He said he had got two waistcoats in his bag, and took them out. We asked him if he had any thing else; he said nothing that would suit us. We ask'd him what they were, he pull'd them out, there were shifts and shirts; he asked ten shillings for the waistcoats, Graham offered him eight: Then we ask'd what he'd have for the linnen. We thought to make use of the shirts ourselves, and make presents of the other things, he ask'd seven shillings for them, that is seventeen shillings in the whole, we offered him fifteen, so as we were short of money, and I was going to be shaved, I got Mr. Chesham to pawn the waistcoats, and I intended to fetch them out again on Monday. We went to an alehouse in Clare-market and supp'd, I asked him to lie with me that night; I had put the other things in a handkerchief in my box.</p>

            . I am a pawn-broker; a woman brought this spoon to me on the 30th of April; I examined her seeing a crest upon it. She said she had it of a woman, and would fetch her; in about a quarter of an hour the same person came and desir'd to have it again, but I would not let her. In a little time after came the prisoner at the bar and another woman (not the woman that came first).</p>

               <p>Charles Capper. On the 2d of May, about 8 in the evening, I was sitting in a little room joining to my shop, I heard the window break, I went into the shop, and saw the handkerchiefs move in the window; I unchained the door: there is a turning at the corner of my shop, that is call'd the New Rents; I went up that court after them; when I came almost to the upper end, I saw them push forward; I called out, stop thief; Child turned hastily to me, and said, where is he? where is he? which is he? I took hold on his collar, and said, I think you are one, I'll take you at a Venture.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you see?</p>
               <p>Capper. I saw but two ; I took Child into my shop, and sent for a constable, and left him in his care, and went up to the Place where I took him, and there I found these handkerchiefs, and brought them into the shop. (Produced in court and deposed to)</p>
               <p>Q. How far from your window did you find the handkerchiefs ?</p>
               <p>Capper. About 100 yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did these handkerchiefs lie in your shop?</p>
               <p>Capper. They had lain all that day in the window close to the glass for show. The prisoner at first, said, he was going home, and went there to ease himself, (it is thorough-fair) but when I found the handkerchiefs and shew'd them to him, he confess's, that he, the other prisoner, and one Low, had been together all day, that they had been to a person that owed Hall some money, and they could not get it, and Hall said, he would have money, or money's worth, before he went home. That he himself was not the man that broke the window, but he stood by and took the handkerchiefs after Hall had taken them out, and ran away with them. We took up Hall about 3 days after, and had him examin'd before the Justice; there I heard him confess, that he was a party concern'd in taking the handkerchiefs, saying he deliver'd them to Child.</p>

            . I live over-against the prosecutor; I happened to be looking out at my window above stairs; about eight o'clock that night I saw three men by the prosecutor's window, two of them stood very close together, I heard the glass break, after they had broke the glass one of them put his arm one way and the other to break it on each side: two of them ran up the New-Rents, and the other was pulling at the window for a considerable time, I thought he was pulling at the iron bar that goes cross the window; there were a candle or two in the shop, and a lamp at the next shop, but I cannot take upon me to say, the prisoner's were two of them. I saw Mr. Capper come out of his little room into the shop, then the two were gone; then I went down stairs, and Child was taken by Mr. Capper and brought into his shop. He went on and confirmed the account given by the other two.</p>

I am a labouring man, and was going to my work by three o'clock that morning, in order to clean some line, which is troublesome when people are about; going along Aldermanbury a man was running along, the watchman and I attempted to stop him, but he was too strong for us and got away, he dropped his cloth he had, we delivered it to Mr. Jones the constable, the man was a clever lusty young fellow, may be twenty-three years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man ?</p>
               <p>Dodd. No, he is not.</p>

            . Last Saturday morning Mr. Penteloe, Mr. Ind, and I, were going to have the prisoner before Mr. Fielding, the prisoner said there were some goods lodged in Charterhouse-lane, and that he had robbed his master, of them, that the stable place (where the horse goes round in his mill) was not fast, so he got in. Mr. Ind and I went along with the prisoner to that place in Charterhouse-lane, the prisoner said, this is the place where I tread; then we opened a trap door, I took up the pieces, they were under ground, five pieces of camblet and ten yards of long all ; and handed them to Mr. Ind, the prisoner wanted to confess to be admitted an evidence.</p>

               <p>Payworth. Out of my master's drawer in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose were they?</p>
               <p>Payworth. I believe they were my master's.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she give you for them?</p>
               <p>Payworth. She gave me six-pence for them, and six-pence for one silk handkerchief, and a groat a piece for the other handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. How many handkerchiefs did you carry to her?</p>
               <p>Payworth. Five in all.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose handkerchiefs were they?</p>
               <p>Payworth. They were my mistress's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her how you came by them?</p>
               <p>Payworth. No, nor she did not ask me.</p>

            . I am widow to the deceas'd, on the Thursday before Easter he said, he was afraid the two prisoners had played some tricks with his breakfast; he complain'd he was extremely ill, and I desir'd he'd have some wine done with spice and go to bed. He went to bed, but I was inform'd he groan'd so the rest of the prisoners could not sleep. He was in <placeName id="t17520514-23-crimeloc117">the prison of Ludgate</placeName>

I sent him some breakfast the next morning by his daughter; she came for me, I went and found him in strong convulsion fits, I ran for the Apothecary, he came and gave him a glister and a julep: After that I went to Dr. Lobb, he ordered him a glister, with a little brandy in it, and the glister made of mutton, and to make him white gruel and a little drop of brandy in it, and also to make him jellies and chicken broth; but he could keep nothing upon his stomack hardly. These things agreed with him best, but he grew weaker and weaker every day; his continual complaint was of pains in his bowels and stomach, pointing to his stomach, and would say, Arsnic, Arsnic. We did all that in us lay, but nothing did. On the Sunday morning he desir'd to be got up, and was no sooner in his chair, but he died in a convulsion sit. Johnson has declared before me, and other witnesses, that it was Jallap and Salt of Wormwood, and sometimes he'd say, it was Jallap and Salt of Tartar. My husband several times said, he laid his death to the prisoners charge, and said he should never be well till he was in his coffin.</p>

On Friday the 20th of March in the day time, he complain'd to me that he was out of order, and troubled with a slight illness: I asked him what was his complaint; he said, he thought it was with eating a breakfast with a fellow prisoner of milk and twopenny, or some such thing. This complaint seemed to have left him on Saturday in the afternoon; for he was upon the leads walking with the rest of the prisoners, seemingly in good health. On the Saturday night he seemed to be very free from any complaint. On the Sunday, the 22d, I saw him at dinner, and by what I could see, and what I was told by his companions, he eat a pretty hearty dinner; I saw him eat great part of it, he seemed to eat hearrier than I had seen him before, for he us'd to have no great appetite. On Sunday night I left him in the taproom, when I went up to my room to go to bed, he then was in good health as at any time I had known him, during the time of his confinement. On Monday in the afternoon I saw him, he seemed drooping and complain'd he was ill, what his illness was he did not complain to me. On the Tuesday morning I saw him, he then complained of a violent pain in his stomach and bowels, and said he had been vomiting and purging.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him vomit, &amp;c?</p>
               <p>Colwin. I can't say I did: Towards the evening I saw him again, and conversed with him Then he said he had heard the two prisoners had given him something in his milk on the Monday morning in their ward. On the Wednesday morning, before I was out of bed, two or three people came to me, and said he was in convulsions and extremely ill, and that it was well known the two prisoners had given him something in his milk at breakfast. I immediately got up and went into his ward, where I saw him in a chair, his complexion and voice were very much alter'd, and he appeared very much convuls'd, and almost speechless. After this Mr. Thompson, Mr. West, and myself, waited on the Keeper, to inform him about the circumstances of what we had heard. I believe Mrs. Davison was in the room with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the Keeper?</p>
               <p>Colwin. Mr. Cave is: Upon this he went up and saw Mr. Davison.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Colwin. This was on the Wednesday morning about ten o'clock. The Keeper returned into his own room, and we with him; he sent immediately for Mr. Johnson, who came. The Keeper told him he had seen Mr. Davison, and thought him in a dangerous condition, and said, he had heard he had given him something in his drink. Johnson at first seemed to deny it, but was in a very great astonishment about it. The Keeper used some little threats, and said, if he would not discover the truth he'd send to the Sheriff, and have him committed to Newgate. Then he said, if I must tell the truth, I must, Pestell got the stuff, and we gave it him. After this Mr. Pestell was sent for by the Keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what stuff?</p>

               <p>Colwin. No, he did not: Then the keeper was in a good deal of warmth, and ask'd Pestell if he was not a very great rogue to go to do things that he did not know the consequence of? Pestell denied it, then Johnson confronted him, and told him he did it, upon which Pestell recollected, and said, I did it when I was in the room; but I did not think there had been any harm in it. About an hour after this I went again, and saw the deceased, he continued in very great agony, was put to bed, and convuls'd very much. In this time Mrs. Davison had fetch'd Mr. Dalmahoy, who lives on Ludgate-hill, and Mr. Meadows, a surgeon, that was likewise a prisoner with us, was there with him. Mr. Meadows had prescribed some physic for Mr. Pestell, and the general report of the prison was, that from thence Mr. Meadows knew what had been given to Mr. Davison. I said to Mr. Meadows, you see what condition he is in, I beg you'll describe the quality of what Pestell had of you: He immediately said, it was Jallap and Salts of Tartar, or Salts of Worm-wood, he could not tell which, that he had prescribed. Mr. Dalmahoy and Mr. Meadows agreed together what should be done to him. The deceased continued very dangerously ill all the Wednesday; sometimes he was capable of speech, and sometimes he was so convuls'd that he could not speak. I saw him two or three times on the Wednesday in the afternoon, he could only make signs over his breast, wherein it seemed his pain lay. On the Thursday morning I saw him, and went again to see him at noon, then he appeared very much convuls'd. I then said to his brother-prisoner in his ward, that his condition was extremely hard, he not having any relief, nor a physician to assist him. Then one of the prisoners told Mrs. Davison, that if she'd go to Dr. Lobb he'd prescribe something for him: She went, and the Dr. wrote for the deceased. Coming from my own room to go to the deceased, I met her going up; she told me she had been to Dr. Lobb, and had got a prescription, which she gave into my hand, I looked at it, and to the best, of my judgment it was much the same as had been administered before by the others. I then desired she'd let me carry the prescription up to Mr. Meadows; she refused it, and put it in her bosom, and went and got the things accordingly. They were administered, and on Thursday evening, about seven, I found him capable of speech, and seemingly in some spirits, insomuch that I assisted, with his daughter, to give him one of his draughts, he was merry and crack'd a joke, and I was in great hopes of his living. Mr. Meadows and I went up about nine o'clock, he was then much alter'd, for in giving him something out of a cup his convulsions then took him, and he fell down speechless again. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175205140023"/> then immediately applied myself to Mr. Meadows, and said, do you think there is so material an alteration in his medicines, as to occasion this alteration in his health. Mr. Meadows said, at that time, he thought him a great deal better, but now he could not tell what to say. On the Friday I visited him two or three times again, but found him at no certainty; he continued changing very much, in a fluctuating state, sometimes better, sometimes worse. On the Friday evening Johnson the prisoner happened to be in the room, while I attempted to get him to take down a bit of chicken, Johnson was crying by the fire side: The deceased lay about four yards distance, seemingly not capable of speaking, he saw Johnson, and call'd out the Villain! Then Johnson left the room. I saw him two or three times on the Saturday, when I think he was worse than before, in want of spirits and every thing. On the Sunday morning about 10 o'clock, being the day on which he died, I then found him, as I thought, with symptoms of death upon him very strong. Johnson followed me to the door crying, and asked me whether there was any hopes of recovery. About half an hour after eleven word was brought me he was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after ?</p>
               <p>Colwin. I did : I attended at the opening of the body. Mr. Meadows open'd it, in presence of Mr. Ruding. There appeared something of an Inflammation on the bottom of the stomach; it was quite opened, as were all the coats of the intestines. I had a doubt upon me whether from the violent vomiting there had any of the material substance passed into his body, from the time he first took it. Upon which Mr. Meadows opened one or two of the guts, and said there was some sign of an Anuras in them, but that it had made no adhesion.</p>
               <p>Q. from Johnson. Did not you say before the Coroner's Jury, God forbid you should think we intended to kill him ?</p>
               <p>Colwin. I did, in answer to a question put to me by one of the Jurymen.</p>
               <p>Q. from Johnson. Did not the Coroner, upon his coming to take a view of the body, declare he saw no marks upon the body, and that he believed he died a natural death?</p>
               <p>Colwin. The Coroner said he did not see any external marks at all. I answer'd, I did not know how external marks should appear in this case.</p>

            . I lay in the same ward the deceased lay in: He complain'd of violent pains on Monday the 23d of March, and likewise on the Tuesday ; on Tuesday night he went to bed, and said he was very ill; Wednesday morning he was very ill, I could have no sleep, he got up between six and seven, in order to go to the necessary-house, and went down, but came up again, and said he could do nothing; he was so very ill he wanted something warm. I got up and got a fire, and made some warm gruel; he drank, I believe, the quantity of a gallon, and as he took it he threw it up again. When we had got him up, between 9 and 10, he fell into a convulsion sit, his wife and I thought he had been dead; he after some time recovered that, but still complained he was very ill. I ask'd him if he could imagine the meaning of it : He said yes, he believ'd Mr. Johnston and Mr. Pestell had given him something in his milk the Monday morning before. I then went down and acquainted Mr. Cave, the keeper, with what was said; he ordered me to call in Mr. Johnston first, which I did. When he was in, he seem'd very unwilling to say any thing; but Mr.

            , a prisoner in the house, said, Mr. Johnston, don't deny it, you know you told me you had something of a secret you would tell me, if I would not say any thing of it. Then Mr. Cave told him it might become a serious thing, and that if the man died he might be sent to Newgate. Then he said, If I must confess, I and Mr. Pestell did it, or gave him the physic, I don't know which, I then called in Mr. Pestell, who denied it; but at last said, if I must go to Newgate, there are more must go with me. He (the deceased) grew worse and worse, and when I ask'd him any question, he pointed his hand to his throat (I suppose) meaning they might as well have cut his throat, and would say, he was sure he was poisoned by those two men, and when he could not speak he would pull his hand a-cross his throat.</p>

            . On Monday the 23d of April, between nine and ten in the morning, as we were eating our breakfasts at the window, as I was at the upper end of the ward, I turned my head back and saw Mr. Pestell with his back towards me, stooping towards the fire, and Johnson with his face towards me, stirring something in a china cup, what it was I can't tell; at the same time the unhappy deceased had some milk boiling on the fire.</p>

            . As to any thing given to the deceased, I cannot tell. They had given Pestell some Alteratives, and I thought proper to give him some Purgatives he had had a bad leg.</p>
               <p>Q. What purgatives did you give him?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175205140024"/>Meadows. I ordered him a little jallap, and a little salt of tartar, by way of correction, because it should not gripe or act with so much violence, and at Pestell's request I attended the deceased: I was call'd to him on Tuesday about 11 o'clock, and found him pretty much convuls'd; and after s ome little time, Mr. Dalmahoy, a chymist, came in; we consulted together finding he had had a purging upon him, I thought it requisite for him to take a glister, which was a little restringent, but at the same time, a very safe one; it seemed to have a very good effect upon him, and abated his purging, he had not a stool after it for many hours, as he himself declar'd; Mr. Dalmahoy had sent in a medicine, something of a restringent, to take internally, but I imagin'd the stomach not capable to take any thing of that kind; I told Mr. Dalmahoy's servant, (his master not being at home) to make up a little mixture (which had a very good effect) with the addition of some mint-water, and a few other things, this took off his vomiting, and he seemed abundantly better, and could take proper nutriment.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what kind?</p>
               <p>Meadows. He took gruels and seagoe, and jelleys, I thought he was in a mending way, the next day I really thought him quite out of danger, excepting his being weak and low; I was informed that Mrs. Davison had been to Dr. Lobb; Mr. Colwin shew'd me a prescription that she had brought from him, and in that prescription there were some little matter of brandy to be added to the glister, and likewise she told me, it was to be taken by the mouth, as well as to be made use of by way of glister; I gave her a caution, saying it is very odd, that he should prescribe such medicines as this, and not to give his attendance himself, and I told her, I thought too frequent a use of that might be very pernicious, and that the quantity of one spoon-full of brandy, to a person so low, might be worse to him, than a quantity to a person in full strength, but as the doctor had been concern'd, it was not my business to interfere (only by way of precaution) with any thing he intended to give him. The deceased was sometimes better, sometimes worse, after the taking these medicines; I was apprehensive that the looseness returning again, was a good deal owing to the taking such a quantity of spirits, and I did not attend him so frequently as before. On the Sunday morning Mr. Johnson came to me very early, to look upon the poor man; I got up between four and five, and found by his smell, that he had been drinking something very strong, he smelt as strong of rum, as though he had been suffocated with it; he was very weak and low, and in a declining way from that time to the time he expired, which was about 12 o'clock: I opened him several days afterwards, I believe it was 4 days; I found some little inflammation all over the stomach and bowels, both the large and small guts, and the blood vessels, were distended, and look'd inflam'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were present?</p>
               <p>Meadows. There were Mr. Ruding, and another gentleman, they approved of it to look within-side of his bowels and stomach, we found some little mucus in the inside of the intestines, and some little matter of excrement; it appeared as if there had been a purging something considerable, but no signs of any thing poisonous, that had been the cause of it; there was no mortification, not so much as a gangrene.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you look upon it, that where poison has been given, something of a gangrene will appear?</p>
               <p>Meadows. Always.</p>
               <p>Q. from Johnson. Whither that witness did not tell me he smelt of rum, so that he might be smelt half the length of the Ward?</p>
               <p>Meadows. I can't say I have smelt rum in that manner, as I did at that time, when I thought he seemed almost suffocated; that was rum; but I believe he frequently drank too much brandy in what he took.</p>

               <p>Q. from Johnson. Had he not complained, that he had been ill before?</p>
               <p>Meadows. I think he did complain he had been ill on the Friday before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a man that took drams commonly?</p>
               <p>Meadows. I really don't know that.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Davison. What this Witness speaks of, is in regard to the rum on Saturday night, when my husband complaining of his bowels being cold, we rubb'd him with hot stannels and rum, especially in his stomack, but he took none inwardly, only a little brandy in his white gruel.</p>
               <p>Q. to Meadows. Could you distinguish whether that strong smell proceeded from his body or his breath?</p>
               <p>Meadows. I was very particular, it was his breath which I smelt.</p>

We carried him before Justice Lediard, he was committed for further examination; after that he confessed he had intrusted a man, one Langford, to sell the lace ; when we came to take him up, he said he knew nothing of it. We went again, and searched his lodgings, and in all found six yards.</p>

               <p>Peirce. No, not in this suit of cloaths they could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why so?</p>
               <p>Peirce. Because this was to be put on quite strait.</p>

               <p>Peirce. No, Sir, he could not, he had plain cloaths to make and it was not in his power to cheat me in them, because I cut them out myself.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to suspect him before?</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Peirce: I delivered into the prisoner's custody 40 yards of silver lace on Friday in the evening, to get the cloaths done against the next day, and upon the measurement of the cloaths there were upwards of six yards missing.</p>

            . I am high constable of Westminster: Mr. Peirce desired me to come and take the prisoner up, he sent for him down stairs and charged me with him; the prisoner then said, he never did defraud his master in his life-time; and said, he had got a quarter of a yard of the lace at home, which he would go and fetch; so I went with him: we took him before Justice Lediard, he denied it still, he was committed for farther examination, after which I went to him, then he said, he had delivered it to Mr. Langford, and as I understood, in order for sale. Mr. Lediard granted a warrant in order to search: Mr. Langford denied knowing any thing of the matter, but upon bringing the prisoner out of the Gatehouse in order to contront him, who told him he had put it into his cupboard (they lodged together) I went and found it as the prisoner had said, it was set upon a silk waistcoat the prisoner was making for himself. Produced in court.</p>

               <p>I took the silver lace along with me home, through a mistake, it was among some paper patterns, I put them into my trunk, and we were so much in a hurry every day, I could not spare time to go to look for it; I put it on that crimson waistcoat for myself to see how it would look.</p>

I had been up in my room for change, to change half a guinea for a gentleman about a quarter before eight: I locked the drawer, also the closet door in which the drawer stood, and the chamber door. I believe the two inward keys<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175205140028"/> were left in the locks. I brought the room-door key down, and hung it up in the bar, after I missed the girl I could not find the key.

             and my wife brought her home: Then she owned she took the key of the room out of the bar, and opened the doors, and took my money, which she said was seven guineas, and three shillings in silver. I asked her where she went that night, she said to a neighbour's house, and lay there all night, and that the money was taken away out of the sleeve of her gown; and that the woman gave her two shillings, and bid her go to the other end of the town, that she might not be found, so accordingly she went to Shoreditch. She told the same before the justice.</p>

            . Just as the prisoner was brought to the prosecutor's house I went in: I said, are not you a pretty creature for your master to take in out of the streets, and you to serve him as you have done? She said, she went and lay betwixt a man and his wife, and put the money into the sleeve of her gown, and lost it all; that they gave her two shillings, and bid her go to the other end of the town.</p>

            . I lodge at the prosecutor's house; I met this girl in Long-lane the 27th of April, and taxed her with the robbery; she confess'd that she took seven guineas and three shillings out of the drawers of her master. I asked her why she did so? she said she was persuaded so to do by somebody. This I heard her confess several times, and said she took it out of a bag.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did she say what sort of a bag she took it out of?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, she did not, only she took it out of the bag.</p>

She came and told me, and I went down and found it so: The wicket was cut so as to get in a knife between that and the door, and the pin cut in two; after that was open it was easy to get in a hand, and unbolt the door. The inside door was fastened on the inside with two bolts; on the inside door there had been a pane of glass in that broke, and I had nail'd a piece of board on it, which board was pulled off, after which they might easily open that door. We found a six-pence in silver in a little room by the bar. We missed 4 s. 6 d. of the girl's box money; in a cupboard in the little room there were about 26 shillings in half-pence, a silver three-pence, and a pair of sleeve buttons, in a till, which was also missing, till and all.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner live?</p>
               <p>Abraham. He liv'd in Gravel-lane. Houndsditch, we went to the prosecutor's house, between two and three on the Sunday morning. Robertson bid Levi stand at the corner of Catherine-wheel Alley, and me go to the corner of the other alley, to watch if any body came, which we did, then Robertson went to the prosecutor's house. We staid so about a quarter of an hour, when Levi saw a watchman coming up the alley, then he cough'd, which was the signal we were to give each other, to take notice somebody was coming. Then Robertson was coming towards me; but turning his head he saw the watchman go down a little alley, and then went back to the door again. In about a quarter of an hour after this Robertson had the doors open, and gave a whistle: Then Levi and I came up to the house, Robertson had the drawer on his head in the street, by the door. He said now we'll go home; Levi said, stay a little longer, I'll go in and see if there is any thing else. He went in and staid about three or four minutes, and came out, and brought a china cup and saucer. Then we all three went home.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the wicket when you went up?</p>
               <p>Abraham. It was open and the door too.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever in that house before?</p>
               <p>Abraham. No, never except that Saturday night we had a pot of beer there. Robertson and Levi knew the house, for they lived in the same alley. When we got to our house in Marlborough-court, Petticoat-lane, said Levi, what shall we do with the drawer? then he himself said, in answer to his own question, we'll take the money out, and throw it down into the house of office. This we thought proper, because we did not care our wives should know of it. Then we went all three of us to the house of office. Robertson and I took the money out, and put it into Levi's hat. There were twenty-six shillings in halfpence, we found in it a tobacco dish, a stock buckle, and a pair of silver buttons. Then Robertson threw the tobacco dish and drawer down the house of office, then we went into the house, and Levi the money and put it into the closet. We went to bed directly and slept till seven or eight o'clock, and then we shar'd the money 8 s. 8 d. each We sold the stock buckle and buttons to a fellow that travell'd the country, a Jew; we had 10 d. each for them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his name ?</p>
               <p>Abraham. I don't know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you taken up?</p>
               <p>Abraham. It was about six months after, I believe, I went and made myself a voluntary evidence : It was upon a quarrel on a Tuesday night, about three weeks ago. I and Robertson were drinking a pint of beer at the Three Pidgeons, about a month ago, one

Robertson ask'd what it was, I told him, He said to Dick, I believe I can sell it. Then he was to come next morning to produce it. I observed they wanted to sting Dick out of his stuff, and I would not let them. This was the quarrel, so Levi and Robertson sent people to take me up on the Thursday night before, and I got away.

            . I am a constable: On the 29th of April, about ten or eleven o'clock, there was the evidence and prisoner in Houndsditch: The evidence said the prisoner had been up one pair of stairs in his house, and that he had assaulted him, and had drawn a knife upon him, and threatened to kill him. I had Levi searched and found no knife upon him, Levi was so drunk he could hardly speak or stand. The evidence said, he hop'd I'd send Levi to the Compter. I asked what was the grounds of the quarrel, or if he ever drank with the man: He said, no. I asked, if he knew the man, he said no. After that, he said he knew his name. I told him I could not send him to the Compter for this; but if he'd get a warrant I'd serve it.</p>

I told him if he'd call at three o'clock I'd consult a gentleman; and after that satisfy him in the affair, accordingly he went away, and call'd at three; but I not being in the way, he offer'd the note in my absence.

             is my clerk; he came to me as I was at dinner, and told me there was a note forged upon him in the name of William, and if he did not pay it, the persons insisted upon giving him trouble, and said he never gave such a note. I hearing several persons had been intimidated for small sums that they could get into White-chapel court to make them pay it, I thought proper to charge the two persons that came; so I sent for an officer, that when they came, to take them into custody, which they did on Friday between two and three o'clock. The officer was not at home, and I desired them to stay 'till my clerk came: They were for going, then I asked them if they had any demand upon my clerk? They said yes, and produced this note. Upon seeing it was not his hand writing, I took them into custody, and they were examined before my Lord Mayor, and I gave the note into the constable's hand. They brought the prisoner before my Lord, who examined him about the note; there the prisoner said the note was his note, and Warner said he had it of the prisoner.</p>

            . This is the note I had of the prisoner, he brought it to me this day 7 weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Warner. I am an officer in White-chapel Court ; the prisoner indors'd the note to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What directions did he give you about it?</p>
               <p>Warner. He told me where the man liv'd, and gave me an order to arrest Mr. Ellis living it merchant Duncley's, and said there were two brothers of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the christian name?</p>
               <p>Warner. No, he only bid me to arrest him upon this note, he told me likewise he had 50 l. per year, at Mr. Duncley's, and came to me time after time about it; on the 8th of May, I went to the George, and sent for the prosecutor, and acquainted him with it, he told me he was not the person he was sure, and desired to see the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring an action upon the note?</p>
               <p>Warner. No, I did not, I only shew'd it him, he wrote his name, to shew me the mistake, and desired me to come again at three in the afternoon, and he would talk with the merchant about it, and said it was not his hand writing: I went at three o'clock, and a servant shew'd me where the merchant was, at the Crown and Magpye in Whitechapel ; it being a tavern, I said to the young man that was with me, we'll go to the Coach and horses, and get a pint of beer, then Mr. Duncley and the others came and laid hold on us, I had before given the note into Mr. Duncley's hand, then I was carried to the Compter in the Poultry, and the other man to that in Woodstreet: When we came before my Lord-Mayor, on the Saturday, the prisoner owned it to be his, and said, that I had no concern in it, and I was discharged; he said also, he had indors'd it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the prisoner there?</p>
               <p>Warner. I sent home to Well-close-square to let him know of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go with this note to demand money, without entering an action?</p>
               <p>Warner. I thought as he liv'd with a gentleman, and had so much a Year, he would pay it without an action.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he indorse this note to you?</p>
               <p>Warner. I think it was this day 7 weeks, when he first delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay him the contents?</p>

               <p>Warner. No, I paid him no money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Warner. He told me, he belong'd to the Deptford Man of War, and that he thought he must be obliged to go aboard, and desired me to get the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to indorse the note to you without receiving the money?</p>
               <p>Warner. He indorsed the note to me, in order for me to bring an action in my own name.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175205140032"/>Q. Are you so desirous to assist strangers, that you will stand plaintiff?</p>
               <p>Warner. No, my Lord, but he told me he would satisfy me; it is a very common thing to have them indorsed to the officer.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a very bad practice.</p>
               <p>Q. to Joseph Ellis. Is this note your brother's writing ?</p>
               <p>Ellis. I believe it is not; I have seen him write often, it is not like his hand writing.</p>

               <p>Q. When did William Hill die?</p>
               <p>E. Woollen. He died the first of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been ill?</p>
               <p>E. Wollen. He had been ill ever since October.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in a good state of health before October.</p>
               <p>E. Wollen. He was in good health before, a very healthful man; he said he was taken ill the first of October, with a sad griping in his bowels, and a pinching pain, so that he could hardly stand, he had strong physick that helped him very much; he continued with a sad griping in his bowels, so that he could not lie down in his bed all the winter, and was never well afterwards; he turned yellow, and grew very thin, and fell away from a very lusty man almost to nothing; after he had done with the apothecary, he said he should never overcome it. He had something of the apothecary after he found the poison out.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he find that out?</p>
               <p>E. Woollen. He found that out in March, he often took water-gruel; he was going to eat his breakfast in a hurry, being to go out with some goods, he eat it very hot, he found something of a knob in it; I heard the prisoner say, she saw her master take it out of the gruel, that she stood close by him, he brought it into the shop to me and the journeyman, he said, he believed he had something in his water-gruel, like Mr. Blandy; he said, he believed it had no business there. I tasted it, and said it was very nasty stuff, the prisoner said she had tasted it, and said the same; my uncle asked how it came there? I said, I feared it was a piece of allum, that might come out of the bread. The prisoner stirred the water-gruel over the fire, and my aunt crumbed the bason: the prisoner said, if any thing was done, more than what ought to be, it must be her mistress that did it. My uncle went to Mr. Allen, the apothecary, with it, and was under his hands sometime: the chymist came and said, he believ'd he could let us into the secret, who fetch'd that stuff; the day after he took her and me to let his son see us, to know which of us had fetched it, my uncle was then at the chymist's, he knew the prisoner, and said, she had had white copperas of him. In the evening of the same day my uncle took her out, and when she came back again, she told me, she had fetch'd it. I asked her if she had done such a wicked thing ? she said, she had done it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175205140033"/>Q. Did you explain it, what wicked thing?</p>
               <p>E. Woollen. No, I did not. I asked her why she did it? she said, she could not tell why: she was sent to the compter, I went to her the next day; she was taken before the Alderman, before whom she said, she had fetch'd two or three penny-worth; he ask'd her how many times she had given it to her master? she said, she could not tell, but she believed about eight times. On the Saturday following, I went to her again, then she said, my aunt had given her the money to fetch the first penny-worth; my uncle insisted upon knowing whether she gave her the second penny, she said, no, she did not know of it: she also told me, she could have poisoned her master with something else, besides white copperas, and that green copperas was poison, as well as white: I asked her how she knew the name of it? she said, she had learned the name of it by her father, and had heard him say it would poison any body by degrees.</p>

            . On the 11th of March last, I, with others, were at the Lock and Key Club ; Mr. Hill there was relating how he had been serv'd in eating his breakfast that morning, or the morning before; he had found a lump of white vitriol, about as big as a horse-bean, and he had carried it to Mr. Allen, the apothecary, and he told him it was poison, and after he had made an enquiry, and found his apprentice bought it at Mr. Wetherall's, the chymist, we desired he would bring the girl to us, to hear what she had to say for herself: he went and fetch'd her, there were several of us, we asked her how she could be so wicked to do such a thing? she first of all denied she did it; then I said, what signifies your denying it? the young man knows you; Mr. Wetherall was in company; then she said she did fetch it: I asked her who told her it was poison? she said, she did not know it was poison: said I, what did you do it for? she said, she did not know: by asking her several times, she said, she was perswaded to do it by an old woman at Lambeth, but she did not know her, nor where she lived, but had seen her when she was at the work-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she bid her do with it?</p>
               <p>March. She only told her that such a thing was poison.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she tell her so?</p>
               <p>March. Last Christmas, when she went over there ; she own'd she had given him some in October: we asked her how she came to give him some before Christmas? she said, she could not tell: we asked her, what she had given it him in! she said in water-gruel and broth; we asked her for what intent? the reason she gave, was, that she heard it would kill her master, and that she should be out of her time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the deceased ?</p>
               <p>March. I have known him fifteen years, I live opposite against him; he was as clever a portly man as most to be seen, a very healthy man ; I don't remember him to have had a day's illness before this.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he at the time you speak of, at the club, as to health?</p>
               <p>March. He was wasted, and looked like a shadow : I had said to my family, I can't think what is the matter with Mr. Hill, he looks as if he was going into a consumption: I had observ'd it two months before this I believe, or more; after this she was committed. The deceased had the advice of Dr. Shambrook; the day after this, as soon as he saw the doctor, I remember he said, he should never be able to go through a deal of physick, the doses will be too strong, I am afraid they'll kill me: the morning after he had taken one dose, he said, I have had such a night, I never knew a poor creature have; after that he was seemingly a little better, but said he was never free from pain in his bowels and stomach, and that he had such pinchings, that he could not sit up-right: once he said, the apothecary had left off giving him things, and he hoped he should get over it; I think this was about the 10th or 11th of April, after we had been to the club again.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he die?</p>
               <p>March. He died of the May day in the morning, after he had lain ill about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a temperate man in his diet?</p>
               <p>March. I never saw him disguised in liquor in my life, I don't think he was irregular in eating or drinking, the day before he died, he said to me, he hoped I would do my endeavour to see the girl prosecuted, for he believed she had been the cause of his death.</p>

            . I live in Smithfield : I am a Chymist. On the 10th of March, Mr. Hill came to my shop, and said, he believed he was poisoned, that he had found something in his gruel; and had carried something to Mr. Allen's, which he said was White<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175205140034"/> copperas, or white vitriol, he shewed it to me, I examined and tasted it, and compared it with other, but do not take upon me to sware it was that, it had something of the taste, but was altered very much from the raw, it was a dark green powder, almost like moist sugar; I judged it to be white vitriol.</p>
               <p>Q. Is vitriol of such a quality that it would occasion the death of a man?</p>
               <p>Wetherall I believe if it was given frequently it would, it is not strong poison, it is used by persons that make eye-water, and glove-washers; we never refuse it to any body, if we know them; we judged her master sent her for it, my lad told me he had served her. He confirmed the account of the last evidence of the prisoner's confession at the club, he being there.</p>
               <p>W. Wetherall. I am son to the last evidence; when I heard Mr. Hill had taken white copperas, I recollected I had served the prisoner with some : I remember I have two or three times, I think it was before Christmas, at a pennyworth a time.</p>
               <p>Q. How much for a penny?</p>
               <p>Wetherall. An ounce and a half; I knew she belonged to Mr. Hill.</p>

            . I was Apothecary to Mr. Hill; on the 18th of February he came to me and made a great many complaints, (he refreshes his Memory with an extract from his shop-book) he said, he had a prodigious griping in his bowels and stomach, and had been so for some months; I asked him, if he had made use of any medicines, he said, he had some purges from the Chymist, but they did him no great service; I apprehended his complaint, from the yellowness of his complexion, proceeded from a fluxion in the Gall-bladder into his stomach ; I asked him, if he ever belched up any thing that was sour: I told him, I would order him a four ounce mixture, which I hoped would give him relief: on the 19th of February I waited upon him and did not find it had opened him (which I intended) as I expected, upon which I increased it and made it more opening a good deal, and the next morning he told me had received much benefit, he had broke a good deal of wind, and his excrement was more liquid, upon which I did not alter it any more till the 22d, then I found him so well and free from any fourness, that I sent him a purge, which he took on the 23d, he was a good deal better, but still in a lower degree; then till March the 2d I gave him nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he in that interval?</p>
               <p>Allen. I did not see him in the time, he had the same ugly complaints he had before of gripings, &amp;c. then I ordered him a gally-pot of electuary to take, when he found them gripings, he made use of it till the 7th, then he told me, whenever he was pinched with those sort of pains, it gave him ease in an instant; I gave him another pot; and on the 10th he brought to me a piece of Vitriol in a paper, it was very wet and ting'd, as soon as I cut off the tinctured part, I could see it was white copperas, I was thoroughly persuaded of it; he said he took it out of his gruel, he took it away again, on the 12th he went to Dr. Shambrook, by my persuasion, the Dr. advised him to take two draughts and a glister, which were given him every night to the 15th or 16th; he ordered him an evacuating kind of a medicine, these things relieved him a little, he had still gripings and sensations in his bowels and stomach pretty much, with these medicines as with mine; I bid him look into his excrement to see if it was interspersed with blood, he said it was, these he took day by day till the 4th of April, that was the last.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he then?</p>
               <p>Allen. He left the medicines off for three weeks, but had some little windy complaints, at last they were intirely removed so that he had no complaint at all, and continued so, free from them, till the 25th; then he came to me again and was pretty much the same as before, I told him he must repeat the medicines the Dr. ordered him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any fresh complaint?</p>
               <p>Allen. I found. none, but much the same; I waited on him that day and found he had a fever, his tongue was very dry with a brown list in the middle of it, and exceeding low and faint; I ordered him to drink largely of barley-water, his pulse was very fast; on the 26th I found him a great deal more dispirited, I ordered him some draughts which he took every six hours, he grew worse and worse every day, and died on the 1st of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same disease, after the 25th of March, as before?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175205140035"/>Allen. I can't say that; I can't at all find any symptoms that we can build any such opinion upon, that it was owing to the Vitriol, I don't think such a fever could be produced by the effects of any Vitriol whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you apprehend was the occasion of this fever ?</p>
               <p>Allen. He carried a heavy burthen of leather, heated himself, and catched cold, he drank and eat a hearty supper; I impute his having the fever to these causes wholly, for he was well three weeks before, and I don't think it had any connection with it. Mr. Hawkins told me there were no traces or footsteps to be found of poison in his stomach, he was at the opening of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole, do you think his death was occasioned by this vitriol ?</p>
               <p>Allen. Really, I think, that had no regard to it at all, nor the least tendency to procure that fever; I have no reason in the world to believe it was any way productive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the body after it was dead?</p>
               <p>Allen. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>

            . I live by Smithfield-bars; I saw the body of the deceased after he was dead, he died in the night, and in the afternoon follow. I was sent for to open it, which I was told was his desire, there were Mr. Allen's servant and several of the neighbours there, I opened the body, and as there had been a report of his taking poison, I was as exact as possible, I did not perceive any thing at all, only his bowels and guts were pretty much distorted with wind; I examined his stomach to see if any thing was excoriated in the inflammation, I found no livid spots, I turn'd his stomach wrong-side out, I opened his bowels in several places; upon the whole there was not any thing that I could imagine occasioned by what he had taken in his stomach, from poison, or any thing of that kind, I examined also his liver and heart.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you look upon white vitriol to be of a poisonous quality ?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. It is of a harsh rugged nature, it is impossible to confine it in the stomach without throwing it up.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person was to take a quantity of it, would it occasion their death?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I don't know but by taking quantities it might have a bad effect; but I never heard of an instance of any body's taking it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think, the deceased could be ill of a fever, as Mr. Allen has mentioned, by taking of vitriol ?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I think not. I saw him about a fortnight, or three weeks before he died, he then seemed to be much better than he had been.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole, what do you think was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I think there is no reason to say he died of that poison.</p>
               <p>The prisoner being asked, what she had to say for herself? answered, Nothing at all.</p>

I put it clean in my pocket, I believe not an hour and a half before, from out of my buroe: before the woman was got above four or five steps from me, I said, that woman has picked my pocket, a waterman laid hold on her as she was turning into a little alehouse, he turned her cloak on one side, there I saw my handkerchief, he took it from her and gave it to me; she began crying, I don't recollect any thing she said; the watermen were for ducking her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was going by water, I thought I'd have half a pint of beer, as I was going into an alehouse I picked the handkerchief up, I never found any thing before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Did you see her stoop to pick any thing up?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not see her, and I had my eye upon her all the while.</p>

            , he came to our house afterwards, and told me there was a man in the Gatehouse, who he believed to be the man. I went there and saw the prisoner and knew him again?</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Was there any other person in the shop at that time you say I came ?</p>
               <p>Bateman. Yes, there was the journeyman there.</p>

               <p>Bateman. He can't sware to the prisoner.</p>
