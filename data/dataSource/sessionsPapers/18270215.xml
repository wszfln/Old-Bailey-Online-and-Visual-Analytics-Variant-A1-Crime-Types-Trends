I came to town on the 22d of January, and went into my library that evening; I saw my mahogany desk in its usual place there, and, I think, I saw the travelling desk in the window, where it usually stands - in the travelling desk was a small red silk purse, with a steel clasp; it had been made by my daughter's governess, and given to me; it had been in my desk ever since my return from the circuit - I never carried it in my pocket, but it was regularly kept in my circuit desk, and I was quite familiar with it; the mahogany writing-desk cost me three or four guineas. ans was in a perfect good state - it was worth 30s. or 40s.; there was a gold mourning-ring in it, worth, I suppose, as the value of the gold, half a guinea; a silver-gilt vinageret, worth 10s.; two unset topaz stones, which I brought from Lisbon, and, I should think, were worth 2l. - these were in a small secret drawer in the desk; there were also four portraits of friends at the Bar, worth 10s. they cost 30s. - there were several trifling articles, my private papers, and family accounts, and a banker's cheque-book in the same desk. The travelling desk was locked, and the key of it was in the mahogany desk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Whether these things were in the desk on the 22d, when you came home, you cannot say? A. Not from having seen them, but as the desks had been locked ever since I saw them there, I infer that they were there - it might have been a month since I opened the travelling desk, as I only use it on the circuit.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you had not seen the silk purse since October? A. I saw it when I came from the circuit in October; I then left it in the desk, and had not seen it afterwards. I had seen the other things within a fortnight.</p>

            . I am cook in Mr. Curwood's family. On the morning of the 23d of January, about half-past 7 o'clock, the dustmen came for the dust; while the street door was open for them I saw the prisoner in the passage - I am certain of him; he said, "Good morning;" I asked what he wanted; he said he wanted the clerk; I replied he was not up, but I would call him; he said, "No, don't call him, I will call again in half an hour - my name is Rogers;" he then went out of the door, and down the steps; the door continued open. I went into the library, and staid there less than five minutes; I then went down into the kitchen, leaving the street door still open - I came up again in about a quarter of an hour. I saw nothing more of the prisoner - he did not call again. I am in the habit of answering the door - nobody called half an hour afterwards - Mr. Curwood was unwell at this time, and did not use his library; I had seen the mahogany desk in the library<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150004"/>when I met the prisoner in the hall that morning - my candlestick stood on it; I saw the travelling desk there the morning before. I attended at Bow-street on the 1st of February, when the prisoner was in custody, and had not the least doubt of him - I am confident of him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where is the dust-hole? A. The men had to go down through the kitchen to it; there were three dustmen - I kept my eye on them all the time, and am confident they did not take the desk; I could see them sufficiently to be certain that they did not go into the library - they had to pass near the library door, which is about three yards from the stairs, and was ajar - the stair-case is dark; I might be down stairs a quarter of an hour. We had ten chaldrons of coals in that morning - I cannot say how many men came with them; they had to go through the library with the coals. The prisoner had nothing when I saw him go out, for I was in the hall; I did not see him return - I was up and down stairs occasionally while the dustmen were there; they were there half an hour after the prisoner went, and the street door was open. The coals came nearly two hours after the dustmen - it took a long time to deliver them; it was light enough in the passage for me to see the prisoner's features; he was not with me longer than this conversation passed - I never saw him before, but am positive of him.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You talked to him? A. Yes. I could not see from the kitchen into the library; I was a quarter of an hour in the kitchen, but still watehed the dustmen sufficiently to see they did not take the desk.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Curwood. On the 23d of January, at ten o'clock in the morning, the coals came; I went into the library to turn the carpet up, and push the table aside, to make room for the men to go through, and then I missed the desks; the men had not been into the library before I missed them. I know nothing whatever of the prisoner - he did not call to see me that morning.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Monday, the 29th of January, I apprehended the prisoner inside the passage of Mr. Selby's house, No. 15, Howard-street; there was a dust-cart at the door at the time, and I took him in consequence of information which the dustmen gave me. I searched him, and found in his breeches pocket this purse, containing 6s.; he was dressed in a blue coat, not as a dustman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was not near Chancery-lane? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. As far as a man can speak to a thing of this sort, I believe this purse to be mine - I have no doubt of it in my own mind; it is dirtier than when it was in my desk - it was then clean; it was not so tight on one side as the other, but it appears to me that since the constable has had it, it has been stitched up a little; it is the same sort of clasp, the same coloured silk, and opens familiarly with my hand - if it is not the same, it is like it in every particular.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There may be other purses made of the same coloured silk and texture? A. I suppose so.</p>

             re-examined. I have been in the silk trade. I have examined the other purse, and this is precisely the same silk; there is something peculiar in the make of it - it is silk-twist and sewing-silk knitted together, and this silk-twist is woven, which is peculiar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long is it since you were in the trade? A. Six years; the peculiarity is its being made of twist and sewing-silk together - I believe it to be the same I have seen Mr. Curwood use; I feel certain of it.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister. I made him a present of a purse about four months ago, as near as I can recollect - it was more of a maroon colour than red, and had a steel snap; it was made of sewing-silk, I believe - I think I should know it again.</p>

               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Had it a yellow tassel? A. It had no tassel at all; the clasp was arched over a little; I saw it at Bow-street. [The purse was here shown to the witness] - this is the purse I gave my brother; it has a tassel at the bottom of it, but I could not tell whether it had one or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that this is sewing-silk? A. I do not know; it is silk - I did not make it; it was made a present to me by a young man.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hackney. - On the 5th of February, about a quarter past four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in Church-street, Hackney, driving two pigs; I asked where he brought them from; he said from Waltham Abbey - that he received them from a man named Williams, who met him, and asked him to drive them to Spitalfields; I asked what part of Spitalfields he was taking them to - he could not inform me; I said that was singular; he then said he was to meet the person at Cambridge-heath, and was to have half-a-crown for driving them there; I asked at what time he left Waltham Abbey; he said about three o'clock, or between two and three; it is more than ten miles from Hackney. I said I must take him into custody - he said if he was allowed to go to Cambridge-heath he should meet the man - that he was a butcher, and he had known him a long while; I locked him up, and went to Cambridge-heath in about two hours; I inquired of the turnpike man if any person had been inquiring about two pigs, but could not learn that any one had - I also inquired at the Clapton gate, but could get no intelligence. I did not inquire at the public-houses. Marsh claimed the pigs, as his master's, next day. Snaresbrook is six or seven miles from Waltham Abbey, and not in the direct road; he said he met Williams at Waltham Abbey, at three o'clock that afternoon, and it being impossible for him to have come so far, made me stop him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say I received them in the Lea-bridge road, which is in the direct road from Waltham Abbey? A. He said they were given to him in the middle of Waltham Abbey town - that he knew Waltham Abbey perfectly well, and received them there; I asked which way he came; he said through Lea-bridge turnpike; I inquired, and found he had come through that gate, and left his apron to pay the toll, and had stated that he had driven them from Waltham Abbey.</p>

I gave it to his wife about half-past ten o'clock, when she came in; it was a gentleman's coachman's drab box coat, with six capes; the bottom one being a kind of half cape- I noticed a hand and snake on the buttons, the same as is on Lucas' coat now; there were two buttons missing on the side - it had three loops and three buttons on them - I observed it particularly, as I suspected it was stolen, and I showed it to Robinson, my landlady.

Cameron and Co., pawnbrokers, I went to their shop about a week ago, and found six napkins and a tablecloth - part of them have my name at full length; I cannot say when I had seen them safe. I received some duplicates from McKee, and went to Messrs. Lamb and Co., of Stanhope-street. where I found six tea-spoons of one pattern, two of an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150007"/>other, a mustard-spoon, and some napkins - some of them have my name on them, but it has been picked out from the others; the tea-spoons are marked "Horns tavern," with my name; the marks have been obliterated, but there is enough left for me to identify them, as I have a private mark on them as well. The prisoner was in my employ three or four times a week, till within a day or two of my finding the property. McKee is a perfect stranger, and was never employed in my house.</p>

I cannot say whether the prisoner knew of my having them.</p>

On the 6th of February Mr. Lovegrove gave the prisoner in charge, at his lodgings, No. 47, Mary-le-bone-lane; Mr. Lovegrove claimed a decanter, a cut glass, and a knife, with his name on it, which were in the room; the prisoner said he could give me no account of them, and he knew nothing of the things.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I admit the napkins are his - they always gave me a supper to take home, and I took them to wrap it in, when I had no glass-cloth of my own, and, as I did not go there every day, I must have forgotten to return them; as to the glass and rummer, they are mine; I never remember taking a tablecloth. I have kept a tavern, and had 160l. worth of plate in my possession.</p>

The prisoners immediately came in, and went to the lower warehouse - no other man was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see them come in? A. Yes. My son was fourteen years old last April; I have been fifteen years in Mr. Bache's service. I did not watch myself, as my business is downstairs, to receive goods, and enter them. I had nobody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150008"/>to watch but my son, who is an acute lad - he is not in the prosecutor's service; I never had a misunderstanding with the prisoners; we had been robbed a day or two before, and I thought I would endeavour to find the thieves - I placed the bales so that the boy could see if anybody touched them; he has left school twelve months, and has been about the premises, but had no occupation there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Why not set your eldest son to watch? A. He was out; I had not arranged to set a watch till the bales came in, and then I thought I would place my son in the loft. I saw Wood go out as I stood at my office door; Hudson remained there an hour after that; my son was locked in the loft, and could not come to me till I let him out.</p>

On the 6th of February, at a quarter-past twelve o'clock, my father placed me in the loft to watch; the trap-doors were open, and three bales of silk immediately under them; I was to see if any one touched them; I saw Wood and Hudson there in about a quarter of an hour - Wood put his fingers into one of the bales, opened it, and took some silk out, which he put into his left-hand breeches pocket; a cart came up the yard, and Hudson stamped his foot, as a signal for Wood, who pinched up the hole in the bale, as well as he could, and then left it; they then went away to the cart - they returned in five minutes, and I saw Wood go to another bale, open it, put his fingers in, and take some silk out; he put that down the flap of his apron; Hudson, who was watching at the same place as before, then went to the crane, got a woolhook, and hung it on the bale, to assist Wood - Hudson then asked Wood if he had got any silk handkerchiefs; he said No, and Hudson said he might have some made - I went to the front of the place, and beckoned to my father, but could not make him see me, and being locked in, I could not get out, or I should have gone down immediately. As soon as I saw my father I beckoned to him, and he let me out - the prisoners had left the warehouse before that. (Looking at some silk) this looks like the sort of silk - it was made up in the same way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many of your family are in Mr. Bache's employ? A. Only my father and brother, who is twenty-one years old - I am not in the service. I went to Mr. Tate's, a baker, in Holborn, on liking, for a short time, but left in two or three months, as I did not like the business; we did not quarrel; I have used a gimblet to make rabbit-hutches with, but not for any other purpose - I never bored a hole in a cask.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not bore a hole in a cask of spirits, and treat the men with it, saying, "This is the first time, but it shall not be the last by many hundreds?" A. Never. I was in the loft when these men left the warehouse; they were out of my sight for an hour and a half - I did not call out. because I was told not; I came down from the loft before Wood left the premises; I saw Wood put his hand into one of the bales, and then go away - Hudson remained behind; he went out of the warehouse before Wood; I was coming down stairs, out of the loft, during the five minutes they were absent - I was beckoning to my father when they were taking the silk out, but he was signing a man's book, and could not see me. I do not expect to be employed in the concern.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the men left the bales the first time, did they remain in the yard? A. About five minutes - they went to take some tea out of the cart, and then came back to the silk; they staid at the bale again about five minutes, and then Wood went home to his dinner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you give an alarm? A. When he went out at the gate I called to my father, and said he was going out; he went to dinner - it was his dinner time.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What is the dinner hour? A. One o'clock; I was put into the loft about half-past twelve. The first time Wood left the warehouse was to get the tea out of the cart; Hudson went with him. I did all I could to make my father see me - if he had come up to let me out they could have left the place the while - the men were going down the yard when I told him; we went in pursuit of them immediately, but could not see them; my father could not find an officer - they came back in about half an hour. I was never accused of using a gimblet for a dishonest purpose.</p>

I followed the boy, crying Stop thief! five or six men joined in the pursuit - they said the boy had ran that way, which was up a parcel of courts - I ran too, about thirty yards, I suppose, and when I could get no further, as the court was no thoroughfare, one of the men said, "Are you sure you have got your watch safe- you had better see if you have;" I was in the act of putting my hand into my fob, to see if it was safe, and while I was lifting up my waistcoat some of them seized me behind, held my arm, tore open my waistcoat, and snatched the watch out of my fob, by the watch-guard which was round my neck; I cannot say who that man was, as he came behind me; they all ran away, and I pursued them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of the five men? A. He is one of the men who ran away with them, but it was almost dark in the court; I am sure he is one of the men who ran away; I followed them, and somebody attempted to trip me up; I pushed that man down - they were all round me; I was between them; I called Stop thief! and the prisoner fell down; some of them pushed by me, but I kept close to the prisoner; the man who pushed past me went and took something out of the prisoner's hand, which I believe to be my watch - the man ran away, and got off. The prisoner got up - several people assisted me, and he was taken into the public-house - I am sure he is the man.</p>

I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which were all safe in the drawers the day before; I then went in search of the prisoner - I found him at the bottom of Lamb's-place, Castle-lane - I accused him of taking them; he said he knew nothing about it - he lives in Crane-court, Castle-lane, not a hundred yards from us; I followed him to the top of the lane, and then gave him in charge; he was taken to the watch-house, but nothing was found upon him - as we were going to the watch-house I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and give something to a boy named Stirrup, but I do not know what it was.</p>

            . I am a surgeon of Hanwell. On the 14th of January I was first called to attend the deceased at Hanwell; he was in the service of the prisoner, who lives at Hanwell, and is a <rs id="t18270215-16-deflabel82" type="occupation">chimney-sweeper</rs>

I was called in again on the 27th of January, about eight o'clock in the morning, and sent a message for them to put him into a hot-bath immediately, as they said he was in a fit; I went down in about half an hour and found him dead; there were no external marks of injury perceivable; I considered him, on the Saturday, to have died from apoplexy, which I then thought might have been occasioned by the wound he received on the 13th of January, and on the 30th of I was present when his head was opened.</p>

            . I live at Hanwell. The deceased was at my house on Monday morning, the 22d of January, a quarter before nine o'clock; he came and asked if I would have my chimney swept; I said No, it was too cold; I had not sent for any body to sweep my chimney - I knew he was in the prisoner's service; he asked me to give him a piece of bread and butter - I cut him a thick slice, and stood him by the fire to eat it; his master came and asked if he was there, and before I could speak he collared him, knocked him down, and beat him violently with a stick, which was rather thicker than my middle finger - he struck him over the loins and shoulders; and when he was knocked down, the left side of his head came against the wall; there was a sooty mark on the wall where his head had been; the child then went out - he laid hold of him by the collar and dashed him on the grating in front of my door; the poor boy cried, but said nothing; he struck him four or five times after he went out of the house, and struck him while he was on the ground; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150011"/>poor child ran home; he repeated the blows till the stick broke, and I saw no more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long was he in your house? A. He might have been there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; you said something about "How long you have been gone," and hit him - he fell on his side in front of my house; his head did not touch the grating.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness, and live next door to Darben - Long came to my house about nine o'clock, on the 22d of January, and asked if I wanted my chimney swept; I had not sent for him; I said, No; he remained in my house about ten minutes warming himself, and then went to Darben's; in about ten minutes, I was up-stairs, and heard a noise; I looked out of the window and saw him laying on the grating; he got up, and the prisoner beat him down, as far as the cage, across the back with a stick.</p>
               <p>MR. G. J. R. J. DICKENSON. I am a surgeon, and live at Ealing. On the Tuesday after this boy died, I, Mr. Evans and Mr. Hutchinson examined his body; I opened his head, and on removing the scalp there was a mark of extravasation over the right temple bone, on the pericranium, another over the frontal bone, another at the back part of the head, inclining to the right - on removing the skull-cap there was a corresponding mark with that on the right temple bone within the scull; the whole brain was gorged with blood, and the frontal stylus ruptured; and in the ventricles there was a larger quantity of serum than there should naturally be; there was no appearance of disease whatever in the body; I attribute his death decidedly to the rupture of the frontal stylus; a blow, however inflicted, might occasion that, but the injury was decidedly very recently inflicted; his fall from the chimney could have nothing to do with it; he could not have lived an hour after the injury, nor could he have died on Saturday from the injury received on the Monday, or there would have been a very different appearance on the brain; his death could not have been occasioned by either of the transactions mentioned; I understand he swept three chimneys on the morning he died, and the injury must have been subsequent to that, for this is a very large vessel that was ruptured; he was a poor half-starved boy, as we found from dissection, and his vessels would not go on very actively.</p>
               <p>MR. EVANS. I was present on the 30th of January, and agree with Mr. Dickenson's statement; I attribute his death to the rupture of the stylus, which could not have been occasioned by either of the circumstances mentioned- when I saw him on Saturday he appeared to have been dead about half an hour.</p>

On the 27th of January, at half-past one o'clock in the morning, I heard something fall very heavy from Cory's wall, and presently I saw two men go from that spot - they looked from the corner of Cory's house right and left to see if any watchman was there; they then came back to the dead part of the wall, and I distinguished them under the gas-lamp, at the corner of the house - I saw them go from there by the gas-lamp, with something on their persons - I immediately followed and came up with the prisoner, who was one of them, and asked what he had got in his apron - he then threw them all out of his apron - they were rabbits, but I could not tell the number - this was about fifty yards from Cory's house- I found two dead fowls at his feet, which must have come from the apron, and a bag containing four fowls, one old rabbit, and a young one, which I suppose the other man, who had made his escape, had left behind - the bag was close to the prisoner - I called my fellow-watchman, who assisted in securing the prisoner - I sprang my rattle, as the rabbits were running in all directions - two other watchmen came and picked them up; we took them to the watch-house with the prisoner - we came back, and about four o'clock found another rabbit, and another before five o'clock - Waters, the constable of the night, found another fowl opposite Cory's wall, and in the morning Cory found three fowls' heads - five heads were found in all - the padlock laid on the ground - we took the rabbits and every thing to the watch-house.</p>

On the 30th of January, about half-past twelve o'clock at night - (I had been spending the evening with some friends, at the Three Tuns public-house, in Redcross-street, but was quite sober - we had three or four pints of beer) I was going home, and a friend asked me to go into Golden-lane, and have a glass of gin; when I came into Barbican again I met a respectable gentleman, drunk, with two girls about him, who I thought were going to rob him - I got them from him, and in about five minutes I was in <placeName id="t18270215-22-crimeloc114">Golden-lane</placeName>

When I got loose I ran away towards Barbican, and went home as quick as I could. I gave information the next morning, and about twelve o'clock that day we took Ward at the Lamb and Lion public-house, in Golden-lane - I am quite sure he was one of the party who surrounded me; I described both their persons and dress to the officers. Harris was taken between nine and ten o'clock that evening, at a public-house in Moor-lane; I was quite certain of him - they were strangers before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Who had you been with? A. Mr. Hurst and two young men who use the house; neither of them are here. I was alone when I was robbed. Hurst had gone with me to the Brittania public-house, to have a glass of gin - I was as sober as I am now - I missed my pocket-book the following morning; I generally carry it about with me, but whether I had it that night I cannot tell - it was found the next day, at the public-house, and I know I had it at the public-house in the afternoon. I might have dropped it in the house; I found it in the hands of a person whom I frequently see there - I do not know how it got out of my possession. I did not have that man taken up - there was nothing in it but my licence. The prisoner Ward was holding me - he was dressed in a long blue coat, a hat, and, I believe, a yellow handkerchief - it happened between twelve o'clock and half-past.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are just as sure of one person as the other? A. I swear more positively to Ward, if any thing - I could pick him out from a thousand. I am certain of Harris also - he is a man of colour - I was not five yards from two lamps; I am certain I was robbed when they surrounded me; I was quite sober, but frightened. There is nobody here to swear I was sober - I had a witness at Guildhall, but the clerk said it was not necessary; I called for a watchman, but none came up, and I went home. I met the officers between nine and ten o'clock the next morning, and told them I was robbed of 2s. 6d., my pocket-book, and licence; I thought I might have lost the book in the scuffle, but was certain they robbed me of 2s. 6d., as they went to my breeches pocket - I kept my pocket-book in my side pocket, and have dropped it before now, when I have been sober. If I had not found it I should have thought that they had got it; I would not have sworn that they had stolen it. I felt the man's hand in my breeches pocket. I paid 5d. as my share of the beer - I am sure I did not take my pocket-book out of my pocket- I generally sleep at this house when my brother has not got a bed for me. I am not certain whether I told the officers I was robbed of my pocket-book, or had lost it.</p>

On the 30th of January, about a quarter before ten o'clock, I was with the new street-keeper of Cripplegate - the prosecutor was with him; the street-keeper asked me if I knew the parties; the prosecuto described several to me, one as having held his arm, and another as taking the money. I went with him, and we apprehended Ward, whom he had described as having a long blue coat, with pockets at the side - he said he held his arms; Ward's dress corresponded with that description; I took him at the Lion and Lamb, in Golden-lane, about twelve o'clock that day - the prosecutor went in first; he then fetched us, and said, "This is the man who held my arms, I am certain, and we secured him; he told me he had lost 1s. 6d., or half-a-crown; he did not exactly say half-a-crown; he mentioned something about a pocket-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150014"/>book, which he thought he had lost at the same time: Ward denied the charge. We were all day looking for Harris, whom I knew well, by Williams' description - we took him at the King's Head public-house, Little Moorfields; when Williams saw him he said, "That is the man who took the money out of my breeches pocket" - he denied it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long were you a constable? A. Two or three months - I was only an extra man; I suppose others had more interest than me - I am now on the extra duty, but have done nothing. I was with the new street-keeper, as I know the neighbourhood better than him. I heard the prosecutor say that Ward pinioned his hands; he has not said so to-night- I think Ward had a Belcher handkerchief on when I took him; there are two or three colours in a Belcher - it was not yellow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you going to work when you met the prosecutor? A. I was going on my master's business; I dare say I should have gone to my master if the street-keeper had not beckoned me over. I go to work at what hour I like, and my master is satisfied, as I am only paid for what I do; Williams told me he had lost the pocket-book in the scuffle - I rather think he said he had lost it at the same time as he lost the money.</p>

            . I am a City officer. I saw Williams, who told me he had been robbed of half-a-crown, and had lost his pocket-book - he said he was in Golden-lane at half-past twelve o'clock, outside the gin-shop, and was pinioned by a short man and a man of colour - that the short man field him while the man of colour picked his pocket - he did not describe their dress to me; when we took Ward, Williams said, "That is the man who pinioned me while the other picked my pocket;" Harris was taken at half-past nine o'clock that night, and Williams said he had taken half-a-crown from his pocket - they both denied the charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. If he had described Ward's dress, must you not have heard it? A. He did not describe the dress to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not collect from him that he had lost his pocket-book and money in the same kind of scuffle? A. He said he had lost his pocket-book and 2s. 6d., whether he meant at the same time I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The Prisoners' Counsel called -</p>
               <p>MRS. WOOLMAN. I live in Tabernacle-walk. Ward married my daughter - they have lodged with me for the last three or four months. On the night before he was apprehended he came home about ten o'clock - he sleeps on the second floor, and so do I; I went to bed about eleven, and left him and his wife up, as they sleep in the sitting-room - he could not have gone out without my hearing him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not? A. He had no occasion to have gone out - I heard him talking to his wife at twelve o'clock, and saw him at nine the next morning; he was not out of doors.</p>
               <p>MRS. HILL. I rent the house where Mrs. Woolman lives; Ward came home about nine o'clock on the night in question, and, I believe, he was not out afterwards - my bed-room is on the first floor, and I certainly must have heard him if he had.</p>

On the morning of the 12th of January I saw Theophilus Cotton about eighty yards from Mr. Hillman's warehouse, coming in a direction from there, with a prickle basket (which bottles are carried in) on his shoulder - he was alone, and went up Great Bush-lane; the prisoner Michael then passed me, and wished me good morning, and he joined Theophilus in Chequer-yard; I saw them go into Kennet's, on Dowgate-hill, both together - Michael assisted in taking the basket off Theophilus' shoulder; I saw Kennet at the door, taking it in; I informed Mr. Hillman as soon as I could see him. Michael was at Mr. Hillman's when I went there, and at first denied assisting him down with the basket till I recalled it to his mind.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? A. He asked if I wanted to implicate him; I said no further than that he assisted in taking the bottles off the man's shoulder, which he admitted; he said he did not rightly know the man, but thought he should if he saw him; I went to Kennet's with Mr. Hillman - he was not at home; I found him at Tower-hill: when I went to his house a second time I saw several baskets; he hesitated about the matter; the basket was never produced in my presence. I took Michael into custody the same day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What basket Theophilus had, you cannot tell? A. It was a prickle - there are a great many in London. I did not see Michael near him till he got into Chequer-yard, which is about one hundred and fifty yards from Mr. Hillman's. I knew Michael before - he knew me to be a street-keeper; it took him a minute or two to get to the place after he passed me - I was about five yards off when he helped the basket down - I do not know whether he saw me; I did not hide myself; it was about a quarter-past eight o'clock, and daylight; Mr. Hillman spoke to him first, and then sent for me, and asked me about it - I asked if he did not assist a man to take a basket of bottles off his shoulder, at Mr. Kennet's - he rather equivocated at first, and neither said Yes nor No, but, "What, do you wish to implicate me in it?" he said he certainly did assist in taking it off, but at first said he might assist for what he knew, but he denied it at first. Kennet is a wine-cooper and bottle-dealer. The prisoners both know me perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you on duty? A. Yes - I go on duty at half-past six o'clock in the winter. I do not think Theophilus saw me. I did not stop them, but went to Mr. Hillman's.</p>

            . My warehouse is in Old Swan-lane, in the City. On the 12th of February the prisoner Michael was in my employ - Theophilus is his cousin; I have heard Michael call him cousin - they have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150015"/>both worked together in my warehouse; Theophilus sailed one voyage in a ship of mine, and worked in my warehouse as well; as he was badly off Michael asked me to employ him, and I sent him a voyage. I deal in bottles. In consequence of Smith's information I went to Kennet's house, and saw a prickle and some bottles - it is such a prickle as I have in my warehouse, and is bound round with spun-yarn, as I generally do mine - Theophilus was not in my service that day, and was not employed to carry any basket from my warehouse - Michael was in nobody's employ but mine: he has been my foreman for three years, but has been in my service longer than that - I sent for him into the house on this morning, and told him the street-keeper had informed me some bottles had been taken from my warehouse to Kennet's, and that his name was mentioned, but I could not believe it - he said he was going up to be shaved; I said, "You helped the man down with the basket?" - he said he did not, but afterwards that he did; I asked if he knew the man - he said perhaps he might; he afterwards said perhaps he might have helped the man down with it - I then sent for the street-keeper up, and said, "Is this the man who helped the man down with the basket?" he said it was - Michael then said, "Can you swear I am the man?" or words to that effect - I still had so good an opinion of him that I could not believe it. I told him to go to work, and I would see further into it; I did not go to Kennet's place till after we found him on Tower-hill - I then found my basket there; Kennet pointed out six dozens of bottles, in a prickle, but they had been washed. I went back, and gave Michael in charge. The bottles were worth 19s. 6d., and the prickle 1s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many does a prickle hold? A. Six dozens, but it will hold six more. I bind my prickles all round with spun-yarn - they are usually bound in three or four places - I never saw any bound like mine. I know all the bottle-merchants in London - there are about thirteen of us; I do not believe there are more. I found Michael at work as usual - there was nothing to prevent his escaping; I gave him to understand that I wished to punish Kennet, and of course he would get off, if he became a witness. I merely said I would punish the receiver - he did not refuse to become a witness; he said he was innocent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Theophilus present during any part of this conversation? A. No. Michael gave me to understand the person was unknown to him. The bottles would weight about 120lbs.; it would require assistance to be got off his shoulder.</p>

            . I live at No. 13, Dowgate-hill, and am a wine-cooper and bottle-dealer. I know Michael Cotton, and have seen the other prisoner before, I think, but not to know any thing of him; I think I have seen him before, but am not sure. On the 12th of January, about twenty minutes or half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was up at breakfast, and thought I heard a ring at the bell; I live on the first floor - I threw up the sash, and there was the man at the door, with a basket of bottles; I saw Michael helping them off some other man's back - I went down, and opened the door; the man who brought them said there was a parcel of bottles for me; I took them in, and said I would look them over. The man went away, and I went up to breakfast.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you hear this case opened to-night? A. Yes - I heard the gentleman say if I did not swear what was expected of me, I might go into some place not quite convenient - I understood him to mean Newgate. I have come to speak the truth; I dare say the gentlemen would send me to Newgate if they could, but I do not think they can send me there - I have no doubt Mr. Hillman would prosecute me if he could; I did not know the things were stolen; when baskets get old it is very common to bind them with rope-yarn. I should think there were more than thirteen persons in the wholesale bottle trade, but I do not know how many. I had about ten gross of bottles in my place; a great many were washed; these were the same as other bottles. I have seen many hundreds of prickles bound with spun-yarn in this manner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you point out any bottles to Mr. Hillman? A. He asked what bottles had come in that morning, and I showed him six dozen which had come in that prickle. The prickle that Mr. Hillman claimed stood among forty or fifty others - it was bound completely round; he said he thought it was his, but he could not swear to it; I do not know that any of the others were bound - it is not here.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. In whose possession is it? A. I think it is in mine; I was not asked by any body to bring it here - I was never asked to deliver it up, or I should have done so - I think it is in my place now.</p>

            . I live on my property, at Bethnalgreen. On the 31st of August I was close to Bishop Bonner's field, and saw the prisoner and five others; I watched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150016"/>them for a quarter of an hour, at the bottom of the north side - they were sitting and tossing on the grass, about three hundred yards from where the prosecutor was robbed; they were all in company together - I am positive the prisoner was one - I had seen him a hundred times before. In about a quarter of an hour they all got up, and came close past me - I watched them, and when opposite some buildings in Bonner's field the whole six changed their dresses; three took their coats and hats off, and gave to the others - three then went round to the left - the other three remained opposite the buildings, and in about two minutes the three returned to the others, and then changed dresses again. The prisoner was one of the six, but I cannot say whether he was one who went round the building; when they came back there was a cry of Stop thief! and I ascertained that Molloy was robbed; I took his address. I was in front of the buildings, and the robbery was committed behind, within fifty yards of where they changed dresses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You will not say that the prisoner went behind the building? A. No.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker. On the 31st of August, about twelve o'clock, I was close by Bonner's field, and saw six persons crossing the field; I saw Molloy turn down the side of Bonner's buildings; the six all followed him; three laid down in the grass, and changed dresses - three then went round to the left, to meet Molloy- the other three got up in a few minutes, and turned to the right hand; I heard a call of Stop thief! and saw the whole six running away together, within a minute or two of my hearing the cry; Molloy was robbed not more than thirty yards from where they changed dresses. The prisoner was one of the six, and one of those who went round the building, meeting Molloy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you at Worship-street in December? A. I believe it was in December that the prisoner was there, but no witness being there but Molloy, he was liberated, and taken again in two or three days.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 31st of August I was close by Bonner's fields, and saw Molloy; I saw six persons divide themselves; three stood on one side the buildings, and the other three went on the other side, but by the time I got up the robbery was committed- the three who went behind the buildings came to those in front; I saw them change their dresses both before and after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What were the three doing behind the building? A. I cannot say - I saw them come back in a very few minutes, and the robbery was then done; I was about one hundred yards off at first - they changed their dresses before I got up - they changed them the second time while they were running. I know the prisoner was in custody at Worship-street, and was at liberty for a day or two after that.</p>

In October last Mr. Charles Sewell kept an account at our house; on the 4th of October his balance was between 700l. and 800l., to the best of my recollection. I produce the ledger, which is kept by James Raper - on the 4th of October I saw this draft (looking at it) presented at our counter - I paid it, and I find, by the book, which is in my hand-writing, that I gave for it a 300l. note, No. 6957, dated the 20th of September, 1826, and 45l. in gold; I have no recollection of the person to whom I paid it; I have been in the constant habit of seeing the prisoner coming to our house, from Mr. Sewell, but whether I paid it to him I cannot say - since I have paid the cheque I have examined it more carefully, and do not believe that it is Mr. Sewell's writing, but I would not swear that it is not; I only examined it in the general way of business when I paid it; I should pay no more attention to a cheque presented by a stranger than by a person whom I knew; there is a stiffness about this signature, not common to Mr. Sewell's writing - his account has since been credited for the amount paid; that appears in the ledger now before me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Whose hand-writing is that entry? A.

Mr. Sewell brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150017"/>his book back, saying he had never drawn such a cheque- he stated this to the partners, not to me - I saw him at the house - I do not know whether his brother, the attorney; was with him; it was paid on Wednesday; I think I first saw Mr. Sewell about it on the following Saturday, when he applied for his pass-book, and I gave it him. I have none of Mr. Sewell's cheques here.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. When did Mr. Sewell have his book from your house? A. On the Saturday - he did not open it, but put it into his pocket; he returned in an hour or an hour and a half, and I was informed that the draft was forged.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mr. Hawley, a jeweller, of No. 75, in the Strand, and was so in October. I know the prisoner's person. On Wednesday, the 4th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our shop, and wished to look at a gold watch - I asked what price; he said one about twenty guineas - I showed him some; he selected one, also a chain, two seals, a key, and watch-guard - they came to 44l. together; he paid me 41 sovereigns, which were all he had in his purse - the other 3l. was paid the next day - he had the purse in his pocket; he also took from his pocket a 300l. Bank note, and said he must take care of it, for he was going out for the evening, and should not like to lose it - I told him it was a great sum for him to carry about, and asked if he had no friend whom he could leave it with - he said not near at hand, and would I have the goodness to take care of it for him till next morning - I said I had no objection, and asked for his address - he gave me, "William Parker, Princes-place, Kennington;" I told him, as he was a stranger, I would take down his address in the book, and the number of the note, which was 6957, dated the 20th of September, 1826, 300l.; he put the watch into his pocket, and went away; he came again next morning, about ten o'clock, and said he had called for his 300l. note - he said, as he was going into the country, to see his father, mother, and sister, he should like to take a present to his sister, down to Northumberland - I asked what he would like to have - he said he should like to take her a gold watch; I showed him some- he selected one at twenty guineas, with a gold chain, three small seals, and a key - also a ring for his own finger; they came to 34l. odd, together; he proposed to pay for them out of the 300l. note; I said, as my employer, Mr. Hawley, was not come to town, I could not give him change till he arrived. I directed him to call in an hour or an hour and a half; he called, and I told him it would be impossible to get change for so large a note in the neighbourhood; he said, "We had better go to the Bank;" we did so, and got the 300l. note changed for four of 50l. and a 100l.; I wrote on the back of the note, by the prisoner's desire - I merely wrote his address - his name had been previously written on it, when he left it with me.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Bank, and produce this 300l. note - when we change notes we always require the name and address to be written on the back, by the person who brings them.</p>
               <p>G. SHEPHERD re-examined. This is the note on which I wrote the address - it is No. 6957, dated the 20th of September, 1826; I have written on it "Mr. William Parker, Princes-place, Kennington," with my initials, "G. S., 4th of October, 1826;" I wrote the name and the date on it the evening before, but the address at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back to the Strand? A. I did, but the prisoner did not - he said he had got his lodgings to pay for, and if I would give him some sovereigns he would call again in the afternoon, and settle the account - I gave him five sovereigns out of my pocket, and carried home the whole 300l. with me - he did not call in the afternoon, but came next day, and I paid him the difference out of 100l.; there was 3l. deficiency on the first transaction, 5l. I had lent him, and 34l. odd for the watch; I deducted that out of 100l.; the other notes were left in my care till he should return from the country, which he said would be in ten days or a fortnight. I was to engrave one of the seals which he bought the first time, and I gave him that when we settled on the 6th - he never called for the 200l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ERLE. Q. The prisoner was an entire stranger to you? A. Yes - I never saw him till the Wednesday. Mr. Hawley was in the shop when he first gave me the 300l. note, and showed him watches - Mr. Hawley did not interfere about the 300l. note, but saw it - all that is on the note is in my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you yourself charged with any offence respecting this 300l. note? A. Yes, both me and Mr. Hawley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make your escape from a house which you were in on that charge? A. I did not - I was detained in a house by Mr. Cope, and went out of it without his knowledge. I tendered the note to the clerk at the Bank, and received the money - I kept it without giving it over to the prisoner; he left four 50l. notes with me - he had none of the notes which came from the Bank; the notes he left with me were one of 100l. and two of 50l.; I put the four 50l. notes into circulation - the 100l. note was not circulated at all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say that Mr. Hawley was present at night, when the prisoner first came? A. He was. I was detained by Mr. Cope and Mr. Gates about a week afterwards - they came without a warrant, to apprehend me and Mr. Hawley - I left the house, and returned home to the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you introduce the prisoner to the clerk at the Bank, or did you appear as the person doing the business? A. I passed the note to the clerk, and he sent me to another - the prisoner was with me all the time, and I asked him what notes he would have - he said, "Get what you like." I did not introduce him to the clerk. I asked him, in the clerk's presence, what notes he would have, but the clerk could not hear that.</p>
               <p>- HAWLEY. I am a jeweller, and live in the Strand. I was in the shop on the 4th of October, when a person called, but I have not recollection enough to know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, but you saw him again the next day, did not you? A. I saw him several times; I was going out at the time - I cannot swear to him; he asked to look at some watches - Shepherd attended to him, and he purchased a watch; I heard their conversation - he was asked what price watch he would have, and said one about twenty guineas - he was shown one or two, and chose one at twenty guineas; he would not go to more: he bought a chain, two seals, and a key; I think they came to 41l.,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150018"/>but there was something afterwards - he paid for them in sovereigns; I heard him remark that he did not know whether he had sovereigns enough, but on counting them he had just enough, I think 41l.; he had a guard, and ordered a seal to be engraved, which made the transaction 44l., but he did not pay that that night - he had a note in his hand, and said, "I must take care of this - this is my yearly allowance - my father allows me so much a year, and I must take care of this;" he said it was a 300l. note- Shepherd observed to him, "Are you not afraid of being robbed of it?" I think he said he had got to go Kingston - he had given a name for the engraving of the seal, and Shepherd asked for his name and address - he said, William Parker, in some square up at Kennington; the seal was to be engraved W. P.</p>
               <p>Q. After Shepherd observed to him, "Are you not afraid of being robbed?" what was done? A. He said,"I am almost afraid of carrying so large a note about with me - will you take care of it for me till to-morrow morning?" Shepherd said, "If you have no friend about here who will take care of it for you, I will;" he left the note, and Shepherd wrote his name on it - that is all that I recollect; I did not come to the shop till after eleven, or between eleven and twelve o'clock the next morning - he was just going away as I got in; Shepherd said the young man who was there last night, had purchased a watch; the prisoner was then gone - he came back in, I think, about an hour - he wanted change for this 300l. note - I told him we could not change so large a note; he said,"I will go to the Bank and get it changed;" I said,"Shepherd, you have a little business in the City - you had better walk with this young man, and he will pay you for the watch out of the note," and they went - I saw him the day following, when he called, and settled the account with Shepherd; I was standing in the shop - Shepherd asked him how he would have the change; he said, "I wish you would give me the change of 100l., the difference of what I owe you, and I will leave 200l. with you till I come back, which will be in ten days or a fortnight - if you will be so good as to take care of it," and he did leave it; I did not see him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How many interviews had you with the person? A. I think I saw him three times, but the time was so short I scarcely noticed him.</p>

               <p>Q. Turn to Mr. Sewell's account - is that account composed of entries made by yourself? A. Yes, entirely; the cheques paid are debitted to Mr. Sewell; the cheque is paid at the counter - it is then passed down to me, and I enter it in the ledger, from the cheque itself, which is before me when I make the entry; I compare the pass-book with the ledger - it is my duty to see that they agree- the pass-book goes between the house and the customer; that is made up by different persons; none of those entries are my writing - I have the pass-book here, and remember it being delivered to Mr. Sewell on the 6th of October - it then contained an account which agreed with the ledger - I saw it delivered to Mr. Sawell on the Saturday; there are now subsequent entries in it, but still it will show plainly, by the dates, what the balance was on the 4th of October - (looking at it) I find cheques that had been paid for, perhaps, a fortnight previous, are written off under the date of the 6th of October; the entries in the ledger are made daily, but those in the pass-book on the day it is left, but still the amounts will agres; we first got the pass-book on the 6th; all the accounts in the ledger are my writing; I make the entry from the cheque, which lies before me; there was a balance on the 4th of October, due to him, of 738l. 4s. 2d., before this cheque was paid; credit has since been given to Mr. Sewell for this cheque; I did that myself, by order of Mr. Lloyd, one of the partners, and credit has been given him in the pass-book also.</p>

            . I am a hop and seed merchant, and live in the Kent-road - my business is carried on at No. 3, Three Crown-court, Borough; the prisoner lived with me a little more than 12 months, as clerk. I had occasion to leave town on business on Monday, the 2d of October; I intended to be absent about a fortnight - the prisoner was in the counting-house, when I left - I do not remember whether I told him how long I might be absent, and cannot say whether he knew that, or where I was gone - I went to Halstead, in Essex, on Monday night - slept there at my father's, and went to Braintree on the following morning; and selling more hops than I expected, I had occasion to come to town on Wednesday, and arrived about eight o'clock at night, on the 4th of October - I did not go to the counting-house till the next morning - I then saw the prisoner there - I made some observations to him about some samples being thrown about, and complained to him of their not being tied up while I was absent - I did not go to my bankers till Friday, the 6th of October; I had no particular reason for going; but Saturday being pay-day, I like to see how my account stands - my bankers are Messrs. Hanburys' and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner remain with you on the 5th of October? A. He was there on Thursday morning, the 5th, about half-past 9 o'clock, when I went to the counting-house- I went into the market, and when I returned I believe he was there - I went out a second time, and when I returned the door was locked - I had a key in my pocket as well as him - I opened the door, went to my desk, and found a note laying on it - he had made no communication to me before that he was going away. This is the note; it is in his hand writing (read).</p>
               <p>MR. SEWELL. - Sir, In consequence of a little difference between my mother and myself, a night or two back, we parted; and as your salary is inadequate to my support, I thought it best to make inquiry for something better, and have met with the wished for success, and have now gone to it - I will send in my account to-morrow morning.</p>
               <p>Yours respectfully, S. ENGLAND.</p>
               <p>October 5, 1826.</p>
               <p>MR. SEWELL. Till I received this note, I had not the least idea of his being about to leave me; I only gave him 26l. a year - he had been a little more than twelve months with me, and was recommended to me by a medical gentleman, who attends my family; he never returned, nor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150019"/>did I receive any account the next morning - I went to my bankers on Friday, and inquired for my pass-book; they told me it was not there - I returned home, found it in my desk, and took it to them; I got it from them again on Saturday morning, with the cheques, which purported to have been paid; I happened to call, on my way back, at my solicitors, Messrs. Hall, Thompson, and Sewell, at Salter's-hall - I looked at my pass-book in the clerk's office, and finding an entry, which I did not expect, I looked for the voucher, and found a cheque for 345l., which I was debited for, in the pass-book. This is the cheque (looking at it) - it is not drawn by me; I have no doubt of the body of it being the prisoner's hand-writing; I never authorized him to draw any cheque.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect him to fill up any cheque for that amount? A. Certainly not. I do not speak to the signature, except that it is not my writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The prisoner was in your employ at Three Crown-court, Borough? A. Yes; that is in Southwark; I left the counting-house about half-past two o'clock on Monday, and left London about three or four; I returned to town on Wednesday night, about eight o'clock; I got on the coach at Braintree; I did not go further than Halstead, which is seven miles from Braintree; I intended to have been absent a fortnight; I took with me samples of, perhaps, one hundred and twenty or one hundred and fifty pockets of hops.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you meet with at Braintree? A. I find, by my sale-book, I sold two pockets to

            , fifty-seven to Mr. Satch, of Colchester, ten to Mr. Walton, of Chelmsford, and, I believe, I sold two more to my brother; I sold no more; I intended to go to Norwich, where I had left my horse and gig, to resume a journey, and I went subsequently; I meant to go to Yarmouth; I should not have returned home, had I not made the sales I have mentioned; I had made an appointment with a gentleman, and, I believe, I wrote to him from Norwich, stating that I should meet him probably on my next journey; I sold these hops at Braintree fair; I had returned from Norwich on the 27th or 28th of September to supply myself in the market, ready for the fair; the hops I sold were all Kent, except two pockets; I had no more Kent left, and was obliged to return to town for more samples, as the people there seldom buy Sussex hops, which was all I had left.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, why take them there? A. It is impossible for me to tell what people may fancy.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave your cheque-book, on going from town? A. In a separate drawer, by the side of my desk; I believe I locked it; I have no recollection of having found it unlocked; here is my cheque-book and the margins; I never had any conversation with the prisoner in my life, on the subject of my balance.</p>
               <p>Q. You never communicated to him the state of your affairs? A. No, not the particular state of my affairs; I never told him the amount of my balance; all I say of the signature to the cheque is, that it is not mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the turn at the end of the l, does it not appear to have been added to the original signature? A. It appears to have been tipped up with a pen; I do not believe it has been added; I have turned my l's something like it at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said that, but for that you should not have known it not to be your hand-writing? A. I never said any thing of the kind - I never said so to Mrs. Amey England, nor to any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at your cheque-book, and refer to the margin of a cheque, dated the 2d of October, and see if it is not torn out? A. There is the remains of a cheque having been torn out clean - I do not recollect ever finding the drawer open - I sometimes put a short dash with a pen at the bottom of my name - it is very probable that I have torn cheques out at the end of my book to take with me when I am going to travel, and sometimes I tear it out completely to the margin; but when I come home I take off the following cheque, and write on the margin of that the particulars of the one I have used.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at any time, subsequent to the discovery of this supposed forgery, advise Mrs. England not to go to Messrs. Hanburys'? A. I did; it was before the prisoner was in custody - I did not state to her that I had paid in 900l. or 700l., shortly before this cheque was paid; I might have said that I had paid in money, but not those sums; I have no recollection of having said any thing to her - I never heard Mrs. Sewell say so to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state to her that England thought he had ruined you in drawing out that amount, because he was not aware that you had paid in 700l. or 900l. shortly before? A. Certainly not; this calls to my recollection something of what did pass - I might have stated to Mrs. England that he thought he was drawing nearly, or quite, all the ready money I had there; but he was not aware of the sums I had previously paid in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mrs. Sewell saying, "He thought he had overdrawn 14l. or 15l., did not he?" addressing you? A. Certainly not; nor did I say, "Yes, but I had paid in a sum of 900l. shortly before," or any such a thing - I did not tell her that I was the nominal prosecutor on this charge, or give that as my reason for advising her not to go to the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on the solemn oath which you have taken, between Almighty God and the prisoner, is not that signature your hand-writing? A. Certainly not; decidedly not - not one iota of it.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Nor was it written by your authority? A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You found your pass-book at home? A. Yes; it was in my desk, which was locked.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at this paper, is it your hand-writing? A. Yes; this is dated the 11th of October - he went down with me about two days before that - he said he should like to buy a coach - I said I would sell him mine; I asked him five hundred guineas for the whole; he said he could not purchase the whole, but should like a stage of it- I asked him two hundred guineas for the stage, between Belfont and Bracknell - he said he would give me 200l., and I said he should have it - he gave me 12l. to bind the bargain - he rode up with me the day after this paper was drawn up the 12th of October - he gave me a watch-chain and seals, as a present - I delivered them up to the officer at Reading.</p>

            . I am master of a Reading coach. In October I saw the prisoner at the Saracen's Head, Friday-street; I drove a coach backwards and forwards then; he went to Reading once with me; I occasionally stopped down at Reading; and about the 19th of October, or the latter end of that month, I had some conversation with the prisoner at Reading; I recollect telling him, about eight o'clock one morning, that I fancied he had been doing something wrong, as I had seen him with a gold watch, and understood he had another - I said I had heard of a forgery in town, and thought he might have been concerned in it; he said he did not know any thing particularly about that; perhaps he might, but he did not say he was concerned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deny being engaged in it? A. No; in fact. I did not press it - he said he thought he should go away somewhere, and talked of going to Oxford or Southampton - he said he hoped I should not detain him, or stop him; this was after I had told him what I had heard of a forgery in London - I said I thought if he had done it he had better be off - he took the nails off his portmanteau, which formed the initials, W. P., and left the portmanteau with me till he should come or send for it - I produce it; here are the marks of the W. P.; he did not say where he was going, and never came or sent for it; I saw Mr. Gates, the solicitor, open it, and take out some papers, which I put my initials on, with the date, the 25th of October - these are them. After seeing an advertisement I went, and made a communication to Messrs. Hanburys'.</p>

            , ESQ. I am one of the partners in the banking-house of Messrs. Hanbury and Co. On Saturday, the 20th of January, the prisoner came into the inner counting-house of our banking-house, No. 60, Lombard-street, and asked for Mr. Lloyd; I said my name was Lloyd; he said, "My name is Sharpe England;" I replied, "Who is Sharpe England?" not, at the moment, recollecting the name; he said, "I am come to surrender myself;" Mr. C. Lloyd, who was sitting at the desk, turned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150021"/>round, and said, "Oh! he is the young man who committed the forgery;" I said I hoped he had well considered the matter, and the step he had taken - that he had nothing to expect from us, us it was out of our hands, and in those of the Bankers' Association; I think he said, "I suppose you won't let me go now;" I said, "Certainly not," and asked him to step into another room; he said, "I hope you will consider my case as leniently as you can." I sent for Mr. Gates, and went myself to the Mansion-house, for Mr. Cope.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ERLE. Q. When you said you could not let him go, did that appear to alarm him? A. He was as collected as possible,</p>
               <p>G. SHEPHERD re-examined. This is the seal, the chain, and watch that I sold the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). May it please your Lordship, I am fully aware of my awful situation, but of the charge, I, in the presence of Almighty God and the Court, declare myself innocent; my father was a respectable tradestman, well known and esteemed, and in the early part of his life was in the service of one of the worthy Aldermen of this City; he was in bad health, sustained great losses, and died insolvent, leaving a widow, a younger brother, and myself, without the means of support - I was only four years old; my mother was reduced to poverty and distress; under these circumstances I became acquainted with Mr. Sewell, who took me into his service, at 8s. a week, and after being with him a year he increased my wages to 10s., which continued to the time I left him; I will not enter into the particulars of the transaction, as it cannot be confirmed, and I shall be charged with having impeached others. I hope you will consider well before you find me guilty. I solemnly state my declarations are true, and, in the presence of all the world, and the Almighty, declare myself innocent.</p>
               <p>Nine witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

This bill (looking at it) was left for acceptance at our house on the 16th of January - and, in consequnce of an observation which I made on it, I spoke to the other clerks about it; on the following day the prisoner came, and said he had called for a bill of 300l. left for acceptance; he did not say who had left it; I looked into the box, and found no such bill there - I then recollected the circumstance of the bill that we had looked at the night before, and that it was in the hands of a clerk behind me; I turned round to that clerk, and the prisoner was then taken into the parlour. The bill remained with Mr. Drake; I did not give it to the prisoner - he could not hear what I said to Drake.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is this bill drawn in the usual way? A. Not as the parties usually draw them. I have seen a bill drawn at so many days after sight, pay to the bearer, but never to such a person or bearer. I should think no banker would accept such a bill without inquiry.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a partner in the house of Messrs. Jones, Lloyd, and Co - Mr. Lew is Lloyd is one of the partners. On the 17th of January the prisoner came to the banking-house, and was shown in to me, by my desire. I asked him his name - he said John Jenkins - I showed him this bill, and asked where he got it; he said it was given to him by a friend of his, Mr. Williams, a man of fortune, in Wales, who occasionally came to town - that Mr. Williams desired him to leave it for acceptance, to call for it again, and deliver it to him back at 12 o'clock that day - he said he had had it the previous day from Mr. Williams, to leave for acceptance - that Mr. Williams lived at No. 342, Strand, while in town - I took a memorandum of what he said his name was, and the name of the person whom he said he had the bill from; he said he himself lived at No. 42, Aldersgate-street, and I think he said he had lived with a Mr. Levett, a shop-keeper, in the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper, do you know whose hand-writing it is? A. No - it is not mine; I do not know whether it was written in my presence - I wrote his address down as No. 42, Aldersgate-street. I know David Jones, of Llandovery, in Wales - he is a banker, and carries on business as David Jones and Co.; he does business with us - he had many thousands of pounds in our hands at that time; the hand-writing on the bill is not his; I know no writing that resembles it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you ever been to Llandovery? A. No. I have seen David Jones write; I cannot say whether any other David Jones and Co. carry on business there; the bill is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150022"/>very clumsily drawn; persons must be very little acquainted with bills to draw one in this manner.</p>

            . I am a solicitor. On the 17th of January I was sent for to Messrs. Jones and Lloyd's, in Lothbury - I found the prisoner there. I procured and officer; when I entered the banking-house, Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Tabor, and the prisoner were there; Mr. Tabor stated this was a bill of exchange which the prisoner I told him it was a very serious case, and he was not obliged to answer any question I put to him unless he chose; he said he had only done what Mr. Williams had desired him, and he should have no objection to state the facts; I then asked him where Williams lived - he said at No. 342, Strand, that he was a gentleman of property, residing in Wales, and came to town three or four times a year, for amusement; I asked him to accompany me to Mr. Williams, which he expressed his willingness to do; I took the bill, and showed it to the prisoner, and asked him if he was quite certain that was the bill Mr. Williams had given him - he said it was, and that in pursuance of Williams' direction he himself had left that bill for acceptance, at Jones, Lloyd, and Co.'s, on the previous day, and had just called for it, as he had promised to take it to Williams at twelve o'clock; it was then about eleven. I sent for an officer, and accompanied him and the prisoner in a coach, to the Strand; I requested the prisoner, on the way, if he should meet Williams in the street, to point him out, which he said he would do; I desired him to tell us where 342, Strand, was, that we might direct the coach; on arriving at the corner of Catherine-street, at a baker's-shop, he pointed to the house, and said that was the house - we got out - he went up to the door, and observing that he could find neither knocker nor bell, I said the door would not open - (it was a sham door;) I asked him if he was quite certain that was the house he had seen Williams at: he said it was, and that he had knocked at that door that very day - it was not a door, but a blank; we then went into the shop, and, on inquiring of the landlord, we found no communication had been had at that door for some time; in fact it was the side of a room - we inquired if Mr. Williams was known there, and was informed he was not. I said, as he had told us one falsehood, he need not give us any unnecessary trouble, and did he reside at No. 42, Aldersgate-street, as he had told us; he said he did, and we desired the coachman to drive there - on arriving within a few doors of No. 42, he said it was of no use to pull up there - he did not live there - that he lodged at No. 136, on the opposite side of the way; we went there, and found he lodged there; his boxes were opened - there was a copper-plate card, with "E. Jones" on it, and the name of a public-house on it, which he had just taken, and he said that was his name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. There was no number on the door of the house he took you to in the Strand? A. No, but there was on the shop door - he said he had gone through that door the day before. I am quite positive about what he said as to his leaving the bill for acceptance, because I asked him for a distinct object; I cautioned him not to say any thing unless he chose - he said Mr. Williams frequented the Angel, St. Clement's; we went there, but could hear nothing of him.</p>

About six o'clock on this evening, I was in my master's warehouse; our bell rang gently - I ran out, and saw the prisoner collared by two gentlemen, who asked if we would have a chest put into our warehouse, or carry it back to the Bell; for they said, in his hearing, they had stopped him, and seen him run with the chest from the truck - that there were three in the gang, but two had escaped; the prisoner said, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150024"/>the two who ran away asked him to give them a lift up with it, which he was going to do - Cadwallader claimed it; I carried it to the Bell, and the gentlemen took the prisoner there.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Horne. I was ordered not to let the prisoner inside the house. I let him in on Tuesday evening, the 16th of January, about six o'clock; he fetched the coals up, and I said I would follow him down to shut the door - he said he would shut it himself; but I followed him down, saw him peep into the counting-house, and put this piece of lead under the stool - I carried it up to my mistress, who marked it; it was there the next day, at half-past three o'clock, when I showed it to the beadle; the prisoner came in at that time, and when he went out, we missed the lead; we folowed him into the next cellar, where the beadle stop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150025"/>ped him; he had then put the lead on a heap of bricks in the cellar; I did not see him put it down, but I saw him go out, and immediately missed it - nobody could have moved it but him; there was nobody in the house, but me and my mistress; I saw him come out of the cellar; I immediately went in, fetched the lead out, and he was secured; it had my master's and mistress's names on it, and was all over plaster of Paris; but I had wiped it clean with a towel when it was in the counting-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him cover it with plaster of Paris? A. No; I saw him put it under the stool the day before; the counting-house has plaster of Paris in it; five or six men have access to the place, but there was nobody there but him; my master is confined to his bed - I saw the lead in the counting-house the very instant he came in; nobody could have moved it but him.</p>

               <p>JOHN WALPOLE. I live in Fitzroy-street, St. Pancras; I have known the prisoner nearly two years. On the 17th of December, 1825, he applied to me to discount him a bill, which he produced; I gave him a cheque on my banker for it, deducting the discount; this is the bill(looking at it) - I paid it away, and it was returned to me dishonoured - the prisoner then kept a lodging-house in Thayer-street, Manchester-square, and continued to live there till lately - I saw him after it was dishonoured, and asked him where Jones, the acceptor, was; he said he should be able to find him by and by; he represented him as living at Deal; I went to Deal on the 20th of January, this year, and could find no person of that name; I found Walmer-cottage, at Walmer, which is three-quarters of a mile from Deal, but no Mr. Jones lived there.(The bill was here put in and read).</p>
               <p>London, Dec. 26, 1825.</p>
               <p>Two months after date, pay to my order the sum of forty-eight pounds fourteen shillings, for value received.</p>

               <p>Jones; payable No. 136, Regent street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. At the time you received this bill, you were supplying the prisoner with goods? A. Yes; I believe a great many persons came to board at his house, and left quickly - I made no inquiry at Deal till last Monday.</p>

I was hustled about, till they got my watch out of my pocket, and then one said, "Let him go;" as soon as I got out I left the field, turned round the outside of the field, and came in again at the small gate; I spoke to a friend, named Ralph Ruddick, who was standing there; he is not here; and, in consequence of what passed, I went to find an officer, but could not. I had some gold taken out of my left-hand trousers pocket; it was from I sovereign to 3; four men walked out of the field, and I followed them into another field; they went out of the footway across the field, when they saw me following them; I believe the prisoners to be those four men.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you first seen them? A. When they left the crowd, and went out of the field; that was after I had gone out of the field, and come in again; I thought they were the same party who were round me when I was robbed; I had not observed their faces, but I thought they were the same; they looked like the same men; I did not observe the faces of any body to recognize them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you were robbed, did these people go out of the field? A. It might be from two to five or ten minutes; it did not exceed ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the four men who left the crowd, and went into another field? A. I think they are the men; they were taken in about an hour; I went from that field up the road, till I met some Bow-street officers, and gave them information of them.</p>
               <p>Q. After you were robbed, did you see the spot, where the mob was, sufficiently to say whether any body joined them after the robbery? A. Certainly; numbers might have joined them.</p>
               <p>Q. You felt somebody's hand on your watch pocket: did he take hold of your pocket? A. The hand was laid on my pocket, nothing more - they crowded close round me - I received no blow; one put his hand on my pocket, another caught hold of me by the side and pulled my arm and hand from the top of my pocket, and at the time they did this, somebody shoved my hat right over my face and over my eyes, which prevented my seeing - Ruddick had not seen me robbed, but referred me to the witness Kain.</p>

            . I am a clerk, and live in Paradise-row, Bethual-green. On the afternoon in question, I was com<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150026"/>ing over the fields, and saw the four prisoners hustle Mr. Hunter - I saw Avery put Mr. Hunter's hat over his face; Hunter came out of the mob; I heard an outcry while they were hustling him - I stopped there for five or ten minutes after it was done; I saw Mr. Hunter - he and I went round the field to look for an officer, but found none- we saw the men go out of the field - they went into another field; and across the footpath, into the middle of the field, three of them laid down; Avery stood up, and was watching us out of the field - Hunter and I were together; we went down Mile-end-road, and at the turnpike saw four Bow-street officers, whom we informed of it - I described the prisoners to them; I knew Avery before; Hunter and I then went into the White Hart public-house, Mile-end - Hunter went out to inquire the names of the officers - I was standing at the window, and saw the four prisoners go by - I immediately ran out, and told the officers, who took them directly - there might have been a thousand people in the field where the prosecutor was hustled, as there was a fight going on; but about the spot, I suppose there were twenty or thirty - the field is at the back of the Eel-pie house, and in the county of Middlesex - I had also seen Fowler once before - they were secured about an hour, or an hour and a quarter, after the robbery; and about three quarters of a mile from where it was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How far from where the men were fighting was Hunter hustled? A. About thirty yards or more; I knew none of the men who were fighting; the prisoners laid down about two hundred yards from where the fight was - I did not see the mob disperse from the fight; Hunter was hustled about a mile from the road, and near the water side - the White Hart is close to the turnpike, and about three quarters of a mile from where it happened - the prisoners are the four men who hustled Mr. Hunter; it lasted three or four minutes; I was about two yards from them at the time; when they passed the White Hart, they were going towards town all four together, and quite in a public place- I was crossing the field, and stopped to look at the fight - I noticed some persons there, who were looking at the fight - I saw Avery there, and knew him - I told the officers I knew some of them, and spoke of Avery as one; I swear that the prisoners are the men who hustled Mr. Hunter - I took a good view of them - they were searched as soon as they were taken, but none of the property has been found.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you been looking at the fight, before you saw Hunter hustled? A. Five or ten minutes - I saw Avery three or four minutes before, close against Mr. Hunter, before he was hustled.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How soon after it happened, did you speak to Hunter? A. Five or ten minutes - I did not like to say any thing to him in the field, for fear of being ill-treated; the men might have ill-used me - after Hunter got out of the field, I asked him if he knew the parties - he said, No; I said I knew them; he then said if he could get the watch again, he would give the men three guineas for it - he did not say he would give me three guineas to get it back - he left the field three or four minutes after it happened - he was out of the field about four minutes, and I told him what I had seen in about two minutes afterwards; I might have been five minutes near him in all, before I told him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far was he from you, when he got out of the field? A. About twenty yards; I did not know what had happened till he came back; while he was going round the field a friend had made a communication to me, and that was the first time I knew he had been robbed.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. On the 5th of February, in the afternoon, I was with Vann, Keys, and Newsome, at the Mile-end turnpike-gate - about four o'clock, Hunter and Kain came up to us - Hunter said he had been robbed; Kain described the parties, and said he knew one of them, Avery - they left us shortly - we stood by the Black Dog public-house a short time; they came back again, and Kain said, "The four men have all gone by" - we immediately rushed out - I took Avery, my brother officers took the others - they were all in company; Fowler said they had been to the fight; I searched Avery, but found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When Kain spoke to you, were you walking along? A. We were standing at the Mile-end gate - he told us where the robbery happened - he mentioned Avery's name, but no other at that time - he wanted us to go round with them to look for them, but we said there was a house these men frequented, and he had better leave it to us; I did not know Kain before - Hunter complained then of losing nothing but his watch; Kain said he knew the men, and described them - I should have apprehended the prisoners from his description - I stopped them going towards Wentworth-street, in their way home; Fowler said, "We have been to the fight."</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched Fowler; I found some silver and a watch-chain on him, which I returned to him as it was not identified; Hall's account is quite correct - we apprehended all the prisoners.</p>
               <p>W. HUNTER re-examined. I first missed my money, about seven o'clock; I cannot say how much I had about me; I had two or three pieces of gold; but whether they were sovereigns or half-sovereigns I cannot say; nothing was left in the pocket I had my money in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When you called out, Robbery! did you observe any body near you, besides the four men? A. Yes, there were several; I did not observe Kain; I said I would give three sovereigns if I could get my watch back, and would ask no questions.</p>
               <p>FOWLER'S Defence. When I was first taken into the public-house, Kain said he could not swear we robbed the man, nor that we were the only four persons near him: now he says quite the contrary - at the first examination he said he could not swear either of us robbed the gentleman; but he believed we were the persons.</p>
               <p>IRONMONGER'S Defence. I went, alone, to see the fight - the ring was broken in. I met these young men, and went home with them.</p>
               <p>JONES' Defence. I was looking at the fight - I saw these persons, and came home in company with them; the witness said he would not swear either of us took the watch, but he saw us near him; Hunter said he did not think he saw either of us before, but he believed he saw Avery near him in the field.</p>

            , Tweedy, and Wilson, bankers, of York. On Saturday, the 29th of April, we had occasion to send a remittance to London; I copied the particulars of the remittance into a book, counted the notes and bills, and put them into two packets; I have a copy of the numbers of the notes which I enclosed, and the private marks I put upon them; I enclosed in the two packets, bills and notes amounting to 547l. 8s. 9d. - I cannot tell what amount I enclosed in each; here is my remittance-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this 1l. note, and see if you find a number in your book corresponding with it? A. Yes - that is in another book which I have here; I find on this note a private number, 446, which tallies with the entry in the book, which is in my hand-writing; this book only contains an entry of the Bank notes remitted on the 29th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Do read the entry? (Reads) - "29th of April, C. and Co., (meaning Curtis and Co.) No. 446, 1l.;" I find, by the other, book, that the number of that note was 32,286, dated the 29th of December, 1825 - our private number being 446; this entry is in the hand-writing of Barreclough. I enclosed this note in one of the packets which was sent to Messrs. Curtis and Co. on the 29th of April; we also sent up a letter, containing a power of attorney; I wafered the two packets containing the remittance, and addressed them to A. W. Robarts, Esq., M. P., London - and put them on the counter - it is another person's business to carry them to the Post.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have a book in which you enter all remittances? A. Yes - the entry in that book is my writing - that is "Bank, 7l.," which means that part of the remittance was 7l. in Bank notes - in order to find a description of this 7l. I refer to the Bank note book - the entry there is in my hand-writing; I have there entered the private number of this Bank note to be 446; the private number on the note is not my writing, but I can swear to it, as I examuned the note itself, to see that 446 was on it, and I have entered it in the paid Bank note book, as being remitted to Messrs. Curtis.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day did you enclose these notes? A. From three to four o'clock; I did not write the letters - I made them up, and sealed them. The whole remittance was enclosed in two packets, both of which were directed to Mr. Robarts. After wafering the letters I put them on the counter, to wait till Barraclough took them to the Post - they were wafered, and sealed with wax; I always wafer them, but Barraclough sometimes seals them; I never knew it happen that notes selected to be remitted had been left behind by accident; immediately they are entered I put them into their respective envelopes - I never leave them loose on the desk; it is my general practice to enclose them directly. I have no distinct recollection of having enclosed these immediately, but it is my firm belief that I did.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Does the book contain the whole account of the 547l. bills and every thing? A. It does.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the whole of this book entrics of remittances sent to Messrs. Curtis only? A. Yes. I took the No. 446 from the note itself, but Barraclough wrote<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150028"/>the number on the note; the 7l. in Bank notes was put in to make up the sum.</p>

            . In April last I was in the house of Messrs. Wilson and Co., bankers, of York. - (Looking at the note) this note was paid into our house on the 28th of April; the No. 446 was made on it by me that day, and entered in the book; it is my duty to put the letters containing remittances into the Post-office. On the 29th of April, between eight and half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I remember putting three letters into the Post-office, directed to A. W. Robarts, Esq. - I cannot say whether I had sealed the letters that day. The post leaves after ten o'clock; I heard, three or four days afterwards, that one of the letters had not arrived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How do you so well recollect that it was about eight o'clock? A. Hearing one of the letters had not arrived brought it to my recollection; I put the No. 446 on the note, and entered that number in the received note book, at the same time - we put a progressive number on all our notes; if it had been a 5l. note we should have put the same number.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What is the entry you have made? A."446 - 32,286, 1l., 29th of December, 1825;" this is the note from which I made that entry.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When the bag is opened, what is done with the letters? A. They are thrown on a table - there would be no others on the table at that time - other bags had been opened before, but all the letters were cleared away; they would be sorted for delivery four hours after the bag was opened - they would be mixed with other letters; only two persons would have to come to that table, the first stamper, and a messenger to clear the franks - I have been in the office two years and three months.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Were there newspapers in the bag as well as letters? A. Yes - the letters would not remain on the table more than five minutes - they are taken away by the messenger and stamper, over to a large table to be sorted.</p>

            . I am clerk in the office of the superintending President of the Inland-office. The prisoner was in the service of the Post-office on the 1st of May, as a collector and facer of newspapers - facing is putting the directions all one way - I find by the book that he was on duty that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is that book kept by you? A. No; but I know his writing - he has signed the book, which states that he was on duty that morning - his duty commences at six o'clock; the book don't state that.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man was taken ill, and came at a later hour, would the book tell that? A. No; but there is a book which will tell about his attendance - I think if he had not come in proper time his duty would have been performed by another person, who would have signed the book - if he had been taken ill after he came, a person might take his duty - but in that event, I conceive that person would have signed the book as having done the duty - I cannot say that I know a case in point.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What is the signature for? A. To show that he did that duty, and entitle him to be paid for the same.</p>

            . I am in the service of the Post-office, and was employed on the 1st of May in facing newspapers, and examining them - the prisoner was employed in collecting papers, and assisting in facing them - there are seven tables, and two baskets attached to each table, which the clerks of the tables throw the newspapers into - he would collect those baskets from all the tables - he would go to the York table - it often happens that franked letters and packets get into the baskets, and sometimes bundles of letters - I was never there but what there were three or four such mistakes, or at times eight or ten - it would be the prisoner's duty when that was discovered, to take the letters back to the several tables.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was he not an extra man? A. No - a regular man; I sign the book as an extra man - a regular man signs his name as extra, if he was extra duty - his name is under the word extra, but you will find it also under the head of collector and facer.</p>
               <p>Q. Show me his name in the book under that head? A. He should have signed it there - but it don't appear, except as an extra man - he ought to sign the book at the beginning of the duty - I cannot account for its not being signed in both places; no other person would be employed in collecting newspapers but him - there would be two clerks and two messengers to each of the seven tables - I do not swear that I saw the prisoner at the York table - it would be his duty to go there - I will not swear that I saw him in the office - in the hurry of business letters are often thrown among the papers, and papers among letters - I have known a man taken ill, and another coming on duty for him - I have been in the office eleven years - how many times that has happened I cannot say.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Was the prisoner on duty that morning? A. He should have been; and he has signed his name - he would have gone to the York table for the newspapers.</p>

On the 1st of May it was my duty to enter all remittances in the country remittance book - there was a remittance of 126l. from Wilson and Co., of York; it consisted entirely of country bank notes - no letter arrived from York that morning containing any Bank of England notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Who would take in the letters? A. Mr. Moules - they are brought into the Country office.</p>

            . I keep the Queen's Arms public-house, Great Guildford-street, Southwark. I know the prisoner very well - he is a customer; I received this note from him on the 1st of May, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon - I have written on it, "Eagles, postman, 1st of May, 1826;" I took it in payment of 2s. 71/2d., which he owed me, and 2d. worth of gin which he had - I know that I paid it to Davies - it is my constant habit to indorse on notes the name of the persons who pay them me - I never changed a note for him before.</p>
               <p>JURY to DEACON. Q. How many collectors of newspapers are there? A. The prisoner was the principal - but if they were heavy, another might help him; I cannot say whether he was helped that morning.</p>
               <p>NEALE re-examined. I know the prisoner's hand-writing; I find, upon examining the book, that his name is signed to the particular duty as facer of newspapers - it is his hand-writing, to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Will you swear these two signatures are both written by the same individual? A. I do - both are written by one person.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. At what time would these two signatures be made in the book? A. Both on the same day; they ought to be made at the same time - one shows that he was employed on his regular duty, and the other the extra duty; I cannot say whether I was on duty that day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is your opinion of both the signatures? A. That they are both written by Eagles - I have seen him write his name frequently - he would have just the same opportunity of taking this letter whether employed at one or both duties - his regular duty was a letter carrier; the extra duty he has signed to was a collector of newspapers.</p>

I went to the back of Rochester-row, and saw the prisoner with a horse and cart, inside some gates; within those gates was a shed - I saw him tying the legs of some sheep, and putting them into the cart - he put four in- the cart being too small, would not hold more; he was going to drive away - I went to him, told him to stop, and asked where he was going with those sheep; he said he was going home - I asked where he got them from; he said he had bought them that morning at Smithfield - I asked how many? he said "Twenty, I believe." I said "What is the salesman's name? and what did you give a head for them?" - He did not answer but seemed to hesitate; I pressed him to answer the question - he said he did not know that he should answer me, or words to that effect - I said I was an officer, and suspected they were stolen - I asked where he lived - he said, "You need not trouble yourself to ask me any more questions, for I shall answer none" - I then said, "If you bought these sheep at Smithfield this morning, how came you to go over Vauxhall-bridge, to Rochester-row with them" - as it was a great distance out of his way; he said he generally went the way that suited his purpose best - Pace, another officer, came in at the time - we secured him, took the sheep out of the cart, and put them into the shed, where there were sixteen more - he had got "G. Williams, Bermondsey, 16,516," chalked on the cart - we took him before the magistrate; he refused to tell the magistrate who he was, where he lived, or to give any account whatever of himself - on the Monday, Walker came and claimed the sheep, as twenty of the thirty-three which he had lost - they were not advertised, but I requested a reporter in the office to name the circumstance; we searched him, and found two sovereigns, and about 2s. on him, with one turnpike ticket of the Vauxhall-gate, one of the City toll bar, and one of the Marsh-gate - they are not dated.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Friday morning, the 2d of February, I was in Smithfield, and bought twenty sheep of a man named Thomas Wood, for 31l.; I paid him thirty-one sovereigns, and drove them home; I had not room in my slaughter-house for them, and took them to the shed, which I hired of Wells. I have a witness named Portwine, who saw me buy and pay for them.</p>
               <p> - LUCE. I am the door-keeper of this Court. - At ten o'clock this morning a woman, who said she was the prisoner's wife, brought a man to the door, saying that his name was Portwine, and he was a witness; I said I would call him when he was wanted. I saw him in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150031"/>yard since two o'clock, and when this case came on somebody said the prisoner's wife had been gone ten minutes.</p>
               <p>- WELLS. I am the wife of John Wells, the witness. When this trial was called on I told the door-keeper I would fetch the prisoner's wife, as I had seen her over the way at the public-house, but when I went for her she was gone.</p>
               <p>His Lordship postponed summing up this case to the Jury until after the subsequent trial, which occupied till past five o'clock - Portwine being then called did not appear.(See the Fifth Day.)</p>

On the 14th of February, at six o'clock in the evening, I went to the yard in Fan-street, and saw the woman standing at the corner of a dung-hill - as I approached her she coughed three times, which excited my suspicion - I looked round, and saw Shorey bring a eight-bushel sack out of my stable, and take it into the female prisoner's husband's stable; she immediately followed him into the stable, and said, "Sam, Sam, here is your master;" he said, "Where? where?" I seized him, and said, "Here"- I took from his hands this bag, filled with oats, chaff, and beans, mixed; he said it was the first time - I asked how he came to do it - he then said the woman had nothing for her horse to eat that night, and he had lent it to her - it was worth 20s. I gave charge of them both, and found another sack of mine in Henley's stable, and some hay, which I feel certain was grown on my father's farm. I found one sack full, and another half full of the same mixture in the loft, and am certain that was also my chaff.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do you cut the chaff yourself? A. No, but I know it by its corresponding with the rest: I have samples of my own here, and have compared it; Shorey said at first that it was the first time - he afterwards said he had lent it to her. I gave him particular orders not to lend provender, having missed a good deal. I have forty workmen, and had less suspicion of him than any one. I never borrow provender - our stables are both in the same range, but do not communicate - the yard is common to us all. I believe Henley is a hard-working industrious woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SHOREY. Q. Have you not sent me to borrow straw? A. Never. I have one partner.</p>

               <p>MR. LAW conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH COLEBATCH. I am in partnership with Godfrey Alexander Cohen; we live in Lower Thames-street, City. The prisoner was in our employ last year. and in consequence of something which occured we discharged him; we subsequently examined a quantity of amber which was entrusted to our care - it weighed 99lbs. when it came to us - we found it 40lbs. deficient. I caused the prisoner to be apprehended by King, who brought me this paper, which is in the prisoner's hand-writing; he had access to the cask of amber while he was with us - he was occasionally employed at coopering - he had left us about six weeks - the amber is worth 12s. a pound.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner by Mr. Colebatch's directions, and took him to Giltspur-street Compter. I neither threatened nor promised him any thing - he asked if I would take a note to his master; I said, Yes - he said he would get it ready in the course of the day, and I was to call for it at four o'clock; when he delivered me this paper. This was before his examination (read).</p>
               <p>"January 19, 1827. - This is to certify, that I, Silas Brookes, do hereby admit that Mr. Barnett, of Savage-gardens, Rosemary-lane, did buy of me a certain quantity of amber at 2s. per lb.; he had bought some at 1s. per lb., in pounds and half pounds at a time, knowing the same to be stolen Mr. Colebatch's warehouse. I am ready to testify from the same in evidence; additional evidence can be given."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Cohen came to me before I was examined, and said if I knew any thing of the fact he would admit me as evidence, if I would tell him what it was - I said I would let him know by letter; King came twice, and I gave him the letter; I obtained the property from a person, who is now at sea; but I did not know it was stolen.</p>
               <p>MR. COHEN. I went to the house of one Jeremiah Nathanson, in Mansel-street, Goodman's-fields, and there found a quantity of amber; he told me where he got it - I never made the prisoner any promise; I did not see him till he was examined.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Three Kings, Thomas-street, Bristol, and take in horses to bait. The prisoners, on several occasions, brought horses to my stables - the first time was about two months ago - I have my stable-book here (looking at it) - I find the mare claimed by Mr. Maides, was brought on the 17th of January - Oliver and Johnson came with her; they remained there till the 23d of January - Oliver then left the mare in my care, desiring me to take care of her till he came again, unless a person, whom he had been speaking to, came to purchase her; that I might sell her for 26l., but if I could not get more than 24l., to take it - while she was there Johnson rode her at times; I do not know that Oliver rode her - several people came to look at her; Johnson showed her in the yard, and Oliver attended also; they both left on the 23d of January, and both returned on the 1st of February - Laycock was with them then; Oliver came first, about eleven o'clock in the morning; the other two arrived about half-past five or six, and brought four more horses.</p>

               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What did Oliver say when he came about eleven o'clock? A. He said he expected<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150035"/>four or five horses that day; I was to provide stabling for them. I frequently go into the stable-yard - Oliver always paid me.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bristol. In consequence of information I took the prisoners into custody, on the 1st of February, about seven o'clock in the evening - Oliver was in the parlour at the Three Kings public-house; the other two were in the stable, feeding the horses, which appeared very much out of condition, as if they had been rode very hard. Mr. Maides claimed a bay mare that was there.</p>
               <p>OLIVER's Defence. I bought the mare on the 13th of January, at the Wheat-sheaf public-house, kept by Mr. Noon, for eighteen guineas - Laycock can prove it; I slept in Noon's house on the night of the robbery.</p>
               <p>JOHNSON's Defence. Oliver hired me to go to Bristol with him, to take these horses down - I took three and he one.</p>

            . I keep the Wheatsheaf public-house-, at Rotherhithe. Oliver first came to lodge at my house about six months age; Laycock joined him three days before Christmas, and continued to lodge with him; they spent the Christmas week at my house; Oliver had stables at the top of the street, but lodged and boarded at my house, and the boy, Laycock, with him. I remember a man offering him a mare for sale - to the best of knowledge it was about the 13th of Jan. on a Saturday; I saw the mare in the street for half an hour before it was bought; it was a bay mare, about fifteen hands high; there was nothing remarkable about it, only I have one about the same sort, and they said it would match mine very well - it had a nagtail; it was rode up and down before my house for half an hour, and then they came to a bargain; he put her into his own stable, and went away the next day, leaving Laycock behind; I did not know that Oliver was going - Laycock continued to lodge with me, and left last Friday three weeks; I am sure that was the time he left - I did not see him go away. Oliver passed all his evenings at my house while he was in town; I never knew him miss one night; he went very regularly to his bed, about ten or eleven o'clock. I do not recollect his being absent one night or morning while he was with me.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you go to Oliver's stable at the top of the street? A. I went twice - he had no horses there then. Laycock came three days before Christmas; that would be twenty days before the mare was bought - the stable is better than one hundred yards from my house. Nineteen sovereigns were given for the mare, and 2s. returned; Oliver went away next day - I did not see him go, and cannot say whether he rode the mare away; it was not left in the stable. I never saw any other horses there - Laycock was there when the mare was bought, and rode her about, to show it, while Oliver stood and looked at her - it was between eleven and twelve o'clock, before twelve, I think; it was before dinner - I never saw the man before who sold it; I have seen him once since - he called at my house last Thursday three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear of Oliver being taken? A. Mrs. Hall came down and informed me of it - I think it was the week before last. The person who sold the horse came last Thursday three weeks, to inquire for Oliver - he did not leave any address.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, last Thursday three weeks was the day before Laycock went away? A. Yes - the man saw Oliver; he had come back again, and was at my house - he slept at my house last Thursday three weeks, and went away on Friday, with Laycock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time on the Thursday did Oliver come? A. Between six and seven o'clock; the man who sold him the mare called to see Oliver on the Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before it was Thursday three weeks? A. It was Friday three weeks, about eleven o'clock, the day Oliver went away - Oliver had come the night before, about seven o'clock - they might be together for an hour; Oliver and Laycock went away in the afternoon - I understand they both left together, but I did not see them go.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they might have gone earlier - how late did you see them? A. About two o'clock.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LAYCOCK (the prisoner). I was Oliver's servant. I went to live with him at Noon's, on the Sunday as Christmas came on the Monday. I was present when Oliver saw a mare at Mr. Noon's; I tried her - Noon was present; it was brought between eleven and twelve o'clock, I think, by a tail fresh-looking man; I knew him by sight, but cannot say whether my master knew him; I came by, and saw my master paying some money for the mare, but do not know how much. I took her into master's stable - she remained there till Sunday afternoon, when Howard took her away, as I was not well, and could not take her; while I was at Noon's with my master he regularly slept at home every night - we did not sleep in the same bed - he always passed his evenings there. I never knew him out after six o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q, You went on the Sunday before Christmas day, which was Monday, now understand my question before you answer - how soon after you had been at Noon's, with your master, did the man come and sell the mare? A. I cannot say - I suppose it might be a fortnight; my master was in the house when the gentleman brought it - it was shown out before the house; I rode her: the man stood by the side - it was about an hour before master bargained for her. The man went away soon after he was paid. I think she staid in the stable nearly a week - I think it was a week after she was brought; Howard took her away because I was not well, and could not ride; master went away at the same time, leaving me - I do not know what day of the week this was. I staid until my master returned - I do not know what day that was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay after your master returned? A. Several days, before we went into the country; my master staid several days, and we went away together, on a Monday morning, about nine o'clock. I did not see Howard when my master returned at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went away, on your master's second return, did any one call on your master? A. Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man who sold the mare afterwards? A. Yes - nearly a week afterwards he came to Mr. Noon's house one morning - my master was there then; he staid with him an hour or so - the man did not come again at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150036"/>any time - the man came on Friday morning, and we went away on the Monday following - I had seen him two or three times before he brought the mare, but have not seen him since the Friday he called on my master at Noon's - I do not know his name - I did not hear him give master any name.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you and your master continue to lodge at Noon's every night till you went away? A. Yes.</p>

Between eleven and twelve o'clock, or about twelve one day, I saw Oliver looking at a mare, which was shown backwards and forwards by my house for half an hour; there was a man on it - Oliver had a boy with him as a servant - whether the boy was there then I do not recollect - this was about the 13th of January - Oliver went into the house with the man, and I saw him paying some money - I never saw the man before nor since.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. When were you applied to about this? A. Last Wednesday, I think - it was a bay mare; I have not seen the one which Mr. Maides claims, and cannot say whether it is the same - I should know it if I saw it - it might be another.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS to E. LAYCOCK. A. Is the mare which was brought from Bristol the one which your master bought? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you seen Steed, the publican, here to-day? A. I have subpoenaed him in case it should be necessary to call him; I had spent the day beyond Hounslow, at Mr. Manchester's - I was certainly tipsy, but had my recollection perfectly - Sleet had passed me in the road; I said he might as well walk home with me, as I knew him - I asked him to see me home; I knew him by sight, and may have spoken to him when I have met him; but merely said, "Good morning!" I considered him a respectable man.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true that you passed by your own house this night? A. I did, with a view to treat him at the Hole-in-the-Wall, which is nearly opposite my house; but I did not go into the house, for I was knocked down within two or three doors of it - Sleet was walking by my side, and must have seen me knocked down - I stumbled against the basket, but that did not throw me down - I was knocked down by the man who rushed out - a man named Fuller was there; I did not fight; I began to abuse him about the basket, but made no blow at any one; I believe the prisoner to he the man, from my recollection of having seen him in the rough great coat; and I saw him run away - he was taken about three weeks ago.</p>

            . I am the watchman of Beaufort-row, Chelsea. On this night, about eleven o'clock, I saw the prosecutor before this happened; I afterwards saw him with Sleet - I was two or three doors off, when I saw a man in a white coat rush out on Mr. Brill, who certainly fell from the force of that man; I am sure the prisoner is the man, for I knew him before; I ran on - the prisoner was then leaning over him in rather a stooping position - I said, "What is the matter?" the prisoner straightened himself up, hit me in the face, and then ran away; he appeared to have his hands about Brill's middle; next morning I saw Brown pick up the watch in the kennel where Brill had lain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first saw him, were not he and Sleet arm-in-arm? A. Yes; I did not see Sleet when Brill was knocked down, as it was a very dark night - I swear to the prisoner because he had a white coat on, and he remained there till I got up to them - I asked Brown who it was that had run round the corner, in the white coat, as I considered he ought to know as well as me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Sleet? A. Yes - after the affray; I heard of no fight - I was not near enough to Brill to tell whether he was sober; I am certain of the prisoner - there was a gas light facing him as he ran.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I apprehended the prisoner on the 26th of January, in Love-lane, Wandsworth; he was sitting by the fire-side - I said, "Tom, I want you" - he said, "What, about that job of Mr. Brill's?" I had not mentioned Brill's name - he said, "Mr. Brill cannot make any more than an assault of it, can he?" - I said I did not know, but Brill charged him with robbing him.</p>

            . I am a cordwainer, and live at Battersea. I have known Brill about a year and a half: I saw him about a quarter past eleven o'clock on the night of the 5th of September; he said "Halloo, is that you, Battersea?" meaning me - I said, "Yes, sir;" he said, "I mean Mr. Sleet" - I said, "Yes;" he said, "I will indict you for walking so fast; why not accompany me down the road?"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150038"/>- seeing him very much in liquor, I said I would - I walked with him opposite his own house, and I said, "You have passed your house, you had better cross the way;" he said, "No, I will go to the Hole-in-the-Wall, and treat you with a glass of brandy and water;" I said I did not require that, as I considered he had had quite enough - that it was late, and we should not get in; he said,"Oh, d-n their eyes; I will fetch them down - they'll serve me, I know;" and when we came to the bottom, to turn up to the door, a basket stood in the road - he tumbled over it while he held my arm, and said, as he lay down, "What the hell is that I have tumbled over?" - I said it appeared to be a basket - six or seven people stood by the public-house door, and as he got up, one of them said, "It is my basket," begged his pardon, and said he hoped it had not hurt him; he said, "D-n your eyes, you scoundrel, you put it there on purpose for me to fall over;" he collared the man, and shook him - the man pushed him away, and he would have fallen if I had not caught him - I could not keep him from the men - he said, "D-n their eyes! I will floor the whole of them;" and struck right and left at them; one of them struck him, and being intoxicated, he fell into the kennel; three or four of the party ran away; I saw nobody hanging over Brill; I helped him out; I then saw Leeper, the watchman; nobody attempted to touch Brill, till he struck right and left at them.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Was Brill bleeding or not? A. He had a tremendous blow, either by falling or bitting at the men; he certainly was in a gore of blood; I gave Brill my card that night, promising to call on him next morning at nine o'clock, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of your giving him your card, when you were going to call? A. He being in liquor, I thought he might not recollect, and I gave him the card to satisfy him; I was sober; I do not know the prisoner; I certainly have been to see him in prison; having been waiting here five days, I called there yesterday; I knew one Featherston, who was outside the public-house, and a baker, whose name I do not know; they both live somewhere at Chelsea; I attended at Queen-square; the Magistrate would not bind me over; I attended there by Mr. Brill's desire.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Brill accuse you of not having done your duty by him? A. Never; I stated to the Magistrate, in Brill's presence, the same as I have here; I heard he had lost his watch almost directly he got up; I was sober; I saw nobody in a white coat. to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>- STEED. I am a publican. Brill was at my house on this night; he was tipsy; he subpoenaed me me here yesterday, and told me I need not come to-day.</p>
               <p>J. LEEPER re-examined. I knew the prisoner before, and knew where he lived; but did not apprehend him, as he never came in my way; I told Brill that night that it was the prisoner who ran away.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the 2d of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I went into the back yard of No. 29, Rochester-row, Westminster, and saw Pople, my brother officer, in conversation with the prisoner; there was a horse and cart in the yard, and four sheep in it - Pople asked him his name - he said it was George Williams, but refused to tell where he lived; we took him into custody, and found about 2l. 4s. in money on him; he said, after we had handcuffed him, "Take care of my horse and cart, and likewise the sheep;" we took the horse and cart with us- when we left him at the watch-house he asked what was done with his horse and the sheep; I told him we had put the sheep at a butcher's named Peek, and the horse and cart at a livery-stables in Great Tothill-street. When we came to the examination on Monday he asked me if his horse was taken care of; I told him it was, and when he was fully committed for trial he asked Mr. White, the Magistrate, if he would deliver up the horse and cart to him before he went to Newgate; Mr. White said, "Certainly not."

I have been in town about a week, and have been lodging in West-lane, Smithfield, at a private house, kept by Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you come to town? (Prisoner "Last Monday.") A. Monday, Yesterday week - I have been here ever since - I was working for Cole last Saturday week. I came up here merely to see a friend, named John Griffith; Mr. Cole knew of my coming - I asked his leave to come for a week, or a day or two more if I liked; Griffith is a carpenter, and lodges in Long-lane. - I was here yesterday - I came by myself about two o'clock, and left about half-past three; I saw the prisoner's wife; I did not go away with her - I do not know of any other man being here with her; I do not go by any other name - I did not speak to any officer here yesterday.

On the 1st of February, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner called on me, to let me know that a daughter of mine, who is an unfortunate girl, was in trouble - I did not know him before, but I am sure he is the man; he said she wanted me to send to her; I said I did not wish to know any thing about her, or have any thing to do with her; he went away. I went out about two o'clock in the afternoon, leaving nobody in the house - I locked the room door, and shut the street door when I came out; I went home about ten minutes before four, and found the street door wide open, and on going upstairs the room door was open, and the lock broken; we have only one room on the first floor. I saw a strange hat laying on a chair, and my husband's hat was taken out of the box, and carried away. I went down and told the neighbours I was robbed. I missed all this property, which I had seen safe before I went out that afternoon; the hat that was left behind, was the prisoner's, I believe, but when he called in the morning it had a piece of black crape round it, which was not on it then - I cannot say it was his hat, but he was apprehended with my husband's hat on, which then had a piece of crape round that; I am sure it was the prisoner's hat, by a mark which I had noticed on the side of it in the morning - it was a cut down the side; I have found nothing but my husband's hat. I took the crape off, and found the band which my husband used to wear, was taken off; there was no crape on my husband's hat before; I gave 4s. for the hat six months ago - it was not new then; 1 value it at 1s., and the other things at 5s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You never saw the prisoner before? A. No - he did not stop a minute with me, and did not take his hat off; I had the keys of all the rooms in the house, to show them, as they were to be let.</p>

I desired a person to apprehend the prisoner, and he delivered him to me, at the watch-house, on the 2d of February, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning - I searched him, and found 7d. in copper on him, and the hat produced on his head.</p>

I wished them good morning, and went straight from there to Red Lion-square; several people were there, getting tickets for the Mendicity society; I was directed to Mr. Sykes, of Queen-square - the beadle said if I waited in the square I might hear of a ticket; a woman came up, and said she would give me one, but it was too late, that I must come at half-past two o'clock; I went and stopped in Davies-court, and at half-past two o'clock I went to Red Lion-square, and after that went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150040"/>with a young man to the Refuge for the Houseless - I was going to Gravesend next day, when I was taken.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Mendicity Society. We enter in a book all applications for relief - here is the book, and it has the following entry, in my writing, (reads) "John Farley, ticket, 79,730, states he lodged at Kingston the preceeding night, and was a native of Godliman;" being a sailor, I ordered him food, and recommended him to sleep at the Refuge at Wapping - I cannot say the prisoner is that individual, but I have certainly seen him at the office at some time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does the position in which that entry stands enable you to form any judgment at what time he presented himself? A. It was certainly in the after-part of the day; we examine females before any men; he must have been there after two; we disposed of one hundred and thirty-four cases that day, and perhaps a young lad of his description might be detained there two or three hours.</p>

On Saturday, the 31st of January, I missed a book, and, upon examining my stock, I missed at least six Bibles and Prayer-books; I questioned my boy Henry about them. The prisoner came on Monday morning, and I watched him; thinking he saw me I bounced out upon him, challenged him with robbing me, and insisted on his telling me what he had taken - he said he would take me to the pawnbrokers, where I found several Bibles, Prayer-books, and Watts' Hymns, which had formed part of my stock; I could not have found them except from his information. I believe his family were in distress.</p>

On Sunday, the 22d of January, 1826, I had no servant, as she had left me for a week, having lost a friend; she was to return on Monday- we went on that Sunday to Christ church, Stafford-street, Lisson-grove; it is four or five minutes' walk from our house - I, my husband, and child, who is in her twelfth year, went to the morning service, and left no one in the house; I fastened all the doors myself, and took the keys with me - I fastened the kitchen window down the last thing; we returned from church about ten minutes or a quarter-past one o'clock; I put the key into the door; it opened as usual, so did the garden gate in front of the house; there was nothing amiss with them; we had a Newfoundland dog inside the house; when I got in, I found the back parlour door wide open; I had left it shut when I went out; there are folding-doors from that room to the front; I went in, and saw papers scattered about; I then went up to the drawing-room, and found that door open; the drawers were rifled, and a great deal of wearing-apparel scattered about - I found the next room door open, and every cupboard and lock forced open; I went down, and called my husband out of the garden; I then went into the kitchen, and found the dog tied up to the dresser with a silk handkerchief: he was loose when we went out, and had the range of all the stairs; he was tied up very tight with a handkerchief put under his collar, and tied to the leg of the dresser; my husband cut the corner of the handkerchief off to get the dog loose; it was our own handkerchief; a fore-spring of pork, which I had left on the dresser, was thrown down to the dog, who was tied up too tight to get at it; there was a slop of salt and water on the tea-tray on the table - the tray was quite clean and wiped up when I went out; my husband went to look for an officer immediately, and brought Gibbs in two hours after; we then proceeded to examine the house with him; I found the kitchen window, which I had fastened the last thing before I went out, was broken open; it was large enough to admit three men; we had lost two 10l. notes, five sovereigns, nearly 20s. in silver, a watch, a coat, a shawl, a brown silk pelisse lined with white, five rings, a shirt pin, two brooches, a pair of earrings, six necklaces, two neck-chains, the miniature of a man in soldier's uniform, set in gold, a gold coral, which wanted one bell, two silver table-spoons, nine tea-spoons, and two pairs of sugar-tongs, one of which was twisted in an old-fashioned way; we only lost one coral; the property, at a moderate calculation, including the money, was worth full 100l.; we obtained no intelligence of the robbery for a long time; we had several hundred bills printed, offering 40l. reward; my husband afterwards received this anonymons letter (looking at it) - we received it, I think, the first week in February - I cannot positively swear to the hand-writing - I have seen Mary Mullins' writing, but never saw her write; I heard nothing more till the beginning of this year, when I found some persons who gave me information.</p>

            . I shall be thirteen years old the beginning of November. (This witness appeared perfectly aware of the obligation of an oath.) The female prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150042"/>is my mother; I had a brother named George, but he has left the country - I know the two male prisoners very well- when this matter happened my mother lived in Stamford-street - my brother George lived at home the beginning of last year, and Duxberry lived in the same house with us - Fox came to the house almost every day; he and Duxberry were intimate with my brother and mother - about a week before this robbery happened, my mother said to my brother George, and the prisoners, that now would be the time to rob Mr. Willingham's house, as the servant was gone away into the country; she was coming back and would be blamed for it; I heard no more conversation between them before the robbery. On the Sunday afternoon following, my mother, my brother George, and the two prisoners, were together - my brother said they had robbed the house, and had got the things - Fox gave my mother five sovereigns into her hand; she said she would put it away, but did not say where - nothing more was said then - I did not see any thing else given to my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your brother, or any of the parties, complain that they had been hurt? A. They did not complain then; they were all there together again on the Monday afternoon, and my brother gave my mother a pelisse and shawl; he complained of his leg being hurt - the pelisse was a brown silk - I did not notice whether it was lined - she put it into a bundle with the shawl; I had seen that pelisse before on Mrs. Willingham's back - John Duxberry gave my mother two silver table-spoons that afternoon; my brother gave my mother the rest of the articles, the rings, trinkets, and a watch; my brother said his leg was very bad from the bite of Mr. Willingham's dog; they all said the dog had flown at them, that they had tied him up, and given him some meat - nothing more passed then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoners together again with your mother and brother? A. Yes, on Tuesday night, the next day; they were talking together, and sent me out on an errand - I did not hear what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper, and tell me whose writing it is? A. Mine, and so is the direction - my mother told me to write it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever at any time, find a coral that wanted one bell? A. No - nor did I ever tell my mother that I had, nor any other coral at all - my mother never beat me about stealing a coral.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first tell any thing you knew about this matter to Mr. or Mrs. Willingham? A. I was put into the workhouse on a Saturday, a week after last Christmas, and Mrs. Willingham came to me on the Monday. I was afterwards examined before a Justice at the Police-office. I gave the same account that I have now. I saw a coral in my mother's possession; it was red, and the mounting was a gold colour. I also saw a man's blue coat in her possession - I do not recollect seeing her with any thing else.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At the time you saw these things, did you live next door to Mr. Willingham? A. No, in Stamford-street, which is two or three minutes walk from there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you been to school? A. Yes, to two or three; the last was Mr. Prior's, in Crawford-street; it is a private school. My brother George is eighteen years old next March; he was at home when this house was robbed. I have no father; I heard my brother say the house was robbed on the Sunday afternoon on which it was done, which was the 22nd of January; I knew five days before, that it was to be done when Mr. Willingham was at church; no other robbery but this had been talked about. I saw Fox give my mother five sovereigns on the Sunday afternoon that it was done; I do not know that that was from the robbery. I wrote this letter about three weeks after, by my mother's desire - I should not have wrote it if she had not desired me; I did not suppose that I was in any danger, or that she was - I did not like to do it at first; but I did not say I would not do it, but I did not like to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that because you might bring her into trouble? A. Yes; I did not tell her so - I should have concealed it if she had not told me to write - I never said a word about it to any body - I do not know how they came to know that I knew of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who first spoke to you about it? A. Mrs. Willingham came to me at the workhouse - my mother was then in custody; I had heard the officer say that on the Saturday, as he was taking me to the workhouse; I had not, at that time, told any body that I knew any thing of the robbery - I knew when I wrote the letter that there had been a reward of 40l. offered. Mrs. Willingham came to me at the workhouse on the Monday, and said, if I did not tell her about it, she would have me locked up. I said, at first, I did not know any thing about it; she said if I did not tell her she would have me locked up among the rats and mice, to frighten me. I said I did not know any thing about it - that was a lie; but I said so because I did not wish my mother to be hurt - I know my mother's life is in danger by this trial, and knew it at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present when Mrs. Willingham talked to you? A. The matron of the workhouse, a little girl, and Mr. Willingham's clerk - Mrs. Willingham said it would be better for me to tell the whole truth - the clerk wrote down all I said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Willingham tell you your mother would be saved if you told the truth? A. Yes; she told me that several times. Fox did not lodge at my mother's - he lived at Kilburn. I should not have said a word about this if Mrs. Willingham had not frightened me. I told her all the truth: she asked how many persons committed the robbery - I said I could not tell who they were, only I saw them with the property afterwards; she then again said, if I did not tell her she would have me locked up. I heard Fox and my mother quarrel about a fornight after the robbery; she said she would be a match for him; he said "You can do nothing to me - you have nothing to lay to my charge." She charged him with being one of the party who robbed Mr. Willingham - he denied it, and said "You know better" - he did not come to my mother's place again for a long time. I went before the Justice the day after Mr. Willingham came to me. I saw the account, which Willingham's clerk had taken down, in the Justice's hands - he read it. My mother went out to market during church-time on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the expression your mother used - that as the servant was in the country it would be a good time to rob the house?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150043"/>A. Yes. I have been a good while at school: there are thirty-one days in January and in March. I do not think my mother can write; my father has been dead eleven years; my brother could write - he and I are the only children living; he remained at home six or seven months after the robbery.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long did you read about the reward before you gave information to Mrs. Willingham? A. We had the paper in our parlour the day after the robbery was committed; I never said a word to any body about it. The quarrel between Fox and my mother was before I wrote the letter.(The letter was here read as follows:) -</p>
               <p>To Mr. Willingham, Solicitor, 13, Park-road, Regent's-park. - "My conscience won't let me keep it a secret concerning that robbery that was committed at your house; and I will tell you the names of the three who committed that robbery - Thos. Duxberry, Portland Town; Wm. Sturdy, Little James-street, and Wm. Tonks, Devonshire-place, No. 1."</p>
               <p>Q. Your mother never told you to name Fox in the letter? A. No. Fox came to our house after the quarrel - it was a long while after; before the summer was over, my mother and he were as good friends as before. He came to see my mother again before my brother left home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what Mr. Willingham's clerk wrote down read over to you, to refresh your memory, or did you give an account to the Magistrate yourself? A. I read it over myself - I gave evidence to the Justice by my memory - I was then on oath.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had Duxberry a brother named Thomas? A. Yes; that brother was taken up after the letter was written; I do not know how many times he was examined. Nobody had been taken up till I gave information to Mrs. Willingham; it was after I had given the account to Mrs. Willingham that Thomas Duxberry was taken up. I do not know how many times he was examined; I did not see him taken up or examined, and do not know when he was taken - I saw him after he came out again; both he and his brother John lived with their mother - John remained at home, at his mother's, after Thomas was taken up, and he was taken there - he had time to have run away if he chose.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. When you consented to write the letter, had you reason to believe that Fox was one of the men who had robbed the house? A. Yes; I did not write his name because I was not told. I knew Tonks; Sturdy's mother lodged with us - I had no reason to believe either of them were concerned - I wrote their names because my mother told me. I have been living at the workhouse ever since she was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were just turned eleven years old when you wrote this letter? A. Yes. John Duxberry was lodging at my mother's when I wrote it."Thomas Duxberry, of Portland Town." meant his brother - I know nothing of Thomas Duxberry being taken up, except what I have heard. I have not been out of the workhouse since I went there, except to go to the office - Thomas Duxberry never came there to see me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, when you speak of his being out of custody, was that before you went to the workhouse? A. Yes, a great while before - I did not tell Mrs. Willingham about this till after I was in the workhouse. I saw Thomas Duxbury last night, as I was going home.</p>

            . I live at No. 9, Stamford-street, next door to Mrs. Mullins; she offered to sell me a coral, and produced it to me; it had seven or eight bells, but one was broken off - the bottom of it was coral - it was a gold colour - I did not examine it particularly - she asked me to give her 2s. for it, and told me not to buy it for gold, for it was not gold; and she put it to her ring, which was on her finger to compare it. I took it into my mother to ask her for the money - she had not got it, and I returned it to Mrs. Mullins. My mother gave me the money, two or three days afterwards, to go in and get it - I went, and Mrs. Mullins said, "Thank God you did not buy it, for if you had it would have got me into trouble; for, instead of Mary finding it, she has stolen it from a little girl" - that she had given her a good walloping, and sent her back to the place - here she had taken it from - she did not say where that was - this was the latter end of January, or the beginning of February, 1826. She had told me at first that Mary had found it, coming home from a place where she had been to play with a little girl - she asked me afterwards to direct a letter for her, and also to make a bill out to go to Mrs. Willingham - she asked me at one time if my mother could give her change for a 10l. note - this was a good bit after I saw the coral - she had the note lying on the table by her - I told her my mother could not change it - she asked if I knew where she could get it changed - I said No. Fox and John Duxberry were in the room at the time; but I rather think Duxberry was asleep. I did not take the note up, but I saw Ten on it, as it laid on the table. I went in a few days after, and asked her for 2s. 9d. which she owed me - she said she could not let me have it: after this I saw her wash her hands, and saw her pull three rings off - one was very broad, with thread twisted round it, as it was too large - I have not seen those rings since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She asked you once to direct a letter for her? A. Yes, but I did not do it; I was once charged with an offence, but I was not guilty. I had a handsome sum of money paid me by the person who took me up, to prevent prosecution, and also an apology advertised in the newspapers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you frequently visit Mrs. Mullins? A. Yes - I never noticed rings on her fingers before; the first time I saw her with rings was when she compared them with the coral - one was a broad gold one, with little dots round it, another a small one, and a keeper.</p>

            . I live at No. 11, Little Princes-street - I lodged at Mrs. Mullins' in the beginning of last year; John Duxberry lodged there, and Fox used to come frequently - George Mullins and John Duxberry appeared intimate with him; they were always together. I remember one Sunday coming down, and hearing a fight, about two o'clock; John Duxberry and Fox were in liquor; hearing a noise I ran down; Mrs. Mullins and Duxberry were beating Fox in a very cruel manner; they struck him several blows - Fox accused them of robbing him of two sovereigns and a dollar. I begged of him to go into the back room till all was quiet. I was once scolding Mrs. Mullins about getting in at a window - she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150044"/>said George was a very bad boy, but he robbed nobody but her - that he had robbed her of a watch and a box of trinkets; this was about the beginning of February.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was called in to examine the prosecutor's house in January, 1826 - every thing was in confusion; Mrs. Willingham has given a correct account. I apprehended the two male prisoners nearly twelve months afterwards; I met Fox in a lane near Maida-hill; I asked his name - he said Fox, and I took him. I took Duxberry in his mother's house, in Portland-town, and Mrs. Mullins at her house in Cochrane-terrace, Portland-town - I was with Morris when he apprehended Thomas Duxberry - it was about a year ago - he was examined once.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whose house were you going to after Fox? A. I do not know that it was his master's; I met him coming up the lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You took John Duxberry twelve months after you had taken Thomas, did you take them both on the same charge? A. Yes - John came very willingly with me.</p>

I heard of this robbery between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and having been informed that these boys had been up all night, I went and took Hiller - I asked what he had done with the sausages - he said, voluntarily, that he Taylor, and Green had eaten them; I asked where he got them - he said from Mrs. Bignell's - that he and Green had got through a sky-light, took some sauges, a half-penny worth of oranges and sweet-meats, and Taylor stood in the market-place while they got them; I heard them examined before the Magistrate - no threat or promise was held out to them; the signature to this paper (looking at it) is Mr. Clarke's writing.

            . I am a watchman. On Wednesday morning, the 14th of February, at half-past five o'clock, I was on my beat in the Back-road, Islington, and saw two persons on horseback, riding together; I went between the horses, and said, "Where are you going with those horses?" one of them rode off, and the prisoner, who was the other man, said he was going to Dixon's repository; I asked who the horses belonged to; he made no reply, but jumped off, and run away as hard as he could; I pursued, gave an alarm, and secured him, without losing sight of him; I kept the horse till I put it into Price's stable; I found Mr. Heath, who claimed it; he lives at Palmer's-green, seven miles from Islington; the horse had a bridle on, and I followed him with it in my hand; it had neither saddle, halter, nor cloth; it shyed when the rattles sprung; Mr. Heath saw the horse this morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The horse shying must have taken your attention off him? A. No; I I never had my eye off him; I did not mount the horse; it was darkish - but the gas lamps gave me light enough; he did not run above ten or twenty yards - and nobody else was near.</p>

I was coming from Hornsey, and met two men in Hornsey-lane, on horseback; they asked if I would have a ride; and said if I would take the horse to Dixon's, they would give me half-a-crown; and the man said I was to take the bridle, and he would meet me at the Still public-house, as he was going to see his brother at Islington. I wanted to keep straight on the road; but he said, "Cross the lane, you will save a turnpike." When the watchman stopped me, the man was walking on the path, and said, "Jump off;" I did so, and ran after the man who was on the other horse, directly; the watchman sprang his rattle; I called back the man; I did not run to get away, but to stop the man who was with me; there is a public-house called the Still, opposite Dixon's repository; I have had a situation in the East India Company's service for five years.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How can you venture to swear to the hide of an animal? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what state were the hides when you saw them? A.

            . I live in Cable-street, in the County of Middlesex. I found these cows in my premises about nine o'clock in the morning, when I came home - it was the Friday after Christmas day; between nine and ten that morning Nottage called, and asked if I had two cows belonging to him; I said I did not know whether they were his; I showed them to him, and he said they were - that they were sent by a friend of his out of the country, to make the best he could of them for him; he said he must go and look for a man to kill them; I recommended him to Hawes, who generally kills at my house for people, and they were killed; I cannot say whether they were in calf. I saw Nottage again about nine o'clock that night, with Banks and Wainwright; he sold the body of one cow to each of them, as I understood; one was a black cow, and the other red, with a white back - I did not notice any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150046"/>particular mark on the black one. Nottage brought a young man next day, with a truck, which the hides were put into, and taken away. I have known Nottage several years - he is in the cheesemongery line, and was so before Christmas, when he kept a cheesemonger's shop in Rosemary-lane - I have known him several years buying beast in Smithfield, and slaughtering them at my house; he had slaughtered none at my house for twelve months before this, nor any where else, that I know of; he was in the butchering business before he commenced cheesemonger - the last place he lived at, as a butcher, was at Ratcliff-highway, twelve months ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you known him slaughter cattle for people? A. He has killed for several people at my house, but never sold any of his own before.</p>

On the 29th of December, between nine and ten o'clock, Nottage came to my house, No. 37, Chapple-street, St. George's East, and asked me if I could go and kill him two cows; I said Yes - he said they were at Stieber's; I went there and killed them; one was a brown and white pole cow - the other was black, with horns, and there was some white about it - the black one gave milk, the brown one was dry; they were both in calf - it is not unusual to kill them in calf; we cannot always tell till they are killed; most beast have a Smithfield mark, which is the hair trimmed off the tail; the hair was still on these, as if they had come from the country; I flayed them, and left the hides at Stieber's - I should know the hides again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he tell you to be particular, and dress them well? A. Yes - he said they were for market; he did not say where they came from; I could tell one was in calf before I slaughtered it.</p>

            . I am a tanner, and live in Russell-street, Bermondsey. On Saturday, the 30th of December, Coulstock brought me two cow hides, and laid them on the floor; I bought them of him. Brett afterwards came and claimed them; as Coulstock was going away he said, to the best of my recollection, "You are not going to let them lay there long, are you?" they were quite exposed, near the door; I said, "No, but why?" he said, "Because I don't know much of the person" or "chap I had them off." I gave him 2l. for them, which was quite their value.</p>

I had put my gold where they could not find it; they lifted up my head and let it down again; they then left me - I fainted afterwards, and recollect nothing more till I found myself in the hands of Whitehouse, the parish beadle - I had been in the tap-room from between seven and eight o'clock till ten - I am not certain whether it had struck ten, as there is no clock in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, at that time, such means of knowing the persons of Sanders and the other man, as to be sure of them? A. Yes, they are the two men, Sanders and Manning, who is not yet taken - Whitehouse asked me about the persons; I described them to him immediately - Sanders had either a light-coloured flannel or fustian jacket; the other had a coloured plush waistcoat, with fustian sleeves - I did not see the prisoners before the Justice till about a fortnight after - I was in the workhouse in consequence of my blow, but not confined to my bed - when I saw them before the Justice I stated directly that Sanders was one of the men who had robbed me - Wasley has a wooden leg.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is not a white jacket a very common dress? A. Yes; before I went to this public-house I had called at the Black Bull, at Brentford, about three or four o'clock, and drank a share of a pot of beer there, nothing more; I did not dine at all; I had a glass of gin at Kew-bridge, about half or three quarters of an hour before I got to the Black Bull - I had come from London, but took no refreshment in town; I slept at Chelsea the night before; I paid away about 30s. of my money, and had about 9s. in silver left when I left London; I paid 2d. at Kew, and 6d. or 9d. at the Black Bull, as I had some bread and beef with the share of the pot of porter; I drank nothing more on the road, nor any thing in London - I had been to no public-house in London, or at Chelsea; I had a share of two or three pots of beer at the Castle, or it might be three or four; but I drank very little out of them, and half a pint of purl - I do not exactly know how much money I paid - I dare say I paid 3s. or 4s., but not for what I drank myself - I will say we had four pots of porter, that was 1s. 8d. - I could not have paid more than 2s. for my share - that was for the porter and purl, which is gin and beer.</p>
               <p>Q. You were knocked down by a large dead wall? A. Yes, that threw a shade; they knocked me down the instant they came up; they were desperate blows; they stunned me and frightened me. I had my gold in my watch-fob - I cannot say whether Sanders was handcuffed when I saw him in the Justice-room - I did not notice; he had handcuffs on when he went away - I had not seen them put on.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you perfectly sober when you left the public-house? A. Sober enough to walk any where, or see any man's face and know it again - I suppose I was knocked down ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after I was called to - I had no opportunity of seeing them till they attacked me.</p>

            . My husband keeps the Castle, at Smallborough-green, in the parish of Isleworth; the two prisoners were at my house on the night in question; they came in together before the prosecutor; when Price came in he called for half a pint of purl; there might be two or three more people in the tap-room, but I was not in the room; the servant collected the reckoning. I remember Price going away; he asked his way to Hounslow, and I directed him; he seemed perfectly sensible - directly after he was gone, the prisoner Sanders, and a person, who is not here, left the tap-room; that person lodged at my house at that time, and generally sat there in the evening, and went to bed about half-past ten, or a quarter to eleven o'clock; he came home that night five minutes before eleven; we were shut up and going to bed at the time; his father and mother live close at the back of our house; he went out early next morning before I was up, and I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That man's name was Manning? A. Yes; half a pint of purl comes to 3d. - I cannot say what beer was drank - we call it porter, but it is country beer - it is good strong liquor - 1s. 8d. would pay for four quarts.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whoever the prosecutor shared it with (if he had it) you say that he was sober? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to W. PRICE. Q. Did you not swear that 2s. was the share of what you drank? A. No; I said I might have paid nigh 2s.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How many persons shared the beer with you? A. We were drinking in company; I believe Wasley paid for one pot - I paid at separate times, when I was asked - I believe I paid for all that was drank between us four, except the one pot.</p>

            . I am beadle of Isleworth. On the night of the 9th of January, I was going from home to Smallborough-green, and saw the prosecutor laying across the footpath, quite senseless and dead to all appearance - I stopped with him, finding he was not dead - as soon as he could speak, I said to him, "Come, my man, try to get up, or you will be robbed;" the first words he said were, it was not to be done, for it was done- I went to Smallborough-green, and sent two people to carry him - I kept him in the toll-house during the night- he gave me an account of the robbery - he was quite sensible as soon as he recovered from the blows, but fainted away two or three times in the course of the night, and I thought he was dying.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoners in the Justice room? A. Yes - I do not know whether they were handcuffed - I was not near enough to see, but I believe they were - I know they were brought there handcuffed together, and went away so - there were no other prisoners there but them - if a person faced them, he could see whether they were handcuffed.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the prosecutor, on the night of the robbery, give you an account of it, and a description of the persons? A. Most distinctly - he said he had never seen them before that night, but he was some hours with them at the public-house, and mentioned their dress.</p>

            . I am an ostler at the Castle. On this night Price came there, and had half a pint of purl in the tap-room; the prisoners were in the tap-room, also two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150048"/>other men and a boy - Price sat down along with them, and drank his purl - a pot of beer was ordered, and they drank it together - I did not hear him order more than one pot - I took the money for what I brought - he paid me some money, which he took out of his left hand waistcoat pocket - I did not notice what money he had - I cannot say how much he paid in the course of the evening - I saw him go out of the tap-room, and heard him ask mistress the way to Hounslow - I was in the tap-room when I heard that - the others there could hear him as well as me he was not in liquor at all - Sanders and Manning followed him out directly - Sanders went out first, and Manning directly after him - Wasley stopped in the house, and said to me, "Tom, you see I am here;" I did not take any notice, and he said so a second time - I then said, "Yes, I see you are" - he asked what a clock it was - I told him it was just gone ten - he said, "Then if there is any thing done to-night, I shall be blamed for it" - that was all - Manning came home about ten minutes before eleven o'clock- he went away in the morning - I have not seen him since - I went by Whitehouse's desire, and helped to carry Price to the toll-gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not ten o'clock a very usual hour to leave a tap-room? A. We shut up at twenty minutes past ten - I received no money from Manning, as he lodged in the house - I do not recollect receiving any thing from Wasley - Price had a pot of beer and half a pint of purl, which would be 8d. - he paid for it as I brought it in - I believe he did not order more than one pot in my presence, and paid me for only one pot and the purl - I am sure of that - I cannot say how much the other men paid - there was money paid between them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Price did not pay nearly 2s.? A. No, he did not - I believe something was set down to Wasley- he had a score.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Wasley staid behind after the others left? A. Yes, half an hour - the boy slept in the house - I merely received Price's money as he paid it, and handed it to my mistress - I let Manning out at six o'clock in the morning - I did not see Sanders or Wasley again till they were at the Justice room.</p>

            . On the night of the 9th of January I was at the Waterman's Arms public-house, Isleworth, and saw the two prisoners there a few minutes before eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is that from the Castle? A. Nearly a quarter of a mile - I did not hear of the robbery that night - I heard a word spoken in the Waterman's Arms that night by one of the prisoners, about a man being knocked down and having his pocket picked- Sanders said that publicly - they were sitting there drinking.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had any body charged him with a robbery? A. No - a young man in the tap-room said to him, "You have robbed some one to night, or you would not be so flush of money;" there was a talk about some money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the young man say this before, or after you heard of a man being knocked down and robbed? A. Before - and Sanders replied, "You fool, I have knocked a man down and picked his pocket" - I had not seen Sanders with any money - they continued at the house till within a very few minutes of half-past twelve o'clock - William Gadley keeps the Waterman's Arms - it is not usually open so late - this conversation passed soon after they came in.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the young man an acquaintonce of the prisoners? A. Yes - but not particularly so.</p>
               <p>SANDER's Defence. I have a witness to prove the contrary.</p>
               <p>WASLEY'S Defence. I was at the Castle, and scored six pots of beer there - Price took a share of it; when I got to the Waterman's Arms I laid down, and went to sleep - I had no money to pay for beer - when the officer took me I had no money - I wish him to be examined.</p>
               <p>W. PRICE. I lost between 7s. and 8s., as well as I can guess; the prisoners were taken next morning, but I did not go before the Justice for a fortnight.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street horse patrol. I saw Price on the night of the robbery, about a quarter-to ten o'clock - he seemed very much injured by a blow on the temple - he was on the road groaning - I asked him what was the matter - he said he had been robbed and nearly murdered - he did not seem intoxicated at all; I apprehended the two prisoners in bed next morning, about seven o'clock - Sanders at his father's house, and Wasley at a house, which he has to himself - I was present at their examination, on the 16th - Price appeared then - they were taken into the room handcuffed - Price had described them to me before he saw them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search Wasley? A. Yes; I found no money on him, and only 9d. on Sanders - I took them both at Isleworth, which is about a quarter of a mile from the Castle - Price did not appear till the 16th, on account of a doctor's certificate of his illness.</p>

On the 8th of February, about half-past two o'clock, I was in the kitchen with three other servants - I heard a ring at the front gate - I went up, and as I passed the pantry door, I saw a man getting out at the window into the area; I opened the door, and ran out, calling "Stop thief!" - he ran up the area steps, and through the front gate - I followed him down Lordship-lane about a quarter of a mile, but did not overtake him; other people were pursuing - I cannot say that I saw him stopped - I became so frightened, I went back when I saw two or three men following him - a strange basket was left behind in the pantry, with oranges in it - I had left this plate on a tray - and before I returned, it had been taken out of the basket, and re-laid on the tray.</p>
               <p>SUSAN GARLAND. I am wife of William Garland. I was in Mr. Lindo's kitchen about half-past two o'clock, and heard a noise in the pantry - the bell rang, and Westmacott went up - she gave an alarm; I went into the pantry - the window was wide open, and this basket on the floor - I found these spoons in it, with some oranges - I took the spoons out, and put them on the tray which they were taken from - it was Raine who rang the bell; I cannot say whether the area window had been fastened.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Friend, who lives next door to Mr. Lindo; I went there with a message - I rang the gate bell, then pushed the gate open - and when I got on the steps, I heard a noise in the area - I looked down, and saw a man getting out of the window - he ran into the street - Westmacott pursued him - I delivered my message, then walked up the street the same way as the man had run, and saw him coming down the lane with a constable; I was about four yards from him when he ran up the steps, and am certain he is the man, from his dress and appearance; he was dressed in a close jacket and blue trousers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This is a public street? A. Yes; he ran very fast; he had an apron on - I cannot say whether it was black or blue - I saw him getting out of the window, and thought he was a workman there - the servant followed him within a minute.</p>
               <p>F. WESTMACOTT re-examined. I had been in the pantry ten minutes before, and put these spoons on the tray; the window was then shut and hasped - I cannot say whether I left the pantry door shut - the window must have been opened from within - I did not see the prisoner when the constable brought him back, and cannot say he is the man - he had blue trousers on, and a light close jacket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you fasten the window? A. Yes; none of the glass was broken - there was seven of us in the house - there is an area door - I cannot say whether that was open or shut - it was not wide open, but it might not be latched.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You merely think the prisoner's features resemble the man? A. I really think him to be the man whom I passed in the street; he does not look exactly the same now as he did then.</p>

On the 15th of January I went near Percival's-buildings, to call a carman, between six and seven o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner walking to and fro - I saw two men on the top of the hospital buildings - I am sure the prisoner is the person I saw walking backwards and forwards; the London Hospital wall is near Percival's-buildings - the building is close to the wall - it is built against it - I saw the two jump down - there were three small carts near the building - the prisoner took some lead from under the cart, and went towards the White Raven public-house; the other two went the same way - the prisoner picked up the lead, and put it on his shoulder - I met the other two at the corner of Percival's-buildings; when I went back I told the men in my master's shop of it directly; I did not know where to go to find the persons belonging to the Hospital - I had seen the prisoner several times before - and I know he is the man; he passed me quite close, within two or three feet; there was light enough for me to know him.</p>

Yes, but not many new ones - I never gave him any lees of wine before - I kept the corks in the cellar locked up - I gave him lees of the Madeira; I had drank some of the wine - my wine is generally decantered in the cellar, and the bottles left there.</p>

               <p>J. PALMER re-examined. I gave Captain Jones the bottles which the prisoner brought to me - the seals were put on afterwards.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN JONES re-examined. I put the seals on to prevent their being changed - I drew the cork of one of the bottles of sherry, and tasted it; I believe this to be my old Madeira - It would be impossible for such wine to come from the lees - It is excellent wine - I should know my own Madeira as well as I should know my own coat - it is fifteen years old - I gave a very high price for it; as far as I can positively say, I believe it to be my own wine; I would swear to it as I would to the identity of my coat; this basket marked R. P. is mine; it was sent with some game and fruit from the country.</p>
               <p>J. PALMER re-examined. I believe this basket is the same I received with the wine, but I cannot swear to it; I gave Captain Jones the same that was brought by the prisoner - the prisoner brought other bottles of wine in this.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN JONES. One of the corks I could identify now if I was to draw it; it was the sherry bottle which had the peculiar cork; I think I tasted from this bottle, but I am not sure; this one I know I opened; I mean to the best of my knowledge; it is by the corks that I judge it is my wine.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Now, Sir, will you swear that to be your Madeira, or is it sherry? A. As far as I can judge from the taste, this is sherry.</p>

In consequence of what I afterwards heard, I went to a pawnbroker's in the neighbourhood, but did not find my property there; on the Thursday, I got another account, and told the prisoner she must leave, but I would not turn her out on the Saturday night, but let her stay till Monday - the new servant found a quantity of duplicates in a napkin, which I looked over; the prisoner was out at the time; I did not see any more of her till she was brought by an officer; this was on the day after the duplicates were found; I told her I was not satisfied with her conduct, and had got an officer to search her, and that she had better give the duplicates up; she said she had none, except some out of date; the duplicates found by my new servant were not locked up; I took a copy of them, and told the new servant to put them in the same place - this mark on the table cloth was made by me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The cousin was in your employment? A. Yes; but he had no opportunity of coming further than the passage - he could not steal shoes from the warehouse; this man never took work home - the prisoner did not work at home occasionally for other people; it is unlawful in our business to work for another - it is not regular to take cabbage out of leather delivered out - I know the writing on this piece of leather, it was signed by a person named Swift, who was my foreman, but not now, nor is he here - there is no private mark of my own on this leather; there is nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150056"/>here in the state in which he should take it from my hand to make up; no leather is delivered out in this state for that purpose - none of it is in a fit state to make into shoes; it ought to be closed - we give work to different work people.</p>

I went into the passage, and said, "Halloo, what are you about?" he said he was going to look for employ, and was going to tell the gentleman of these goods laying in the dirt; I took him into custody, and sent for an officer; the prisoner had this knife, which he gave me himself.</p>

            . I live at No. 43, Bread-street, Cheapside, in the parish of Allhallows, Bread-street, and rent the house. This calico is the property of myself and my brother, who is in partnership with me; it was in a bale in the lobby, about six feet from the door; the bale was ripped open, and this taken out; I should think it would take a very little while to take it out of the bale; it had been in the bale before, and was removed from it. I think the value of it is 3l. My warehouseman is here, who had seen it about five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not the bale well secured with ropes? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Lainson. I know these goods to be part of that bale of goods. I came in about nine o'clock, and wiped my shoes on some straw by the side of the bale - it was complete then - if it had not been I should have seen it; that was about ten minutes before the prisoner was brought into the warehouse - I think it was two or three minutes after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT to THOS. LEE. Q. What was the time when you saw him? A. It was about nine o'clock - I cannot tell to a minute or two. The property was quite out of the bale, and the side of it on the ground - the prisoner had hold of it in his hands; no part of it was near the bale.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left home to seek work, and seeing this warehouse I went in to ask for work; I went into the passage, and saw the bale cut, and this laying in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150059"/>passage - I had to move it to get to the door; the instant I moved it the witness collared me. I have worked for several masters in Bread-street, and for a master-weaver in Steward-street, but I have not had time to let them know. I have worked for Messrs. Herring and Douglass, in Bread-street, who are weavers.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. LAINSON. Q. How many bundles were there in the bale? A. Six, and this was one of them - it contains nine pieces - they were tied up as they are now.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were not all these things returned to him? A. I believe so; they were sealed up at the first examination. I am a patrol. - Gook was with me - he is a parish constable; there was a great crowd. I first saw him in St. James'-street; I saw him throw his hand out, and immediately the book fell.</p>
               <p>MR. FELL. This is my book - it contained memorandums, which were in it when it was found, and here are some marks on it, by which I know it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you once prosecute the King's postillion? A. No - it was a helper in the King's stable; I was prosecuted myself afterwards, and acquitted. Several people were up the court - I will not swear how many; there was no pressure from the soldiers - the soldiers were in the road - this was on the pavement; I stood without pressure; there was no particular crowd there.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There were a great many people there - I suppose forty or fifty? A. I dare say there were; the court was choked full of people, who were getting away from the trampling of horses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there a great pressure besides that, from the persons who endeavoured to rescue the prisoner? A. Yes - he said nothing about his wife and family in my hearing.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was 7s. a fair price? A.

               <p>CLEEVES' Defence. I was at work at the time.</p>
               <p>MORRIS' Defence. The persons coming on me by surprise, I thought it a very curious thing, and very imprudently said, he had none from me, but at last I said who I bought it of; I was foolish, but it was no bad intention; I did not conceive that he had received it from me, because I sent my wife to Jones, to know if he would let me have the shag we were talking about, and he sent it down. When I had the sample from him in the morning, he asked if I would buy it at 7s. a yard; I said I did not know what it was worth, and I went to Durant, who said, "If you can get it for less, I will find a market for it, and we will share the profit;" Jones being a respectable tradesman, I did not consider there could be any thing wrong in it; he said a friend of his, who was a manufacturer, had it to sell, and wanted to make up some money.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you in his company every morning? A. No - I called there, having been sent into Brick-lane; his wife and child were there - he was at work all the time; nobody else was in the room; I had not been there before for two years.</p>

On the 31st of January I did not see him at home, but heard him get out of bed, and go into his room, between seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150062"/>and eight o'clock; I heard him speak to the baby about five minutes after he went into his room.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you not his mother-in-law? A. Yes. I heard his wife blowing the fire; I heard somebody go up to him, but did not hear them talking; I do not know Cooper.</p>

In consequence of suspicion, on the 19th of January, I proposed to search all the women, as I missed a shawl; I took them, singly, into another room; the prisoner was the only one who objected- she was told to take her clothes off; I saw her drop her hand, and a duplicate fell from some part of her dress - she tried to put her foot on it; I took it up, and said,"Here is the duplicate of my shawl;" I gave her in charge - the officer found the shoes and handkerchief in her trunk.</p>

On the 12th of January, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop with her daughter, who is a woman - I had seen her there before, to the best of my belief; I have since found that she resided at No. 6, Paradise-row, Bethnal-green; she asked to see some lace, and chose a piece, desiring me to cut three yards and a half at 9d., which I did; I rolled it up, and think I laid it on a box behind me, and put the rest into a box; she asked to see some half-stockings - I shewed her seven or eight pairs in a paper; she bought none, but said she had bought better for the money, and did not like them; while she was looking at them, I saw her take a pair with her left hand, and put them into her muff - she was sitting with the muff in her lap, below the counter; she did it while she was saying she would not take any - I then asked if I could show her any thing else - she said No, and took out her purse, and paid me 2s. 7d1/2. for the lace - I did it up in paper; I did not like to leave her, and called a young woman to give her change for a 6d.; I then said, "You will excuse me, Ma'am, but you have a pair of stockings in your muff;" she said she had not; I reached my hand across - she then took them out of her muff, and put them on the counter - I laid my hand on them, and she said, "I will give you 10d. for that pair of stockings if you like." I said "No, you shall not have them, Ma'am;" and expressed my surprise at a person of her appearance doing such a thing, and said I hoped she had got nothing else; she shook her muff with her left hand, her right hand was below it; I looked over, and saw a card of lace laying on the floor where she had been sitting; I then said I could not let her go - I sent for Mr. Hopkins down, who asked her to give her name and address, but she would not; an officer was sent for, who took her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing fall when she shook her muff with her left hand? A. No; she shook the muff between herself and the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you not now know that her husband is in a good situation? A. I have learnt so since. She did afterwards give me her card; I am almost certain I had seen her before; she put the stockings into her muff, not upon it; when she took her hand from her muff, I saw part of the stockings out of the muff.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said she had got the stockings, was not her answer, "I think not?" A. She might say so; I had asked 1s. a pair for them - I did not offer them for 1s. after she produced them; she sat on a stool, the height of which is about a foot below the counter; her muff was not quite so high as the counter; I saw the lace in her hand at the time she chose the other piece - I think she put it on the counter again; I went to the office that evening; she was not admitted to bail till Monday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was she a ready money customer? A. All our business is done for ready money. I did not know the lace was left out of the box; I put the box away from the counter, and did not see the lace afterwards; I put all into the box except one piece, which was laying under the daughter's muff - I took that piece, and then thought I had got all the lace (but I could not have put this piece in), and then shewed the stockings; I saw nothing in her right hand when she was shaking her muff.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How could she shake her muff between herself and the counter? A. She moved her knees to do it, but still kept sitting; our counter is about two feet and a half wide; there were people on the other side of the shop; we have fourteen or fifteen servants.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Is any amount entered to Clough on the 30th? No; nor on the 23d or 16th - he sometimes paid me monies on other days, but it was put down on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I paid this money to him - that an I some others were put down on the last leaf, which is cut out; it is a malicious prosecution; it was usual to keep a little in hand for disbursements; his books will show that the accounts are so confused, no one can understand them - I told him I had other entries to make.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Shew me any one account that is balanced? A. Here is one; I did not allow him to keep money back on Saturday - I at times had cash from him in the course of the week - he kept a small book, and the balance was struck every Saturday - he has paid money for me.</p>

Yes - I generally paid it on the day I received it; and he sometimes has asked the prisoner for 10l. or so, on account; he entered what he received in a memorandum book - I sometimes paid money for Murray, and gave him the balance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was no account kept of what I paid - he would not allow me to keep an account; so I was forced to keep one in a small book.</p>

            . I live in Playhouse-yard, St. Luke's, and keep a sale-shop. On the 17th of January the prisoner, William Spicer, brought me these candlesticks for sale - I asked how he came by them; he said "Never mind, it is all right" - he said his name was William Spicer, of No. 7, Grub-street, which I put down; he wanted 4s. for them - I told him to come again in half an hour, and if it was all right I would give him that - I sent for an officer, who went to Grub-street; the two prisoners ran into the shop some time after, and George put his hand over the wooden guard and took hold of five of them - I caught hold of him as he was going out, and held him - the officer came and took them both.</p>

Higgs came in, on Tuesday evening, the 16th, and offered a jar of honey for sale - I had seen him before - he dealt in lozenges and other things - I bought it of him for 3s. 6d. - he said there were from 8 lbs. to 10 lbs., and promised to call again, but did not - I gave the jar to the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you first tell him you would be glad to receive articles of him? A. I said I would buy lozenges of him - I can buy white honey at 9d. per lb. - this is not a good colour.</p>

I went with the prosecutor and took the prisoner at the Three Compasses, Brick-lane, in company with about fourteen other women and men; he described her person before - she did not deny it - but several girls said she had been there a long time - I took her to the watch-house, and she gave up 10s. 31/2d.; I went to search her, and a piece of paper fell from her, which she picked up, and swallowed. Bardwell described the other woman, but I have not seen her since.</p>

            . I am a fishmonger, and live in Peter's-lane. I met the prisoner at Islington on Tuesday, the 23d, by the turnpike; he stopped me, and said, "Thank God I have got my business settled;" he had told me, about a fortnight before, that his cousins were going to get him some money which had been left him; he said he had got it, and gave me something to drink - he said, "Will you take care of this for me?" and gave me forty sovereigns; this was about half-past two o'clock - I met him the next morning, and he said, "If you will go and buy me some things, instead of going to work, I will give you 5s. for your trouble;" we had something to drink - I found myself rather giddy, and went to the Artichoke public-house, and sat down - I was there beat and cut about, and lost all his money, and all my own - I went and told him of it; he said it was a bad job - it would be his ruin - I wanted him to go for an officer about it - he said it was of no use, as I could not swear to them.</p>

            . I live in Crown-court, White-yard, Whitechapel, in the same house with the prisoner's father. On a Saturday night, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in bed, and heard him coming in and going up stairs; I cannot say the date of the month; I met him next morning, between eight and nine, coming out of the back-yard; I do not know how long ago it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Why, when was it done? A. About a quarter to six o'clock in the morning; the chaps who did it told me so; I know them well; I took one of them before a Magistrate - he was liberated; he told the neighbours he was the thief, and they told me.</p>

The prisoner (whom I knew) came to the house on the 2d of February, in the evening, and asked for change for a 5l. note; I asked who it was for - he said, "For Captain Simms, of the ship Anna;" I did not recollect the name, and told him I had not got it; he said he would take it in copper, or silver, or in any way; I said I had not got it: he came again in a quarter of an hour, and said he would leave the note, and take 2l. or 3l., as the vessel was to sail next day - I took the note, but gave him no change - here it is; he had it in a snuff-box; and had apparently a new black coat on, much too large for him.</p>

I have known Smith twelve years; on the night of the 26th of January at half-past seven o'clock, I was stopped by two men; Smith, who was one, came up and gave me a nudge on the arm; I rather turned round to get from him; he presented some fire arms (it was bigger in the nozzle than a gun) to my face. and demanded my money; the other was close at his side - I said I had hardly enough to buy a pot of beer; the other then said, "Deliver up your watch and all your property, or else I will blow your brains out;" they both took hold of my handkerchief, and swore that if I spoke one word they would blow my brains out. Smith kicked me very hard on the left shin, and tried to throw me down - I then heard two waggons coming; I told them I would soon fix them - they then ran away; I saw several men - and called Murder, and Stop thief! it happened very near Mr. Gale's house; I went out afterwards to the spot, and picked up my handkerchief there in Collard's presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Can you swear to Barnes? A. Yes. I only knew him by his dress - Smith was taken to Gale's house that night - I swore to him there as the man who presented the fire-arms; he was let go, as I did not want to appear against him; Barnes made his escape over a hedge; it was dark.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What dress had the man who accompanied Smith? A. A very dark blue or black coat, and dark trousers - the figure of the man was like Barnes.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the night of the 26th of January, Carter pointed out a spot - I saw him pick up his handkerchief; and on that spot I found a large case-knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take Smith that night? A. Yes, at Gale's - I let him go, as neither of the men who were stopped could identify him; Carter said at first,"Harry, you are the man that stopped me;" he afterwards seemed to deny it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What time was this? A. About a quarter to eight; I did not find Barnes that night; he was taken at his father's.</p>

On the 15th of February I went to Nottingdal - I knew the prisoner was building a cottage there - I saw from 1500 to 2000 bricks by the side of that cottage; I examined their quality - I had a quantity of bricks at some building in Sovereign-street; I took a sample of those bricks to the prisoner's premises, and they corresponded in every way; none of them had any initials on them - they were all of one colour, and what are called seconds, such as are put in the fronts of houses - it is usual, when builders buy bricks, to receive a ticket with them, and sometimes we have two; one of which we sign and send back - I had a conversation with Beal, and, in consequence of that, went to the prisoner, and said, "Hancocks, where did you get those seconds from?" and asked him where the tickets were - he said he had none, nor never had any; but he could take me to the man he bought them off; he took me to a man at the corner of Polygan-street, about two hundred yards from his own place, and said to him, "Did not I buy those bricks of you?" - the man said, "Yes; you gave me 35s. for the lot;" nothing was said about the quality; I asked where he bought them - he said, of a respectable man in St. John's-woodgrove, and he brought them home in his own horse and cart - it would take two large carts to hold them - I directly fetched Wabster, the officer, who took the man who said he had sold them, and then went back and took the prisoner - the Magistrate committed him, and discharged the other man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You told the same story to the Magistrate about the man? A. I believe I did - here is a sample of each lot of bricks - I swear they are both from one kiln; I believe it is a general custom to have a delivery-ticket - bricks have been brought without a ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. If you bought them of a person who had bought them from the clamp, would you have a delivery ticket from that person? A. No. The prisoner would not want seconds for this cottage, but he has used some of all sorts at it; we do not usually go to different makers for bricks to build a small cottage; I had missed bricks about a month or two before - mine were in a stack before my own buildings. The cottage is about two miles and a quarter from my buildings. My carpenters begin work at break of day; they cart bricks much earlier; his building is in a bye road.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you missed a large or small quantity of bricks? A. I missed a few at a time, but more than 1500 in all. I have seen the prisoner's cart; I never bought so small a quantity as that would hold; I always have a ticket with every load.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Falkus' employ. I did not know the prisoner previous to the 15th of February - I saw him about a quarter past six o'clock that morning, in Frederick-street, which joins Sovereign-street, with his horse and cart loaded with bricks; he was fifty or eighty yards from Falkus' premises; I followed him about three hundred yards - he stopped; I did not speak to him, but took particular notice of the bricks; I saw no reason for his stopping - he stopped, and looked steadfastly at me; the bricks were the same sort as Falkus had in Sovereign-street, as near as it is possible to speak - they are seconds. I went and told Falkus; the prisoner was going towards Edgware-road, which was the way to his cottage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It would not be unnatural to take a load of bricks at that time? A. No - but it is unusual<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150090"/>to use seconds with rough-place bricks. I cannot point out which of these two bricks produced came from master's premises; I cannot say that any of the bricks in the cart have been found, but they were bright ones, of this description. There are bricks called cutters - I cannot tell them from a second, nor a paviour from a front; I speak to the colour of these bricks - they resembled these in colour; I saw the man who said he sold them; it was said he had been carter to the prisoner; I do not know that he has absconded.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are these the same kind of bricks as your master has? A. Yes. I went to the prisoner's cottage.</p>

             re-examined. I asked the prisoner where he got the bricks - he said he bought them in the grove, meaning St. John's-wood-grove; I asked him again, and he said, in St. John's-wood-road - that is a quarter of a mile distant; he afterwards said they came from the foot of Primrose-hill - that is about a mile from the grove; he afterwards named the Uxbridge-road; he said at first that his man bought them for 35s., and then that he gave 35s. for them. This is one of the bricks brought from his premises - 2000 would come to about 6l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what progress is your house? A. The first story is on. I missed some bricks that day - he said he bought them himself at last; and that is why I took him, because he prevaricated; he said he bought them himself, at Primrose-hill.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Could you see where the bricks came from? A. Yes, a person who was digging a sewer wheeled them from the side of a pig-sty. I saw the same cart come back next day, and it was loaded again with old bricks, about the middle of the day. I live about one hundred yards from Sovereign-street; I saw nobody with the cart either time - I think it was the prisoner's cart - I believe he owns it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the prisoner? A. A carman; I knew he was building a cottage; he kept his horse and cart on my premises; I believe it was his horse and cart that I saw - I saw it return the next day. I can swear they were old bricks - the cart was fifteen yards from me.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Nottingdale. On Thursday morning, the 15th of February, I saw the prisoner, about seven o'clock, with a load of old bricks in his cart; they were not like those produced, but old ones, and some were not cleaned from the mortar - I saw none of this description; I was going for a load of bricks myself, which made me notice his - I knew him.

            . I am a labourer, and live at Nottingdale, about twenty-five feet from the prisoner's cottage. Last Thursday morning I saw him with his cart, about seven o'clock, close to Notting-hill gate, about a mile from his cottage, going towards his cottage, with a load of old bricks - all that I could see were old; it is usual to use old and new bricks in building cottages; he had a pile of new bricks there; I have seen them there full three months. I have a cottage of my own.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you build it? A. It was built for me; I bought my bricks from Shepherd's-bush; I might not be able to produce the person I had them of. The prisoner may have a thousand new ones; he has some seconds; I call these very bad seconds; I stopped and said, "John, have you got another load of old bricks" he said, "I have;" I knew he had bought three or four cottages, and thought these came from there; he had several men once; he may have a carter for a day or so; his wife asked me yesterday to come here - I did not know before that he was in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see these new bricks there from time to time, for three months? A. I saw them most days, as he asked me to attend a little when he was away.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did it appear to you that for three months there was the same quantity of bricks there, or were they increasing from time to time? A.

Yes, but they are more common than these - I have not compared them; the lot, which stands before the cottages, is to build another house - he had two sorts of new bricks, new stocks and seconds - the front was built before any seconds were there - I do not think there are any of this sort in the building - I will not swear it; if there are any, it must be just over the windows; the rest of the house is of old bricks.</p>

            . I am the wife of Stephen Millins. I saw the prisoner at our cottage last Thursday morning, near seven o'clock, within a few minutes of it - it is about one hundred yards from the cottage he was building - he had a one horse cart with old bricks; I saw them shot from the cart; they were all old; I saw a pile of new ones there, when the gentleman came to measure them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long has the cottage been building? A. I do not know; I have not been there above a fortnight; the old bricks were to build another cottage; I did not see the cart till seven o'clock; I have seen nobody at work there for the last fortnight.</p>
               <p>J. FALKUS re-examined. I have minutely examined the front of his cottage; I suppose there are 200 or 300 bricks of this description in the arches and other places; it is stocks mixed with seconds - I have been a builder from a boy; the front would take 300 or 400 bricks; the rest is old and new bricks together; stocks are easily distinguished from seconds, by people who understand building- I examined it last Friday, about four o'clock, with my bricklayer and Mr. Royal, a mason.</p>
               <p>- SHEPHERD. I am a bricklayer. I went with Falkus to view the prisoner's cottage; there are seconds in the arches and in different parts of the front; a builder cannot mistake stocks for seconds.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Will you swear there were fifty seconds? A. Yes; I will not swear to one hundred nor to sixty; I did not count them; I sold the prisoner some bricks about three months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this voucher, and say is it not the memorandum you gave for the settlement of the bricks? A. Yes; they were my own bricks: (read) "August 26th, received of John Hancocks, for bricks, 2l. 5s." I sold him 2000; I never sold him any others; I had them from Berkshire; I was then in business for myself.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What bricks did you sell him? A. Stocks, not seconds.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You told him to take them, if the prisoner desired him? A. Yes; the prisoner lived with me about six months - he was formerly in the trade; he was in distress when I took him; I never told him to take what he liked and I should be satisfied if he gave me an account of them - I never gave him leave to sell any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never go to his house, and say, "Sell those nuts for me?" A. Yes, - that was before he was in my employ; I always paid his wages regularly - he once bought two dozen dry nuts of me.</p>

The night before the prisoner was taken I heard the prosecutor say he might take as many cocoa-nuts as he chose, and have them drawn off from his wages at the end of the week - he often said so - he said it every evening when they were talking - I do not live there now; he was to take as many as he could sell, and account for them at the end of the week; I am sure this was said the night before he was taken.

On the 17th of October I was in a public-house in Barbican; I had a horse there - the prisoner asked me to sell it; another person wanted me to sell it, and take a bill of him, which I refused; I at last agreed to sell it to the prisoner for 4l. 10s. - he threw down this cheque for eight guineas; I said I had no change - he said he would go home with me for it; I said I had no money, and would go home with him for it; some persons in the room, who appeared then to be strangers to him, proposed that I should take the cheque, and present it next morning, and he call on me for the change; he objected to that - I wished to have nothing to do with it; I waited, as he said if he could sell a poney, he could give me the money; I at last said, if he wished the horse, he was to call on me in the morning, but I did not care about selling it; the others interfered, and wished him to give me the cheque; I got up to go away - he then said, "Give me your direction, and what money you have got - I'll call to-morrow for the rest;" he then gave me the cheque; I gave him the horse and 19s. - he did not call in the morning; Newland, who was with me, said he had known him a long time, and it was all right; the prisoner gave me his direction, No. 3, Fan-street; next morning I went with the cheque, and found the bankers had failed ten months ago - he never called for the change.</p>

I was leaving work about seven o'clock last Wednesday, and in Groveend-road saw the prisoner with two deal boards on his back, about one hundred and fifty yards from Hall's house; he said he had brought them from Kilburn, where he had been working for Mr. Pitts, and had come by them honestly - he went on; a person was with me; we followed, and asked where he lived; he said in Boston-street. Dorset-square; I told a watchman, and we followed him - he went to Boston-place instead of Boston-street; we stopped him at the door, and marked the boards - he gave me Pitts' direction; I went, and could find no such person; I returned, and told the watchman; we then went to his house, and took him and the boards; he then said the man he had them of lived in Brownlow-street, Seven-dials. I went there, and found one Pitt.</p>

The prisoner slept in the same room; I have been there thirteen weeks - he was there before me; I had my money in my chest, which was locked, and stood in that room - I put twelve sovereigns in there on Saturday, the 10th of February, in the foot of a stocking, and missed them on Monday, the 12th - all the twelve sovereigns were gone; another man, named

On Thursday last, 15th of Feb., between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my house with two other men - they had some beer - one of the men went out with the prisoner, and then they came in again - the prisoner had used the house before, and I knew him; he came to the bar, and said to me, "I have saved up a little money - will you take care of it for me?" and gave me nine sovereigns - they were not in any thing; he came on Friday morning, and had one back - he came again on Saturday, and had one from my wife - I produced the other seven.</p>

            . I am night-beadle of Aldgate. I took the prisoner into custody on Saturday, and asked how he came by the nine sovereigns - I held out no promise or threat - his answer was, he supposed he had stolen them - I might take him to the Police-office, or do what I pleased with him - I heard him say at the office that he found them in the room where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to LIVINGSTONE. Q. Was there any silver with your sovereigns? A. I do not know, but think there was twelve sovereigns and 20s. together, wrapped in paper, and put into a stocking; here is the paper they were in - I know it by some figures, and it was given me by Mrs. Wilson, who found it in the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I own I picked up the money under my my feet in the room - there were ten sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and 19s.</p>
