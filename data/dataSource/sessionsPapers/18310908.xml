On the 30th of July I went to bed about a quarter to eleven o'clock at night - the house was all secure then, and about two in the morning, on the 31st, before daylight, on hearing the alarm bell ring, I went down and in the cellar I found a dark-lantern a-light; the iron grating of the cellar had been secured by an iron chain, which I found had been broken in the course of the night - the prisoner was not in the house when I came down;

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You keep a pastry-cook's shop, at the corner of Canon-alley, St. Paul's church-yard? A. Yes - Woodhill has a shopman and porter living on the premises; I have one female and two male servants - they are not here; a person could not get from the cellar to the upper part of the house without unfastening the cellar inner door - that door was not broken; the cellar is part of the house - I had seen the grating fast at five o'clock the evening before, when I was in Canon-alley; the chain was attached to the staple in the usual manner, and if it had not been fast the chain must have given way, as it was attached at one end to the grating, and at the other by a staple to the wall - it is never opened; it had been made for a coal-shoot, but the house having been broken open about two months ago I did away with the padlock, and had it fastened by a staple, not intending to open it again - I went to bed a little before eleven o'clock; my servants usually go to bed before me - Mr. Woodhill's people are generally up after me - after the alarm I found the grating of the cellar separated from the chain, but the grating was down, as it lifts on a swivel; the chain was broken, and down in the cellar - a link of it was broken by violence, and the curb of the grating much pressed, apparently by a crow-bar; Mr. Woodhill keeps the first and second floors, and has a shop frontage round St. Paul's Church-yard - he has no occupation of the cellar: I have a lease of the house distinct from him.</p>

I went to bed at near twelve o'clock on the night in question, and was awoke about two by a noise on the cellar stairs - I rose myself up in bed, listened, and heard the noise repeated; it sounded as if the door at the top of the cellar stairs was being pulled - I pulled the alarm bell, and soon brought five or six persons down stairs; we found nobody in the house - I sleep on the ground floor, not three feet from the door; the door had not been opened - I afterwards went into the cellar, and found a dark-lantern with a candle burning in it, a crow-bar, a chisel, and a centre-bit with the brace, but without a stock; I looked to see which way the thieves got in, and found the strong iron chain, which held the grating down, had been broken - any body could then lift up the grating, and get in; the prisoner was a stranger - I saw him at the watch-house in King's Arm's-passage, in about ten minutes; my master's stock is valuable.</p>

Yes - a pastrycook's shop is at the corner of the alley; there is a public-house in the alley, before you come to the covered way leading to St. Paul's church-yard - I saw the prisoner taken immediately that he got on his feet, out of the grating - he was as near as possible to the door of the public-house; he was taken before he entered the covered archway, for I did not lose sight of him from the time he left the grating till he was in the hands of the watchman; I will swear that - I got out of bed immediately I heard the bell ring, and saw him - I could see about half along the covered way from my window; the man was leaving our house - the watchman came under the archway towards our house, and took him; I saw him in the watchman's hands before he got half through the covered way, for I did not lose sight of him.</p>

I stood in my yard in Camomile-street, and heard the cry of Stop thief! - I ran to the gate and saw the prisoner run by, and Evans in pursuit of him; he never got out of my sight, only in turning the corner - I am certain of his person; when I got within about five yards of him he flung the bundle down into the cutlers' Arms - I followed, tripeed his heels up, and fell on him; he laid a little while, then jumped up, struck me in the face with a brush, and hit me three times on the shoulder - I threw him down, and he said he would go with me, but when we got a few yards he struck me again two or three times, and tried to throttle me; he resisted a good deal, but I secured him, took him back to Spring's house, and gave him in charge of Sapwell.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SAPWELL. I know Mr. Spring's house is in the parish of All Hallows on the Wall; I took charge of the prisoner, and the property was in a chimney soot cloth.</p>

               <p>MR. ORR. These are my clothes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>

            , brought the prisoner to my house on the 9th or 10th of June, to reside there for a short time - she staid six weeks and three days, and left on the 23rd of July - she lived in the same room, sat at the same table with us, and knew where I kept my keys and property. On Wednesday night, the 22nd of July, there was in my cupboard, a 20l., a 10l., and four 5l. Bank notes - I had received the 20l. from my nephew, and received 40l., in 5l. Bank notes, from Colonel Bentinck; I gave my nephew four of those 5l. notes for the 20l. note, and the 10l. note I had from a lady who lodged in the house; there were two sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in a paper - these were all in a cupboard in the dining-parlour; I saw those notes safe in the closet about eight or nine o'clock at night, when I went to put away the tea, and at bed time the prisoner was sitting in the small back parlour with me; I left the room to go round the house, to see that it was safe; the closet was in the next room - I was not gone more than five minutes; I came up again, sat down, and put away my work; I looked at her, and said, "Good G - d, Miss Eckhardt, what a smell of fire there is;" I ran out with the candle - she followed me; I said, "Good G - d, where is it?" she pointed to a little bit of string like a thread, which hung down from a nail in the closet, and said,"There it is;" it hung down by the side of the cupboard, which was open at the time; I ran to the cupboard, and there was a fire.</p>

               <p>Q. What was burnt? A.Paper - I put it out, and said, "Good G - d, my money is burnt;" it was some paper which I had there - I put it out as well as I could, and ran down stairs; I got a shovel, and put the burnt pieces of paper into a plate, and begged her not to touch it till my nephew came in - I went out, and when I returned she was still at the cupboard, and said, "Here is your gold, that is not burnt, but your stupid English money, paper money, is burnt;" I then waited for a short time, to see that every thing was right - there was no danger in the cupboard, and then we went to bed; she at that time slept with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any money transactions between you, in the course of which you could have given her either of these notes? A. No - this was on the 20th, and on the Saturday following, the 23rd, she went away; she told me and my nephew she was going abroad, to travel with a new married gentleman and lady, who had come from Cologne, and were going back there; that she was going to Paris, going to travel, and then going home to her father and mother at Cologne - she said that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080006"/>lady and gentleman were to meet her at Southampton; she was to go with them across the water, and then home, but she at first told me she was going to Winchester - she afterwards said she was going to Southampton, as she could not get a place to Winchester - on the Sunday or Monday after she was gone, I went to the wardrobe to get my shawl to go out with my nephew, and could not find it; I have also missed lace, dresses, cambric handkerchiefs, muslin, gloves, pieces of new silk, a crape shawl, veils, a long shawl, a lace shawl, feathers, and various, articles of dress - I have lost also two rings, and a portfolio of drawings was taken from my wardrobe; I have seen some of them since - I never permitted her in any way to take these articles; I did not know she had got them - the very night before she went away I said I had got some things to sell; she looked at them and paid me eighteen sovereigns for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LOVEDAY. Q. I thought you had never had any money transactions with her? A. I conceive that was my money, and her board and lodging was included in the amount - I do not always lock my drawers, but I see that the keys are laid on the table; I locked the closet when I went to bed, but that was after the fire - I had been to the closet before I went down stairs; it was between ten and eleven o'clock at night -I put the candle on the table which stands by the closet, and threw in my work; I did not take a candle into the cupboard - the fire was discovered about that time; we went to bed about half-past ten or eleven o'clock - it was all done within ten minutes; I merely threw the work into the closet, and saw that the notes were there - I did not count them - I saw that they laid on the shelf in two parcels; the 10l. note was with some bills and two sovereigns and two half-sovereigns - the 20l. and the 5l. notes were altogether; I usually drink a little table-ale, and when I have none in the house I send to the public-house for it; I have lived with the Bentinck family more than thirty years - I did not touch the notes when I went to the cupboard, but am certain they were there - I saw the two parcels, but did not examine to see the notes; my nephews have lived with me some time; I am single: the prisoner knew where I kept my keys - the cupboard door was not locked, nor yet put too; a piece of string was hanging down, and there was fire at the end of the string - the end paper was burning; I collected the burnt pieces of paper, thinking when my nephew returned he might find the numbers of some of the notes - he was out of town: I thought it might be the notes, but it turned out to be nothing but paper which I had some tea in - we have since found the notes, therefore they could not be burnt; I am not related to Colonel 
               <persName id="t18310908-4-person130">Bentinck</persName>
             - he pays me an annuity; he paid me 40l. in July, which was half a year's annuity - he paid me these 5l. notes, and the rest in gold and silver; I received 40l. odd from him - the 10l. note I received from Miss Impey, a lodger; I never saw any thing of the notes afterwards - the two sovereigns and two half-sovereigns, which were in a paper, were left behind; the burnt paper was taken to the Bank - I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner pay you 18l. for? A. She bought a dress for 1l., and six shifts for half a guinea a-piece - that was a week or a fortnight before, but they had not been paid for; I had no money transaction with her till she paid me for them the night before she left; she asked me that night to show her some more things, and she would buy them - it was then she bought the shifts; the shifts were made of Dutch linen, trimmed with cambric, trimmed in Holland; she paid me three guineas for a blue dress, and the shifts came to three guineas, and there were six weeks' board and lodging at a guinea and a half a week; my nephew brought her to my house in a coach from an hotel in the Haymarket - Colonel Bentinck had written to him to fetch her.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not receive twenty-seven guineas from her? A. I swear I did not receive more than eighteen; I have heard her speak of Mrs. Kently, but I never saw her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You called her Miss Eckhardt - is that the name she was known to you by? A. Yes - I did not know her by any other name.</p>

             - I took her to my aunt's, and she boarded and lodged there; while she was there a two-penny post letter came, addressed to Madame Roulette - she heard my aunt tell the postman nobody lived there by that name, and I heard the same; I said I thought there must be some mistake, it must be for Miss Eckhardt - she opened it immediately, and said it was for her; before she left my aunt's she told me she wished to get a place by the stage to Winchester, that she had been to the coach-office, and every place was engaged for the following day, but a French lady had booked a place to go to Southampton, and she had arranged with that lady to have her place, by paying for it; this was the second day after the burning in the closet - I went with her to the New White Horse cellar, in Piceadilly; she took two trunks with her, and an umbrella, that was all - when she got to the coach-office she showed me a ticket, which she said she had received from the lady, with the lady's name on it, which was Roulette; I made no remark to her, but she said, "Roulette I thought it was Broulette - that must have been the French lady who was going to take a governess' situation which I had given up - you remember a letter coming to me in that name - that must have been the lady; I wish I had remembered it, I would have talked to her about it;" I saw her off by the Southampton coach- this was on Saturday, and on the Tuesday following my aunt missed some property, upon which I went to Southampton, and at last found the prisoner at a young ladies' boarding-school, kept by Mrs. Wood, at Houndwell, near Southampton; Mrs. Wood, spoke to her by the name of Roulette - I told Mrs. Wood, in her presence, what had brought me there; I said she had made so many false representations at my aunt's house that she must return with me to town, to clear them up; Mrs. Wood took two drawings from the mantel-piece, and said, in her presence, that Miss Roulette had given them to her as her own drawings; I believe them to be my aunt's - I asked her for her keys; she gave them to me - I went up stairs with a constable, and opened her boxes; they were the same boxes as I saw her take to the stage - I saw some feathers on the top of the boxes when I opened them; I did not search the boxes - I put in some things which were found; there were shawls, lace, silk stockings, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080007"/>various articles - I put them into the boxes, locked them, and brought the boxes to town, with the whole of the things belonging to her; I put the keys into my own pocket - the boxes came to town untouched and unaltered - I left them at Mary-le-bone watch-house; an officer, who had met me at the coach, was with me at the time - the boxes were produced before the Justice, with the same things in them; my aunt saw them there - they have been in the hands of the officer ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went to the hotel to fetch her? A. I went there to see her, in consequence of a note from Colonel Bentinck, and the next time I went I found a note in her possession, directed to me, from General

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say this piece of silk is worth 5l.? A. Yes - here is another piece that is cut off it; I kept my purse in a drawer - I did not keep my money in a box; I am sure I drink nothing but table-ale - half a pint at dinner, and half a pint at supper.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I left Amsterdam in the capacity of companion with a lady of the name of Kently; having arrived at the Custom-house, and not finding my box, Mrs. Kently desired me to return to the steam-boat to look for it - however it was not there, and the captain representing that it was probably left at Rotterdam I returned to the Custom-house, where Mrs. Kently had left a note for me, desiring me to follow her to her residence at Pall-mall, but not being able to trace her there I was compelled to repair to an hotel; the keeper of the hotel took the utmost pains to find her, and I put an advertisement in the newspaper for the same purpose, but all in vain - reduced to despair, on finding myself thus forlorn in a strange country, I recollected a General 
               <persName id="t18310908-4-person138">Bentinck</persName>
            , who was well known to a family of the name of Eckhardt, with whom I had been very intimate during my stay at Cologne; I addressed him under the signature of my friend's name, Cristine Eckhardt, begging his assistance in finding Mrs. Kently; he came to see me, and showed me so much kindness that I felt ashamed at having given him an assumed name - he procured me a lodging with Miss Carey, No. 20, Connaught-terrace, till I should be able to find Mrs. Kently, and to recover my box; I received my box from Rotterdam, and at the same time a letter from Mrs. Kently in which she told me that she had deceived me, and many other things which I cannot now repeat - Miss Carey persuaded me to remain with her and try to get another place; I accordingly answered several advertisements (but in my own name), and at length had the good fortune to be engaged by Mrs. Wood, of Southampton, who expressed her entire satisfaction with my testimonials as to character and deportment, confirmed as they were by the representations of Mr. Herstatt, at Cologne; many times I felt inclined to make it known to Miss Carey that I was not Miss Eckhardt, whose name I had been induced by my distress to assume, but I was ashamed to do it - from the first day I discovered that Miss Carey was always drunk, and often in such a state as not to know what she did; on the Wednesday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080008"/>before I set out for Southampton, I changed with others a 10l. Bank note for her, and these she says are the notes which were burnt - in the evening she was very much intoxicated, and on going to a cupboard with a candle she set fire to it; after it was extinguished, she said that she had put some Bank notes into the cupboard and that they were all burnt; the day before I left she showed me after dinner twelve shifts and two dresses, asking me to buy them of her, which I consented to do, and paid her nine guineas, and nine guineas for my lodging - in the evening, being very drunk, in going up stairs with me to bed, she asked me if I had any money left with which to buy some more things; I said Yes, and she brought me a great quantity of things, telling me that I might have them all for thirty guineas; I told her I could not give so much, but that I would give her eighteen guineas, which she at length agreed to take, (saying that she was in want of money,) and helped me to put the things into my box; now she says that I stole all these things - she had several pictures, which I asked her to lend me to copy them, but she refused, and when I left I took them with me; she took at the office a black lace veil from my bonnet, (which I had worn during my stay in her house,) saying it was hers; she also told the Magistrate that I had given her three gilt shillings for three sovereigns, having seen in my box some gold dust which I used to put on my writing, and some gold leaf, which I had brought from Amsterdam for the purpose of ornamenting some trifles; Madam Van Doesberg, at Amsterdam, knows all this, and also that I was possessed of 80l., 50l. in gold, and 30l. in Bank notes.</p>

On the 4th of July I saw two persons fighting opposite Milfields-place - the prisoner was one of them; that is about two miles and a half from the prosecutors' - I went up, and parted them; the prisoner was rather drunk - a bundle was given to him by a person, who brought it out of a beer-shop, and he put it on his shoulder - I then suspected all was not right, and took him into custody; I asked him what the bundle contained - he asked what was that to me, and said I could see what he had got; I asked what he was going to do with them - he said he dealt in the trade, and that he bought, sold and exchanged - I said my opinion was that he had stolen them, and asked how he came by them; he used very abusive language, not fit to mention, and in our way to the station-house he offered to treat me with a pot of porter to let him go about his business - as I was taking him from the station-house to Worship-street, Foster passed me in a chaise-cart, and informed me a robbery had been committed at Tottenham: the prisoner then changed countenance very much, and said, "Now I am done!" he said he should like to shoot that bl - y fellow's brains out: he said he hoped I should be as favourable to him as I could, and if I did I should find him an honourable chap.</p>

On the 4th of September I went out to church, just after the clock struck six, leaving nobody in the house; there is a kitchen, parlour, and shop on the ground floor - the shop and parlour communicate; a door leads from the parlour into the passage, and into a lower kitchen - there is a door from the shop into the street; I locked my parlour door, and put the key in the shop - I locked the shop door, and put the key in my pocket; I left the door leading from the parlour to the passage bolted inside, and found it so, and the kitchen door was fastened with a chain - the windows were all shut up and bolted; I came home between eight and nine o'clock, when service was over - I unlocked the shop door as usual, as I thought; it goes with a double lock - that door was not broken, but when I opened it, the parlour door, which faces the shop door, was wide open; I missed a green cloak, three silk shawls, two silver spoons, a table-cloth, and other things - I have seen part of them since, in the hands of the Police; I had left them safe in a chest of drawers in the parlour when I went out - I had seen them in the drawer that very day, when I took something out; I called Ann clarke, who lives next door - we examined the place together, and then sent for the Police.</p>

Last Sunday evening, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Golden-lane, with two other men; I knew him before - I saw him cross the road, and go into a clothes-shop, kept by a Jew, with a green cloak on his left arm; directly he entered the door it was closed - I forced it open, and found the prisoner standing behind a heap of clothes on the counter; I took the cloak off his arm, and asked where he got it from - he made no reply, but rushed out of the shop; Reid was with me - we pursued after him, calling Stop thief! he was stopped by Morris, and his hat directly fell off - Draper picked it up- I produce the cloak.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What is your business? A. I do hired work for gentlemen, whatever they want me to do, respecting horses and carts; I live at Peckham-rye; I have no partner - my father-in-law had the pony before I did; I took his business, and the horse with it; I did not know Chapman before this - I was here yesterday, and this morning, but by mistake went into the other Court; I am a stranger, and did not know but it was the right Court; I have not received any money from Chapman.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when any money was paid to Chapman? A. No; I saw 14s. 6d. tied up in a woman's shawl - I cannot say she gave it to Chapman.</p>

            . On Friday, the 8th of July, I was in Smithfield, and had a pony, there; I asked William Cogan to hold the pony - I had bought it of Johnson about half-past nine o'clock that morning; I was coming down Charles-street, Drury-lane, where I live - Carter came up to me, and told me he had a pony to sell me, which would pay me a few shillings, if I would buy it -I went with him to Johnson, who was standing at the bottom of Newton-street, Holborn, with the pony in between the shafts of a cart; I asked Johnson what he wanted for it - he asked me 6l., to the best of my recollection; I gave him 3l. for it - there was a good deal said about it; I had not the money to pay him, and they both went with me to Parker's, in James-street, Paddington, and waited there till I came out - Parker lent me three sovereigns, which I paid Johnson; Carter was present - we took the pony out of the harness: some people collected, and bought the cart of him; I took the pony away in about ten minutes - I put it into the stable, then brought it to Smithfield, and gave it to Cogan to hold; it was the same pony as I bought of Johnson.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you acquainted with Carter before? A. I had seen him before, and spoken to him; he lived with a horse-dealer - I had never been to his place; I had known him about two years, but was not intimate - I never saw Johnson before; I did not take a receipt for the money - I cannot write myself; Mr. Parker saw me buy it - he keeps a green-grocer's shop, and is a friend of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he received 14s. for you, that you might stay away? A. No, that promise was never made; the woman said she knew it was a great loss to me, and she would make the 3l. up to me, but I got nothing; Parker, who lent me the money, had it, I believe, but I was not present, for I was taken with the horse, and was locked up in the Compter all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell the Jury that you gave 3l. for a horse which you were asked 6l. for, by a person you never saw before? A. I knew Carter before, having lived with a horse-dealer; I deal in horses a little - when the horse was claimed I ran up, and said, "That is my horse, I bought it;" Reed said, "It is mine - it has been stolen from me this morning;" I said it was mine, and the officer came up, and took me to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing about who you got it from till you were charged with stealing it? A.When the man said it was his I told him who I bought it of immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say a word about it till you were before the Magistrate? A. Yes, I said so to my friends about me; I believe Parker and Reed knows that - I said I believed I could find the man; I have not received any money to stay away - I believe Parker has received 14s. of the money; Johnson's wife gave my wife 2l. 1s., which my wife gave to Parker, as I had borrowed the money of him to pay for the horse; it was given to her to give to Parker - I was never at Peckham-rye in my life; I have never received any of the money myself - I told the Justice that Parker had received 2l. 15s.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not say no further proceedings should be taken, and that you would not appear if you could get enough to pay Parker? A. I never said such a word; I was in custody at the time Parker received it - I do not know whether Reed referred the person to Parker to pay the money, for it happened outside Guildhall, and I was in custody at the time; I suppose Reed must have shown the woman to Mr. Parker, because I understand she wanted Reed to take it; I cannot say whether the Magistrate asked what I had done with the money - I told him my wife had 2l. 1s., and Parker 14s.; I told him what had become of it without his asking me - I will not swear it was before he asked me about it; the woman went and complained that I had promised to acquit her husband if she paid the money and I went to explain it; I do not know of any warrant being issued against me - none was served; I mentioned my wife's having had the money before any complaint was made.</p>

               <p>ROBERT PARKER. I live in James-street, Lisson-green. On the 8th of July Chapman and the two prisoners came to me with a pony; Chapman came into my house - the prisoners were outside; I lent him 3l. to buy the pony - I went out of the house with him, and saw him give the money to Johnson: Carter said it was a good pony, and he had had it some time - that is all I recollect; they then went into a public-house - the cart stood at the door, and while they were there a man came in, and asked the prisoners if they would sell the cart; they both went outside with the young man, and sold him the cart - the pony was taken away, and I went home to breakfast; Carter was outside the public-house when he said he had had the pony some time, Johnson was close to him, and could hear what he said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the man who bought the cart here? A. Not that I know of - I know him, he lives near me; I never saw the prisoners before - the cart was sold directly, and then Chapman took away the pony; there did not appear any thing unusual in the transaction to me - I have seen such things done before, when people have been wanting carts and had no further use for them; I never lent money before for that purpose - I took no receipt from Chapman: I have lent him money before - I keep a potato-warehouse and green-grocer's; I have lived there eight months - I have known Chapman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080011"/>about three years; I have received 2l. 15s. of the money back again - a woman brought me back 14s. of it.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not receive it on the express condition to forswear your evidence? A. No, the woman asked me if I would keep away if I received the money, and not appear - I said, "I cannot help appearing - I must appear;" I received the 14s. from Carter's wife, or Johnson's wife, I believe she calls herself; Chapman's wife brought me 2l. 1s. - she did not tell me where it came from, nor did Chapman; the women themselves told me outside that they were sorry they had found the money for me now; I had told them I should appear to clear Chapman, as I had seen him pay for the pony - I had a right to receive the money, as I had lent it; I had no business to ask Chapman's wife where she got it; I did not tell the Magistrate that Carter said he had had the pony for some time - I was not asked the question.</p>
               <p>Carter's Defence. I did not say the pony belonged to me, and that I had had it a long time - on Friday morning, the 8th of July, I met Johnson at the foot of Westminster-bridge; he asked if I had any thing to do- I said No; he asked if I knew any body wanted to buy a pony - I said I knew a man who might buy it; he asked me to go with him to the man - I went and recommended the man to buy the pony, and after it was sold I went to Johnson's house, and stopped all night with him.</p>

            . I belong to the Police. On Saturday, the 27th of August, about ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners in Portpool-lane, Gray's Inn-lane, coming in a direction from Jockey's-fields; Helmes was pulling a truck, and Simpson pushing behind - they had the articles now produced in the truck; I followed them into Cross-street, hatton-garden, about four hundred yards, then stopped them, and asked what they had in the truck - Helmes said, "Ask the other behind;" he did not mention his name - he said he was hired to assist him, and the other was to give him 2s.; I said to Simpson, "Hopeful, what have you got here?" that is the name I knew him by - I knew him before; he said, "It is my property, I am going to set up house-keeping;" I asked where he was going with it - he said into West-street, Smithfield; I asked where he got the property from - he said he bought it of a broker in Old-street; I asked the broker's name, and the number of the house where he lived - he said he did not know; I said as he could not give a satisfactory account where he obtained the property, I should take him into custody; I took hold of Helmes, but Simpson got away before I took hold of him, and I took him on the next morning, between eight and nine o'clock, in bed, at his mother's house, No. 3, New-court, Portpool-lane, which I knew before - Newcourt is about the middle of Portpool-lane; they were opposite that court when I first saw them - they might have been taking the things from that court, for what I know.</p>

I did - I followed you down the lane, hoping to get assistance to take you both - Johnson, the Policeman, No. 18, came up; I then seized Helmes - Johnson did not hear the conversation between us; he came up just as I finished questioning him, and also Serjeant Barton; I stopped the truck about ten o'clock - they were not three minutes going from portpool-lane to Cross-street; they went very fast.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to Jockey's-fields? A. No.</p>

            . I am the wife of Bryan Helmes, and live at No. 5, Castle-court, Fulwood's-rents. My husband was employed by Mr. Hayter, and I was directed by my husband to buy these things for Mr. Hayter - I believe the articles produced to be the same that I bought; I had no particular marks on them - they are all similar to those I bought; I know nothing about the saddle - I believe the other articles to be those I bought about four months ago for Mr. Hayter - he lives at No. 9, Old-square, Lincoln's Inn; the things were taken to the stables in Jockey's-fields- I saw them there; the prisoner is my son.</p>

            . I am a stone-mason, and live in Castle-court. I gave my wife direction to buy these things for Mr. Hayter, and saw them repeatedly at the place in Jockey's-fields; there is no particular mark on them - I was at Jockey's-fields a fortnight or three weeks before they were taken, but not later; I have been in the habit of going there a great deal, but the groom was out of town - I passed by the place on Saturday, the 27th of August,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080012"/>at ten o'clock in the morning, and seeing a person pass who I knew to be a bad character, I tried the door, and it was fast - I put my knee against it; I went there the next morning, (Sunday,) and found the door standing open, as if it had been opened with a key.</p>
               <p>HENRY FLATMAN. I am a farrier. On Sunday morning. the 28th of August, between eight and nine o'clock, I saw this stable - the door stood two or three inches ajar; I could not judge how it had been opened - there was no appearance of violence; I alarmed the neighbours, and a man went up stairs with me - I found the property gone; I was never there before - Jockey's-fields is all stables, and is much frequented.</p>

               <p>Helmes' Defence. I was at work in the City-road on the Saturday, and as I passed the end of Portpool-lane, on my way home, a man came up and asked if I was busy; I said not - he asked if I would help him move a few things, and he would give me 1s.; he told me to fetch a truck for him - I did so; I came up the lane, and a person put in the bed and things - he told me to go down Holborn-hill; the Policeman came, and asked where I was going with them - I said I did not know; I was going towards Holborn, and told him to ask the man behind - the man said they were his, and he was going to take them to West-street; I never saw the man any more.</p>
               <p>Simpson's Defence. The bed and furniture have been in my possession nine months - I bought them with money I worked hard for, and kept them at my lodgings till this time, when I was going to move to a room I had taken -I bought the saddle and bridle in Smithfield on the Friday week before; I have not seen the bridle since I have been take - I met this man in Gray's Inn-lane, and employed him to help me.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the night in question I saw the prosecutor in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, in company with the prisoner Bacon - she had hold of his arm; Lee was walking close behind him- I saw them go away together down Essex-street, and in about forty minutes the two female prisoners came back, went into the house where they live, and in about twenty minutes, or hardly so much, the prosecutor came and appeared looking about for somebody; I asked him if he had lost any thing - he complained of his loss to me; I went with him to the house I had seen the females enter- I knocked at the door twice; Moore asked who was there - I called him by name, and told him to open the door, which he did; I immediately went into the room - he followed me; he had nothing but his shirt on - I went into the room, and told the two female prisoners they must consider themselves in custody; the prisoner Cotter was also in the room - he was dressed; I saw some papers burning on the fire, and the covers of a red leather pocket - book - I produce one piece which I took off the fire; I could not save the papers - the two male prisoners said they knew nothing at all about the circumstance; Moore keeps the house - Bacon and Lee live there; Moore's wife was in bed, under a kind of counter in the room - I know there is a crack by which I could see into the house when the shutters are closed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080013"/>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Are there not oyster barrels by the shutters? A. Yes, but that does not impede the view - Moore appeared to have just got out of bed; I believe Cotter lives with the prisoner Lee- I have taken oysters outside the window, but was never inside the house; it is an oyster-shop, but not an intermediate beer-shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many other persons lodge in the house? A. I cannot say - I do not know that any women lodged there except Moore's wife; it is a lodging-house - I do not know how many rooms there are; I only went into two - the prosecutor appeared to me as if he had been drinking, but capable of conducting himself; I saw Bacon with him - I do duty in that street; I first saw them about half-past one o'clock or a little later, in Wentworth-street - a good many men and women are about there late at night; I make it a practice to notice every party I see.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor did not complain of being robbed till you asked him about it? A. No, he began his conversation with me by asking if it was not a very fine morning - I suggested to him that he had been robbed; I was in my uniform - he merely passed me, and said it was a fine morning; I followed him, and asked if he had been robbed, as I thought it singular he should be wandering down the street, and he appeared to be looking for somebody - his looking at every house as he passed made me speak to him; he was not looking at one house more than another - he appeared as if he had lost something, and was endeavouring to find it; I could not tell whether he was looking for assistance or not - if I had seen him go into a house with the prisoners I should have stopped him; there were not many people about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prosecutor tell you he was so drunk he was utterly incapable of telling you by whom he had been robbed? A.He did not - that I swear; he was not very drunk - he did not appear to have been drinking to excess at all, but to have his perfect senses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was he able to speak? A. Yes, and walk as straight as a man could - he gave me a correct account of what took place.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went into the house after Cotter, and took one piece of the pocketbook off the fire; before I went in I looked through a crack in the shutters, and could see the prisoner Cotter with a piece of paper in his hand, and heard him say, "In what manner have you got rid of him?" I could not see any body but him - the reply was that they laid him flat on his back and left him; that is all I heard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Had you taken any oysters at the shop that night? A. Yes, I had them outside the window - Cotton was not with me; Moore helped me to them - he was dressed then; when I looked through the crack Cotter stood about two yards from the window; there is glass to the window, but whether the sash was down I cannot say - I was sober; I do not know whether I was looking through glass or not; the window was up when I had the oysters - the shutters were up when I saw this; I looked through an aperture in them - I went into the shop afterwards, but did not notice whether the sash was down; if the glass had been down I should think I could not hear distinctly; I was not above half a minute looking through the shutter - I heard what was said quite distinctly; my eye was to the crack, and my ear close to the shutter - there was a candle standing on the counter; Moore's wife was under the counter, in bed - I do not know how many people lodge in the house; knowing the prisoners before made me notice them; the crack in the shutter was large enough to put a penny-piece through - it is a bow-out window, with a front window to shut upthe shutter is in front of the bow; it is a sash window.</p>

            . These are two pieces of my pocket-book - I know them by the look of them - the particular marks I had on the book are burnt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to say you had nothing that day but a glass of rum and a pint of porter? A. I had some beer on board the ship before I left, but nothing but my allowance; that was all I had - I had drank no liquor but a glass of rum; I do not know the name of the street I took that in - my ship had come up the day before; I drank nothing in the prisoners' company - they wanted me, but I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state to the prisoners, when you produced the sovereign in the house, that that was the only one you had, for you had been robbed of the rest? A. On my oath I did not say any such thing, nor any thing like it; I left my ship between six and seven o'clock, and went up Holborn, but being a stranger I cannot tell the names of the streets I went to - I have been a seaman ever since I was twelve years old; I was in Holborn about nine or ten o'clock - I was going to see my cousin, who I learned was gone to Gravesend; I came away down homeward again- I called at no house; I strolled about some time - I passed through smithfield; I never sat down - I walked about, and intended to go to my ship - I was paid that afternoon from the ship, and received six sovereigns; I left one on board with a shipmate, named Grant, and changed another after I came on shore, and another after I saw the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q.Then how had you five when you saw the prisoners? A. I had four sovereigns in my pocket-book when I was robbed; I was sober - I do not know what became of the change of the first sovereign exactly; I believe the change was taken out of my pocket before I saw the prisoners - I told them I had been robbed, but did not tell them that was the only sovereign I had left; I was robbed in a house in that same street, I think - I do not recollect that I have sworn I did not go into any house; I was in one undoubtedly - I went with a woman I fell in with in the street; she was showing me the road where I was to go - a person like me might lose their way in London; I did not give the woman any money, nor any thing to drink - I did not go into any public-house with her - I might be there an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Three hours? A. I cannot tell, but I was sober and knew what I was doing - I will not swear that it was in the same street that I was robbed in; I was robbed of my pocket-book and money the second turning below Whitechapel church - I was robbed before that in a house, and lost about 14s.; I cannot say exactly how much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you could not tell what became of your change? A. I say that still, because I lost it - I had no money before I was paid; I changed the first sovereign down by the London-docks - I think I had about 14s. left; I cannot tell how much I spent - I spent it dif<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080014"/>ferent ways; I might go into a shop, and get something to eat - I might have bought a biscuit or so; I got different things to eat - some bacon, bread, and potatoes; I swear that I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you from half-past ten till half-past one o'clock? A. If I could repeat every street I was in, I could tell you.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what time of night was you in the house with the woman, where you suppose you were robbed? A. It might be between ten and eleven o'clock, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you look at your pocket-book from the time you left your ship till you went with the officer? A. I did, as I took the sovereign out, and there were four remaining; I changed the first sovereign at a public-house, but did not drink there - I paid for what I bought to eat with the change of that sovereign; I took that sovereign out of the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When you went to search the oyster-shop, Moore's wife was in bed under the counter? A.She might be, but I did not search the room - I did not notice whether the window was down.</p>

             re-examined. I did not notice whether the window was shut or open.</p>
               <p>Bacon's Defence. This is a lodging-house; there are eight rooms in it, and a good many more young women live there - I know nothing of the robbery; we got up to get something to eat, and saw the prosecutor standing there - he said he had been robbed; there was a lot of people round him - he was washing his face with a handkerchief; somebody gave him water to wash it with.</p>
               <p>Cotter's Defence. The Policeman saw me come home; directly I got in I asked for a light to go up to my bedthe people had not got the light before the Policeman came to the door and knocked; this man let him in - he searched the girl and searched me; he found 11/2d. on me - they laid hold of the two girls, and I walked behind; if I had not been innocent I could have got away - I was eight or ten yards behind them all the time.</p>

            . My nose was bleeding, and I was washing my face when the prisoners came up; I do not know what made my nose bleed - I received no blow; I rather think I was robbed of the 14s. in the same street - it is a very long street, but I might have turned the corner.</p>

               <p>Q.What did you do for the two months before the 22nd of July, up to that day? A. I used to get jobs where I could - I worked for Dalton and Watts, in High-street, Lambeth; I did several days work for them between the time of my leaving Denew and going to the prisoner's - I had a whole week's work there, and I have worked at getting clay out of barges by the water side; I have supported myself by my own work as a potter - I was not in want of money, not to be distressed; I had money at home which I had earned by working as a potter - Lawrence is a fishmonger; I have known him in Lambeth, I suppose, six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you first to go with Lawrence? A. I was desired by Gollocker to assist in taking him - I expect nothing but my expences; I did not go for the purpose of making money by it - I have not been told any thing about what I am to receive, nor that I am to receive any thing; I do not expect to be paid more than for my loss of time -I was never in trouble myself; I was never at the place till Lawrence took me - I went with Lawrence; he gave the order for the money - I afterwards went and took them; Forecast was not there the first time I went - I saw Forecast put the metal into the pipe; I went to take them, not to entrap them.</p>

            . I live at No. 23, Lambeth-butts. I know Gollocker - he is a parish constable; he asked me to go to the prisoners' lodging - I said I would; I accompanied Brummitt on the 22nd of July - I had seen Brummitt twice before; when we got there we went up into Bagley's room, and I asked if he had any half-bulls, meaning half-crowns - he said No, and asked what I should want; I told him I should want a score of half-bulls and a score of garter-bobs, which means shillings, and a score of plain, which means plain shillings that have not got the garter round them - I asked him how long they would be before they were ready; he said he would have them ready in an hour and a half - we then went down, and went to the public-house at the corner of the street, where the officers were waiting; I did not go to the place a second time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.How long have you been a dealer in counterfeit coin? A.Since the 10th of June; I have been with Gollocker at times - I am not a dealer; I consider myself an honest, upright man - I have not given more than six or seven orders for counterfeit coin; I believe it is not more than five times - Gollocker is the person I principally go with when he calls on me; he never pays me, nor has any body else paid me - I expect to be paid for my loss of time, but as to any thing furthere I cannot tell; I do not get people to make coin, to entrap them, and then inform the Mint - if a person is introduced to me, I go and make a purchase of him; I never go myself, because I have no connexion with dealers in coin, except they are pointed out to me - Gollocker asked me to go to the prisoners'.</p>
               <p>Q. He asked you as a friend of his? A. He and I have been together many years on the watch - he was a patrol, I was a private-watchman; I am a fishmonger - I live by that, and not by following Gollocker; I have never received a halfpenny for this, and as soon as I go from here I shall go to my employ - if a person is pointed out to me, I make it my duty to go, if I am sanctioned by an officer; it is my duty to go under the patronage of the officer, and detect them - I was not acquainted with coiners, so as to introduce myself to them - Gollocker was waiting in the street while I went in to the prisoners' - he had been with me previously to the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be acquainted with the terms? A. It is language I hear them make use of - I ordered a score of half-bulls, &amp;c. in those words; I used those words when speaking to those sort of people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go there on purpose to betray them? A. I went to convince the world that they were the people they were represented to me; we knew of it a long time before - I do not entrap any one.</p>

On the 22nd of July I went to the prisoners' lodgings with Brummitt, Lloyd, and Hall - I followed Lloyd up stairs, and after we got on the first floor I heard a man say, "Who have you got there?" and at that moment he rushed down stairs - when he came down I seized him on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080016"/>landing, and forced him into a room on the first floor; it was Bagley - when I got there another man was behind the door, and directly upon that the female prisoner and another man came round, and endeavoured to get him from me; I drew my cutlass, and said if he did not go up stairs I would cut him down - I forced him up stairs, and Forecast was sitting in the chair with Lloyd holding him; after he was secured, this tin dish was on the hob in the two pair of stairs room - there was a sharp fire there; two tobacco pipes were in the fire red hot, and full of metal - on the top of the ashes, under the fire, was this half-crown, which I picked up; it was very hot - on the table laid two pieces of metal, called gets; another get laid on the right-hand side of the fire place, and a three-square file and scissors on the table; a blue cloth on the right-hand side of the fire place on a chair, and on the table laid these pieces of new pewter spoons, cut up; on the bed by the side of a shawl lay these four half-crowns, finished - on the floor, by the side of a chair by the window, laid four more unfinished; in a cupboard, in the room, was this tin band, which they make the moulds with, and this knife with plaster of Paris on it - some wet plaster of Paris in a basin, and by the side of it a paper bag, containing a quantity of plaster in a dry state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The room seems to have been nearly ready to receive you? A.It appears like it: Gollocker is here - Lawrence goes with us both if we want him; I cannot tell how much money I have received in two years from the Mint - you asked me yesterday that question on a trial, and I told you if you had asked me to bring my book, I would; I have not looked at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you have not had 100l. in the last two years? A. Not within twelve months; I will swear I have not had 150l. within the last two years - my business as a tobacconist is very good, but I do not depend upon that; I have landed property - I did this out of regard to the laws; I am entitled to my expences - I have been in the habit of going with Lawrence about twelve months; I should think it is nearly as long - he was at Maidstone, at the Spring Assizes, and you saw him there; I believe that was the first Mint case he had, but I have known him about twelve months - when we send him on this business we can trust him, and he never deceives us; he does not get people to make coin that I know of - I do not think I have been paid any thing by the Mint for these twelve months; I have done business for them for the last ten years, but do not think I have been paid above five years.</p>
               <p>Q.Is there not one Perkins employed about coin? A. Yes, he came to us; I do not know of his having been convicted - I told you yesterday; I sometimes gave him a shilling or two - I will swear I never gave him 5l. - I mean to charge the Mint with what money I pay.</p>
               <p>Bagley. Q. Did you not put out your hands to stop me from going out at the bottom of the stairs into the street? A.When I first saw him he was coming out of the two pair of stairs room - he rushed by the witness; I stood at the corner of the stairs, and as he came by I seized him with my left hand - he never got down the stairs; the staircase is very narrow and dark - I pushed you into the front room; another man and that woman came into the room, and gave me a drive towards the window - I drew my cutlass, and you surrendered; you said you did not live in that room - I seized him at the bottom of the second flight of stairs, coming down from his room, not near the street door - the female prisoner and another man came into the room to us.</p>

I am acquainted with the materials coiners use - this mould is made of plaster of Paris; there are the two sides of a half-crown, of the date of 1817, impressed on it, here are also two pieces of what appears to be a plaster of Paris mould - it has part of the impression of the reverse side of a half-crown of 1817, the date is on it now - one of the half-crowns produced by Hall is finished, and the other has the get to it, as if just out of the mould; they are both counterfeits, and of the date of 1817 - I cannot say they are made from this mould, it being so broken; the two produced by Lloyd are both counterfeit, and dated 1817 - one is finished and the other not; the four produced by Myers are counterfeit, and dated 1817 - they are finished; here are four more produced by him, one finished and three unfinished; they are of the same date, but cast in a different mould to the others - they appear to me to have been cast in the mould which is perfect; in fact I have no hesitation in swearing so - there is an indented mark just under the chin of the whole four, and there is a corresponding mark in the mould; the moulds are made by inserting a good half-crown into the plaster of Paris - the unfinished ones merely require small particles of metal to be removed from them, which is occasioned by the mould not being closed; it is removed by a file or scissors - a spot or defect in the mould would appear in the coin; these are Britannia metal spoons, which is similar metal to the coin - a tin band is usually used to form the mould.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you call this half-crown entirely finished for circulation? A. Yes - aquafortis would entirely destroy it; I cannot say these smaller pieces of plaster of Paris have ever been a mould for a half-crown, because here is only part of the reverse side - whether the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080017"/>obverse side was to it I cannot tell; I have no hesitation in saying it is the obverse side of a half-crown - part of the impression of this other mould is broken off on the outside- rubbing it together would produce that; the convex part of it is in a perfect state, but there are projecting parts in order that the mould might fit together in one place always, and those are off.</p>

               <p>Forecast's Defence. I do not live there, but live in the same street - I went to the Star, and asked for a newspaper; they said it was out, and if I went to such a place I should get it - I went to this room, and asked two females for the newspaper; they said I should have it, and directly the officers came they took and threw me on the bed; a mallet laid there - I laid hold of it, and he said if I did not go up stairs he would cut me down with his staff - I did not see Bagley in the room when I went up; one of them says I threw the handkerchief out of the window; these men say they picked up the mould, but there was no handkerchief found - I believe Sheen can prove I was taken at the street door.</p>

               <p>MR. WILLOWS. I had seen the trousers in the front kitchen the night before - I had seen the green bag in the first floor back room shortly before, or the day before, and I had left this wine-glass in the back room.</p>

Did you not know I was in possession of a few pounds? Witness. No.</p>

On Friday night, the 5th of August, there were some things in my bed-room, which was locked; I cannot say whether the window was shut - I went to carry some things up stairs that evening, and when I went up Blacket sat in the club-room, which is right opposite the staircase leading to the bed-room; I saw him sitting right facing the staircase - I had not been in the club-room that evening; there were several persons in the room - I had not seen Cohen there; they were all strangers to me; when I got on the landing-place Blacket came out of the club-room on to the landingplace; I went to my bed-room door, and could not put my own key in the lock - I found there was another key in the door; I did not take it out, and cannot say what sort of a key it was - on turning the handle the door came open, and as soon as I opened it two men rushed out: I laid hold of the last one, and held him till Blacket laid hold of me, and kept me away from him - the two men escaped down stairs; I cannot say who they were - I think the second man was dressed in a brown coat, but I had very little opportunity of seeing; I laid hold of Blacket, and gave him in charge - when I laid hold of him he said he had not been in the room; he would have got away if he could - he did not do any thing.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any difficulty in stopping him? A. There were several people at the bottom of the stairs, as I called out, and it was useless for him to attempt to escape; after going to the station-house I went into the room - my sister, Elizabeth Walker, went in first, I believe: when I went in I found one of the top drawers taken out, and the contents thrown on the bed; they were bills, papers, and receipts - there was wearing-apparel and things taken out of the second drawer; some of my late husband's clothes were taken out, and put on the bed, and some of my little boy's clothes - the veneer was of some of the drawers, as if they had been forced open with a knife; a pipe laid across the wash-hand stand; it was warm when I saw it, which was a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after the men had rushed out.</p>

               <p>Q.When you opened the door was the window open? A. I am not certain - it is a corner house; the window looks on Artichoke-hill - it is on the first floor, and a person holding by his hands could drop on the ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About what time did the persons rush out of the room? A. As near as I can tell about ten o'clock - I cannot say whether it was a little before or a little after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many times have you been examined on this case before the Justice? A. I was at Lambeth-street once or twice - I have been examined four times there; I believe a gentleman wrote down what I said each time - it was read over to me the last time, and I made my mark to it; I do not recollect its being read over to me more than once - I told the whole story over each time, as near as I could, I did not take much notice of what was being written - I was asked to come into a room, and what I said was taken down; I made my mark to it - that was the last time; I do not know whether what I said was taken down every time, or only the last; I have always told the same story, as near as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said you knew so little of the matter that you would not have come at all if it had not been for the Police? A. No, I will swear that positively; it was not the Policeman who asked me to come - I gave the account I have now before the Magistrate: whether Blacket was committed as a rogue and vagabond I do not know; he rescued the man, and pulled me away from him - he got between us, and pulled me away; it was in the dark, because when the club-room was shut I could not see; the moment I laid hold of the door to open it the light was knocked out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before the men rushed out? A. No, it happened all at one time - Blacket came on the landingplace where I stood; he was close against me - there was nobody on the landing-place but him and me; I did not know him before - I did not let him go till he was taken by the Policeman at the bottom of the stairs, which was directly after he prevented my holding the man; we came down the stairs together, and he was taken at the bottom of the stairs - he might have got from me by using great violence, but there were several people at the bottom of the stairs; my girl went and hallooed out - the Policeman and several people were at the bottom of the stairs, and took him directly - I never let him go; it was only up one pair of stairs - the Policeman was not in the house; I held Blacket by the collar - the girl passed us at the top of the stairs; she ran out with several more, and the Policeman came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not release him altogether, and was he not some time in the house before he was given in charge? A. No.</p>
               <p>HENRY MARQUARD. I am a Police-officer. On Friday night I was on duty near this house, about ten o'clock -I went to the White Hart; I found Blacket there - the prosecutrix was there, and gave him in charge; I should think when I got to the station-house, it was near halfpast ten - I did not see the other prisoner; I afterwards went up to the room, found a small drawer on the bed, and some papers - the room was in disorder;

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you at the examinations before the Magistrate? A. Yes - Cohen offered to tender two witnesses to prove where he was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where was Blacket when you took him? A.Standing just by the bar, at the bottom of the stairs - there were several women round him; the prosecutrix was one, and, I think, she had hold of him - there was great confusion at the time: she was standing close to him - the station-house is about a quarter of a mile from the house; it might take me seven or eight minutes to get there - we walked slowly; the clock had struck ten when I heard the alarm- I was not a minute and a half going there, but we searched the prisoner at the public-house, and found a half-sovereign and some silver on him.</p>

            . I was at Mrs. Collison's house on the night in question; I heard her give an alarm up stairs, and at that time I saw the prisoner Cohen come down stairs - he was alone; I saw one man come down before him, but I do not know him - Cohen came down alone; the other man had come down two or three minutes before - I had seen Cohen, I think, the evening before, in the club-room, but not before; I had not seen him in the club-room, that night - I had seen him the night before, but cannot be positive I had seen him that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you an opportunity of seeing the person you call Cohen? A. I was standing at the counter at the bar, and he went by; he turned his head, and looked up at the clock - I had an opportunity of seeing his side face as he passed; he did not stop - he was dressed in a kind of snuff-coloured coat, the same colour as he has on now, with a black velvet collar.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after he went away did Mrs. Collison come down? A. I heard her call out directly; I went towards her, hearing her give an alarm, and saw Blacket holding her - this was immediately after I saw Cohen pass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Can you tell how many minutes before the other man had passed? A. To the best of my recollection two or three minutes - I never said I did not see Cohen's face; I recollect telling the Magistrate that to the best of my recollection, I had seen Cohen the night before - I cannot swear positively that he is the man I saw the night before, because there were more people there; I was not confused at the time I saw Cohen go through - I heard Mrs. Collison call out after that; I saw Cohen at the station-house, I think, the next night - I cannot say whether it was Saturday or Monday night, but it was on the night he was taken; I cannot say whether his cravat was white or black - he passed too quick for me to observe that; he went by quite quick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you ever hear Mrs. Collison say she knew so little about it she never would have come if it had not been for the Police? A. I did not.</p>

I went to this house on Friday night, to help Mrs. Collison; I know the prisoners -I saw them in the club-room that night, in conversation together; to the best of my recollection it was nine or ten o'clock - It was before the alarm; I should think it was about nine - there were several others in the room in conversation with the prisoners also.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go into the club-room, before you heard the alarm, and after you had seen the prisoners there? A. Yes, Blacket was there then, but Cohen was not - that might be about half-past nine o'clock; I heard Mrs. Collison give the alarm about ten o'clock, and saw Blacket holding her - I did not see any body go out of the room then; I afterwards went into her bed-room, and found the things in disorder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you related to the last witness? A. She is my mother - I am not a waiter there; I merely went over, being a neighbour: the regular waiter's name is Richard - he was attending on the club-room all the evening, backwards and forwards; I did not serve Cohen - if he was served with any thing it must have been by the regular waiter; he is not here - I do not know that he is ill; Cohen declared at the office that he was not in the house - I did not notice what waistcoat he had on; he had a black cravat, to the best of my recollection, but I cannot swear that - I will not swear it was not white.</p>

I am the prosecutrix's sister. -I was at the bar on Friday night, and remember her giving an alarm; at the time she gave the alarm I saw Cohen come down stairs - I am sure of him; he looked at the clock as he went out, which gave me an opportunity of seeing his face - I found a key outside the bed-room door, and gave it to the Policeman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you never go by any other name? A. No - I was married at Whitechapel church, to Robert Walker, and never went by any other name - my maiden name was Barlow.</p>
               <p>Q.Whoever the man was, he took some time to look at the clock? A. He made a full stop.</p>
               <p>Q. And deliberately looked up at the clock? A. Yes- Mrs. Fitzgerald stood by my side at the bar at the time, but my face was towards him.</p>
               <p>Q. If she has sworn he went so swift by her she could not see whether he had a white or black cravat, she must have made a mistake? A. Yes - I was never in a Court of Justice before; I went to Collison's to take some caps home; I said at the office that the man made a full stop and looked at the clock - there were different people in the public-house, outside the door and inside; I cannot swear what coloured cravat Cohen had on.</p>
               <p>Q. He made a very full stop at the clock? A. No, he passed and put his head up; I had seen him in the same dress the night before, in my sister's club-room.</p>
               <p>Cohen's Defence. On Friday evening, the 5th of August, in consequence of an indisposition, I did not leave home till after four o'clock; I then went to Charles Atkins', in Green-street, drank tea with him, and remained till after eight - I walked with him to London-bridge, then went down High-street, to the end of Dover-road, where we met two ladies of his acquaintance, but they are now in the country; we then proceeded down the Borough, to the end of Princes-street - I bade him good night, went home to supper, and was in bed at half-past ten o'clock, or from that to eleven.</p>

             re-examined. The prosecutor's wife was in my room from half-past two o'clock till she went to call her husband, except when she went to fetch the baby - one of my children died that morning; she fetched her baby, and I do not recollect her leaving the room afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, (written). I have always lived by industry, and have lived in the parish of St. Martin above twenty years, and part of that time as housekeeper, carrying on business as a working-jeweller, working for some of the first shops in London, supporting a wife and a large family; but by losses and misfortune failed. I have been working since as a journeyman for many respectable masters, and latterly with Mr. Rayner, of Union-street, Blackfriars-road, who is ready, at any time, to take me into his employ, should your mercy be extended to me by your verdict. I have only to assure you, that going towards the prosecutor's house I saw a man come out, and seeing the door nearly open, and wanting to go to the yard, I went in - I was followed by a woman and a man to the privy, when they laid hold of me, and accused me of taking some clothes, which were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080023"/>shown by the woman. I did not go up stairs - the prosecutor was called down; I told him I did not know that I had done any thing wrong, that I was intoxicated, and hoped he would let me go, which he did; I was then pushed out into the street - I was walking away towards my home, reflecting on the impropriety of my going in, when the Policeman stopped me, and took me to the station-house - he went back, and compelled the prosecutor to come against me. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I throw myself entirely on the mercy and consideration of the Court, having a wife and three children to support.</p>

            . On Wednesday, the 22nd or 23rd of August, I was in Tothill-fields prison; the prisoner came down to me there, and gave me this handkerchief - he brought me a loaf and some butter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with him before? A.Only by speaking to him, and civility - I had an old red handkerchief on my neck; he gave me this, and when I came out he asked me for it; I had sold it - he had not lent it to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lent it to her till she came out - I had a red one of hers to wash, and gave it her to put on the while. Witness. Yes, but he gave me this one, and I sold it to Charlotte Andrews for 2s.</p>

This is my handkerchief; it is marked with my name, and No. 3 - my house is in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster; I kept the robbery secret till I found the handkerchief; two or three people came, and told me they had seen Andrews with it, both on Saturday and Sunday - they are my next door neighbours; I had told them of it, because I had desired them to look out after my place, but I told nobody else.</p>

I said Yes: he said, "How do you sell them?" I said 1s. a peck - I do not know who they were; I had never seen them before - I am quite sure I met them both at the door; they walked out, and I walked in - a lad, who stood in front of the door, said to me, "Have you lost any thing?" I had seen both the lads apparently come out of the shop - the door-way is very narrow, and there was a truss of hay at the door; I was absent more than a minute or a minute and a half; I went into the shop, in consequence of what the lad said, looked into my till, and the bag was gone - I was going down Thomas-street next morning, and met Mr. Flood, who gave me the bag, tied up as I had left it; I do not think it had been opened - the same money was in it - this is the bag (looking at it) - it contains twenty sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, a crown-piece, eighteen half-crowns, eighty-one shillings, thirteen sixpences, two 10l. and a 5l. note; they were all in the bag when Flood gave it to me - the notes are all endorsed.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On Saturday night last I was going along Princes-street, Leicestersquare, about ten o'clock, near Mr. Powell's shop, and saw the two prisoners standing close to his window - I watched them for three or four minutes at the window; I did not see them talking together - I then heard the breaking of a pane of glass, and saw Pace snatch his hand from the window, and put something into his pocket; they both ran different ways - I followed, and canght Pace; I found this watch in his pocket - I never lost sight of him; as I was taking him back Rogers came up, and said he knew him - I immediately recognized him, and Pace said he was a d-d fool to come back; I took them both.</p>

No; I have drank in company where he has been, in the brickfields, eight or nine years ago - there was nobody round the table but him and three of his party; a woman was by the fire-place, three or four feet from the table - I did not agree to fight any body, nor give the prisoner the sovereigns as a stake; I was taken up, about three years ago, for an assault and acquitted, but was never accused of attempting to rob.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate woman. I was at Smith's public-house, in Tothill-street, and saw Meads; there were three people there besides the prisoner; I saw two sovereigns and some silver in Meads' hand - I did not see the prisoner take it, but saw him run out; Meads attempted to follow, and somebody struck him by the side of his eye - I went out, and saw no more; Meads complained of being robbed of two sovereigns before he was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you near enough to hear their conversation? A. I did not notice it; I heard nothing about a fight - I was three or four feet from the table; when the prisoner went away the prosecutor had the pot in his hand; I cannot say he was drinking - there were two men in the room besides Meads and the prisoner; they were not drinking with Meads; the landlord was not there- Meads had not been many minutes in the house; the other men were there before him - I went to Chelsea with Meads that day, to take the prisoner, and I heard him say at the watch-house that he took the money.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 8th of June Meads gave the prisoner into my charge, in Queen'syard, Jews'-row, Chelsea; he said he had taken two sovereigns out of his hand at a public-house in Tothill-street; the prisoner denied it going to the watch-house - he said he never had them, not that they had been given to him to hold as a stake; the prosecutor asked how he could be so ungrateful after knowing him so many years, and he said,"I did not take the money;" he again charged him with it - the prisoner then said, "I did take it, and if you will allow me to go, I will restore it to you again;" I think he said in a quarter of an hour; I found 4s. 11d. on him, and a bad crown-piece - it was about five o'clock in the afternoon; the prosecutor was struggling with him in the yard when I took him - the prisoner was on the top of him, and there were a number of thieves and prostitutes there, assisting the prisoner, to prevent his being taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That woman was never in the room; the prosecutor was there, drinking, three or four hours before I went in - he was falling out with a gentleman I did not know, and he threw the money down to me to hold; he was going to fight the gentleman - he said, "If your friends are agreeable I will fight you directly for the money;" I said I did not wish any thing of the kind, for the prosecutor was too much in liquor; the young man then said, "Well, I will have nothing more to do with it;"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080028"/>I then gave the gentleman his money - he threw it down, and put it to me again; I went about my business, and left the money on the table - he put his handkerchief up to his eye, and was crying drunk.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Chequers, where this happened, and have been there eight months. I was there the day this happened; the prosecutor was there nearly the whole day - he came in about nine o'clock, and left about an hour or an hour and a half after this happened: Johnson was never in the house - I have seen her several times: I supplied the prosecutor several times with drink - he was far from sober when he left; I heard him several times challenge a man to fight, and he put the money down on the table; he put above 3l. down at one time- it was two sovereigns and some silver; I was out of the room when he left - he, the prisoner, and the persons at the table were all chatting together; I should think there were ten or twelve persons drinking there while he was there - he came in before the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prosecutor very drunk? A. He was - a man named Easy Chapman had been drinking with him; the prisoner was drinking by himself: the prosecutor went away between two and three o'clock - I have known the prisoner two or three years, by seeing him; he did not frequent the house; I lived seven years with Mr. Muston, of Grosvenor-place - he died, and the establishment was broken up; after leaving there I was thirty-two weeks in the hospital, and sixteen weeks before I went to the Chequers; I have never been in trouble myself.</p>

             re-examined. Q. How did you become acquainted with the prisoner? A. I was not acquainted with him; I have seen him at Chelsea, and considered that he was a bricklayer; I have seen him at buildings, and at public-houses, where he was drinking -I saw the prosecutor put his money down two or three times, but he took it up and put into his pocket again; I never saw it after he said it was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had lost it before the prisoner went away? A. No; Chapman and another came into the room, and he gave charge of them too, but the Policeman would not take them.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you receive the money for his liquor? A. No, he paid at the bar; I am positive Johnson was not there: he told me he had thrown two sovereigns down on the table, and the prisoner had taken them up and gone away with them; I had not been out of the room above ten minutes: the prisoner had left during that time.</p>

Bank note, and a guard-chain from round my neck; my watch was not attached to it - it was made of silk, and had gold beads fixed to it; they took a snuff box, eight sovereigns, and sixteen or seventeen shillings, from my right-hand trousers pocket - I had accidentally torn one corner of the 10l. note off, but cannot say at which end; I folded the torn part in the rest, and had the whole note - my hat was also taken off; this did not last more than three or four minutes, I should think - I had drank a little rum-and-water after supper, but was perfectly sober; I called Murder! and Police! a person immediately put his hand before my mouth, and I could not halloo - they tore my coat with pulling my hands from holding my pocket; they dispersed when they had got my money - it happened near the Bishopsgate-street end of Rose-lane; I am certain Field is the man who held my left arm - I do not know Meeking; I have seen none of the property except the chain - no blows were struck.</p>

I did not, except at the time they robbed me; it happened about half-past one o'clock - I had dined at my lodging, in Wormwood-street, at five, and had a glass of warm rum-and-water, and perhaps a glass of porter; I left home at half-past nine - I am not well acquainted with town; I went to call on a Mr. Ross, who was ill - he lives near Finsbury-square;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080029"/>I did not know his house - I was directed to a baker, who showed it to me; I cannot remember whether I drank any thing there - I swear I did not drink a bottle of wine there; I do not think I took any thing - I left about half-past eleven o'clock, and was going to a Mr. McDonald, in the Commercial-road, but could not find his house; I then returned directly home - I went to a tavern in Fenchurch-street before I went to Mr. Ross, and may have had two glasses of rum-and-water there: I could swear it was not three - I only paid 1s. there: I was at no other public-house - I drank nothing at Mr. Ross to the best of my recollection, and am sure I had no wine; I did not state at the office that I was intoxicated - I denied that I was; I swear I was not on the step of a door, except when these people were holding me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How many times were you at the office? A. Five - my examination was written down the last time; I gave my right name at the second examination.</p>

            . I live in Wentworth-street - I saw the people in Rose-lane, standing round a gentleman, who was rather intoxicated; I saw one lift up his arm - I do not know who it was, as it was dark; I did not see them take any thing - I saw one man with a brown guard-chain in his hand; it was just like the one produced - the gentleman had no bat on; he was asleep on the step of a door when I saw him - five or six were round him; he appeared to be asleep, because his hands were on his face, and his elbows on his knees; he made no noise, nor resistance - he appeared to be asleep - I was coming home, and met Reynolds; he and I went up, and saw this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did any body come up after you? A. No; I have known Field some years - I saw him come up backwards and forwards two or three times; I did not see him take any thing from the man, but we kept at a distance from them - I did not rouse the man, as there were five or six; they might have struck me, or something.</p>

            . On the night in question I was in Fashion-street, near Rose-lane; I heard a person cry Robbery! and Murder! I ran into Rose-lane, and saw the prosecutor standing up, with a parcel of women holding his hands; there were four or five women, I suppose - they were encouraging each other to take something out of his pocket; there was no man there that I particularly noticed at that moment, but there might have been; I do not know whether Meeking was there: when I got there I picked up a hat, and put it on the gentleman's head; it was laying in the kennel - I turned round, and saw a person very much like Field with a black pocket-book in his hand; he opened it, shook it, and said, "My friends, there arn't a bl-y mag in it;" he and another man enticed the prosecutor up to the top of Fashion-street, and asked him for something to drink; they brought him up to the door of a private house, and said, "This is a public-house, let us have something to drink;" the prosecutor put his hands into his pockets, and gave them three or four halfpence; I think it was the prisoner took them - they both said, "Good night, my friend;" I did not see them do any thing to his pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure it was to two men he gave the halfpence? A. There were two men together - I was not at the Queen's Head; I swear I never said Field was not the man - he is as much like the man as I ever saw: I never said the prosecutor offered me 5l. to swear to Field - I said if I could swear to him the inspector would make it as good as 5l. to me; the inspector of the Police told me so.</p>

               <p>THOMAS SINDRY. I am beadle of the parish. I heard the prisoner give the account of the child as Drinkwater has stated; I went to a court opposite a gin-shop, in Rosemary-lane, but could find nobody named Atkinson - the prisoner did not say where she herself lived; I made inquiry, and found out the prosecutor.</p>

On the 1st of June the two prisoners came and asked me for some bonnet ribbons - I showed them some, but they did not like them; I then produced a basket of ribbons - they chose one, and told me to cut off two yards, which came to 6d.; they had but 51/2d. between them - they told me to put the money and the ribbon by, and they would call again for it; they then went out, and a young man went after them, but I did not know what for - I have since seen two pieces of ribbons, which are part of what had been in the basket; the shop-mark is on them - I had not sold either of them to the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.How long was it before you saw them? A. Not an hour; there were some other customers in the shop; there might have been forty- I believe there were persons on the opposite side of the shop.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutors. I saw Robertson lay the corner of her shawl on the counter, where I saw a piece of pearl-white ribbon; she then drew her shawl off the counter, and I missed the ribbon at the same time - the prisoners then went out; I followed them out of the door - I there took hold of Robertson, and said she must come back; I did not charge her with any thing at that time - this piece of pearl-white ribbon was picked up in the kennel, about a yard from where she was; I then took hold of Milton, and this piece of green ribbon fell from under her arm - I saw the end of it under her arm, and the roll fell on the pavement; these ribbons have our shop-marks on them - I took the prisoners<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080032"/>to the passage, and Robertson went down on her knees; I think it was about twelve yards from the door that the green ribbon fell down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not go into the street, and charge them with having taken the ribbon? A.No; Robertson did not throw open her shawl, and say, "I have no property of yours;" I am certain of that - I did not ask her for the length of white ribbon; I am not aware that I swore that before the Magistrate - this is my signature; I believe this deposition was read over to me, but it is not correctly taken - it is a very bad systemed office; Milton was about three yards from the door when the end of the ribbon was under her arm, and the roll in the street - the end of the shawl covered the pearl ribbon; it might fall on the counter, and be over the goods - Miss Day was directly before them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When the ribbon was picked up a yard from Robertson, was Milton as near to it as she was? A. No - if it had been swept down by the shawl it would have fallen in the shop, and it was picked up two yards out of the shop; the ribbon was taken up in their presence, and given to me before they were taken to the watch-house.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>RICHARD STANTON. I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 8th of July I saw Welch walking down from the hall-door, with two coats on his arm - Pulling was outside the premises, twenty or thirty yards from the door, and could not see the coats hanging in the hall from where he stood; I went out at the gate, and saw the coats in the possession of Pulling, but I did not see Welch give them to him - there was a third person with them; I followed directly, and inquired what they had done with the coats -I had lost sight of them for about a minute and a half: I then saw Pulling with the coats, and the third man, who is not here; they ran, and I secured the two prisoners, and gave charge of them - I left the coats where they dropped them, outside the premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How far were you from Welch when you first saw him? A.Between twenty and thirty yards; I was gathering some peas in the garden, and saw Welch coming from the hall door - there was a shrub between us, four or five feet high; when I saw Welch again the other man had the coats.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Had you a view of the person carrying the coats, before the shrubs intercepted your sight? A. Yes, and then he passed nearer to me; it was Welch who was in the garden - I have no doubt about it: the man who got away was different in appearance.</p>

I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's lodging - I told him I had a search-warrant to search for property belonging to Mr. Perrottet, his master - he said, "I have no articles belonging to him;" these articles were then found - the prisoner said they were all his own, and part of the tools he had brought from Birmingham with him; there were a great many other things there.</p>
               <p>MR. PERROTTET. I was in the habit of using these tools, and seeing them in my shop; these pieces of mother-o'-pearl were in a drawer, which I opened almost every day - one or two of these pieces have been worked upon; I helped to make part of this - this tool fits my lathe exactly; the prisoner had a lathe, but I did not try it to that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you swear to these rough pieces of mother-o'-pearl? A. Yes, they have been more than two years in my drawer; these are tools commonly used - there is no mark on them; I know them by using them from time to time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw any thing of this kind in his shop; I had been in business before I came from Birmingham - he allowed me to take those two needle-books home one night to forward them.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080036"/>Cross-examined. Q. How long had the prisoner been engaged there? A. I think from February 1829; he had a salary of 150l. a year, with an allowance of 10l. for errors, by which losses might accrue to himself; that is the usual course in the common law department - I do not know of the prisoner having agreed with the prosecutors to allow him a third of any business he brought to the office; but it was the custom if a clerk introduced any business, to allow him a gratuity, which was generally at the rate of about a third; the prisoner introduced several clients - I know of no engagement but the regular rule of the office - the prisoner left about March, 1830; his salary was paid up to the 27th of February, 1830, and after that his attendance at the office was very irregular - there was no ascertained sum of money due to him, (at the time he left,) for business he had introduced; I believe something was said about some money - I cannot tell whether there was eleven months of the 10l. a year due to him; I have heard of a notice to produce a bond, executed by Mr. Cuer and the prisoner; but I have not brought it - I saw the bond this morning in Mr. Johnson's hand; I know Mr. Cuer - the prisoner left his disbursement-book behind him, when he went away; I have heard that he went into the service of Mr. Martin, in Red Lion-square - I understood he was taken in his office; I had seen him three or four times after he left the prosecutors -Mr. Cuer came to the office several times; Mr. Mayhew might have been there sometimes - but I do not recollect it; I remember going into the prisoner's accounts with Mr. Cuer after the prisoner had left.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. MAYHEW. Q. Is this receipt the prisoner's writing? A. I believe it is - I spoke to him about this money of Topp's, and he admitted having received it; I said Mr. Topp had been and said he had paid him 7l., which was to be paid into Court off the 9l. 7s.; I had spoken to him about Mr. Topp's money before, and he said he had not got it; that caused me to write to Mr. Topp.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was it you spoke to the prisoner? A. I had spoken to him repeatedly after the 10th of January, 1829, and then after Mr. Topp had been - I said he had been, and said he had paid the prisoner, and he said he had - I kept speaking to him about Mr. Dance's money up to the very hour he left; and he always declared he had not paid it - the 26l. was on account of Tebby's insolvency; I directed the prisoner to apply for it, on my account, as I had accounted to my client at Coventry for it, as received by me - I never allowed the prisoner to retain 26l. from the 10th of July to the middle of March; I called on Mr. Cuer to make good the prisoner's deficiencies - I suppose it was eight or nine months after that before I took steps to prosecute him, as I discovered he had kept counsel fees and other things; I then said "Let me see every thing you have done, and we will see what can be done;" he discovered every thing except the 26l. and the 23l. 6s. - I discovered that his security was not available to make good his deficiencies after seven or eight months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find out that before you preferred the indictment against the prisoner? A. No, I think afterwards - I cannot tell whether I had any bills of exchange from Mr. Cuer, but I believe there were; I took an assignment of Mr. Cuer's equity of redemption, and I released him from any demand we might have upon him under that bond, but I afterwards refused to give up the bond - I have it still, in case there should be any further demand; I make no doubt but the 7l. was included in the account with Mr. Cuer, and the 23l. 6s. and the 26l. - I did not take the prisoner before a Magistrate; I did not tell a person who applied to know the charge, that if the law would not tell him I would not; I said the indictment would tell the charge before the Grand Jury, because they were sitting at the time: I recollect a friend of the prisoner's applying to me on the subject of this charge, and I recollect saying that the premiums which had been assigned to me had been put up for sale, and they would not pay the money they were mortgaged for; that was after I had preferred the indictment - I had no conversation with any one before; I discovered the embezzlement of the 23l. 6s. when my client came to me, which was, I think, six or seven months after the prisoner left me - I did not then know where the prisoner lived; I thought he was in no service; I went to Mr. Martin's, in Fitzroy-street, and there I found the prisoner - I never went to Mr. Martin's, in Red Lion-square; I asked Mr. Lock where the prisoner was, and he said he was in Mr. Martin's employ - I thought he had gone there, as he was in the habit of doing, to make up some work; I had not then discovered the whole of these deficiences, only monies that I said I would forgive if he made discoveries; I cannot think Mr. Martin would allow him to stay there after what I told him.</p>
               <p>The bond was here put in and read, and the agreement for the 10l.</p>

On the 3rd of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was going home, and had got within one hundred yards of my own door - the prisoner ran across the street, and took hold of my left arm, which was towards her; my purse was in my left-hand waistcoat pocket - there were 24s. or 25s. in silver in it and five sovereigns; she held my arm so violently that I could not get rid of her - when we got about twenty or thirty yards further, which was about half-way between where she first accosted me and my own door, she quitted me, and ran up one of the courts; I missed my purse, and ran after her - she went up one or two courts, and came back again to the court she first ran up; I came up to her there - she was stopping, and seemed to be secreting something; two sovereigns fell from her on the pavement, and the purse was in her hand - I took the purse, and part of the silver was in it, but none of the sovereigns; there was some silver in her pocket, which, with what was in the purse about made up the quantity I had in my purse - I went with her to the Police-office, where she was searched; I should think about a minute and a half had elapsed from the time of her first running and my taking her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What time was this? A. I should think it wanted a quarter to twelve o'clock - I very frequently take a walk round Lincoln's Inn-fields; I did not speak to her first - I only told her to go about her business; I did go twenty or thirty yards with her, but I must have knocked her down if I had not; she did not accuse me of soliciting her; I dare say she asked me to go with her, or something of that kind - I told her to go about her business twice or thrice; I had taken fast hold of her when the Policeman came up; she did not state, in my presence, that I had given her the silver: my purse was in my pocket, as it is now, and the only way she could have got it was with the hand that was through my arm; I did not go into any court with her - when she was first taken she said she had not so much as would purchase a glass of gin; I can only account for the money being in her pocket by her putting it in as she ran away - she did not say that I had given her the five shillings, and that the seven shillings in her pocket she had got to pay a bill for a woman named Bryan - I think I had seen the prisoner before: I judge that by her person, not her voice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did the purse contain? A. Five sovereigns and about 24s., as near as I can calculate; I recovered two sovereigns and the silver, the purse was in her hand.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search every part of her? A. Yes: I cannot exactly say how much money I found in her pocket - she said the money in her pocket was her own; she said so in the presence of Mr. Dixon, and she said it all through - but she said at first that she had not the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080039"/>price of a glass of gin; I searched every place about there for the three sovereigns, but I could not find them; the prisoner did not mention the name of Mrs. Bryan - the inspector asked her address; I do not know whether she gave it right or not, I did not go to it, - it was Fetter-lane, but I do not recollect the number - she did not say who she lived with.</p>

               <p>ELEANOR TITTERTON. I am the wife of George Titterton; we live at <placeName id="t18310908-55-crimeloc324">57, Exmouth-street</placeName>

Last Friday week I was at home with my two children, and had three people at work in the workshop at the back of the yard; about five o'clock in the afternoon, or a little after, I called the prisoner to get tea, and heard a dreadful noise in the kitchen - I went down, and she laid there apparently in a fit, whether she was really so or not I cannot tell; the cry must have been heard by any person in the house - I went up to my bed-room on the first floor, to fetch her some brandy, and on opening the door I saw smoke; it was so great I did not see from what part of the room it came - I did not see a blaze; I saw it afterwards - it was put out by the inspector and serjeant of the Police; it had burnt the bed in part, the blankets, sheets, and a wool mattress, a chair, and several articles of apparel, but not the whole of any thing; the blankets,&amp;c. were on the bed - the wearing-apparel, when I left the room, was part on a chair, and part on the bed; a small part of the floor was seorched, which might have been done by the clothes falling from the chair; whether the wood-work of the floor had been on fire I cannot tell - I had not heard any body in the room; I was there for about ten minutes, about three o'clock, and all was safe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080040"/>then; there had been an alarm about the kitchen chimney being on fire about two o'clock, and the prisoner helped Mr. Titterton to put it out - Jesse Davis, who was at work in the back shop, had given that alarm; there had been a disagreement between the prisoner and me on the Wednesday, and on the previous night I gave her warning to quit on the Wednesday - she did not use any particular expression then; she had gone out without leave.</p>
               <p>Q. If she meant to burn the house, can you conceive any motive besides the words on the Thursday night? -A. No; she never threatened me in any way.</p>
               <p>JOHN BUSAIN. I am an inspector of the Police - I went to this house with the serjeant and constable; I got there a little after six o'clock, I think - I went up stairs, and found the back bed-room on fire; the blaze was ascending from the top of the bed and about the bed, about three inches high; there were no curtains nor hangings to the bed - the cane bottom of a chair, about a foot and a half from the bed, was burnt out; there were fragments of wearing apparel burning on it - I produce a piece of the floor that was burnt; that was all the damage that was done to the floor - it is deal wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose the wood itself has been in a blaze? A. No, I will not say that it has; it was immediately under the chair, and might be occasioned by the burning clothes falling on it; the chair was on fire when I entered, and the back nearly burned - the clothes were burning on this part of the floor when I went in; I threw water on the chair and put it out; this is the only damage done to the house, except that the door which was near the bed was scorched - there is hardly a doubt on my mind but if it had not been put out it would have set the house on fire, either by communication with the floor, or the chair communication with the closet, which contained a dozen or twenty pounds of candles; the chair was close to the closet - the bed was on fire; I extinguished the whole of that, and then saw the prisoner - this was about ten or fifteen minutes after I arrived - she was in the back kitchen, and appeared labouring under intoxication, and pretended fits - it was pretence, in my judgment.</p>
               <p>MRS. TITTERTON. The chair with the clothes on it was near the closet when I was in the room; I keep my candles in that closet - the prisoner knew they were there- the cupboard is locked occasionally, and I think it was so then.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOOTMAN. I am a Policeman. I went with Busain, and found the bed on fire, and the chair - I did not notice whether any part of the floor was burnt - I saw the prisoner in the kitchen as soon as I entered the house; she was stretched on the floor, screaming and hallooing, and when the serjeant left me in the kitchen, to take care of her, she was sitting in a chair, and cried for George - I asked what she wanted him for; she made no answer, and presently afterwards she said, "What shall my mistress say? Oh dear! what shall I do?" she called for George again - I asked what she wanted him for; she said the house was on fire, and to save the children - I said the fire was out, there was no fear of the children; there was a smell of fire, and the house was all in a smoke at the time; she afterwards called for George again - I said, "Here he is, what do you want him for?" she then held up her head, which was down before, looked about, and said, "He is not here;" he was not there.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police. I went with Busain - I got there, to the best of my recollection, about five o'clock; the boy went up and opened the back bed-room door; the smoke was so strong he shut it again; Busain opened it - the room was full of smoke; we extinguished it a little with water; the smoke having disappeared, I could see fire on both sides of the bed, and in the middle of the bed; the fire on the left side was nearer the head than the other part; there was fire at the foot of the bed, and on a chair which stood by the fire-place, about two feet from the bed, and another chair at the foot of the bed was also burnt.</p>
               <p>Q.Might not the fire have communicated from the bed to that chair? A. I think not: I saw fire in six places; a piece of the floor was burnt - I think that had been done by the clothes falling off the chair; the floor had been on fire, but I did not notice it on fire; it was under the chair, and might have been done by the flames from the clothes which was burning on the ground, and had fallen from the chair; it might be done without setting the wood itself on fire.</p>

On Thursday, the 14th of July, he passed the end of the street, near my house - I went out, and sent my little girl to call him back; he came back part of the way - I went to meet him, and begged him to go home; he seemed quite wet and uncomfortable; he said he would not go home, and told me to go home, and he would not trouble me any more; he went away, and I followed him at a distance into Whitechapel - I was about one hundred yards behind him - I missed him in Whitechapel, and waited there some time, then looked into the Blind Beggar public-house, and saw him sitting there; I called him out - he came out; I asked him to go home - he said he would not - that he would not be yellowed any more - that he would be a pauper on the public - I again begged of him to go home, saying, I would go with him, and beg him off; yellowing is a punishment at the hospital; he said he would never go home any more - I told him I was afraid if he did not return he would go to prison, and he had better submit to any punishment at Greenwich, than go to prison; he then asked if I was going to give him any thing - I said No, I had enough to do to find his children; he then walked on with me, and seemed very much agitated - I felt afraid, and shifted from side to side; this was in Whitechapel-road; and when we came between <placeName id="t18310908-57-crimeloc334">Colt-street</placeName>

               <p>Q.What was the blow given with? A. I could not ascertain I was so frightened - it came from him, for no other person was near; as I stood looking at him, after I received the blow, he said he meant to die himself - but he would kill me first; I ran back in my fright to Colt-street, saying "Will no one stop him" - he was taken, and I was lead over to the London-hospital; he was in liquor; I have seen him on other occasions, when he has been intoxicated, and taken precautions - for when he is in liquor, he seems not quite right in his head; the smallest quantity of liquor seems to take effect on him, and when he had no liquor he used to ramble from his family, and has been two months from the college, without any body knowing where he was, and not always in his right mind when sober - he appeared to have had a little liquor when I first saw him, but he answered more reasonable - he said he had had half a pint of ale at the Blind Beggar, and seemed more angry then than when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long had he been in the navy? A. Twenty-one years - I do not know of his being wounded in the head, but he has been to St. Helena, and was very bad on the voyage, and seemed much reduced in his constitution; he always seemed uncomfortable and wrangling when not in liquor; if I had not sent after him that day he would not liave called.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you not some high words on the road before he cut you? A. It was my urging him so against his will to return to Greenwich made him quite angry - I was not going to take him to the Police-office - there was a warrant against him, and I said he had better go home than to prison - I did not pull or push him - I never put a hand on him; I should have been glad to get out of his way - the would has not injured my constitution at all; I soon recovered, I was discharged on the Saturday from the hospital - when taken before the Magistrate, he was fined 5l. for the assault, and afterward held to bail; I said it was not in his power to get bail, and then the Magistrate settled that he was to be sent to Greenwich; I said I wished nothing more - he in fifty-nine years old.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On former occasions have you put sharp instruments out of his way? Yes, I have done so six times; he formerly begged me to put every thing out of his way, in case he should do me mischief - I have put knives and a razor out of his way; he was in his right mind when he desired me to do so - it was while he was living with me; he returned from St. Helena seventeen years ago, and was paid off.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Bleeding might take place if it merely passed through the skin? A. Yes, without passing entirely through the integuments - it was exceedingly slight - it was an incised wound; my impression is that the integuments were cut through - the outher integuments were cut, and it bled.</p>

Bank-notes, thirty-eight sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns in my purse, and one sovereign loose in my pocket; the Bank notes were in my breast pocket - I did not lose them; the gold was in my left-hand breeches pocket -I opened my purse on my way to the bridge, and at that time put the notes into my breast pocket; I buttoned up my pocket tight a few minutes before I got to the bridge, and the moment I got there - I was on the top of the step- I and my childern were surrounded, and the prisoner, who was among a number of others who surrounded me, pressed between me and my little child, got between up, and separated us - their pressing against me, drew my attention from my pocket - I preceived my pocket much lighter than it was; I put my hand to it, and the purse and money were gone - one of my childern saw the loose sovereign on the steps; I am sure at least six persons surrounded me - I am certain of the prisoner; he was under my left arm, directly at the side of my pocket from which the sovereigns were taken - I told my eldest child to take care of the childern while I followed the prisoner, who, I was sure, had robbed me; I followed him at a few yards' distance, as near as the crowd would let me, and was looking out for an officer - the moment I saw one I gave him in charge; he might have gone one hunderd yards from where I was robbed; I have not found my purse or money- he said nothing to the charge; I took my eldest daughter to the Computer to see him a few hours after.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many other persons were on the bridge? A.

               <p>Q. Have you ever gone out to fish for pickpockets? A. Yes - I have been endeavouring to find the other five; I believe I said at Guildhall that I lost upwards of thirtyfive sovereigns, but have since counted my money, and discovered that it was thirty-eight sovereigns and two half-sovereigns - I never swore I lost forty sovereigns; I should recollect three of the others if I saw them twelve months hence - Bickerton was one of the six, to the best of my recollection.</p>

I was with him on the steps of the bridge, nearest to the shore; three more of my father's family were with us - they are younger than me; I saw five or six men surround him - I then saw one of them get under my father's arm; he was nearest to my father's person - I could not see what was done, for the men pushed us; directly they were gone my father said he was robbed - I looked at the persons who had left him; I observed the features of the man who was under his arm before he left, and am certain it was the prisoner - I saw him again at Guildhall; I was not present when the constable took him - I went with my father to the Compter the same evening; he was in custody there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On your oath, did you see that man at the Compter? A. Yes - I saw him at Guildhall the night of the robbery; the Compter is at Guildhall - I was at Guildhall the next day; I saw the prisoner the same night as the robbery, but I forgot that - I was very much frightened when it happened; I know the prisoner is the man- there was a great rush of people; I did not have all my sisters to hold - there were three of the family with us; the youngest was six years old - my father was looking after her; I cannot say what handkerchief the prisoner had on.</p>

            . I was sworn as a special-constable, to act on the bridge. I was on the bridge, and saw the prisoner there - I did not see the prosecutor till after I had the prisoner, who I immediately took, on seeing him draw his hand from a person's pocket; Mr. Barrowcliff immediately came up, and charged him with robbing him of a purse and sovereigns - I cannot recollect how many sovereigns he mentioned; the prisoner made no answer to the charge - he was taken to the Compter, examined next day, and committed; when I first saw him he was in company with others, and went away to a person who gave him in charge, and whose pocket I saw him draw his hand out of; he was searched, but nothing was found on him -I had not seen him near the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you to be sworn in? A.Because I applied for it - I was a constable of Bow-street, but not a regular one; I hold two Bow-street warrants now - I was transferred to the new Police, and was charged with being drunk, but it was not true - I was dismissed; I heard Mr. Barrowcliff make a charge against a person who he thought was one of the men, but I did not attend to what he said, as that was not a case of mine; I dare say there were a thousand people on the bridge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to see the sight, like other people; the bridge was much crowded - I was taken by the officers, but knew nothing of the charge.</p>

            . I hold a situation in Doctors'-commans, as clerk, and have been there nearly twenty years. I went to see His Majesty open the bridge - I did not see the prosecutor there; he charged me at Guildhall as being one of the gang concerned in robbing him of forty sovereigns and somethings more - he positively stated that I was one of the party, that he was positive of it; I have brought on action against him - I was only a few hours in custody, and discharged by the Alderman; I had no knowledge of his being robbed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the prisoner? A. I never saw him till he was at Guildhall - I had been out that evening, and was taken up as being disorderly; I swear the prosecutor positively swore I was one of the gang, but the Alderman discharged me - Mr. Armstrong, my principal, came forward, and gave me a twenty years' character.</p>

            . I am a City officer, and was in Smithfield; a lady came to me about a quarter to four o'clock, and told me something - I followed after the prisoner, who she described to me; she placed herself by the side of Mrs. Bailey, and had not stood many minutes before she put her left hand outside Mrs. Bailey's clothes, raised the pocket up, put her right hand into the pocket, and with her right hand the purse came out; I allowed her to go a yard or so, and said, "Now, my good woman, you must give me hold of that purse;" I seized her hand, and the purse fell to the ground - she said," My good man, what do you want with me?" I said, "Never mind, you shall know;" Mrs. Bailey turned round, and saw me take up the purse.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did not Mrs. Bailey tell you she had pulled out her handkerchief, and it might have dropped out? A.She did, but I saw it taken; Mrs. Bailey said at Guildhall she supposed it was ten minutes before that she took out her handkerchief, and not on that spot; I had the prisoner and purse before Mrs. Bailey knew she was robbed - she did not say she might have dropped it till she got to the Compter; I then told her I saw it taken - I had been observing the prisoner for about five minutes - there was a crowd; I was obliged to get another officer to help me - I told my brother officer I saw it taken; I am a special officer, sworn in for the fair.</p>
               <p>MRS. BAILEY. This is my purse.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was there another officer there? A. Yes; Bignall told me the woman had robbed me, and taken my purse out of my pocket - I told him on the spot that I might have dropped it.</p>

Yes; he did not say it was not all right, but he would explain it to Mr. Parsons - the prosecutor was indited to drink a little more than he ought somtimes - he was sober the day he gave this money out, and the day following, I think; I never heard Mr. Parsons tell him he might purchase some clothes, as he looked very ragged and distressed, and I am sure it was never intended - the prisoner staid away two or three days, which excited suspicion, and when he came he was very much intoxicated; the last day he came was Thursday - he breakfasted with Mr. Parsons; he did take up the bill for 18l. - I do not know of his being at any races, where he was knocked down and ill-used, nor did I hear him mention it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. There was another man with him? A. Yes, who turned out to be a servant of the prosecutors' - the prisoner did not say London had employed him till he got to the station; I ascertained the next morning, that the prisoner and London both worked at one cotton factory.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you a man named London in your employ? A. Yes, we have lost sight of him; I believe this cotton to be ours, but I would not swear to it - we have two manufactories, but only one for the manufacture of wadding; I expect this was taken from Cooper-street, City-road - London had access to the property.</p>
               <p>THOMAS METCALFE. I am foreman to the prosecutors. I have examined the cotton, and believe it to be theirs; I suspected that some cotton was missing - this bag, in which it was found, is similar to ours, and I believe is one of ours.</p>

Yes; I found the bales reduced faster than I expected, from what was manufactured; we employ forty persons or more - I generally give out the cotton, and it is open to all up stairs; London and the prisoner both knew the premises.</p>

Yes, the prosecutor and two gentlemen, who are not here - I had counted the fifteen persons in the gang; there were thousands of persons in the street- I took fast hold of the prisoner's hands, and held them up, but in the attempt at rescue the key and ribbon might be taken from him without my seeing it - the ribbon appeared a dark colour; I saw no seal, only a key.</p>

I said, "Nearly twelve;" he said, "Let us look," and immediately took it from me - the prisoner immediately seized me by my right arm, and said, "Come along, I want to get home, it is wet;" I said, "Where are your friends? they have got my watch;" he said, "They will be here in a minute;" he immediately put his hand into my waistcoat pocket, and took the remaining money which I had - it was four half-crowns, and 1s, or 1s. 6d.</p>

            , who lives at Teddington. On the 31st of June last I wrote nine letters, by desire of my father, in answer to advertisements in the Times respecting servants - I directed eight of the letters; they were addressed to initials - I gave them to my father.</p>

            . On the 30th of June my son wrote these letters by my direction - I sealed them, and on the next morning (Friday, the 1st of July,) gave them to my son, Ambrose, with 2s. 6d. to pay the postage; I went to three of the places where I had appointed meetings, and none of the servants came.</p>

               <p>AMBROSE WILLY. On the 1st of July I received nine letters from my father, with half a crown; I took them to the post-office, and saw a little girl at the door - she called Aunt! and the prisoner came; I will not be sure she is the woman - it was a stouter woman, I think, but I gave that person the letters, and the half-crown; I do not recollect whether I said any thing - the postage came to 2s. 3d.; I waited a few minutes while she stamped one or two of the letters - I then left, and forgot the change; I went back in about an hour, and got the change from a woman - I do not recollect whether it was the same person; I stopped at the door on my donkey - she brought the change out to me directly; I took the letters to the post-office about seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you sure it was not near eight o'clock when you got there with them? A. I do not know; I went directly I got them from my father - our house is about a quarter of a mile from the post-office - I do not know whether I was known there; I did not see the postman come in - when I returned for my change; I did not say who I was - I stopped outside, and asked for 3d. which I had forgotten, and she gave it to me.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLY. I gave the letters to my son about seven o'clock - I have seen the prisoner at the post-office at Teddington; she had a niece there - I sent my son back about nine o'clock for the threepence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner knew who you were? A. Perfectly well; I have lived there six years- my family are very likely known there.</p>

            . I am a letter-carrier. I carry the letters from Teddington receiving-house to Twickenham - Mr. Edwards kept the receiving-house at Teddington; the prisoner generally acted for him - she used to take the letters out of the box, and stamp them by the time I came, and give them to me, with the postage; on Friday, the 1st of July, I received the unpaid letters, and two paid letters, with 6d.; I remember it well, because Mr. Willy called on me about it on the following Monday; this is the bill which I received on the 1st of July, (looking at it) - I put down on it "Seven unpaid, and two paid, 6d.;" it is dated the 31st of June, but I did not date it - here is the entry of a money letter on it; I have seen the prisoner write, and believe that entry to be her writing - the letters were taken out of the box at the time I went, and laid on a table; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080056"/>prisoner gave me the 6d. - I took all the letters which I received to Twickenham, with this bill; Mr. Willy made some inquiries on the Monday of me - I immediately went to the post-office, to the prisoner - nobody else was present; I asked if she remembered receiving nine letters from Mr. Willy on Friday morning; she said she remembered receiving nine letters from Mr. Willy's son, but it was on Saturday morning, not Friday - I said I was sure they did not go on Friday morning, nor on Saturday, for I should have remembered them going through my hands - I do not remember, during the eight years I have fetched them, having so many paid letters in a morning; the afternoon delivery contains general-post letter - she said she was quite sure it was on Saturday morning, and it was as long back as Saturday week; I said I had not the slightest recollection of the letters myself - I had seen Mr. Willy at my house about seven o'clock, and got to the post-office about half-past seven o'clock; I should be there a quarter before eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you in the habit of filling up the columns in the bill? A. Yes, my predecessor had done it - the prisoner was always by me when I made out the bill, when at home, and was so on the 1st of July, when I did it; she said, at the post-office, where there was an examination, that her niece was present, and heard her observe to me "What a number of paid letters there are to-day;" that this was the morning the nine letters were brought - I know her niece was not in the room on the Friday morning - she might have been standing at the door; she certainly did not make that observation to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you always very punctual to your time of half-past eight in the morning? A. Yes, in my collection; I sometimes got the prisoner to deliver letters for me - I paid her for it; I have got others to do it- I do not drink till after my duty is over - I have got a man named Kembly to deliver letters for me; I may have been drunk once or twice during the time I have been at Teddington, and he has delivered letters for me when I had a friend whom I wished to be with - the evening collection is at three o'clock - I was never at the office so late as ten o'clock at night; I dare not leave in the morning till a quarter before eight o'clock - I was in the house on the 1st of July at a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning; I was there perhaps about five minutes before I received the letters; I did not state that I was in a hurry - the prisoner was standing by the table when I went in; I did not see these letters brought - I will swear the niece was not in the room; my regular time to be at Twickenham is twenty minutes before nine; it is better than a mile and a half from Teddington - I was there in time that morning.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not take the letters and stamp some of them yourself? A. I did not on that morning - I have done so: I heard the niece say at the post-office, and at Bow-street, that her aunt had observed to me what a number of paid letters there were; I remember one very wet day in the winter getting Stevens, the watchman, to deliver a letter at Dr. Vint's, which is opposite his box - I cannot say whether the two paid letters on the 1st of July were directed to initials.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not take the letters off the counter, professing to be in a hurry, and carry them away? A. I did not; I received the prisoner's salary for her, and she had said, "Let me have 1l., I do not want the rest till my rent is due; if I have not got it I cannot pay it away;" about six months ago she said her rent was due to-morrow, and she should be obliged to me for the money; I unfortunately had not got it in my pocket, but she had it, I believe, next day; I had received it about a fortnight - she did not threaten to complain to the post-office of me.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q.Where do you receive the money? A. We receive an order from the office to pay it out of the money we collect; it sometimes takes a week to collect what we have to pay, which is three offices - she had 8l. a year; I was sober on the morning of the 1st of July, and employed nobody to deliver any letters.</p>
               <p>Q. On what morning did the little girl say this conversation had passed? A.She did not say it was not on the Friday morning.</p>

It is the duty of the letter-carriers to bring all the Teddington letters to me - I take them is my hand, compare them with the bill, then make a fresh bill, which I send with the old one: I receive the letters from three offices, and send three bills with my own - this bill (looking at it) was made out on the 1st of July; the Teddington letters that morning were seven unpaid and two paid, and the postage 6d. - I received no others from Teddington that morning; I never remember so many as nine paid letters coming from Teddington - Weal mentioned this circumstance to me on the Monday, and I certainly should have recollected so many paid letters, if they had been brought within four or five days; Weal has been the Teddington carrier about eight years - I believe he was punctual that morning; I know nothing against his not being in time generally.</p>

            . I am one of the presidents of the Twopenny Post-office. On Saturday, the 9th of July, I went to Teddington; I saw the prisoner - I said I had come from the Post-office, in consequence of an inquiry made by Mr. Willy, and asked if she remembered receiving nine letters from his son on the 1st of July; she said she did remember receiving the letters, but thought it was before that period - I said, "What did you do with them?" she said, "Sent them to the office;" I said, "That is impossible, for on the morning in question there are only two letters entered," and for a week previous there were not any letters to correspond with that number - I produced the bill, which she looked at, and said, "The figures are not my hand-writing," that Weal had put them; I said that was extremely improper, against the positive instructions, and I should say no more till Weal was present - I left, and returned about a quarter before three o'clock, with Weal, and asked him, in the prisoner's presence, whether he had received that number of letters; he said he had not - I asked how he came to put the figures in the bill; he said they were frequently in a hurry, and the letters were not always ready when he called; that he had been in the practice of doing so, and his predecessor also - the prisoner also said that it was in consequence of his being in a hurry that he put them there, but did not admit that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080057"/>he always did it; she said she was quite sure that all letters she received she gave him, but she could not be quite sure on what morning these came - I told her nine letters were an unusual number, and could she recollect having paid him any particular sum of money; she said she could not, but all the money, and all the letters she had received she gave him - on Thursday, the 14th, she was at the Post-office; the solicitor had her into his room - he first cautioned her not to say any thing to prejudice herself, but that she might answer what questions she thought proper, and that the answers she made might be brought in evidence against her; he wrote down what she stated, and I witnessed and signed it - this is it (looking at it) - (read)</p>

            . I am the daughter of Joseph Edwards of Teddington. The prisoner (my aunt) lived with us; I recollect Mr. Willy's son bringing nine letters - I do not know that it was on the 1st of July; he put down half a crown and was to have 3d. change - I called my aunt down to him; he went away and afterwards came back on a donkey; I recollect Weal coming that morning, I do not know at what time - I was in the room against a chest of drawers: my aunt took the letters out of the box; Weal appeared in a hurry, I did not hear him say he was so - I think I saw him stamp the letters; I did not see the bill - I do not recollect his taking the letters up; it was about an hour after Willy's son had gone - I heard my aunt say to him, "There are a great many paid letters;" he must have heard her say that.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Were any of the letters stamped before little Willy left? A. Yes, but not all, for he went away without his change - I do not know how many my aunt had stamped; I saw her stamp them all afterwards, and put them into the box - it was the unpaid letters that Weal stamped; my aunt stood at the table when Weal was there - I did not see him writing, because his back was towards me; my aunt and him were standing side by side.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him with a pen and ink before him, I suppose? A. Yes, my aunt could see what he wrote; I remember Mr. Smith coming from the Post-office - I think I told my father and aunt before Mr. Smith came, that I had heard her observe, what a many paid letters there were - I heard my father talking something about it, and mentioned it; I am sure it was before Mr. Smith came; they said Mr. Willy had lost some letters - they did not say Weal had said so; it was about two days after the letters were brought there - it was on the Monday I am sure; it was on Monday morning, after Weal had been -I saw Mr. Weal there on the Saturday afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. On the morning Willy brought the letters must Weal have seen you, or were you hid? A. No - I stood against the drawers by the middle door, he did not speak to me; his back would have been to me ask he stood at the table - I told Mr. Smith what I have stated now.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GEENERAL. Q.What, when he first came? A. No, it was the second time; it was not by my aunt's desire, he asked me.</p>

On the 12th of July, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner pawned this silver watch, with two seals and a chain, for 4l. - I received information three days afterwards that it was stolen; I went to Bow-street, and was told to stop the party if any application was made for it - I met the prisoner in Cornhill as I went home, and gave him in charge; I understood him to say he had had it from a captain, merely out of a frolic, and he knew nothing about stealing it, that the person's name was Germain, and he had gone into the country; he told the Lord Mayor he was gone to Ipswich, and he was remanded to bring the person forward, but he never came.</p>

On the 13th of June, in the evening. I observed his coat hanging up, and having frequently missed property, I examined it, and found in it a quantity of incomplete gloves, which had been stolen from me - the prisoner afterwards returned to the warehouse; I told him he might leave for the evening - I followed him down stairs; on his getting out I called him back, and requested to inspect his pockets, in which I discovered the materials for three pairs of gloves - I asked him whose they were; he said they were mine, but it was the first offence he had been guilty of - I promised him forgiveness if he told me the whole truth, but he said that was his first offence; I requested the keys of his boxes, and gave him in charge - he delivered three keys to me; I asked him again, in the officer's presence, if that was his only offence - I went with Henman, the officer, to his lodgings, in a court leading from Farringdon-street to Snow-hill, and searched his drawers; I saw the officer apply the keys to the drawers, and in them he found upwards of three dozen' pairs of unmade leather gloves - there were four hundred and odd pieces, worth at least 3l.; I returned to my house, where the prisoner had been left in custody - the officer produced to him one of the three keys he had given me, and asked how he got possession of that key; he said he had found it - it was afterwards applied to a chest of drawers in my house, which contained clothes, and opened all the drawers in that chest; after he was in custody I went to Giltspur-street prison - I did not hold out any threat or promise to him; I said I was sorry to find a person in whom I had placed such confidence had committed such a breach, and was sorry I had not an opportunity of finding the receiver - he said he had been induced to steal the property from me, to support himself when out of employ.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you charge him before the Lord Mayor with stealing the leather contained in this indictment? A. I charged him first with stealing three pairs of gloves - this charge was made before the last Session; I gave my evidence before the Grand Jury in a general way, on the indictment for the three pairs of gloves - I stated the whole of the thefts to them, and understood I was dismissed; I did not go before them on the other indictment - he was tried for the gloves last Session, and discharged; I ordered the officer to detain him, and take him before the Lord Mayor on this charge; I found the pair of gloves named in this indictment at his lodgings, and I believe I named that before the Lord Mayor - he was tried last Session for those found in his coat; my servant on that trial swore he believed the marks on the tranks to be his, but he would not positively swear it was his mark; I positively swore it was his mark - he was admitted to bail after being detained; I have been to him once in prison since the last Session, and asked if he had been set at liberty on the Saturday, whether he meant to remain in town or go into the country - my motive was to know if I should rid myself of a person who had committed such extensive depredations on me; I should have persisted in this charge if he had gone into the country; he was a good workman; I produced a bit of ribbon before the Lord Mayor, but did not prefer a charge against him for that - I know the leather found to be mine; they have the marks of two of my men, King and another, on them.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You gave before the Grand Jury last time a general account of what you had lost, did you suppose you had given all the evidence required? A. I did; I did not mean to abstain from evidence on the other charges on any consideration; it was entirely an error on my part that I did not go before the Grand Jury on the other bills; finding they were ignored, I had him taken before a Magistrate, and stated the circumstance - he was bailed.</p>

I accompanied Mr. Watts to the prisoner's lodgings with three keys, which Mr. Watts gave me; I produced the keys to the prisoner, and asked him what they were; he said two of them belonged to his trunks, and the other to a drawer at his lodgings - I went to a house kept by Hodson in Sea-coal-lane, on Tuesday the 7th of June, about eight o'clock in the evening - Hodson showed me a chest of drawers, to which I applied two of the keys, and found a quantity of leather, which Mr. Watts identified; before I went I cautioned the prisoner, and told him if he had no more property of Mr. Watts', but the three pairs of gloves, Mr. Watts would fulfil the promise he had made, (as Mr. Watts told me he had made him a promise;) he then said there would be no more found, none whatever - there was nothing at his lodging, I might go and see; I did so, and found these thirty-eight pair of tranks, and a pair of made-up gloves; there was but one box and one drawer, at the prisoner's lodgings; I could find no use for the third key - I returned to Mr. Watts' house, and said to the prisoner, "You have stated wrong, you have not got two boxes" - he said,"I never said I had" - I said, "You did, what is the use of this key?" he said he had no use for it, that he had found it - he had told me two keys would open his boxes, and one his drawer; I applied the key he said he had found to a chest of drawers at Mr. Watts' house - it opened the whole of them.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know the lodging to be the prisoner's? A. He informed me he lodged there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the key fit the place the gloves were kept in? A. No; he told me I should find no property whatever of Mr. Watts' at his lodging.</p>
               <p>MR. WATTS. I know this leather to be my property; here is the mark made by the cutter, which I know perfectly well - there are two marks; I lost as many tranks as I found at the prisoner's lodging - there are the cutter's initials on the tranks; there is no mark on this pair of gloves, but I am certain they are mine - the prisoner was never a cutter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are all the tranks in the same state of manufacture? A. Yes, the marks are scraped out of some of them; here is a pair I have no doubt have been defaced - here is another with a K. on it, and something more; here is another mark of another cutter - King is the first cutter; his Christian name is John, I believe.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. On this pair here is a K., has that been attempted to be erased? A. I cannot think how it could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080061"/>be in this state, unless it had; King had been in my sole employ for about nine months.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Watts' service about six or seven weeks ago, as a cutter - I should not know my marks on the gloves, not to speak positively to them; (looking at a pair) I could not swear this is my mark.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. On your oath, do you believe that it is your mark? A. Why, it is like it; I believe it to be mine, to the best of my belief it is; it is the K. as I used to mark it, when employed by Mr. Watts.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have left Mr. Watts six or seven weeks, that must have been after this second charge was made? A. Yes; I was before the Lord Mayor six times about this, but not examined.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why did you leave Mr. Watts' employ? A.Because I received great insults from him, through not swearing to the mark at the last trial.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you not state to the officer, before the prisoner was charged with any offence, that you would swear to the marks on the gloves? A. I never did.</p>

             (examined by an interpreter.) On the 5th of June I went up to the garret, where the prisoner was employed blocking the caps - I found him with his back towards the door, pressing something into his hat; he put his hat on his head; I desired him to show what he had in it - he refused; I took his hat off, and these two skins, which belong to Messrs. Hyman Emanuel and Co., were in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Does Mr. Emanuel sell skins in this state? A. I do not interfere in the business - he makes caps of them; the prisoner was in his service last year, and came back again last May - there was no other person worked in the room; no one had any quarrel with the prisoner.</p>

A. I was not intoxicated.</p>
               <p>JOHN GROGAN. I have heard my wife's evidence - the prisoner was in the room; I put him out, and then fell asleep; when I awoke my wife informed me of the loss - I looked and missed all the property.</p>

On the 18th of August, at a quarter to three o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in Pollard-street, Bethnal-green - I observed something large before him, and asked what it was; he said, "Only a little flour;" I asked where he got it - he made no answer; I took him to Mr. Squirrel's, Pollard's-row - he had this bag in his apron, with 52 lbs. of flour.</p>

The prisoner had been nearly five years in my service - I had seen him on my premises not more than twenty minutes before he was stopped; this bag is not mine - I cannot speak to the flour; I had let him in that morning, and locked the two gates - when I came down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080063"/>in the morning I found these false keys in the gates, which led out the back-way, and was the way the prisoner was going; I saw nothing in his apron when he came in - my flour is kept in a loft, about two yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Had you ever seen those keys before? A. No; a widow and her daughter lodge in my house - the daughter has at times come home late; she would be let in at the street door, not at the back gates; I never found the prisoner in flour - he has bought flour of me.</p>

I slept in the same room with the prosecutor; the prisoner and the landlord's son slept in the same room - I got up at a quarter to seven o'clock that morning; the landlord's son got up at the same time - we left the prisoner in bed; there was then a basket on the prosecutor's trunk, and nothing seemed to be out of its place.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you let lodgings by the night? A. No, none are less than weekly lodgers; the prisoner came on the 22nd of June - when he came down he said,"My week's rent is up to-day?" I said, "No, not till tomorrow;" he just spoke as he went through, but did not stop - he must have had the property about him then, but I was busy; he had no bundle.</p>

The prisoner and prosecutor came to my house - they went out; the prosecutor returned, and said he had lost his watch - the prisoner was searched, but it was not found about her clothes - his fellow-servant brought a Policeman; I searched the prisoner again, but could not find it - I asked if she had got it; she said No: I said, "If you have you had better give it to me;" she still said she had not - the Policeman insisted on my searching her again, and said if I did not find it he would send for a doctor or surgeon; I then saw her hand go to the chimney-piece, and I took the watch from there.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you asked her again about the watch, did you not know she had it about her person? A. I did see her hand come from her person, and go to the chimneypiece, and then the watch was there - I do not recollect her saying any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Q.Mind how you answer - when you told her the Policeman talked about a doctor, did she make any offer to you? A. Yes, she said she would give me 5s. if I would say I had searched her and could not find it; I told her I would not say any thing of the kind, and that she had better give it up - she said she had got it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who was in the room when she offered you 5s.? A.Nobody; after returning with the prosecutor she did not leave the house- my sister did not assist in searching the room for the watch - she opened the door for her; the prosecutor was in the room till the Policeman came - the prisoner and I were alone when the watch was found; the Policeman was at the door while I searched her - I only searched her clothes - she undressed several times. I have been to see her in prison once - I did not make her any offer; not a syllable passed about 2l. - I felt unhappy about her being here; I merely asked at the door to see

I have kept this house about two months - I never kept any other house; I have been servant at other houses - I do not know where my husband is now; I saw him on Saturday.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to THOMAS RUST. Q.When you missed your watch did not the prisoner request that you should go back with her? A.

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in the New-road; the coachman called me to No. 4, Fitzroyrow - I found the prisoner there, and understood she had been searched; I required her to be searched again - she voluntarily stripped; nothing was found: I was not satisfied, and desired Buckeley to strip her quite - I went out at the door; I heard some words, but cannot say what - Buckeley afterwards produced the watch to me, with a ribbon - the prisoner clasped her hands together, burst into tears, and begged me to forgive her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who else was present? A. I believe Buckeley's husband; it was a man who appeared to belong to the house - Buckeley's sister came into the room.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Buckeley was looking for the watch; she took it from a tea-caddy on the table, and said, "I have found the watch;" she said to me, "Hold your tongue - I will give you 5s.; my husband is in the habit of selling watches in the country;" I said I would do no such thing, and to give it to the gentleman - she came to me in prison, and said she had said she was my sister, or they would not have let her in - she said, "I am sorry you did not sell me the watch, but I am still sorry for you, and if you will make up 2l. I will not come against you" - I refused, and she said, "You shall rue it."</p>

I saw a woman like this witness come to see the prisoner - I cannot say she is the woman, as I was talking to a woman myself; I heard the woman say to Kelley, "Don't be alarmed - if you can give me 2l. I will go into the country, and not come against you;" I did not notice much what else passed, but I heard Kelley say, "Mrs. Buckeley (or Buckey) are you not ashamed of what you said of me?" she said she did not say what she did at the time, and she need not be uneasy, she would not hurt a hair of her head - Pollard was present, but no turnkey.</p>

On the night of the 17th of August I saw the prisoner coming down stairs from the second floor; on seeing me he dropped a bundle which he had, on the landing - I immediately asked what he had been up stairs for; he said he was waiting till the song was over - I came down, and told my father, who secured him; he said he had some friends up stairs, but nobody there would own him - the bundle contained these articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Were any other persons there? A. No; I am certain the bundle fell from his hand.</p>

The prisoner came to me on Thursday morning, the 14th of July, and brought six bundles of printed paper; I never looked at them - he asked if he might leave them for half an hour; I said Yes he might, being an acquaintance - he said if I could sell them while he was gone I might; he wanted 31/2d. per lb. for them - I said I did not think I could sell them, but after he was gone I went down to Mr. Raphael, who lived in the house, and dealt in stationery - I asked him about it; he said he would not purchase it, but he took them out and sold them to Mr. Abrahams; he took only a sample - he came back, and said he had got a purchaser; he afterwards gave me 5l. 1s. 6d., which I gave to the prisoner -I delivered the paper to Raphael.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where is Mr. Raphael? A. He is a commercial man, and has been out of town since the day after he sold it - I do not know where he is; he never writes to me - I lodge at his mother's; I have known Raphael many years - he is not related to me; I do no business with his mother, and have no connexion in trade with her or her son, nor has my mother.</p>
               <p>Q.Read this bill? A.This is right, but it only alludes to Passover time - my mother and Mrs. Raphael have a sort of partnership during the Passover.</p>

Yes; I can neither read nor write, but I can swear to the size of the paper - I put no mark on it: the officer put a mark on it, and took it away about five days after I bought it - I had other paper in the house, but not made up in bundles like this; not such a quantity - it stood in my parlour at the back of the shop.</p>

            . I live in Thames-street, opposite the Old London-bridge; I am a watchmaker, and deal in silver. On the 2nd of August, about six o'clock in the evening, I was in a little room behind the shop; Mrs. Hutton was in the shop, she came and brought me this silver, which she said was offered for sale - I immediately said, "This is stolen silver," and directed her to buy it; I went to a place where I can observe every thing without being noticed, and there I saw the prisoner selling this plate; I took particular notice of her person; her name and direction were asked; she gave her direction, No. 20, Long-lane, Borough; I am not positive whether she gave her name - I sent my female servant out at the private door, to watch where she went - she was gone some time, and from what she said, when she returned, I went after dark to No. 7, Castle-street, Kent-street, Borough, with two Policemen; I knocked at the door, and the prisoner opened it; I gave an agreed signed to the Policemen, and they approached - I challenged her with having been at my house, and given a false address; she said she had never seen me in my life, and I do not think she did see me, but she added that she had not been over the bridge, nor at my house, which I described; I took out the silver, and said to the prisoner, in the Policemen's presence,"Will you say you did not bring this silver to my house today;" she utterly denied all knowledge of it; she was taken into custody; the Policemen went into a back room, which her landlady said she rented, and found a man there, whom they took; I have no doubt this silver is part of a cup and cover.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not tell the landlady that you would transport her? A. I do not remember it- I said the case would transport her; I was about four yards from her in the shop, looking through a hole; my wife bought the plate; she might give her name as Mary Ann Reynolds; I do not recollect; I went to Long-lane, and found it was a false address; I think she did say her name was Reynolds - my wife is not here; I had no conversation with the prisoner in the shop; she told the Magistrate her brother gave it her; I did not know at first sight that this was sacramental plate.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Hatton. He desired me to follow the prisoner; she went to No. 7, Castle-street, Borough; I am quite sure she is the person - she did not knock at the door, it was open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you was in the shop when she first came in? A. Yes - she asked if the gentleman was at home; I went and sent Mrs. Hatton out to her - I remained in the parlour, which is a very little way from the shop; I was within hearing, but did not hear her say her brother gave her the silver - if she had I must have heard it: I might not hear all she said - she gave the name of Ann Reynolds, for it is down in the book; I did not hear this.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went to No. 7, Castle-street, on the 2nd of August - we found the prisoner in the passage; there was a man in the room - the prisoner and the man both said they lived there together; I found a lap-stone there, with marks of silver on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there not shoemaker's tools there? A. Yes - they use a lap-stone; I have heard that the prisoner's brother ran away - he did not live at the house; I have been looking for him.</p>
               <p>MR. HATTON. I gave 4s. an oz. for the silver - it came to 37s. 6d.; I thought at first it was foreign silver, but on looking at it, I saw the Hall mark, and advertised it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see your wife weight it? A. Yes, and she entered it in the book - there were 9 ozs.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.Then it is all false that the 2s. have not been paid? A. Mr. Watney will take a false oath - I was there about three weeks, merely to mind the place while the man went out with the cart.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the prisoner the first to mention this truss of hay to his master? A. He was - he said, "Here are 2s., which I forgot to give you:" it was settled in full of all demands - I was suprised to hear of his being taken up; they kept me back from going to the Magistrate - nobody stopped me from going in, certainly, but I was ordered out of the Court-yard; I cannot say who by - the prisoner's wife asked me to go there; she asked me if I did not remember his paying the 2s.</p>

            . I lived as porter with Messrs. Easts, in Leicester-square. I left them on the 20th of March - the prisoner Robinson was in their employ with me; I slept in the shop - Robinson generally came between six and seven o'clock in the morning; Mr. East generally came into the shop to business about nine - he occasionally came into the shop before nine, but not to continue; Robinson employed me three or four times to take out parcels before eight o'clock in the morning; I took one or two to a coffee-shop in St. Martin's-lane, by his direction - I am not certain whether they had a direction on them - I think one of them had "James Robinson" written on it; he sometimes told me the parcels were linen, or his dirty shirts - I tore a bit of the brown-paper off one of them, which I was to leave at a baker's-shop, in Bear-street, St. James', and saw it contained what looked to me like brown kerseymere - I told him that was not his linen as he had told me, and he said it was a cut which he had brought with him out of the City; I have observed him go out with parcels himself of a morning, before Mr. East came down - I have asked him about them; he generally said they were his clothes going to be mended, or his linen going to be washed - John King was the porter who succeeded me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You never looked into more than one parcel? A. No; I undid one corner as well as tore the paper; whether there was linen under the kerseymere I cannot tell; nor do I know what was in the parcels he took out - if I had supposed property of large value was being taken away, I should have mentioned it.</p>

On the 17th of August, in consequence of information, I called in Clements, and we had Robinson into the counting-house - I said to him, "Where do you live?" he hesitated considerably, and said, "What do you say?" I said, "Where do you live, sir?" he said, "No. 3, Upper St. Martin's-lane;" I sent one of my shopmen to inquire if it was true - he came into the counting-house, and said, in the prisoner's presence, that no such person lived there; I again asked where he lived - he replied, "I have done nothing wrong, I shall not tell you;" I then said, "Now, James, I have been seriously robbed, and I am determined to find out the thief;" he then said, "I have never robbed you of 6d.;" I said, "You are resolved then not to tell me where you live?" he said, "Come with me to my brother's, and I will tell you;" I said, "Why not tell me here?" and after he was given in charge he gave me his address, No. 12, Blenheim-street - I saw him searched, and among other things a bunch of keys taken from him; in consequence of some inquiries we made I went to No. 48, Han's-place, Sloane-street, with an officer; I saw the prisoner Martin there, and asked him to show us Robinson's room; he said it was locked - he took us up to the back attic; I found the door wide open - we went in, and with the keys found on Robinson, Clements opened some boxes, trunks, and closets - in the boxes I found several articles of my own wearing-apparel, some account-books, and banker's cheques; the account-books are mine, but not the writing that was in them; the cheque-book was mine - I found in the closets silks, kerseymeres, cloths, umbrellas, and a variety of things; immediately I saw the cloths and silks I knew them to be ours - Martin was with us; we went down stairs, and as we were leaving the room I said,"Have you bought any goods of Robinson?" he said Yes, that he had had considerable dealings with him, and believed he owed Robinson between 400l. and 500l.; I said,"Have the goodness to show me the articles you bought of him;" he said, "All that I have bought of Robinson have tickets on them;" he was at that time showing us his stock - I said, "You appear to me to have an immense sized stock, pray what sized trade have you?" (he is a master tailor) - he said, "I keep from two to three men;" I said, "Have you been aware that this young man is in my service?" he replied, "Most certainly I am;" I said,"Pray when did you expect to pay for these goods you have bought so extensively?" he said, "Perhaps in two or three years' time;" that money was no object to Robinson, and that was the only way he had of investing his property - he said that he (Martin) had had dealings with Mr. Bousfield; we know that name in our trade - the property was in a room on the ground floor; I know it to be ours by the marks - the value of the property he stated to have bought of Robinson was about 300l., besides which there was about 200l. worth in Robinson's room; Martin had no shop - it was a private room; the name of "Martin, Tailor," is on the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Has your father any share in the business? A. He has not; we succeeded him, and pay him a fixed income - Robinson did not give me the information, which led me to Martin; I only know it to be Robinson's room, by what Martin said; we had not missed any of these goods - my brother sold in the shop, also William Landon and Robinson - these goods have not been sold; I can tell that by my books - it is our invariable custom to take off the marks when they are sold, and several of those found both in Robinson's and Martin's rooms have marks attached to them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q.Then the marks were plainly visible to any body who opened the cloth? A. Yes; they still remain fixed to the goods - I cannot be certain that the marks remain on those sold to Martin, till I look at them - I know they are on those found in Robinson's room; our stock mark is made with red pencil and not easily removed; they could be cut off - Clements was with me at Martin's, and heard all that was said; he said that Robinson himself attached the tickets to the goods, to distinguish them from the property he had purchased of other persons - I was violently agitated, and said, "You all deserve to be hanged;" he pointed out 2l. or 3l. worth of goods, which he said, he purchased of Bousfield: Martin's son was present at the latter part of the conversation - two coaches were sent for, and the property put into them, but I do not know whether Martin's son fetched the coaches - it was some part of his household undoubtedly; he did not say he had a book in which an account of the transactions between him and Robinson were kept - we brought a book away, which we took out of Robinson's box; Martin did not produce a book - this is the book we took from Robinson's box; Martin wished his son to accompany him to the office.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not a voluntary act on the part of the prisoner and his son, that they went to the office? A.The officer told them they must go to the office.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is this the book (producing one)? A. Yes, it is; Clement's was present at the conversation with Martin - he knew he was an officer.</p>

            . I am an officer, of Marlborough-street. On the 17th of August I saw Robinson at Mr. East's shop; the first address he gave was No. 3, Upper St. Martin's-lane; he then said No. 12, Blenheim-street, and afterwards, No. 8, College-street, Fulham-road - I went to Blenheim-street with a search-warrant, and they said they did not know him, and to No. 8, College-street, but he did not live there - I asked where his brother lived, he said in Yorkshire; I asked where there; he again said in Yorkshire - I ultimately found his brother lived at Mr. Dalston's, in Regent-street; I saw his brother there - I took some keys from the prisoner's possession, and went to No. 48, Han's-place, with Mr. East, and applied the keys to the cupboard, boxes, and drawers in the back attic; they fitted and opened them - a considerable quantity of property was found in Martin's room on the ground floor, as well as in Robinson's - in his parlour and a back room, which appeared a cutting room; they were both on the ground floor - Mr. East asked Martin, if he knew where Robinson lived; he said he knew he lived at Messrs. East's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. Do you remember a coach being sent for? A. Yes, two; I think Martin's son went for them - the property produced was brought away in them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Has it been in your possession ever since? A. It has been locked in a room in my house.</p>

Here is a ticket in Robinson's hand-writing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080071"/>fixed to five or six yards of velveteen, found in Martin's room; it cost me 5s. a yard - here is another in his writing, attached to twenty-one yards of fustian, at 2s. 9d. a yard; and another on ten yards of patent cord, worth 2l. -I have examined all the property and can conscientiously say it belongs to our firm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Do you mean to say the goods which are not marked are yours? A. I do; some have neither marks nor tickets, but I should say they are ours.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM LANDON. I was in the employ of Messrs. East, and on the 18th of August I went, by desire of Messrs. East, to the house of the prisoner Newland, No. 12, Bury-street - Goddard went in first; I followed, with four or five more, and found, laying on the table, three coats in an unfinished state, one silk waistcoat made up, and one surtout, not made, and six white quilting waistcoats cut out, but not made: Newland said the coats he had cut out to make up for Robinson's wear, and the silk waistcoats also, but the quilting waistcoats were for customers of his own - two lengths of drill were also produced with other articles, by Newland; he said he had them from Robinson - Goddard asked if that was all the property he had got which he had received from Robinson; he said it was all he had got; Clements said, "Then if that is all you have got, we will look round the room;" he did so, and on taking a candle, on a sideboard or shelf on the left-hand side of the room, he found this parcel, tied up in brown paper - here is the paper; there is written on it, in Robinson's hand-writing, "Mr. J. Robinson;" I have seen him write many times; the parcel contained a yard and a quarter of fancy velvet, a yard and a half of figured silk, a yard and three-quarters of superfine brown cloth, and two pairs of trousers made up: I do not think they have been worn - one pair has not been worn certainly: Newland said he was not aware of it having been left there - that it must have been left three or four days before; he was asked if he had an account with Robinson, and said he had been in the habit of making up a good many clothes for him - that he was never paid in money, but in goods, which answered his purpose equally well; he produced no account in my presence - he was asked if he was aware Robinson was in the employ of Messrs. East, and he said he was perfectly aware of that - he was asked what he owed Robinson, and at first said, Nothing; being again asked, he said there was an account between them, and he believed he owed him between 30l. and 40l., which was to be paid at Christmas - several of these articles I can positively swear to; I have the piece this velvet was cut from in Court - it matches exactly, where the figures is cut through, and tallies exactly, and this silk I thoroughly believe to be Messrs. Easts', as we have the exact pattern; here are two pattern-cards which we found in Newland's room - they are Messrs. Easts', and his name ought to be on them; that part of the cover which had" C. and H. East" on it is cut out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Had this conversation passed before you found the coats? A.They were produced to Goddard, I believe, before I went up -I never heard him say any thing about his believing Robinson to be an agent, selling on commission, or any thing to that effect; he lives at a baker's shop, and is a tailor - it is a small room, about fourteen feet square; I did not see the parcel till Clements took hold of it - Newland's attention had not been directed to it; I do not think it had been opened at all - it was not directed to Newland.</p>
               <p>Q.When the officer asked if he had more articles which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080072"/>he had bought of Robinson, did he call his apprentice to look and see if there was more? A. I did not hear him, and think I can swear he did not; I never knew an instance of a clerk acting as a commission agent in our trade; I have been with Mr. East twelve years - Robinson was two years and a half or three years in Mr. East's employ, and acted as a servant.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was the sideboard, on which the parcel was, in the dining-room? A. Yes; there was nothing to prevent the family seeing it - I never knew a clerk allowed to get goods made up, and pay the tailor in cloth.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with another officer and Landon to the prisoner's house; I went up stairs first, saw Newland, and asked if her knew a young man named Robinson, in the employ of Mr. East - he said he did: I asked how long it was since he had any cloth from him - he said, "Last week;" I said his employers had been robbed to a very considerable extent, and that I had a search-warrant, and it was for him to produce the property he had of Robinson: I then asked how much he owed Robinson - he said he did not owe him any, for he always took it out in cloth: he then went into a back room, and brought three unfinished coats, and the articles Landon has spoken of - the drill was in the front room; he said he was making the coats up for Robinson; Clements and Landon then came up stairs - the conversation was in the middle room; I asked if he had got any more property which Robinson had brought there - we were then in the front room, in which the sideboard was; he said No: Clements then proceeded to search further, and on the sideboard found a small parcel, directed to 
               <persName id="t18310908-140-person1154">J. </persName>
            Robinson - Newland said it must have been left there three or four days ago, for he did not know it was there; he was again asked if he owed Robinson any thing, and said he owed him nothing - we pot him into St. James' watch-house, and on our way to the office next day, he said he supposed he owed Robinson 20l. or 30l., but if he had finished the clothes he supposed he would have owed him 10l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time did you go there? A.About a quarter-past seven o'clock in the evening, or it might be half-past; it was certainly getting towards dark - he at once said he knew Robinson, and had bought goods of him; the things were brought to us by himself and his apprentice - he went into the back room, where they make up clothes; the front is a set of dining and a cutting-room, and the middle a bed-room - I asked him to produce the whole of the property which he had from Robinson; we were then in the front room, and he was asked if he had got any thing else; Clements took the candle off the front room table, and brought the parcel - the parcel was tied up, as if it had not been undone; the drill laid openly on the cutting-board - the other things were brought out of the back room, except the quilted waistcoats, which were in the front room; his apprentices assisted to produce the things - I particularly asked if it was all the property he had of Robinson.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see the pattern-cards? A. Yes, they were found, to the best of my knowledge, under the paper parcel on the sideboard.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with the officers, and found the paper parcel on the sideboard, with these two pattern-cards under it, and another by the side of it; Landon took them up, and said, "Why, these are ours;" I was bringing Newland to the office on the 19th; he said he owed Robinson about 20l., or it might be rather more, that he had been making a suit of clothes for a young man at No. 120, Sloane-street, named Wilson Scott, with cloth brought by Robinson, which he took home last Saturday, and that would reduce it to about 12l.; I went there, and got the clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go into the room were you found the parcel with a candle? A. I took a candle off the table in that room.</p>
               <p>HENRY VIGURS EAST. I am in partnership with my brother. Robinson was our servant; we paid him wages as a servant - he was called into the counting-house on the 17th of August, and asked where he lived; he gave three false addresses - these pattern-cards contain patterns of the goods we had for sale in August, and our present stock corresponds with 19-20lbs of them; the cards are ours, and all the property produced is ours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you deal in the wholesale way? A. Yes; we serve tailors as well as others - we give pattern-cards, not sell them; August is not the season for giving them; we gave several dozens away in April or May - the goods found at Newland's are worth 9l. or 10l., besides that in the parcel.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When you give any cards do you erase your name from them, or is it that the persons may know your stock? A.Certainly it is - our name is outside, and we generally write inside the name of the person we give them to; there is no name inside these.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. If a person sells on commission for you, in what way does he sell? A. It is a very different description of trade altogether; we have a country traveller, but never sell on commission - I do not think it is the practice in our trade to sell on commission at all.</p>

            . I was porter to the prosecutors five months ago; Robinson directed me to take two parcels out for him; I left one or two for him at a coffeeshop kept by Arliss, in Upper St. Martin's-lane, tied in brown paper - I think they were directed in the name of James Robinson; I also took a parcel to a baker's-shop, in Bury-street, St. James', and think it is the house Newland lodged at - I think I took two parcels there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you to leave Messrs. East? A. On account of getting up late in the morning; I understood so at the time - I have since heard I was not confident enough; I left on the 20th of March - it was about July last year that I went to Bury-street, and about February to the coffee-shop - I did not know what the parcels contained.</p>

            . I keep a coffee-shop, in Upper St. Martin's-lane, and have known Robinson about eight months. He left a parcel himself with me, about eight o'clock in the morning, directed to Mr. Newland, and one for Mr. Green - I cannot positively say whether Newland himself came for the parcel; I was examined at the office - a person called about eleven o'clock the same morning, and asked for a parcel left for Mr. Newland by Robinson; it was the prisoner Newland for all I know - I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.How long age<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080073"/>was it that Robinson left the parcel for Newland? A. I cannot say; I think it was after Christmas, five or six months ago - I do not know who fetched it away.</p>
               <p>Newland's Defence (written). If I had dealt with the prisoner Robinson as a mere acquaintance of yesterday, more caution might have been required at my hands, but I have known him intimately for several years, and known him employed in various situations of great respectability and trust, in which no misconduct was ever imputed to him - I knew him to be a sober and an attentive industrious man. I was acquainted with some of his relatives and friends, who were highly respectable, and in a condition, as I believed, to afford him the means which he stated they had done; I have long worked for him, as a tailor, before he entered the service of the prosecutors, and was always told by himself, when he solicited orders from me, that he was transacting business occassionally on his own account - a circumstance not at all uncommon with persons in his situation. In confirmation of all this, his prices were as high as those charged by the wholesale traders; and I humbly hope you will be satisfied that, in crediting these assertions and representations, I was doing no more than almost any other man would have done; he came openly to my shop, and transacted business in the presence of my two apprentices, to whom our accounts were always open for inspection - nor was there any thing in the extent of our dealings to awaken suspicion on my part. When his conduct was discovered, and the prosecutors, with the officers, came to my house, I was ready and anxious to give every explanation - I directed every article to be brought forward, and gave up the accounts without hesitation, for I had nothing either to conceal or to deny; and if I have been in any instance too easily induced to believe in the representations of so very old an acquaintance, who, as far as I knew, had deserved the good character he had enjoyed, I trust the character the Court will hear of me to-day, from respectable individuals, will induce your Lordship and the Jury to believe that I have not done so with any culpable intention of defrauding others, but that I have been myself most cruelly deceived.</p>

            . I have been apprentice to Newland these two years - he was in the habit of buying goods of Robinson; I have several times heard him complain of their high price, and Robinson said he did not get 2d. a yard by it - I have heard him say he got the goods in the City, but never heard where; the purchases were regularly entered into the book at the time - I believe that book is in Mr. East's possession.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How long has Robinson dealt with your master? A. Ever since I have been there, I think, but I did not know much of master's affairs when I first went; he would appear very young two years ago - the first dealing I was present at was about a year and a half since; when he has called master has said he wanted goods - I have heard him say, "It is a pity I did not know it an hour ago, as I have just come from the City;" I have heard that several times - I never heard master ask where he got them; I knew he was in Mr. East's employ, and have heard master say so - Robinson frequently brought cloth to master's, he might have brought cloth a dozen or three dozen times.</p>

I cannot; I have seen pattern-cards about, but do not know whether these were them - they had not the name scratched out; I never noticed what the names were - I seldom went into the front room; I believe Robinson went into master's front room whenever he chose - I never saw the parcel on the sideboard; I had not been into the room for three days.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Look at these trousers? A. This pair was made at our house, and I believe the others; they do not appear to have been worn.</p>
               <p>Q.Then in the bundle was a pair of trousers made by your master? A. I think they are his make - I do not remember when they were made.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Bedward, a man's-mercer, in Vigo-lane - I have managed his business for the last seven years, and receive all his cash. I know Newland perfectly well; I have dealt with him as an agent, at least he has had goods of me on my own account; I bought them of Mr. Bedward, who is my uncle - I am allowed that privilege; they are booked to me, and I dispose of them among my friends - I have sold the prisoner goods, and have been paid by his making clothes for myself, my brother, my cousin, and Dr. Jewell, whom I recommended to him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your uncle was acquainted with this, and you did nothing secretly? A.Certainly - he knew where I lived; I told him I had my uncle's permission.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How were the goods delivered? A.Sometimes he came to our shop for them, and at other times I sent our young man with them.</p>

I believe for five or six years - I had a good opinion of her; I never allowed her to take skins home, unless I gave them to her to work upon - I have, at times, given her English rabbit-skins to work upon at home, but never foreign skins - I never suffer them to be taken home, and do not allow work to be done on the premises in our new year, but August was not a time of that kind.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 31st of August I stopped the prisoner about a hundred yards from the prosecutor's door, about seven o'clock in the evening, with a basket in her hand - I asked her if she did not work for Mr. Lialter; she said she did - I told her he suspected things were not all right, and that he missed his skins - she immediately said she had four in her basket; I asked what she was going to do with them - she said to cut the wool off, and return it in the morning; I asked if Mr. Lialter knew of it - she said he knew nothing of it - I took her to the watch-house; three of the skins were in a paper, and one in a handkerchief.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not mean to wrong Mr. Lialter of them - I took them home to forward me an hour the next day; he often gave me leave to take work home, as I was obliged to go home early in the evening.</p>

            . The prisoner Gapes was one of our workwomen. On the 29th of August, a young woman, named McCartney, produced a bundle to me, about halfpast twelve o'clock; I examined it - it contained two foreign hare skins: the prosecutor had about ten persons in his employ then - I put it where I found it, which was at the next board to Gapes'; they work at separate boards - she had left the room to fetch something for her dinner - when she returned she took the parcel from the next board to her, and put it on her own board; she then eat her dinner, and after getting up I saw her put the parcel into her basket - I did not see her leave the premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q.Are you related to the prosecutor? A. I am not; the boards are parted from one another - it was on McCartney's board at first; it was not concealed - I said nothing to her about it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Were the skins wrapped up in a handkerchief? A. In white paper; nobody could see they were skins without undoing the bundle.</p>
               <p>MARGARET SCAGO. I am in the service of the prosecutor - I have heard Nathan's evidence, which is correct.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you see the parcel? A. Yes, every body in the room could see it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you see it on McCartney's board? A. I first saw it in Nathan's hand - she put it on Gapes' board: it was in whitey-brown paper - none of the skin could be seen.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's service. When I came up at half-past twelve o'clock, Gapes was out of the room; I found a parcel, wrapped in whitey-brown paper on my board - I turned round and showed it to Nathan - Simpson was by; we opened the paper and looked at it; Nathan opened it - I saw two foreign skins; it was put back on my board, I am sure - I had put it on the board opposite; I saw Gapes come back, and after she had dined, she put it on her own board, and then into her basket - Simpson stood behind me at the time at work; I saw Gapes leave between six and seven o'clock - she took her basket with her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had Scago had an opportunity of seeing whether the parcel was placed on your board or Gapes'? A. I cannot say - she was about two yards from me; after the prisoner put it into her basket, she fastened it, and put it close to where she was at work; every body could see the basket.</p>

               <p>MR. LIALTER. In consequence of information, I had Gapes apprehended on the 31st of August, and at the watch-house I asked if she had any of my foreign hare skins at home - she declared she had not; I then said I was informed she had taken two skins, wrapped up in paper, on the Monday, and likewise that she had taken two on the Tuesday, that we had the keys of her lodging, and were going to search - (Potter and her both lived together;) she said I might, I should find nothing at home but a lot of rubbish, which I had given her to work on on the Saturday - we took her with us to her lodgings, No. 2, Lock-street, Commercial-road; the door was open- she struck a light, and there was nothing; she then took us into a back room adjoining, and said, "Sir, I will tell you the truth, I hope you will forgive me;" she went to one part of the room, took up two paper parcels from the corner, and said, "There are two skins which I brought home on Monday in this paper parcel, and two which I brought on Tuesday, and four which Potter brought home;" she got them all from one place - the four were not in paper, but she said she meant to bring the produce of those skins back again - I said, "How did you mean to bring them back, when the work I gave you on Monday you returned on Tuesday, and when you brought down that work, I said it was very light; you said it was all you could get off the skins, you could not bring more than you had;" I found a quantity of my felt in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do these persons work by the piece? A. Yes - it would not take ten minutes to manufacture this - they earn 3s. 9d. by cutting sixty skins - we cannot count them when they bring the produce, as they are obliged to cut the skins up; I am certain I have correctly stated what she said.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you leave the prisoner under such circumstances, that upon any little scuffle the watch might have fallen from you? A. Oh no! it was impossible; the chain was so thick it must have been cut.</p>

             - he is a tobacconist, and lives on Newington-causeway; I met him at the Rose and Crown - I received from him six shillings, a sixpence, and four half-pence; I went to Goswell-street, and waited there three quarters of an hour - I saw the prisoner, a person named Johnson, and another named Avis; Avis said to the prisoner and Johnson, "This is the young man that wants the things" - I went into New-court, which is opposite the Rose and Crown, where Myers was waiting - the prisoner and Johnson followed me into the court, and Avis stood just at the mouth of the court; I asked the prisoner what he had got; he said ten, and he took a paper parcel from his trousers pocket, which he gave me - I opened it, and found it contained ten half-crowns: I gave him the 6s. 8d. for them, which Myers gave me - I said he must stand something to drink, which he agreed to; we went to the Rose and Crown, where Myers was waiting - the prisoner paid for some rum, but did not take any himself; Myers had been in such a position that he could see what was done in the court - when we were at the Rose and Crown the prisoner said, "They are very good ones, I suppose you will get rid of them to-day;" I said I would if I could - I marked them at the Rose and Crown, and gave them to Myers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been employed by the Mint to buy coin? A. From about the beginning of December - I have been a constable six years; I have known Avis three or four months; he said he knew who made base coin; he gives us information at times - I never paid him any thing, nor have I seen him paid; I never knew him till the 15th of May; I have heard he has been convicted - I did not take the prisoner at the time, as we had information that there were four or five coiners in Wentworth-street, and we could not have taken them if we took him then; I did not induce him to do this - I believe this is the fourth time I have bought coin, but will not swear it is not more; if I was at home I could refer to some accounts and tell; I have been a witness in vmore than ten cases, but not bought coin - I believe I have been a witness in seventeen cases, but am not quite sure; I have not received a farthing since December - I expect to be paid for my loss of time; I had a case about four years ago, and then I was paid for it - I am in the coal trade, but do not attend much to it; my wife is a laundress, and I keep a few pigs - I had five chaldrons of coals of Mr. Scott in the last twelve months, and sold them to my neighbours; I sell from a cellar; I fetch my wife's linen, and do other jobs; I was a patrol of the parish before the establishment of the New Police; I feel a pleasure in detecting people who act against the law - it is not for gain; Myers searched me to satisfy the Jury I had no money about me - if I could find Johnson I would take him- I have not seen him since; Avis knew I was to meet the prisoner - I did not know it was the prisoner I was to buy of - I did not direct Avis to send the prisoner with them.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. You have been a constable several years? A. Yes; I think it is entered into the seventh year - officers are often obliged to speak to persons of suspicious character; I have been in the room with them, and in all kind of company.</p>

            . I am a tobacconist, and live on Newington-causeway. I received information that the prisoner was a dealer in counterfeit coin - I made an arrangement to introduce him to Gollocker, and he was to meet him on the 4th of June; Avis was the person who gave me information; I met Gollocker at the Rose and Crown public-house, Goswell-street, a little after nine o'clock in the morning - I searched him, and satisfied myself that he had no coin about him; I have known him some time; he is a constable - I gave him six good shillings, a sixpence, and 2d. in half-pence - I had no reason to doubt his honesty, though I did this; I do not employ him, he goes as a constable with me - when I had given him the money I remained in the Rose and Crown, and he went into the street - I was in such a position as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080079"/>to see what he did; when he had been some time in the street, the prisoner, another man, and Avis, came up - Gollocker then went into New-court, immediately opposite where I was; they had some conversation, and the prisoner stood with his back against the wall - after they had talked a minute or two the prisoner put his hand, I think, into his left-hand trousers pocket, and pulled out a paper parcel, which Gollocker received, and gave him something in return - Gollocker then opened the parcel, took one out, and tried it upon his thumb; I saw him do it - they then came across to the house where I was, and I withdrew from the door where I had been standing, and went into a parlour adjoining the bar, with a glass partition across it; they called for some rum, but the prisoner would not drink any - her said he had other business to do, or he had not had breakfast I do not know which; I think the prisoner paid for it, and Gollocker and the other two men drank it - the prisoner and the other men then went out - Gollocker came to me and produced these half-crowns; my reason for not taking the prisoner at the time was, because we had other parties in view - we made several attempts to take the prisoner afterwards, but failed in them, till the 22nd of August, when I met with Hall, and took him at the bottom of Wilson-street - he was searched, and in the lining of his jacket Hall found three counterfeit half-crowns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been a tobacconist? A. Ten years; my servants attend to my business - I was a constable ten years, and left off about a year ago; when I receive information, I go and tell Gollocker, and he tells me - I have heard Avis called Perkins - I have heard of his being in trouble once about coin before I knew him; I have given him 1s. or 2s. for refreshments, and sometimes 3s., but not as payment - I never introduced him to the Mint; the solicitor knew he has been with me finding these people out - I will not swear I have not given him 5l.; I enter in a book what I give him, and expect to be paid again; the Mint paid me last about a year ago - I cannot tell how much I have received for the last two years without my books - I do not think it is 100l. in all.</p>

            . I am a fishmonger, and live in Lambeth-walk. In consequence of an application made to me, I met Gollocker and Myers, at Myers' house, on the 10th of June; Gollocker there searched me, to see if I had any money, and then provided me with four shillings, and Myers gave me six pence; I then went with them to Kingsland-road - I and Gollocker went to the sign of the Bull, and Myers went to the Weavers' Arms - Gollocker and I had a pint of porter, for which Gollocker paid; in about ten minutes the prisoner came in, he took a drink of porter and then beckoned me out - I had seen him on the day before, at the same house; we went into Edward-street, and Gollocker followed us - I went with the prisoner nearly to the bottom of the street, and asked what he had got; he said a score of bobs - I asked him the price - he said they were to be 4s.; he took a parcel out of his waistcoat pocket, and gave it me - I broke it open, and found there was a score; I gave him four shillings in return - I took one of them out of the paper, and threw it up with my thumb and finger, to give Myers a sight of it - we then went into the Weavers' Arms, called for a pot of ale, and the prisoner asked me when I should want any more; I said I would let him know; he then left, and I gave the twenty base shillings which I had from him to Gollocker, and he gave them to Myers, in my presence - we then went to Myers' house, where I marked them; I went to the prisoner's house on the 22nd of July, and he was there taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How long have you been employed by the Mint? A. I have gone now and then for about eleven weeks; but I attend to my own trade - I am a fishmonger; I never passed bad coin; Gollocker knew I had taken seven bad shillings, and applied to me to assist in taking these people - I have not received a farthing; I have given evidence for the Mint once before; I expect to be paid for my loss of time, whether the prisoner is convicted or not - there is a dead wall where the sale took place; it is a long street.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q.What did you see the prisoner for on the 9th? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q.How were you able to see her? A. Quite well; I was standing against the door - she was touching the basket, and I thought she was placing the lint on it as she took it out of the mangle; I do not let my mangle out, but she had a particular wish to do it herself - I never saw any lint mangled before, and did not understand the nature of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Where were you? A.About one hundred yards behind the cart - I had been acquainted with Brotherhood before that; there were no hedges between me and them - it is a turnpike road; the cart had no tilt over it - when the cart was stopped I was gone for the constable; Brotherhood was not laying drunk in the bottom of the cart.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You received information of their being taken? A. Yes, and went to the cart; Brotherhood was there, laying in the cart asleep - that was a mile and a half from my field; I aroused him; he was asleep, but I do not think he was drunk -I asked what he had in his cart; he made an answer not fit to be repeated; I made them an offer to take the oats back to the field, which they refused - they followed me; I said I should give charge of them; Brotherhood then took the reins out of Thomas' hand, and they turned and drove off - I gave them both into custody of the patrol, but I said that if he felt disposed to let Brotherhood out for the Sunday he might; Thomas remained in custody -Brotherhood went away, and appeared next day; the Magistrate let him out on bail, by my wish - I always considered him a man of credit - I think he had had some liquor; he called on me the same evening, to know what was the matter - I told him I had nothing to do with it; I had given it up to other hands.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went in pursuit of the cart - I took the two prisoners; Thomas said his master knew nothing about it, and he was the only person who had stolen the oats, while his master was asleep- he was not asleep when I found him.</p>

            . This is a similar bag to that which went from the warehouse, but I cannot swear it is the same- I saw no mark on it, and did not particularly notice it.</p>
               <p>MR. EDWARD BEDWELL KEMBLE. I have one partner only. Jolly was in our employ, and I know his handwriting; I have not a doubt this direction is in his writing- Jolly was our porter, and Cornman was under him.</p>
               <p>Jolly's Defence. I should not have been charged with this if it had not been for Cornman; I knew nothing of it, but when Cornman was accused of it, he accused me to get off himself.</p>
               <p>Clarke's Defence. I know nothing whatever of this parcel; I expected a parcel of coffee that evening - I never touched this parcel; it was half-past nine o'clock - I had no light, and could not ascertain what it was.</p>

            . I am a coffee-roaster, and live in King's Arms-yard, Whitecross-street. I have roasted Mr. Clarke's coffee for some time; I never was at his house, but I suppose he is a grocer - I have forwarded coffee to him from the Elephant, and from the White Horse,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080084"/>Criplegate; I did not send him a parcel on the 27th of August, but he expected one from me, for I had had a remnant of coffee belonging to Mr. Puce, which had laid by me for some time, and he authorised me to sell it if I could - I offered it to Clarke for 1s. 01/2d. per lb.; Clarke offered 1s. - I said I could not take that until I had seen Mr. Puce, and if that would do I would send it, but I did not see him, and so could not send it.</p>

             that day? A. About one o'clock; there were three-quarters of a hundred weight of coffee - it would have made about a similar sized parcel to this, and the bag this is in is a coffee bag.</p>

My watch hung by the side of the mantel-piece, in my own room, on the second floor - I went out about eight o'clock in the morning, leaving my wife at home; I returned in the evening, and it was gone - I went next morning with my wife in search of the prisoner, and found her, after much inquiry, crossing Foley-street; I did not know her, but my wife said, "That's her;" I crossed over, and charged her with stealing my watch - she denied it several times, and I said if she would tell all about it, I would forgive her.</p>

            . I live at No. 12, Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square - I have known the prisoner by sight for about six months. On the 23rd of August I saw her at the corner of Little Ogle-street, talking to a woman - she asked if I was out of work; I said Yes, and asked who that young woman was - she said it was a young woman who was going to pawn a watch for her; she then asked if I wanted to buy one - I said No, but I dare say I could sell it, and asked where she got it; she said a gentleman gave it to her for sleeping with her all night, as he had no money - this was about half-past eight o'clock in the morning; I asked to look at it - she said she would go home and fetch it, and meet me in half an hour; I met her in about three quarters of an hour, at the corner of Riding-house-lane - she gave it to me; I told her I had but 11s. about me, which I gave her, and asked what she wanted for it - she said she did not know how much; I said I would give her 3l. 10s. for it, and pay the rest by instalments - I gave her half a sovereign and a shilling; she asked if I would have any drink - I had half a glass of grog; she gave me 2s. to keep for her, and I left her with the young woman - she said she was going to the play, and I went with her that night; I was never in her company before, but knew her by passing her of a morning as I went to work - I gave the watch to the prosecutor's wife.</p>

A.They made a swing at me, and shoved one another against me - the landlord came, and told me to go out; I asked him what I had done; the pot-boy came, and asked if I wanted to fight - I said No; he said I must either fight or go out - he caught me round the waist, and shoved me into a passage, where the rest of the people followed - I was shoved down in that passage - as soon as I got up I went out into the mews; I saw Harrington bring the prisoner up - he asked if I had lost my watch; I put my hand to my fob, and said I had - he told the prisoner to give it to me; he did so - Clements has it; I know it to be mine by the maker's name - I delivered it to Stevens, the landlord, when I took it from the prisoner; I cannot tell whether the prisoner had been in the skittle-ground or not - I did not see him till Harrington brought him up; I did not perceive the watch go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You was thrown down, was your coat and waistcoat unbuttoned? A. My coat was, but not my waistcoat, except the two bottom buttons, which I always leave unbuttoned; my watch was in my fob, and I had a steel chain to it - the prisoner delivered it to me, and said he had picked it up; I made no disturbance at the public-house - we wrangled when the man would not pay me; he did pay me at last - I was no party to any disturbance there.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did the landlord order you out? A. He said I had not spent any money there, which I had not; he said I should not kick up a riot in his place - there was no riot about betting; they sneered at me, and began shoving one another against me - I should think there were eighteen or twenty people there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the prisoner's father lives? A.Somewhere in Carnaby-market; Harrington and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080087"/>called at his house one night, after we had found the bill- that was the only time; he seemed very uneasy, and wished to know if it was a true bill or not; I promised to go and let him know, to save him the trouble of coming down.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to take Harrington with you? A. We were going the same way home, and he knew where his father lived, which I did not - that was my only object in calling; I never called before.</p>

            . I am a helper at Mr. Jay's livery stables, and have been so eight or nine months. I was coming by, and heard a noise at the Guinea; I did not go in, but stood outside, and saw the pot-boy catch hold of the prosecutor round the waist - he let go of him, and caught him round the waist again, to turn him out, I suppose - I heard nothing said; a man came and put his foot out before the pot-boy, and threw him down; I do not know the man - Williams was thrown down also, and was under the pot-boy, Williams said, "Let me get up;" they did so, and the man who put out his foot threw him down again, he caught hold of the collar of Williams' coat, and said he should not go out - while that man held his collar, Jones stood on his right-hand side, and I saw him, with his right hand, draw the prosecutor's watch out of his fob - he reached his hand across his body, put the watch into his right-hand trousers pocket, and went out at the door; he said to a young man, who stood outside,"Come along;" the young man said, "Stop a minute;" he said, "Come along" again - the young man made no answer, and the prisoner started off to run - I hallooed out, "Where's the man's watch?" the young man who stood by the prisoner's side said, "He has not got no watch;" I said he had, for I saw him take it out of the man's pocket, and hallooed out, Stop him! Mr. Billing's was coming round the corner of the mews, and seized him by the collar - I caught hold of the other side of his collar, and asked where the man's watch was - he said he had got no watch; I said he had, for I saw him take it - Billings said he had got it in his right-hand breeches pocket - he denied it again, and then we took him up the mews, and met the prosecutor - I asked if he had not lost his watch; he put his hand to his fob, and said he had - we took him as far as the Guinea, which was two or three hundred yards off, and there he (the prisoner) delivered the watch up to the prosecutor, who gave it to the landlord, and took the prisoner to the station-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Where does his father live? A. I do not know, any more than I have heard him say it was in Claremarket - I went this night to his father's house, with the prosecutor; it was last week, I think on Friday, but will not be certain - I do not know what the prosecutor went for; I did not hear what passed; he asked if his father was at home, and his mother said not; he said it was very wet, and he should not stand there - he left no message that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the same Harrington who once lived with Mr. Murle? A. Yes; I happened to get drunk when I went to see a friend, and lost my service - I was not so drunk as not to be able to drive my master's family if they had let me - I lived there three or four months; I have been drunk before, but it is not my habit; Billings is not here - I have not been to look for him; I was perfectly sober on this occasion; the watch was taken while the prosecutor was standing up.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell his Lordship you did not know where Jones' father lived, when you had been there within a week? A. I did not recollect it at the moment; I have not been there more than once, I am sure of that; I think it was Monday afternoon that I was before the Grand Jury- I walked home with the prosecutor; we went up Holborn with a young man named Brown - I did not call at Clare-market with him; we never went near Jones' father's house that day - I will swear I never went but once - when we were there the prosecutor was talking to a gentleman by the side of the house, and said he was out of employ - I do not know who the gentleman was - this was on the Friday; I have not heard what the prosecutor swore; Mr. Jones was standing at the door when he was talking to the gentleman; I have not seen that gentleman at Clerkenwell - he was a stranger to me; how he came by the house I do not know; he did not go with us - the prosecutor told him he had been out of place, but could have had one if it had not been for this case - I did not hear him say he was rather in want of money; I did not go with the prosecutor to the father's house after the bill was found, it was before.</p>

               <p>Q. Then if it has been sworn it was after the bill was found, it is not true? A. It is not - I heard the prosecutor tell the woman the bill was not found that day - that is all that passed, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know where to go? A. I went with the prosecutor, who took me there, not I him; I did not know where the father lived till he showed me - the father said in the hall that it was in Clare-market; the prosecutor asked him what number - the prosecutor said he should go to Clare-market, and let the father know about the bill, and we both went; I had heard him tell the father he should come down and let him know if the bill was found- if he has sworn he did not know where the father lived, and should not have gone if I had not taken him, it is not true - I did not go there the day the bill was found; I did not ask for money, nor did he, to my knowledge - I swear he did not, in my presence; it rained, and I went away from the door a little while, and was out of hearing - I suppose we were there five or ten minutes, but I took no particular notice of the time; Williams came away with me - I was quite sober; I do not think we could have been there three quarters of an hour - I was not in the public-house on the night of the robbery; this all took place in the passage - it was broad day-light; I did not see the landlord till he came to take the watch.</p>

            . I am the landlord of the Guinea. There was a disturbance in my skittle-ground; I wanted Williams to go away - he would not go, and I helped to turn him out in the first instance; there was a disturbance in the passage afterwards - I did not see the watch taken; it was given to me by Williams at the tap, while they were going to take the prisoner to the station-house- I did not see what passed in the passage; I gave the watch to Clements.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was the company in the house perfectly quiet and well-behaved till the prosecutor came? A.They were; he was the cause of all the dis<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080088"/>turbance - I did not leave the house at all, and heard no thing of the robbery; Williams gave me the watch at the bar, and took the prisoner away, but did not tell me the charge - Mr. Billings is not here; he is a respectable man - I should have brought the pot-boy if I had been required; I was attempting to put the prosecutor out - the pot-boy took hold of him and shoved him back; he then said he would fight him - the prosecutor said he would not go out, and a crowd came.</p>

I was passing the Postoffice between eleven and twelve o'clock; I turned round into St. Ann's-lane, and saw the prisoner and this child together, at St. Ann's school door; I stopped to watch her, and saw her pull off its frock, pinafore, and shirt - I was about six yards from her, in the middle of the road - supposing it might belong to her I went on - I had not been home twenty minutes before she came into the court I live in without the child - she went down to the watercloset there; a quantity of people came up the court, looking after her, saying she either lived there, or had concealed herself there - I went and ordered her out; she got into Staining-lane, and was taken into custody in Noble-street- I am certain she is the woman whom I saw taking the child's clothes off.</p>

            . I live at a Leghorn warehouse in Foster-lane. I was passing through St. Ann's-lane, and saw the prisoner with the child - the clothes were off the child, and laying on the step; I watched, and saw her put them on again - I did not speak to her; she took the child by the hand, and walked up Noble-street; it did not cry, and I thought it was her own - I went away, but in about five minutes I was in Noble-street, and saw a mob round the child, which had been left; it had its clothes on then; the prisoner was taken in five or ten minutes, in Noble-street; I am certain she is the woman.</p>

            . I am a print-colourer. I saw the prisoner with the child on the steps of St. Ann's school - she was putting the frock on, and had the pinafore in her hand; I rather suspected her - she led the child to the corner of Noble-street, and my sister, who was with me then, asked her what was the matter with the child - she said it had been in the dirt; it had dirted its clothes very little - I followed her up Noble-street, and a gentleman called after her, but she did not stop; he went up and stopped her, and asked what she was going to do with the child - she said, "What do you think?" several people collected - the gentleman asked the child if that was her mother; the child said No; the prisoner then, in a moment, let go of the child's hand, and was going away - she was stopped, and I went to look for an officer; on returning she was not there - I went into Staining-lane, and saw her come out of the court; she was taken into custody in Noble-street - a gentleman had taken the child away, to find out where it lived; the prisoner said she was going to take it home and wash its clothes - she did not say where she lived, that I ever heard - I afterwards saw Mrs. Youhill at Guildhall, and she claimed the child.</p>

On Tuesday, the 16th of August, I had my little brother on my arms in Back-hill - he is three months old, and his name is Thomas; I saw the prisoner about half-past five o'clock; she said, "Little girl, I will give you a penny if you will show me where <placeName id="t18310908-185-crimeloc973">Saffron-hill</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. The prisoner was quite a stranger? A. Yes; I was some distance from home when I saw her, but I told her, I lived on Back-hill - I went with her to Saffron-hill, and carried the child myself; she did not say she was ill; she did not look ill then - I might have got back in a quarter of an hour, if I had found the gentleman and made haste; she might have said, "Go in the name of Johnson, and tell Mr. Jackson to come here;" she did not tell the particular number, she said No. 17 or 18 - there are a great many people about the place where I left the prisoner, and a great many turnings; a person might be lost sight of in a moment - she had sent me to get change for a shilling before I went to Smithfield; she held the child at that time, and when I came back she was still there with it - Saffron-hill is the nearest way from Back-hill, to Smithfield.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You are not a nurse? A. No; I have had children of my own - the prisoner before that appeared to be in a state of pregnancy, and I had let her have any thing about my shop - I could not see the size of the child when it was first brought in, but I desired it to be wrapped up and put on the hearth, while we attended to her, and got her to bed - I did not take notice of the child that night, I was so flurried; we went to dress it the next night, between seven and eight o'clock, and then I saw what it was - I certainly did not see enough of the child the first night to be able to state that it was the same I saw the next night; I cannot state whether the prisoner appeared to be pregnant after this, as she left my house so soon afterwards - I had signed for a box of linen for her.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had she had this letter for you to attend her? A.

I will take the child for you while you go, as I am in a great hurry;" the girl said No, she would take the child with her - the prisoner said, "No, you know me, you need not be afraid of me; I live in Peter-street, my name is Johnson;" she took the child out of the girl's arms.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The reason I changed the child's clothes was that they were so dirty, and I could not take it out as it was - I have friends to produce them; I had not taken off the roller.</p>

            . I am twelve years old. I used to mind the bar in the morning - Stapleton made an application to me - after that the prisoner came to me in the bar, and said he knew all that had passed between me, Stapleton, and other boys; that I had robbed my father, and he would have money as well as the rest - he said he would have 1s. or 1s. 6d., and I gave it him through fear that he should tell my father; I took it from the till - he was near enough to see where I took it from; I saw him several hours after, and he had a good deal more money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long ago is this? A. About Easter twelve months; I had been in the habit of robbing my father for nine months before, and continued to do so for about three months, as near as I can recollect - I have taken above 60l.; a boy named Dean wrote to my father about it, and I then charged Dean with setting me on to steal - my father usually came down between seven and eight o'clock, sometimes later; the boys drank beer, ale, and milk at the house.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.What did you do with the money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080091"/>you took? A. I gave it to the prisoner and the other boys; I think the prisoner might have about 2l. 10s. -Dean received above 15l.; he applied to me to allow him 4l. a week; I refused, and then he wrote to my father - the prisoner asked me for the first shilling about February.</p>

            . About April, last year, I was in the habit of leaving my son in care of the bar; he was then not eleven years old; when my payments became due I found I had not the money I expected, but did not know how it went; the prisoner was in the habit of coming to my house; his mother has sent him for things - he lived near.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did you miss your money? A. Chiefly about nine months ago - I received the letter three or four months ago - I did not mention it to my son till then - I showed him the direction of the letter, and asked if he knew the hand-writing; he said he did not - I showed him the signature; he said he knew that; he burst out crying, and said he had been robbing me; he wrote down the boys' names, which were also in the letter, but he had not seen them; he never saw more than the signature of the letter, and he does not now know the contents; here is the letter, it is signed by Dean - I know he had paints - I had given him the money to buy them - I found he had pistols and powder in the garret; he said one of the pistols was the pot-boy's,(Burkins) who denied it; the only person who spoke to me about him was Goner - I do not think I told him not to let boys drink there - I found a few seals in his possession.</p>

            .

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long before your father received the letter had the prisoner been to you? A.About three months - I was out when the letter came; my father, when I came in, told me to get a sheet of paper to write down every farthing I had robbed him of - I did so, to the best of my recollection; he showed me the direction - I did not know the writing; he then showed me the signature, and it was Dean's; he showed me the letter, and I read it myself - I read what I was charged with then in the letter (looking at it), and this is the paper on which I wrote what had I taken; the largest sum is 25l., and the smallest 2d.; my father took me to the Thames Police next day - Stapleton gave me a box of paints - I never had any other - I had thirty or forty small seals, a few watch-keys, and a knife - I gave them back to Stapleton; Berkins gave me a horse pistol - I never had any other - I did not ask Berkins to say they were his pistols.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean that your father only showed you the signature, and not the other part of the letter? A. Only the signature - I did not know the contents when I wrote this paper; after I put down what was in this paper, I read the letter.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner between five and six o'clock the same evening - he had left the prosecutor's about ten in the morning; this pair of gloves was in his waistcoat pocket, and this bundle was at the Swan, at Kensington Gravel-pits, where he was stopped; I found 2l. 19s. on him - he said he knew nothing of any part of the property; he told me what he had done with the compass.</p>

            . On Sunday, the 21st of August, between three and four o'clock, I was in Praed-street, Edgware-road; I saw the prisoner standing, with some persons round, who said it was a shame he should be treated so - upon inquiry I found he had been into a shop for a pennyworth of curds and whey - that he said it was sour, and that the man of the shop had kicked him in the mud; he said he was going to Bayswater - I asked him to come to my house and have his clothes brushed; while he was there he seemed to take a great fancy to an opera-glass on my mantel-piece, and he offered me this compass in exchange for it - I gave him the opera-glass and a penknife for the compass; I gave the same compass to the officer.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 27th of August, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoners in the City-road, near the bridge - Smith had this parcel on his shoulder, and Jones was a little behind him; I followed them some distance, and Smith gave Jones the parcel - they went to Mr. Pearces' shop, a plumber, in Plumber's-row, and Jones threw the lead into the scale; Mr. Pearce came into the shop - I told him I suspected it was stolen; Jones said it was not, that he had brought it from his own house in Golden-lane, and it was his own - I said I had seen them come in a very contrary direction, and asked if they had not brought it from the back of Mr. Rhodes'; they denied it- I asked Mr. Pearce to assist me in taking them to the station; in going along Smith struck Mr. Pearce, pushed him down, and attempted to escape, but we secured them- at the station-house Jones said they had picked the lead up, but they thought it was no harm; I found some lead had been taken from a gutter in one of the houses at the back of Mr. Rhodes', and I found the lead which the prisoners had, fitted the gutter exactly - the nail holes all matched, and it exactly corresponded where it was cut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did Jones say when he got to the shop? A. He said he had brought some lead, and that he wanted some glass for it; the lead had been taken from the top of a kitchen adjoining a house - Jones said they picked it up in a field; a boy, who came and swore he saw the prisoners pick up the lead in a field, is not here - he gave evidence at the office against the prisoners.</p>

No - this lead was on a kitchen which leans against the house; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080094"/>lead being off would have let the rain in - I had been in the house three days before, and there was not any appearance of rain coming in.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I saw the two prisoners following the prosecutor up towards Templebar, and back again - the prosecutor was not sober, but was capable of walking and talking; in about a quarter of an hour I saw the prosecutor with a hat on, which I had seen Drover wear the same evening, and that caused suspicion; I took Hartin on the 13th of August - I had seen both the prisoners in company before, and knew they were associates.</p>
               <p>Hartin. Q. Did you not see the prosecutor stripped, in the act of fighting? A. I saw him taking off his coat; he was having an altercation with some person - I did not see you pick up his clothes from under feet.</p>
               <p>M - MOSES. I keep a clothes-shop. I bought this coat of Drover about half an hour before the officer came - there was some other man with him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Drover's Defence. The prosecutor took my hat off, put his hat on my head, and put mine on his head, to disguise himself, to go to fight a porter at the gate of the lun- the handkerchief was in his hat, and I put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Hartin's Defence. I and a friend went into the public-house opposite the Angel Inn; I heard an altercation, went out, and saw the prosecutor fighting - the Policeman came up and separated them; he was beastly drunk: no man would have behaved as he did in his sober senses; the Policeman sent him towards Temple-bar, but he returned once or twice - I went into the public-house again, and he came in with his coat off, and Drover's hat on; the porter, and two female servants were in the house, having a glass of ale; the prosecutor insisted upon fighting the porter - the man behind the bar jumped over, and turned him out; a respectable person, who was with me, came to Bow-street, and proved that I was not out of his company till half-past eleven o'clock that night, but he was sent by the Scotch society to Scotland, the next day.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 2nd of August I was in a pawnbroker's-shop in Sloane-street, and while I was there Gazey came in, and brought these two pieces of a broken spoon to pawn - they refused to take it, and then she wanted it mended; when she went out I followed her - she crossed, and joined three or four girls of the town; after some conversation with them she went on, and I followed her - I asked what she had got; she said Nothing - I said I had my doubts about that - she then said, "I have a spoon, which is my own property;" I said I should take her to the watch-house - she said she would not go, but she would take me to the house- she took me to the prosecutor's; she called Cresswell to the door, and told her the Policeman was after her - she slipped the spoon into her hand; I took it from her, and found there had been a crest on it, which was nearly erased - Cresswell said it was her own, that her mother had had it left to her before she was born; I said I was not satisfied, I should take her to the watch-house - she said I should not, for it was all right, her son had given it to her, who was now in the West Indies - on our way to the watch-house she said she had found it in a piece of rag, but she could not say when, nor where.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080096"/>dressed in your uniform? A. Yes; she was in the shop rom three to five minutes - I do not know any thing of either of the prisoners - Gazey took me to the house where Cresswell was.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first see Tulloch? A.

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday evening, about eleven o'clock, and found 19s. on him, but no notes; he was standing under a lamp, with a female - he said he was innocent; I said, "Why did you abscond from your house with the woman you have lived with twelve years?" he then began to pretend intoxication; he had a new hat on, and almost all his clothes were new - I knew that, for I was in the habit of seeing him daily.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, upon being called upon for his Defence, in a coarse and indelicate statement, represented that the prosecutor and Brookes had come to her house in a complete state of intoxication, and wished for a room, which he refused them, and turned them out of doors; and that he was robbed previous to coming to his house.</p>

            . I am a chimney-sweeper. On Friday last, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prosecutor laying in the kennel, drunk; his face was bleeding - I picked him up, and a female that was with him; I wiped his face with my handkerchief, and took him to No. 9, Glasshouse-street - it must then have been near three o'clock, and between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw him sitting in the necessary, asleep- I and a female helped him out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where is the necessary? A. In the back apartment of the house, No. 9, next door to the Compasses - I was called there to assist him out; he was quite drunk, and could not stand.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you hear him say some wh - s had rooed him? A. He said so when I took him out of the kennel - I am sure he was intoxicated at half-past two o'clock.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Compasses. Last Friday, about half-past two or three o'clock, I saw the prosecutor in our house - he was neither drunk nor sober, half and half; I saw the sweep pick him up out of the kennel; the left side of his face was scratched; Glass took him to the next house - his hat was under our bar all the night; it was a straw hat - he had it on when laying in the kennel - he came into our house after he was picked up, about three o'clock, and had five or six glasses of brandy and water, and then the landlord refused to let him have more; he went out with another female, returned in ten minutes, and wanted more; he said he had been with a girl, and had been dished - and about halfpast four o'clock, when I took a pot of beer to the next house, he was asleep in the privy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When did you hear about this business? A. Not till next day.</p>

            . I am the son of the prosecutrix. -On the 18th of August, in the afternoon, a woman came to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080099"/>borrow some money; I examined the till, and the tin box was gone, which contained about 25l. in money altogether, besides papers - there were half-crowns in it, one of which I had marked overnight - I gave information to Brown almost directly; when the prisoner was taken I saw three half-crowns, one of which I had marked - (looking at it) I cannot positively swear this is it, but think it is.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Would he not have to reach over a considerable way to take it? A. No, I could do it - the mark on the half-crown is a scratch on the rim; I made it with my teeth - it is the mark, to the best of my belief; - there were a great many half-crowns in the box, and a bill of 300l.; I have found none of the contents.</p>
               <p>MR. DOWLING. Q.What is your belief of the halfcrown? A. To the best of my belief it is the one I marked overnight.</p>

             I am an officer. I went in pursuit of the prisoner and his companion, and took the prisoner opposite the prosecutor's house on the following morning; I found this half-crown, with three others, and 10s. 6d. in silver besides; I found some keys, which he said belonged to his tool-chest, and went to his lodgings, but there was no tool-chest there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You ascertained from himself where he lodged? A. No - the key fitted a box I found there; I found no money.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there room for the dray to pass at the time? A. I consider that there was not sufficient, as it was between a coach-stand and a coal-waggon, which was next to the footpath, and there did not seem sufficient room for the dray to pass between them; the horse of the cab was not injured, but the shaft was broken, I suppose by the shaft of the dray - the dray was drawn by two horses; I thought the deceased was dead, when we were opposite the Bull and Mouth, but the surgeon at the hospital said he was not- I did not see the prisoner till before the inquest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You did not see the beginning of this? A. No, the cry first alarmed me; I only saw one dray - Bates and a butcher helped me to put the deceased into a cab - nobody else assisted; I did not see the prisoner, and do not think that he assisted; I do not swear there was not room to pass between the dray and the coach-stand - there did not appear so to me: I am not accustomed to driving - I did not see

I was on duty in Cheapside, on the pavement of the south side, going towards Bow church; I heard somebody scream, and saw the deceased under the wheel of a dray, which I think had four puncheons on it; it was loaded with beer, for I sounded one cask - the off wheel was pressing the deceased along the ground, dragging him along; I could not see the driver - my attention was directed to the man; some man pulled him from the wheel - I came up directly, and the wheel rested on the body, and went back again, not over him; I did not see who drew him from under the wheel - I lifted him up, and took him to the hospital, in his own cab - Hazlewood was so frightened I could scarcely get him to my assistance; I had repeatedly seen the man as a cab-driver; his cab was facing towards St. Paul's - I saw him again between eleven and twelve o'clock, at the hospital, dead; the shaft of the cab was broken on the side that the man had stood with his horse; I took the number of the dray after the deceased was extricated, and then saw a man, whom I believe to be the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you acquainted with the rules of driving? A. Yes; I was on the south side, the driver's proper place would be on the other side of his leading horse, there was another dray stood before - whe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080100"/>ther that had passed between the waggon and coachstand, I did not see; but it must have passed between them, the cab stood still.</p>
               <p>Q. If the cab horse had jibbed towards the north side, might that not have drawn the shaft towards the dray wheel? A. It might - horses on the rank will shift sometimes, and the space of half an inch will bring them closer - the coal-waggon was going on at the time, and the farther it went on the narrower the road got - I cannot say it was not the prisoner who took the deceased from under the wheel; Hazlewood got there before me: my back was towards the dray - how the accident was caused I cannot say; Goodson the driver of the first dray came up, when I was taking the man up; two or three assisted, I cannot say whether the prisoner was one.</p>

            . I am one of the housesurgeons at St. Bartholomew's hospital. The deceased was brought in between six and seven o'clock in the morning; he appeared to have received a very severe injury, and died almost immediately - several of the ribs of the right side were fractured and driven into the lungs, which were much lacerated; there is not a doubt the accident caused his death.</p>

            . I live in Mercer-alley, Bankside, and am carman to Mr. Elmer, a coal-merchant. I was driving his coal waggon towards the Mansion-house; my waggon was going on at the time of the alarm - it was on the Gutter-lane side; I was at my third horse's head on the foot path side, near the kennel - my wheels were in the kennel; I heard the alarm and stopped my horses immediately; the first thing I saw was their picking the man up - I did not notice whether any body was at the head of the horses of the dray; it had just past between my middle horse and the coach-stand - I did not observe the prisoner at all; when I first saw the cab-man, he was standing at the off side of his horse, on the side nearest to the dray; he and the cab were then quite safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cab the first in the rank, or the middle of it? A. It was first on the rank; my waggon and the dray were going in the same direction - the first dray cleared my waggon, except rubbing a little against the chain as it passed; I cannot say whether it went between the cab and my waggon, for I was on my near side, near the shaft horse's head - I saw the first drayman pass me, he had two horses; I did not see the leading horse of the second dray coming, for hearing the alarm I had just time to pull up my horses - I did not see the horse of the first dray till it was stopped.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there a good road on the other side of the way? A. Yes; there was nothing passing just at that time.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Would that not have been his wrong side? A. Yes, unless there had been a great deal of room - whether the cab had moved after the first dray passed I cannot tell.</p>

I was in Cheapside, standing at the end of Paternoster-row, looking towards Watling-street; I heard a cry out, and saw a man laying before the wheel on the ground - the cab was in the rank, and the coal-waggon standing near; I saw two drays, one had passed the coal waggon, but not the other - I went up, the man was then turned on his back; and the second dray backed a little; several persons were putting the man into the cab - I had seen the drays turn out of St. Paul's churchyard, but not afterward; the drivers were with them then.</p>

            . I drive a cab, and live in Francis-street, Tottenham-court-road. I was talking to the deceased, by the side of his horse, and went from him to my own cab, leaving him standing between his own horse and the pavement, in the middle of the road; my cab was not on the stand - I was on the opposite side of the way; I heard a scream, and saw the deceased down - I did not see him knocked down; the wheel of the dray was on part of his clothes - they could not get him up till the dray was moved; the man driving the dray, to the best of my knowledge, backed the horse; it was the drayman who backed it - he was at the fore horse's head when I first saw him; the dray had passed the cab, and the coal waggon had just passed the cab; I cannot say whether the driver was with his horses at the time they passed the cab, but when I called to him to stop, when I took the man up, he was at his horse's head.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the Post-office. I was coming along Cheapside, and saw the coal waggon on the pavement side; I cannot say whether it was moving; the first dray passed on, and as the second approached, I saw the cab-man was in danger, as soon as the first horse passed - he appeared to me, to be leaning on the shaft of his cab, and not to see his danger, till the wheel of the second dray came close to him, nearly in contact with him - I saw his hands extended, as though he was attempting to save himself, by trying to catch hold of the planks which cross the dray; he was so near that the dray wheel was hid from me; I saw him go down - I cannot say where the driver of the dray was; I was some distance off, and before I got up he was released; the prisoner was with his horses when I got up - I believe he was on the off side of his horse, having passed round to where the accident happened; I saw him back his horse as I came up.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I was in Cheapside, in my cart, following behind the two drays; there was a coal-waggon going on in front; I saw the cab on the stand - one dray passed the coal-waggon, the second followed it, but there was not sufficient room to pass - I saw the cab-man just before the second dray came up, standing with his back towards the dray, with his elbow on the shaft - I did not see the driver of the second dray; he was some yards off, on the pavement; the horses were going by themselves - the waggon was between him and his horses I am certain; I saw the front piece of wood which held the first butt of beer strike the man, who could not recover himself, and he was driven on before the wheel about six yards - it was pressing him on; if the driver had been at his horse's head I think he might have stopped the dray before it got on the man's body; I am sure he was on the pavement at the time; I helped to put the man into the cab - the prisoner came up; I told him he had killed the man - he said he was very sorry for it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where do you live? A. In Dorset-street: I am a journeyman butcher - I was working for Mr. Wheel in Leadenhall-market, and keep a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080101"/>horse and cart of my own; I saw Sims there - he had the same opportunity of seeing what passed as I; he was in the second or third cab - Bates was on the opposite side of the way, the right-hand from St. Paul's - Hazlewood was on that side, and they could not see; I will swear the prisoner was not at his horse's head till after the accident - I never saw the prisoner before; I was the first who got the deceased from under the wheel - the prisoner did not assist till after he was from under it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you observe there was not room for the second dray to pass?" A. As soon as I saw the man knocked down, and not before; I cannot say whether the wheel of the waggon or the cab were touched - my attention was directed to the man who was standing outside the shaft in front of the wheel; I saw the driver of the first dray- I was there before him; I was the first that laid hold of the man; I was much agitated and jumped from my cart - I did not lose sight of the man till he was under the wheel; it happened within twenty yards of Foster-lane; I did not look for the dray-man - I called out as soon as I saw the accident, and the next cab-man called the dray-man (the prisoner); he answered from the pavement, I believe, but I will not swear that, because I was so far away; I did not observe him till he was called - he was on the pavement, I will swear; for I saw him pass the coal-waggon.</p>

            . I am a cab-driver. My cab was on the stand, about eight feet from Hill's - I was behind Hill; I saw a coal-waggon, and two brewers' drays; the first dray passed without anything happening - I saw the second come up to the cab - I did not see the driver there, but he might have been there, as I was looking at the deceased, who was leaning on his shaft, and was struck by the dray; he went to lay hold of the iron part of the dray, missed it, and fell under the wheel; the dray went on, and the wheel kept pushing him on; a mob gathered, and I saw him taken up - I had spoken to him just before; he did not appear the worse for liquor; he might have had a glass; the dray-men did their best when they saw what was done, to stop their horses, and rescue him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the man leaning on the shaft and projecting out towards the road? A. He was leaning on it just at the step; the dray made a kind of slough towards the pavement, and hit him; a brick, or a hole, might have caused it to slough; the dray-man assisted to put the man into his cab, and in getting him from under the wheel; they stopped the moment they were called to.</p>
               <p>Q. If the man who drove the second dray was by his first horse, could he see the man who was behind that horse? A. I should think not, unless an alarm was given; there was no alarm till afterwards.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Lobsey of Cheapside. I was looking out of the second floor window, down towards the cab, which stood nearly opposite our house - I noticed two drays and a coal-waggon coming along; the waggon was first; the first dray passed between the waggon and the cart very close; the waggon was in motion at the time; the second dray had less room to pass, in consequence of the progress of the coal-waggon - I was rather surprised on seeing the second dray come on, that the cab-man, who was leaning on his shaft, did not move, and as it got very near to the cab; the horse of the cab made a little move, which appeared to awaken the man to his danger; he moved from the dray, rather more towards the south side, which gave the drayman room to pass - I thought he had been asleep; he made a sudden start, turned round towards Bow church, and ran, as it appeared, before the wheel of the dray; after going four or five steps I saw his hands extended, and he fell, after which I saw no more - I could not see where the driver of the second dray was, for I was more intent on the deceased.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was your house close to where the accident happened? A. Exactly, so that I had a bird's-eye view of it - I should have thought that the dray made noise enough to awake the man before it got to him; there was plenty of time to have moved; in my judgment, it was pure accident; the man ran into danger certainly.</p>

I drove the first dray between the coal-waggon and the coach-stand, and passed without difficulty - I was at the head of my horses, and the prisoner was alongside his horses and never went on the pavement - I looked back before the accident, and saw him at his horse's head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. As you drove your dray through, did you see his approach? A. Yes; drays follow each other as close as possible - I looked back, to guide my horses, saw the man under the wheel, and stopped; the prisoner got hold of his horse's head, and stopped as quick as possible; he went up and assisted the man.</p>

            . I occupy a house in Swan-place, Old Kent-road, and am in the employment of Mr. Marchant, of Ingram-court, Fenchurch-street, printer, and have been so nineteen years, seven of which I was an in-door apprentice. On the 12th of August, 1830, I dined at a venison-feast, in Stationers'-hall - I left the hall about halfpast nine o'clock, perfectly sober - I met the prisoner opposite Apothecaries'-hall - I had never seen him before, but have not the smallest doubt of him; he accosted me as I was going through into Bridge-street, and said, "How do you do?" - I said, "I am very well, but I don't know you;" he said, "That's all nonsense, you know how you and I have been situated, I want 2s. of you, I am out of work" - I told him I had no money to give any one; he said, "I will have it, and will follow you wherever you go" - I was in such fear and tremble at the time, I did not know what to do, and thought I would consult a friend - I had the money, but said I had not - I said, "Here, take my handkerchief, wait here, I will go and borrow the money" - I went to Mr. Rowe's, in Shoe-lane, who keeps the Globe public-house, to ask his advice, but he was from home - I came back, gave him the money, and released my handkerchief, considering it was worth more than the money - I then went towards Blackfriars-bridge; which way he went I do not know, but he did not follow - I saw him several times afterwards, and on the 16th of this month I gave him in charge to Betterton, a Policeman - I had related to Betterton, in his pre<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080102"/>sence, the whole of the transaction which had passed, but did not state to him any thing of the present charge - I was greatly in fear when I gave him the money.</p>
               <p>The Court ruled, that the language used on this occasion was not sufficient to constitute the offence charged.</p>

               <p>HENRY GALLABIN. On the 6th of September, about two o'clock in the day, I met the prisoner as I passed the end of lugram-court - he was waiting under the court; he came up to me, and asked me to give him 3s. - I said,"I've no money, and shall give you none;" I walked about the streets in a zig-zag direction, in order to find an officer - he followed me all the way, and exactly at half-past two o'clock I got to Bow church; he accompanied me all the way, and there he said, "I am not like some people - extorting sovereigns, I merely ask you for 3s.; you may as well give it me at once" - I said, "I shall not give you any thing;" when we got opposite Dolland's, in St. Paul's church-yard, he said, "Do you mean to give me the money?" I replied, "I will not give you any;" he said,"By G-d, I want the money, and if you don't give it me, by G-d you shall not darken those b-y gates again, so do as you like;" I am positive he used those expressions; I was in greater fear than ever then - he is a taller and much more powerful man than me; my mind was in a dreadful state, I hardly knew what I was about; I made my way to the corner of Bride-lane, saw an officer by Poppin's-court, and gave him in charge - I went to the watch-house; he came up close to me there, and said,"Don't do any thing; if you won't, by G-d I'll never trouble you again;" I instantly walked away from him -I am quite certain I never knew him before the 12th of August, 1830 - I was never in any public-house with him, nor ever drank in his company.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have known him two years; I never asked him to give me any money - I asked him to lend it. Witness. The 12th of August was the first time I ever saw him- he did not ask the 3s. as a loan; I am sure he said if I did not give him 3s. I should never darken the gates again, and while he used that expression he held my left arm.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the 6th of September, a little before three o'clock in the afternoon, the prosecutor gave the prisoner into my charge - I do not think he was near enough to hear what the prosecutor said - when I took him he said he only wanted to borrow the money, he afterwards said he only wanted the lend of it, and afterwards that he did not want to extort it - when I was taking him from the Compter to Guildhall I asked how long he had known the prosecutor - he said about seven or eight years; I am certain of that - he had heard the charge as I took him to the watch-house; what he stated at Guildhall was taken in writing.</p>

In 1829 I bought the machinery which had been used for the Steam Washing Company for 1,500l.; I had had some interviews with the prisoner, and on the 29th of June I took him and Smith into my service - their salaries began from that day; they were to have 300l. for the first year, 400l. for the second, and 500l. for the third; it was my intention to remove the articles I had purchased from where they were to the Isle of Dogs, but in July 1829, I had not began to build - I have had large buildings erected there since; I had no place then fixed to meet the prisoner, but I had seen him at the Somerset coffee-house, and he proposed that I should still meet him there - I met him there on the 4th of July, 1829, and he said there were a great many sets of harness, which had belonged to the old company, to be sold a very great bargain, and he had bargained for the purchase of them for 21l. with Mr. De Mole; and he asked me to give him a cheque for it - I drew the cheque which I have now in my hand, and gave it to him expressly to pay for that harness - it is drawn in favour of Mr. De Mole; I left London for Scotland on the 28th or 29th of July - I had given the prisoner a cheque for 50l. for the general purposes of the business, on the 11th of July; and before I left town I deposited in the hands of Messrs. Bosanquets 1000l., to the credit of Junius Smith and James Lee, with joint power to draw with two names to the cheques - I did not tell Smith that I had given Lee the cheques for this harness; he knew nothing of it - it was not till May of the present year that I discovered the cheque had not been paid for the harness.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. This cheque is dated July, 1829? A. Yes; (looking at an account) part of this is my writing; the prisoner had not been in the company's employ previously - Smith left me in July, 1830, and I appointed Captain Wager in Smith's place; the prisoner lived at Lewisham-hill - I preferred two or three indictments last September and four this - I did not complain to any Magistrate respecting this cheque.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he appears here for the first time to explain, if any error has arisen? A. Yes, I charged him at Bow-street with embezzlement last April - there were two examinations, and he was dismissed, on account of his bringing forward a book, which he pretended was an account kept for me, and by me which I disowned; the very instant I discovered this charge I went to my solicitor - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080103"/>am not aware that three Sessions have passed - I dismissed the prisoner on the 11th of January last; he brought an action against me for wages, which was unjust, and I resisted it - I think that was in March - I proposed to give him 130l. as a settlement of all accounts, if he would stop the action, and he refused, but that was before I knew I was defrauded - he had taken one book away with him when he left; my cheques are generally kept at my bankers' for years, and sometimes I do not demand them for three years or more; I am not a man of business - they were returned to me a week or a fortnight ago- I keep a pass-book, and it is entered in my cash-books - it was proposed to me to refer all matters in dispute to an arbitration, and I agreed, but that was before I discovered the fraud; the prisoner and I very often went over the accounts to see how much had been expended, but not lately, before he left me, for we were not on speaking terms for some months; I do not recollect his telling me I had debited the washing concern with a great many cheques, which had been paid to my private account - I will say he did not say so - this cheque was never applied to my private purposes; there was no other cheque of 21l. about that time; these five items on this paper are my writing; it is a scribbling thing, it is no account: here appears for "Self" marked against them, and "Cheque 21l.; it is one of the items - I did not give any cheque of 21l.; it is my writing, but I do not call it an account - it is a rough scribble, which I might make to see what I might have to receive at a particular banker's hand; this is not the date in question, and probably not the year - here is a cheque of 21l. in Coutts's book, in July 1830, paid to Smart, and that may be the 21l. on that paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not on this paper "29th June?" A. Yes, but that means collections received from the beginning to June; there is no last date - it might be written in 1830, for there could be no debts collected till after 1830, as the buildings were not erected; the parties belonging to the harness were bankrupts four months afterwards, but not at the time; I imagined that it was to be delivered to me on payment of the money.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went before Mr. Hall in April last? A. Yes - Mr. Harmer was then my attorney; I did not then know about this 21l. cheque being stolen -I never

             a cheque in favour of De Mole, except to pay for the harness; the prisoner never informed me it had not been applied for that purpose - there was no private account between us.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. The prisoner has not been in custody? A. No, the Court admitted him to bail last Session.</p>

            . I was a clerk to Mr. Macdonald with the prisoner. I remember an application being made on behalf of Mr. De Mole for 21l., but am not certain whether it was for harness or the works - the prisoner and I agreed that it should be paid by a cheque; I think that was in August - it was after the prosecutor had gone to Scotland; this is the cheque - the prisoner never told me he had another cheque for the harness; this cheque is on Bosanquet's, drawn by us, in favour of De Mole, for 21l.; it was to be paid out of 1000l. Mr. Macdonald had left there to meet expences while he was in Scotland.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there any secrecy in the prisoner's transactions? A. Not that I saw - I had access to Bosanquet's cheque-book; the prosecutor still holds the concern.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you access to Coutts' cheques? A. No.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and live in Threadneedle-street. In 1829 the assignees of the Washing Company sold the property to Matthew Smith; there was some harness; I saw the prisoner several times about it; the harness was sold, or about being sold, to Mr. Smith, for twenty guineas - the prisoner called about the transfer of some property, of which I had no knowledge, and spoke of purchasing the harness, among other things, for himself or Mr. Macdonald - I told him a sale was made to Smith, and I could not well have any thing to do with it; I ultimately received this 21l. cheque on Bosanquet's about the 14th of August, and the receipt was given I think for Mr. Smith, as I was careful not to mix the accounts; I had before refused to receive payment, and wrote to deliver the harness to Smith - I am not aware that the prisoner ever offored me any other cheque, but he offered to pay on several previous occasions, and I refused it; I think the negociation had been pending two months or longer.</p>
               <p>THE REV. MR. MACDONALD. The prisoner would not have occasion for more than the 1000l. during my absence- I had given him 50l. besides for general purposes; he had no need to apply this cheque to any other purpose.</p>
               <p>JUNIUS SMITH re-examined. Q. Did the prisoner ever pay you 21l., or bring to your knowledge that it had been received by a cheque? A. I was at the building, and he brought me money from town to pay for materials, and work people.</p>
               <p>THE REV. MR. MACDONALD. I have books with an account of money paid by Lee to Smith - I am sure this 21l. cheque was not returned to me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in a long address, stated that he had received the 21l. cheque himself, at Coutt's, and offered the cash to Mr. De Mole, as the prosecutor wished his name not be known in the concern - that on its being refused he had given the amount to the prosecutor, and that the prosecutor, on a settlement had acknowledged the receipt, as appeared by the account in question, and there was no other cheques to which the 21l. on that account could apply; that it must be evident if he had committed a fraud he would have taken the 130l. offered, rather than wait for a reference.</p>
               <p>MR. MACDONALD re-examined. Q. On this account there is "Self 21l.," and other items - were these sums taken out of any banker's book? A. I think not; I have no doubt this applies to myself in 1830; I think I made them from a private memorandum of my own in 1830; the prisoner never paid me a sum of 21l., or any other sum on any occasion; these figures could not refer to any transaction previous to 1830, as there are collections entered which could not be made till business began - here is on another part of the paper "Hodson 60l." - that might be about the commencement of the works in 1830 - I do not swear that it might not be in 1829; I do not see in my book any ac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080104"/>count of any other cheque of 21l. - here is one for 21l. 15s. in June, 1830; I am certain he did not return me the money.</p>
               <p>JUNIUS SMITH. I cannot say the prisoner did not pay me the 21l. among other monies at the works.</p>

            . I was in the employ of the Steam Washing Company. The prisoner did not pay me this 2l. 3s. 11/2d., but it has been accounted for since - he gave me some paper about February, and there is a memorandum about Miss Nicholls and others, but he never gave me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he leave the service? A. He was in the habit of coming till February - I have not brought the papers here.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. While he was in the office did he inform you of an error to this amount? A. He gave me the papers in February; the prosecutor had forbid his coming to the office then, but he was in the habit of coming and transacting business as usual.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did he account to you weekly or how? A. He should account when he received it; it was in the latter end of February that he gave me the papers - he charges himself with this sum, but never paid it; I do not recollect the account being paid.</p>

There was a great sum of money out - I received monies, and paid them; when Smith was discharged I took charge of the works - Mr. Macdonald came down and sent me to town to receive the accounts, and it is not likely I should account to an inferior clerk; I kept an account of what I received - I received this sum, and stuck the papers on the file, with a quantity of papers, and I overlooked it; in February I went to the file, and seeing these papers, I said, "Warner, I received from Miss Nicholls 2l. 2s. 6d., give me credit for it, I have credited Mr. Macdonald for it in my cash-book" - and the information he has got is from that very cash-book. If I intended wrong him should I have settled it at all?</p>
               <p>MR. MACDONALD. I desired Warner to receive mone when I dismissed the prisoner; that was about the 10th of January.</p>

            . I am of the firm of Halliday and Carter - we supplied blankets to the Steam Washing Company in 1830 - I have the books here; on the 2nd of January, 1830, we delivered goods to the amount of 7l. 13s. 4d. - I believe the bill of parcels went with the goods - on the 14th of January we supplied them with six pairs of cards, which came to 1l.; we had no other dealing with them till the 29th of May - we generally allow a discount for prompt payment - the first money we received was on the 23rd of April, 8l. 10s. discount 3s. 4d. - I received it by this cheque - this other cheque for 7l. 13s. I believe was never in my hand till now.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have known the prisoner many years? A. Yes - I entered his name in our book as the person to whom the goods were to be delivered, and made out the receipt in his name; this is it - it was given by my clerk; he stated it was on account of a Washing Company, and the gentleman did not wish his name to be known - I knew nothing of Mr. Macdonald, but he afterwards called on me and told me to make out the account to the Washing Company; the whole of the balance has not been paid to me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Had you received any money for goods between January and April? A. No - the balance not yet paid is a subsequent account. (Cheques read).</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY to MR. MACDONALD. Q. You had no account with this house till after these goods were purchased? A. No - I was arrested at the prisoner's suit, I think in March; it was before that I called on Messrs. Halliday and Carter to order the alteration to be made in the bills, as I had found out various things.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080105"/>MR. ALLEY to MR. CARTER. Q.Could it have been so early in March that he called? A. I cannot say, but I think not.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY to MR. MACDONALD. Q.Upon your solemn oath, was it not after you were arrested that you called? A. No, before - there was a bill of particulars delivered by my attorney; I pleaded a set-off, and was ordered to give the particulars of my account - I did give this very sum of 7l. 13s. 4d. in my set-off originally, and afterwards I amended it; after I had preferred my bill of indictment last Session, I gave in the amended particulars, omitting the sum for which I had indicted him - till I preferred the indictment it remained a matter of set-off against the claim he had for wages against me; I then altered it by omitting it - my solicitor advised it should be left out, for the purpose of sustaining the indictment.</p>
               <p>1830, January, Cash to pay Halliday and Carter's bill, but returned, 7l. 13s. 4d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I saw that the cheque of 7l. 13s. was charged to me, I naturally concluded that it had been given to me, and I gave Mr. Macdonald credit for it.</p>

             CUMMING. I am a surgeon. I was applied to to examine the child's head, in his father's presence; there were several causes which were sufficient to produce death - the carotid artery and the nerves were divided, and a great quantity of blood effused; that would have occasioned death - I saw him in about a quarter of an hour after the accident, but did not examine his head that night; in my judgment, the division of the carotid artery and the nerves was the immediate cause of his death; the explosion of gunpowder would have occasioned it; but I also found some wadding in the bottom of the wound, which was from one inch and a half to two inches deep.</p>

On the 19th of August I remember he went out about eleven o'clock in the evening, to get a little money owing to him - I expected him back that evening, but he had no key to let himself in - he used to get over the wall sometimes, and get in at his own bed-room window; the Police-officer called me up about two o'clock, and said somebody was in the house - I was going down stairs, and saw the prisoner on the stairs; I said, "Jem, how can you be so foolish, why did you not call me up, without knocking at the door, and making a bother with the Policemen?" I let the Policemen in at the back door - they said somebody had been in the bar - I opened the bar, and missed a 5s. paper of halfpence; it was safe about half an hour before I went to bed - I was in the tap-room when the prisoner was searched, but I cannot say, from the fright I was in, whether I saw the Police-officers take a bundle from him, but I heard it smack down on the table; I have no doubt it came out of the prisoner's pocket - I believe it is what I had taken for 5s.; I had locked the hat, but there is a sort of half-door, which a person might lift up and unbolt one holt, and any little thing would unbolt the other; the Policemen found this wire in the tap-room, it had come from a window of the stairs, where we keep empty cans; we found a candle in a gin measure; it was not there when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe the prisoner apprised you of his going out that night? A. Yes; he went to a person who owes both him and me some money, and he was to receive my money as well as his own; I will not venture to swear to the money or this paper - this money was outside the till - the prisoner did not appear confused; this was on Sunday morning, at two o'clock - workmen are frequently paid in copper on Saturday - there was only 1d. more found on him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you believe that to be your money? A. I do not know what to say about it - I think it is, but I cannot swear to it - the paper is a good deal like the one I had - there was but one paper of copper in my bag - I had two others that evening, but emptied them; I said before the Magistrate that I could not swear to the property.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did he not say, "Here are 5s. worth of coppers," and put them on the table? A. Yes; I found some keys in the prisoner's room - one of the landlord's door, and one of the cellar; a person could enter the bar by getting down the shutters, without opening the door; I found eight gilt farthings on the prisoner; I gave them back by the Magistrate's desire.</p>

             - we live in King-square.

I met the prisoners between seven and eight o'clock in the evening of the 13th of July, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house, in company together; Miller had a bundle - I asked what they had got - he said he did not know; I asked to see it - he put the bundle down; I opened it, and found this wet linen in it - I took them both in charge; I have seen them in company before, and know they are companions.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you really mean to say you were sober? A. I do; I had 236l. about me - it was my own, and the produce of my labour -I lodge in Oxford-market, and am now at work at Lambeth, for Mr. Armstrong, as a journeyman plasterer - I am forty-three years old; I was unfortunately led away - I had my trousers and boots on in the room - I had met her between eleven and twelve o'clock - I had come from the seat of his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury that evening - I arrived in town about five; I had come from Croydon in a go-cart, which took me up outside the Swan - I did not go into a public-house - several persons were in the go-cart - I have had very excellent jobs, by which I got the money; I have not charged any body else with this - three persons were brought to the office on suspicion of having the property, but not by my desire; they were no doubt connected with the prisoner; I have not charged any body with it but her - this was all the property I had - I have been earning it since 1817 -I thought it safer about my person than to leave it in my box - I have jobs at great country seats - I took about 190l. with me down to the Archbishop's; I had not looked at my money that evening, but I knew by the weight of the gold that it was there - it was in my inside coat pocket, wrapped in a silk handkerchief, and in three separate brown papers.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you had the notes? A. I had been no where but in respectable company - I am accustomed to come from Croydon in a go-cart - the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080112"/>soner was taken on the 22nd of August; she had abaconded - I looked for her for three weeks - I do not often go to houses of ill-fame - I am single - I am not in the habit of carrying money about me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What were the sovereigns in? A.In three separate pieces of brown paper, tied tight round with my handkerchief; I did not see the handkerchief in the morning, nor any of the paper.</p>

            . The prisoner Atkins is my brother; the two boxes were left at my house - he afterwards saw them and opened them; I saw a bottle in one of them - the Policeman took them away in the same state as they came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Should you know any of the boxes again? A. Yes; they came to my house between January and February - here is one of the boxes; I know it, because I am a painter and glazier, and I have mixed putty upon it.</p>
               <p>Richard Roper's Defence. Part of the things I confess to; but the rest. I solemnly declare, I bought out of my weekly earnings - the things found at my brother's I engaged him to carry to my father's house, he being a porter; as respects the other things I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>

He was; we bought some candles of him, also starch, mustard, blacklead, and salt - we asked him to buy them, thinking he could get them cheaper in town; I knew he was living with Mr. Marchant.</p>

On the 18th of August I shut up my shop, and they were going home to their supper; they live opposite; I stopped Wildey, and asked what he had got in that cloth - he said a piece of beef, which Butler gave him to take - Butler ran across, I followed and brought him back, and the Policeman took a breast of lamb from him: both joints were in my shop two minutes before, when I left the prisoners there; Wildey said,"Master I had nothing to do with it, Butler gave it me to hold, till he came from supper:" Wildey had told me a fortnight before to look out - the cloth this meat was in is mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Wildey was only an occasional man? A. Yes - when I took Wildey, Butler was crossing the street, and turned to go into the privy; he had been a long time with me, and I suspected he had been robbing me all the while: I stopped Wildey as soon as he got out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Butler's Defence. I never saw the beef - I picked the lamb up going through the market.</p>

            . I am the wife of Robert Savage, and keep an oyster-shop in Harp-alley. On Thursday, the 5th of August, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner bought 1d. worth of oysters, which he paid 1d. for and went away; he came again in ten minutes with another man, had 4d. worth of oysters and 1d. of bread - the prisoner paid me a shilling; I did not examine it - I asked my brother-in-law to examine it; he thought it good, and put it on the counter, but did not mix it with any other - after he left the watchman came up; I then sounded it on the counter - the watchman said, "You have given that man changed altbough I cautioned you:" the prisoner had new been gone a minute - my brother-in-law went in search of him I saw him in custody on the Sunday.</p>

The prisoner was in my service about eight months, and was employed to receive money, for which he was to account the same day - on the 1st of July I delivered him ten loaves for Mrs. Moore, and on the Tuesday following I gave him some more for her; I saw him no more till the following Friday, when the officer brought him to me - he had 18s. a week, and what bread and flour he wanted for his family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. When was the last day he received any money? A. On the Tuesday - I did not offer to the prisoner's wife to take from her the amount he had not accounted for; it was offered, and laid on the counter, but I refused to take it - my barrow had been broken; I did not hear that the prisoner had been drunk in a skittle-ground, till it was stated before the Magistrate - I would not have taken the money his wife offered me, if she had paid me for the barrow; I did not say I would look over this if he would pay the money, and make an apology; I said I would not hurt him on account of his family.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you deliver the prisoner any bread for Mrs. Denby? A. Yes - on the Friday and on the Tuesday; on the 30th of June I delivered him one loaf for Mrs. Lambert - on the 1st of July another - on the 2nd and the 4th one on each day, and she had one on the 5th, which was paid for.</p>
               <p>ANN MOORE. I am the wife of William Moore - we live at Lea-bridge. I received ten loaves of the prisoner on the Friday, and eight on the Tuesday; he brought them, and I paid him 12s. on the Tuesday for his master, to be paid the same day.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What time was it? A. About ten or eleven o'clock.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on Friday, the 8th of July - I told him it was for embezzling money and I asked what had become of it; he said he had lost it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not add that he had been into a skittle-ground, and been drunk? A. He did not then, but he did before the Magistrate; he did not say he had been robbed by some person putting their hand into his pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. DELVES. The prisoner has never accounted to me for these sums.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any book kept? A. I keep my own books; he does not keep any - he did not say that he had been drunk and been robbed; he sent word on Thursday night by his wife, that he had got a situation, and he would pay me by instalments.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master agreed with my wife and Mrs. Melville to take the money, if I would send a written apology - I sent the money to pay him, and also for the barrow, which was not broken while it was in my care; he took the written apology, read it, and showed it to his wife, and Mrs. Melville put the money down twice, but he would not take it - he said he would if I were discharged, but if not it would do to keep me in prison.</p>
               <p>MR. DELVES. He certainly did send a paper to me with an apology; I said that if he would send a written apology, and say he was sorry and pay the money, I would not have any thing further to do with it, but I was told I should get myself into trouble, and refused to have any thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080117"/>more to do with it; I would receive him into my employ again.</p>

In consequence of information I went to the warehouse on the 15th of July - I missed, I should think, two or three tons weight of modern law books in quires -I should think they were worth 2000l. or 3000l.; I received information, and have found a large quantity of it.</p>

            , JUN. I live with my father in Leather-lane - he is a tripe-dresser. On the 12th of July we bought two quantities of paper of the prisoner Thomas Wakeman; on the 14th he called again in the afternoon, and said he had about 10 cwt. of waste-paper, which I agreed to purchase of him, and on the 15th he brought it in a caravan - there was a young man with him, but I saw nothing of Lill; I paid him 4d. per 1b. for the paper, which is the price of good waste-paper: it came to 21l. 12s. 4d. - I kept it by itself, and Mr. Brettell came and claimed it the same day; I gave it up, and it is here to-day -

Yes; I have known Wakeman six or seven years, and my father much longer; I always considered him an honest fair dealing man - I had had dealings with him before, though not to so large an amount; I am not quite positive that he did not say he had it to sell for a person who brought it from a lawyer, but I understood he had it from a lawyer - Apollo-court and Bell-yard are very near Liucoln's Inn.</p>

            . I am a carter, and live in New-court, Peter's-lane, Cow-cross. On the evening of the 14th of July, Wakeman came to me in the stable yard, and said,"I want you to do a job for me between five and six o'clock in the morning;" he told me to take my cart, and remove some paper - I asked him what quantity; he said he did not exactly know, but he supposed four or five hundred weight - I said it was an awkward time, and an awkward morning, but I agreed to go, and I went with my cart and horse towards his house, where he had told me to go, but as I was going up Warner-street I saw Wakeman and Lill, apparently coming from Wakeman's house; we stopped at a public-house in Warner-street, and all went in and had something to drink - there was another person with him, who was a stranger to me; we staid about a quarter of an hour - Wakeman then told me to go to Carey-street; the strange man went on before my cart, and Wakeman and Lill went up Eyre-streetbill into Leather-lane - when I got into Leather-lane I passed them with my cart; the strange man still kept on before my cart, but on his turning out of Chancery-lane into Carey-street I lost him - I then drove on about fifty yards past Bell-yard; the strange man then called to me to back my cart as far down Bell-yard as the pavement - I tried to do so, but I could not get it above half-way down; while I was backing, the strange man and another strange man, each of them, brought a large bundle of paper out of a turning in Bell-yard, but I do not know where it leads to - it was on the left-hand side in Bellyard; they put the bundles of paper into the cart, and I let down the tail-board, unbuckled the seat, and got the cart in order while they brought some more - they kept bringing out till I expect they had got about 7 cwt. in the cart; I told them that was as much as my pony and cart could draw - they said I must take some more, they had not got much more - they brought out two bundles more, and said there was some more; I told them I could not take any more then, I must come a second time - I then began to tie some ropes across, and they brought out three bundles more; I tied them on, and moved my horse up Bell-yard till I came opposite the large new building, and there my cart, being loaded heavy behind, it swagged - both the shafts broke right off, and it went up; a great deal of paper fell off - the strange man told me I must go and get another cart; I said I did not know where to get one without going home - one of the strange men said he would go and look for one; while I was taking out the paper, and tying it up as well as I could, another cart came up; I took away my broken cart - after I had taken it home I went to Mr. Wakeman's house, and his wife paid me by his order; I do not know what became of the paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Yours is a pony-cart? A. Yes; I will not say whether Wakeman had an apron on - I had seen him many times with an apron; one of the strange men had an apron when I came - I had known Wakeman, and worked for him for two years; it was about twenty minutes before seven o'clock when my cart broke down - there were plenty of people about; I did not see Wakeman after I passed him about the middle of Leather-lane - I think that is a quarter of a mile from Bell-yard; I think I received in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080118"/>formation about eight o'clock or a quarter past eight the same morning, that Mr. Butterworth had lost paper - I know a man named Chidley, and had been to his house; I had been to Wakeman's house before that, but I did not then know of the robbery; I went to Wakeman's as soon as I got home, to try to get some recompense for my cart - Mrs. Wakeman said that Wakeman and the people were gone to take the paper to Chidley; I went to Chidley, and asked if Mr. Wakeman had been there - I heard there that the paper had been stolen, but from whom I did not know; I went back to Wakeman's - he was close by, and was sent for into the presence of me and Chidley; it was then about nine o'clock; Wakeman asked me how much I charged for my cart - I said 1s. 6d. was what he generally gave me for jobs that lasted about an hour, and he told his wife to pay me; I asked Mr. Chidley if he wanted me any more - he took my address, and I went home.</p>

On the morning of the 15th of July I was at the end of Fetter-lane, by St. Dunstan's church, when I was called by two persons, whom I did not know, to go with my cart and take some paper; they took me up Chancery-lane, down Carey-street, and up Bell-yard, where I saw a cart broken down, and some paper in the mud - but before that, one of the two men had left me in Chancery-lane, and I saw no more of him till my cart was unloaded again; they first told me I was to take the paper to Mr. Emblin's, but when I got to the corner of Back hill, the man who was then with me said, "Down here;" I said "This is Back-hill" - he said Yes, but he took me down Eyre-street-hill to Mr. Wakeman's shop - there is written over the door "Stationer and rag-merchant;" the person who had loaded my cart was there, and Mr. Wakeman, who is the other person who had spoken to me about the cart, but did not go all the way with me, came there when the cart was unloaded - the person who had gone with me all the way paid me 2s., which he got from Mr. Wakeman - I saw him received it; I did not see Lill - I have known him a number of years.</p>

            . I know Lill. On the morning of the 15th of July I saw him in Bell-yard, which is near my house; he was shoving forward a truck with some paper in it - it was about half-past six, or twenty minutes to seven o'clock; there were two men in front of the truck, pulling it, and Lill pushed behind - I passed by them, and saw them when the cart broke down; I had known Lill before.</p>
               <p>Lill. I was not there at all, nor near the place: he said before that it was seven o'clock when he was there.</p>
               <p>Witness. I said between six and seven o'clock; I had to go to Chapel-street, Lamb's Conduit-street, and I got there before seven o'clock - the cart breaking down first attracted my notice; I thought the paper might be Mr. Howard's - It did not strike me that it was a robbery; there were several people about, asking what was the matter - I spoke to Lill, and said, "Joseph you have got a good master, for he is teaching you to draw," meaning that a man is not a finished bricklayer till he is able to draw plans; my son was with me - but he is not here.</p>

            . This is part of Mr. Butterworth's paper; I tied it up myself, and put this card on it; it is Chitty's Commercial Law, Nos. 2, 3, and 4.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When did you see it? A. I put it there in December last; I cannot say when I saw it last, perhaps a month before; Mr. Butterworth is an extensive publisher - some law-books sell better than others; it is customary to sell works for waste-paper, which will not sell in books - Chitty's Commercial Law is a very saleable work.</p>
               <p>Wakeman's Defence. Had I been in the least aware of being brought to a place like this, I could have produced proper documents to prove my innocence; the man I bought the first paper of is Bowyer, whom I have known for twenty-five years - he is a rag-dealer and dealer in paper: I could often sell paper for him, when he could not sell it himself - I sold twenty-four reams for him to Mr. Johnson, of Bishopsgate-street; I am aware that the law must take its course, but I am as innocent as I was the day I was born - Mr. Chidley called on me, and said, "You have had some paper;" I told him Yes, and where I had sold it: I went with him to Mr. Butterworth's, told him where I sold it, and he got it all backthe last parcel of paper I bought of a person a total stranger to me, to whom Lill introduced me; I said to the person, "I think you sold some of this paper to Bowyer:" he said, Yes he had, but should not sell him any more, for he could not get his money from him.</p>
               <p>Lill's Defence. I never recommended Wakeman - the truth was this, two persons told me they had some wastepaper to sell, and I said I knew a person who bought it; I sent them to him with it, and he made the agreement - what it was I do not know, but I heard it was some where in Lincoln's Inn.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. But whether what Wakeman said was true, you cannot tell? A. No; there were many cases inquired about; I knew nothing of the robbery, but what Mr. Brettell had told me - I had bought paper of Wakeman three or four times; I never went to a warehouse to get paper away - I do not think I told the prosecutor of Wakeman having said he bought it of Joe, the bricklayer - I cannot say whether I did or not; I believe I told him all that Wakeman said.</p>

            . I live in Market-street, Newingtoncauseway, and am a general-dealer. I have known the prisoner some time - she keeps a marine-store shop, in Portpool-lane; I have heard that she is married. In July last (I cannot tell what day) I bought some paper of her, which I sold to Mr. Cohen; I sold it him by sample before I bought it in the bulk - Mr. Cohen had the same paper and quantity that I bought; I bought it of her on a Friday, and sold it to Cohen on a Monday, but I should state, that before I went to the prisoner's I met Mr. Cambridge, in Holborn, and he asked me if I was going to his daughter's (meaning the prisoner) - it was in consequence of what he said I went to her; I said that her father told me to call - she then said she had paper to sell, and fetched me about a quire as a sample, which she brought from up stairs; she asked 3d. per lb. for it - I offered her 21/2d.; she said she could not take that - that it was her father's property, and she sold it for him; I took the sample, and said I would let her know - I went to Mr. Cohen, showed it to him, and asked him 5d. per lb. for it; he offered me 4d. - I went back to the prisoner's, and bought one lot first; I think I then took three or four hundred weight, but I do not know exactly - she said it had been weighed before; I said I should like to see it weighed again, and a lad, who was in her shop, helped me to fetch it down stairs and weigh it - we got it from a little room on the first floor: I did not no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080120"/>tice whether it was a bed-room or not - I do not exactly know what quantity I had in all; I paid her 3d. a pound for it, and sold it to Mr. Cohen for 4d.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WEBSTER. I live at Waltham Abbey, Essex. In the month of January last I went to an eating-house, in Shoreditch, and in a short time the prisoner came in; he ordered some dinner, and soon afterwards another person came in - the prisoner and I had spoken before the other man came in; we all sat there in coversation some time, and then went to a public-house opposite <placeName id="t18310908-263-crimeloc1345">Shoreditch</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Were you ever in London before this? A. Yes, many scores of times; I had taken part of the money that day - I think it was near two o'clock in the day; I think it was about the 28th of January - I mentioned my loss to the landlord; I did not go to any magistrate in London - I never mentioned it to my wife; I told nobody of it but my brother-in-law, and the publican, until after I found the prisoner - I am sure I am not mistaken in him; he told me he was a drover, and he was dressed like one, but at the races he was dressed quite like a gentleman - I had not been drinking before I met with him; I might have taken a glass of ale.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long were you in company with the prisoner? A.I think an hour or more in the eating-house, and an hour or more in the public-house; we were in constant conversation - I noticed his voice and features; I have no doubt at all he is the man, though he was very differently dressed - when I seized him, he said, "What do you want me for? I have done nothing;" I recognized his features - I do not know what became of the farthings; the publican said he did not know him - I was quite sober; after he had thrust it in, I felt to see if it was safe, and felt them, as I thought - when he was gone I discovered they were farthings.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.The farthings were in the paper? A. Yes; I cannot say whether it was the same paper the sovereigns had been in - they were both brown paper.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was at Enfield races on the 21st of July - the prisoner was given into my charge - he struggled very much to get away; there were two or three attempts at rescue - I found on him a good sovereign, a had one, and a sixpence; he denied the charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent of the charge.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES McCABE. I am a surgeon, and live in College-street, Westminster. To the best of my recollection I have seen the prisoner, at least I think he is the man, whom I attended from the 12th of January to about the middle of February; he was very ill - he might go out, but I think it must have been with very much pain; his complaint was the hydrocele, attended with much inflammation, for which I applied leeches twice - he might perhaps limp across the road, but I think he was not in a condition to walk the streets - I attended him at No. 12, Edward-street, New-street, Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to attend the prisoner there if you reside at Westminster? A. I was solicited to do so by a person named Webb, a silversmith, whom I attended for the same complaint, in Weymouth-terrace - I will not undertake to swear the prisoner is the same person - he was then dressed very shabbily; he wore a dirty flannel jacket, and had whiskers - I speak to his person generally; if I were to examine him I could speak posilively.</p>
               <p>SUSAN BARNARD. I am a widow, and live in St. John-street, Brick-lane. I have known the prisoner for four years, and worked for him - I attended him in January, for an illness which he caught at his brother's funeral, and Mr. McCabe attended him; his brother was buried on Tuesday, the 11th of January - he had died the 31st of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080121"/>December; I was called to attend the prisoner on the 12th, and I applied seven leeches, and next day seven more - he did not go out till the 15th of February, when he took his own little boy with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know any public-house in shoreditch? A. No; when he went out he was dressed in corded trousers, a blue coat, with gilt buttons, and a black waistcoat.</p>

            . I was up stairs dressing; when I came down my niece said, "There is a box for Fulham," and I booked it - my husband was ill in bed at the time; I remember it was di<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080122"/>rected to "Master Cartwright, North-end, Fulham," not to Burlington-house - that I can swear to; after booking it I gave it to the Hammersmith carrier, as the Fulham carrier did not call, and knowing they were both in one neighbourhood; I should think it could make no difference whether Burlington-house was on it or not - I read the direction twice over to the carrier, who told me he could leave it next morning, which was Sunday, but not that night.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Barnett, the Hammersmith carrier. I remember the box being delivered to me, directed to Master Cartwright; I took it to Northend, but could not find the owner - I then took it to Mr. Donaldson's shop, and left it there all night; next morning I saw the prisoner inquiring for Mrs. Barnett's stable- I did not know him before, but I told him I was her servant - he then asked me if I had a box directed to Master Cartwright, to be left at North-end, Fulham; he said it ought to have been directed to be left at the Red Lion, near North-end, Fulham - that he had been to the person who sent it; that he told him he sent it to the booking-office on the Friday, that he had been to the booking-office, and they told him Mrs. Barnett's cart had it; I came with him to the lane close to our yard, where he saw another man waiting for him, and he told him he had found it; I then went to the shop where I had left it, took it out, and walked with them towards North-end; they asked me what the carriage was - I said 1s.; they said, as I had had so much trouble and running about, they would give me another 1s. - the other man gave the prisoner 1s., and the prisoner gave me 2s., and they took away the box, which has never been found; when they were gone I began to think that all was not right - I ran after them, and said that I would rather go with them and deliver it myself; they said I need not do that, as there were two of them, and they had been sent for it - we went on as far as the Three Kings; we there had a pint of ale, and I went away - on the Saturday after we heard that it was lost, and on the Tuesday after I saw the prisoner and the other man, walking in Holborn; I jumped out of my cart, got a woman to mind it, and followed them from Grays' Inn-lane, to Chancery-lane, with an intention of finding an officer, but I did not see one; I then went up to them, and said,"A pretty row you have got me into about this box:" the prisoner said, "There is a row if you will go along with me, I'll put it all right" - he called the other man Jack or John, and said "Here's the man about this box;" the prisoner said to me "Can you go with me to Harry's?" I said I could not, but I saw my mistress in another cart; I asked him to go and speak to her, which he did; she asked him to go to the booking-office and make it all right there - he said he would, and he went on till he came to a court; he ran down there into a house; I ran after him, collared him and pulled him back - I am sure he is the man; his companion had gone off.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why did not you take us both? A. I could not; I do not think the other staid five minutes -I followed you up Holborn, and you were looking into a shop; if I had seen an officer I would have given charge of you both - you told my mistress the box was all right.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not find I had lodged at a barber's shop there? A. Yes, at No. 28, not No. 3.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I consider it is a concerted plan, between the carrier and her man; I can assure you, however clear their evidence is against me, that I was not at Hammersmith at that time; I was not out of town till eleven o'clock that day, when I was at the Elephant and Castle; I took my breakfast in Drury-lane at nine o'clock: it is very clear some person changed the direction, and it is an astonishing thing to me, that the porter does not know something about it - it must have been somebody connected with the booking office that did it.</p>

This watch is mine - I lost it on Monday, the 11th of July, between half-past twelve and a quarter to one o'clock- I went out for about three minutes, and in that time I lost the watch - when I went out it was on a chest of drawers in the front parlour; I met Harris going out of my house as I went in; the street door had been left ajar, and the parlour door had the key in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Did you ever say Jones was the person you saw coming out of the house? A. No; I had been to get some beer for my dinner, and saw a stranger come out; I turned and looked after him - I have some lodgers, but I knew he was not one of them; I do not take notice of every one who comes in or goes out - I saw him about two minutes- I looked at his face; I knew he had a light waistcoat on; he had his hat on, and I think a coloured cravat</p>
               <p>Jones. On the second hearing the prosecutrix said she could swear I was the man that came out of the house, and when she got to the office, she swore to Harris. Witness. I never said so.</p>
               <p>Jones' Defence. Harris asked which was the way to High-street; I was directing him, and took my watch out</p>

I let the prisoners a furnished room on my first floor, about Christmas, at 5s. a week; they paid regularly till within the last five weeks- the woman said her husband was a cabinet-maker; we had given them warning several times, not liking them, and they left on Tuesday, the 14th of July, without saying a word - I was at home; they had nothing of their own, and walked out of the house - I did not expect they were going for good; I got into their room with the key of another door, which we found would open it, and missed all the articles stated in the indictment; the man returned by the house, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night - I sent for an officer, and gave him in charge; they had no right whatever to pawn my property - they owed me five weeks' rent; the lodging was let in the usual way - I had no security for the furniture; we asked for the rent - he sent us down a few duplicates of wearing-apparel, as security for rent, and I found they belonged to another person.</p>

The same afternoon; I did not know before - I had been continually asking them for a pair of sheets, which I had lent them, and as they did not return them, I suspected they might be pawned; we did not find them in linen - my husband, on the Friday before, had threatened to send for an constable to turn him out, because he would not leave; we did not like him in the house, because he came home at all hours - they sent down twelve tickets on the Sunday, and said they would pay the rent on the Tuesday; they were not as security for the property - I did not know it was pawned.</p>

            . I keep a carver and gilder's shop, within about twenty doors of this linen-draper's. I saw the two prisoners following the prosecutor; I and Taylor, whom I met, watched them - the prosecutor stopped at a shop; the next thing I saw was Taylor taking hold of Thompson - I then saw Thompson throw the handkerchief away; Frewster stood a yard or two from him, and could not avoid seeing what he did - he went away when Thompson was taken; next day as I was taking Thompson to the station-house, I saw Frewster at some distance - knowing him I went after him; he ran away, but I took him in about ten minutes, in White Conduit-fields.</p>

            . I live at Pentonville. I was with Colton for about five minutes, and saw the lady and gentleman stop at the linen-draper's window; the prisoners then went on each side of them - Thompson then pulled the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket; I caught him in my arms directly he came away - Erewster ran away.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Thompson put in a written Defence, stating that he was going to bathe, and picked the handkerchief up in the street, not knowing who it belonged to - that he gave it up immediately it was claimed.</p>
               <p>JURY to WILLIAM COLTON. Q.Did you see the prisoners in company? A. I had seen them together for three hours, passing backwards and forwards from the Angel.</p>
               <p>GEORGE TAYLOR. I saw Thompson take the handkerchief - Frewster ran away directly.</p>

No, I was sitting at a door; he saw me, and came and took it off my finger - I had my head resting on my elbows, and the string of the reticule round my finger; I was alone - I had been with a few friends, and being very tired, sat down and fell asleep; the prisoner taking the reticule off my finger awoke me - I immediately got up, and went after him; it is not a place of resort for Policemen.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Dalston-lane, about three hundred yards from where the prosecutrix was sitting, which was in a brickmaker's shed- she was a stranger to me; I saw the prisoner enter the shed, reach his hand forward, as if to take something, and steal back - I had not then see the prosecutrix; he entered the next field, and in about a minute the prosecutrix came round the field, and hallooed after him - I followed him to Hackney-downs, and took him; I found the purse in his right-hand jacket pocket, with a crown-piece, a half-crown, and 8s. 6d. in it - he said he had picked it up; I kept the purse concealed till I got to the prosecutrix - I then asked her the colour of it; she said red, which it was - he had the reticule in his hand.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out of employ about four months, and had nothing to eat; I thought I could go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080127"/>down to Lincolnshire - when I got to Delston I was tired, I went into the brick-field, and sat down till one o'clock; I then saw some person, whether it was the prosecutrix I do not know - I fell asleep till nearly three; when I awoke I saw this old sand-house, and thought I would go and lay there - I went, and saw the prosecutrix and another person, who I suspected was the Policeman; they were asleep - I turned to where I had been laying, then got up, and came to this place - I saw something black laying about a foot within the door; I picked it up, and found it was this bag with some biscuits in it - I was very hungry, and did not think of there being money in it; I went on, took a biscuit out to eat, and a halfpenny dropped out - I then felt, and found the purse.</p>
               <p>M. A. WILLIAMS. I had been out the Saturday night with my friends: it was late when I left them, and I sat down in this place, about four o'clock, and dozed - there was nobody there all the time I was; I am sure I did not drop my reticule; there were four biscuits in it.</p>

            . I am a coach-spring maker, and made these springs on Mr. George's premises - I saw them there about three weeks before they were lost, and on the 29th I saw them in the officer's possession; I know McDonald by sight - he is a stranger to the premises.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HUSON. I am a Policeman. On the 28th of July, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners together at Mr. Jones', a pawnbroker, High Holborn- they were both leaning over the counter on which the springs lay, offering them in pawn; they came out together; I took McDonold, and in about an hour and a half, in consequence of information, I charged him with stealing the springs - he said he would fetch the master who gave them to him in half an hour; I trusted him to go, but he never brought any body to me to own them -I found him in the shop of Mr. Washbrook, a springmaker, for whom he worked; I took Donoghue that evening - he said he had nothing to do with the springs, he merely carried them there for a man: I brought the springs from the pawnbroker's, and have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>McDonald. I came to the station of my own accord. Witness. I told his master if he came in to detain him, but I met his master bringing him to the station.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>McDonald's Defence. Seven weeks last Thursday, as I was going to breakfast, I met this man and another opposite St. Giles' church; being in the habit of pawning for my master, to get the work on, this man asked me to show him where I pawned, and as it was in my way home, I did so.</p>
               <p>Donoghue's Defence. On Sunday evening I stood at the corner of Drury-lane; a man came up in his shirtsleeves and a hairy cap; he asked me to carry a parcel, and if I had a basket - I said No; I borrowed one - the man took me into a stable in Parker-street; he told a man to put the things into my basket, and told me to meet him at eight o'clock on Monday morning; I went, and he brought out the springs and asked me to pawn them; this man being in the habit of pawning, I asked him where to go.</p>

On the 27th of June, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner going down Parliament-street with a soldier, who was having words with her; she had some thing in her hand - the soldier said, "You have something there, I will give you in charge;" I walked over, and saw her put her hand to her bosom - she turned a corner, and began to run; I followed her, and put my hand on her shoulder - she then took this watch from her bosom, and threw it away; I asked what it was - she said she had no watch; I took it up.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prosecutor and prisoner walking towards Waterloo-bridge - one of them had his handkerchief hanging out, and I told him of it; I saw them turn, and both fall down - I assisted to help the prosecutor up - he then walked towards Waterloobridge; he appeared to have been drinking - the prisoner said, "He is an acquaintance of mine," and walked after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When they fell down were their hats off? A. Yes, and they might be changed at that time.</p>
               <p>J. C. RAWLEY. The prisoner had only this one hat when I took him - I recollect seeing their hats fall off, and I particularly noticed the prisoner's hat; he put his own hat on his head, not this one - his hat was a very indifferent one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not this such a hat as the little boys in the street follow, crying "Shocking had hat?" A. I should think not - I went to the hatter, and found the prosecutor by that means; I took the prisoner opposite Wellington-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent. I was very much intoxicated, and cannot say whether that was the gentleman I was with or not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were not the parcels he had to take out in the warehouse? A. Yes, he had to take out five or six; these diapers were within three or four yards of them - he told me it was a mistake; he had been entrusted with considerable sums of money - I never had any quarrel with him; I have heard him complain that I imposed more work on him than I did on the other men, but I did not do so - he had got about one hundred yards from the door when I took him; I did not say before the Magistrates that it was twenty yards - I think not.</p>

On the 8th of August I went to the theatre, at half-past nine o'clock, leaving the property all secure; I left only the prisoner in the house - I was sent for, and informed something had occurred; I got home at twenty minutes past ten o'clock - I saw the prisoner at home; she said, "My dear creature, you are ruined, and robbed of your money, watch, chain, and two silk dresses," but I found the silk<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080135"/>dresses were not gone; I asked if she had seen any one- she said she fancied some one brushed by her in the back yard; I asked her what sort of a person it was - she said he had a great-coat on; I took the candle, went up stairs, and found the three drawers were turned out of my chest of draweres, and were all in confusion - I had left them locked; I asked her where she had been - she said in at the next house playing at cards, and while there she heard a double knock at my door; that she thought I had come home, and she asked them to let her get over the back way and get in at the back door - she went to the street door, and found it bolted; the officer then came in, and I gave charge of the prisoner; I had a gold watch in my drawer, and the prisoner had seen me put three sovereigns to twenty-two, in a purse in the drawer, while she was making the bed in the morning; I left it all safe when I went to the play - I have never seen the watch or the money since; no person but the prisoner knew they were there - a table-cloth and spoon were afterwards produced, which I had not missed then; I afterwards found a key in the bottom of the coal-hole, which unlocked all my drawers; I believe I had seen that key in the prisoner's possession; my drawers had not been broken open - the prisoner went by the name of Lill when she first came to me; that was her first husband's name.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was there any thing to have prevented the prisoner from absconding before you got home? A. No; there is a communication to the next house by the back way- she might have come in that way; 3s. 6d. was found on her; a Mrs. Carter might have visited at my house unknown to me - I have since heard she was in the habit of coming; I believe search has been made for her- the prisoner sent for me home, and told me of this; I know the persons who live at the next house - I have visited there, but not played at cards or drank tea there; I never allowed the prisoner to go - there is a kitchen and a wall between the two back doors; I have gone by the name of Thompson, but my name is Vincent.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty, and went to this house; the prisoner was there, but the prosecutrix had not arrived - the prisoner said her mistress had been robbed of money and jewellery during her absence next door; that the people said there was a double-knock at the door, and as her mistress had desired her not to leave the house, she got over the back wall - when she got to the street door, she found it bolted; she said she fancied all was not right, went up stairs, found the drawers out, and missed the property - she said she fancied that as she got over the wall some one brushed by her, but it being dark she thought it was a cat; but when she found the drawers had been opened, she thought it was a person in a dark coloured coat; she went up again with me, and I saw the doors opened - I went backwards, and scaled several walls, but saw no one; there was nothing found on her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What sort of a neighbourhood is this? A. The square is very respectable; some of the streets adjoining have bad houses in them, but I know of only one bad house in that street, and that is the prosecutrix's.</p>

Yes - Bell, Bentley, and Co., in Cheapside, became customers of mine a few days after the prisoner came into my service; I charge the prisoner with selling goods to them, and not accounting to me for them - I did not trust him with a very large stock; I never allowed him any commission on what he sold, or agreed to do so - I keep some books, but when he took out goods for sale I merely made a memorandum of them, and looked over the box when he came back; he should account as soon as he came home - I entered the goods that were sold in a day-book; I have not brought that book - these sums I charge him with are entered in the day-book, but not as paid; I have no means of knowing what he sold, except from the day-book, and the bills of parcels.</p>

               <p>COURT to CHARLES JAMES FOX. Q. Did he at any time give you an account of the 6s.? A. He said he had sold the goods, and he was to call again for the money.</p>

            . I am eleven years old. I went to the Park with my two little brothers; the keeper would not let us in, because we had pinafores on, and I was not old enough to mind them; the prisoner came up, and told us to keep inside the Park; I said the keeper would not let us; she spoke to him; she then came and told me to go round to the Horse-guards' gate; she was then within a few yards of Storey's-gate; she gave me a penny, and said, "Go and get a penny worth of apples" - I had some playthings and an apple in my lap; she said, "That apple is not large enough for you, go and fetch a pennyworth;" I went, and when I came back she was gone, and my two brothers too - I was not gone long; I said, "William and Johnny don't go away"- she said, "No, I'll take care of that;" one of them is six and the other four years old.</p>

            . I live in Tothill-street, Westminster. From Wednesday to Friday I was in the greatest distress about my children, and out day and night; I found one in the workhouse in Shoe-lane, and the other in Shoreditch workhouse - the youngest had a pinafore over him, with his little trousers; the other had scarcely any thing on - I took my daughter, Caroline, to the prison; all the female prisoners were turned into the yard; she pointed the prisoner out among twenty, immediately; I have not found their clothes.</p>

I said,"How came you by the two sovereigns you spent yesterday?" she said she was married to a man who gave her one, and that her former master gave her another - she said,"You may search me, I have not a single shilling;" I took her to the station-house - a sovereign, 4s. 6d., and the duplicate of a watch were found on her - we asked where the young man she was married to lived; she never told us - we found in her box a gold seal, which I had missed, and a key which opened my drawer, also a pair of shoes of her mistress, and a street-door key - we found out the young man; I asked him for the watch Jane had given him; he gave me a watch; I had lost two watches, and about six sovereigns had been stolen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is your real name Fouracres? A. It is - I have been married these eleven years - I have been called Jones by some people; the landlady said it was a long name, and I might as well go by the name of Jones only - I went by the name of

             Fouracres at the first examination - I have every reason to believe so; I will not swear it, for my mind is so tortured I scarcely know what I do say; I am convinced I gave my right name - I washed for a Mr. Willoughby, a bookseller, in Goswell-street; I then lived just by Aske-street, Hoxton - I will be on my oath I never pawned his clothes; I have lived in Beverden-street - I went by the name of Fouracres there; it is about twelve months ago that I washed for Willoughby; I then lived in Beverden-street - it might be nine months ago that I left there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Willoughby lose any of his linen? A. I will not answer these questions, it has nothing to do with this- if he thinks proper to come forward, I will answer him, but not strangers; he did not charge me with stealing his linen - I did not remove about his linen; I heard that he had lost some.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he got nothing back from you but pawnbroker's duplicates? A. I do not know any thing of the kind; I saw a great many duplicates - I saw Mr. Willoughby yesterday, and should think if he had any thing against me he would have stopped me; I do not know Phoebe Jones, or John Baker - the property in the trunk formerly belonged to

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Bedding before the Magistrate? A. Yes, once - he gave evidence; the prosecutrix went by the name of Jones, and when before the Magistrate she gave the name of Diana Fouracres Jones- she first gave her name as Jones, and then as Fouracres, because the Magistrate said she had no right to the name of Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he find out that her name was Fouracres? A. She told him so herself; he asked if she went by any other name - she has not told me how much a day I shall get for coming here, and I never heard; the prosecutrix knows

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 24th of August, I should think; but cannot exactly recollect the day; I found him in Willowgardens, and told him he was charged with stealing a portmanteau, cutting it open, and taking the top part of the contents out - I collared him; he said there was no occasion for that, he would go quietly; he said nothing, but went willingly - I found the portmanteau in Mrs. Fouracres' place: Bedding came to the first examination; he went to the office with the prisoner and me - he gave evidence, and was ordered to come the following day to have his deposition taken, but he absconded; I saw him here yesterday.</p>

I heard of the portmanteau on the Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon; I was present when the prisoner was apprehended, it was on a Friday - there were two persons taken; we said they were wanted for cutting open a pormanteau - the prisoner said he knew nothing about it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure he said he knew nothing about it? A. Yes; Morley was present; I do not know whether he heard it - we came into the gardens in a sort of triangular way, and there were five of them standing together - we took two; there had been three seen together, it was so given in evidence - I think the woman herself saw the parties together; the little girl said she saw them together about the same time - Morley and I might have been a yard and a half apart when he said he knew nothing about it; it was I collared him, and not Morley.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear? A. Morley came up to the two first, and he had hold of him; he gave him up to me, and it was while I had him, that he said he knew nothing about it; it is very likely Morley heard that.</p>
               <p>MRS. FOURACRES. This is the portmanteau which was taken from my room.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Brand, a butcher. On the 2nd of August, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was in Drummond-street, and saw both the prisoners; this van stood between the Royal George and Drummond-street - I saw Lawrance get on the van, and shift the looking-glass out of the body of the chariot, and put it by the side of the van; Berry was at the other side of the van, and could see what he was doing - they walked up and down, and in about ten minutes they went to the side of the van; Lawrance took the looking-glass off the van, and gave it to Berry, who put it under his coat, and went away with it - I went and told the carman; I then went to look for Berry, but he was out of sight - Lawrance stood by the van, and said he had only been shifting the ropes; I saw Mr. Bond in about five minutes, and told him what I had seen - Just before Lawrance said he had been shifting the ropes, he offered me and 
               <persName id="t18310908-329-person2377">Lewis</persName>
             a penny between us to run into Wilstod-street, to touch the first coach in the rank, and bring him back the number, but we stood round the corner of Seymour-street, and watched - we came back, told him we had been, and there was no coach there; he walked up and down a little, then gave us a penny, and said,"Go away, because here is our master, and he don't like to see any boys here;" we then went round the corner, watched, and saw him give the glass to Berry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q.How far were you from the van? A.Just across the road; the van was heavily laden-Berry was on the side nearest to us, and Lawrance on the other side; I could see it was a lookingglass, for it made a shadow against the gas-light - I had seen Berry before, but did not know him; he was close to us - I never said it was a picture; I went round the van, and saw what Lawrance did - we looked under the van; Berry came round, said he could not find it, and made some motion - we were round the corner when we saw Lawrance give it to Berry; they were both on one side then - the van was not between us and the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Where do you come from? A. Charlotte-street, Somers'-town - I am out of employ; I lived with Mr. Grange, and was turned away - Lewis lives with his father, who keeps a horse and cart; Lawrance told us to go about our business, but we went round the corner when he said that - the carman was in the public-house, talking to Mr. Bond, when I told him.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old; I live in Drummond-square, with my parents - they kept a coalshed and green-grocer's formerly, but now keep a horse and cart; I was with Wood, about three o'clock - the goods were stolen about eight or nine, in Drummond-street - I saw Lawrance get on the van, and shift the glass out of the body of the carriage, to the side of the van; he then came down, and said he was only fastening the ropes- Berry was just at the side of him; Lawrence said,"Which of you will run fastest to Wilsted-street, and touch a coach?" he spoke to me, Wood, and another boy; we ran round the corner, and watched them - we came back, said we had touched a coach, and asked them for a penny, which he said he would give us; he said, "Go away a bit, and I will give it you directly, but our master is behind us;" he came up afterwards, gave us the penny, and said, "Now go away, I'll take care of the van;" we went round the van, saw him get into it, and give the glass to Berry, who went away with it - I told Bond and the carman of it directly; they were both together - I could see the glass glittering about, as the gas was lighted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you directly said to the other boy, "Here is the looking-glass?" A. Yes: and he said "Let us go and tell Bond, and the man"- the carman had told us to mind the van, and feed the horses, and said he would give us 1d.; when Lawrance took the glass, and gave it to Berry, I was at the side of the van, about half a yard off - he got on the wheel, got the glass off, and gave it to Berry, who was just by, waiting to take it; we saw him go away with it - when I saw Lawrance first take the glass, I was on the pavement, near the van; I did not see Wood peep under the van-I have not talked to him about this: there might he twenty people about - I went and told Bond; I did not call out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q.Perhaps there were twenty people looking on at the time? A. We were round the corner, watching them, and saw them take the glass; we saw the shadow of it.</p>

            . I live in Little Drummond-street- the George public-house is in Great Drummond-street I am an engraver. On Tuesday, the 2nd of August, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I had occasion to wait at the George for a friend, who was talking to a person he had met; during that time Lawrance was holding the horse of a cart, containing ginger-beer - I saw him climb up behind the wheel of the van, put his hand into the the body of a chariot, and take something out, which I suppose was too heavy for him; he immediately put it down - he then got a looking-glass out of the chariot, and placed it by the side of the wheel; he then took it up, and put it on the other side of the van, within his reach - Berry came out of the public-house, looked me in the face, and went to the corner of Seymour-street; he then returned into the public-house; he came out in a very few minutes - I saw these two boys standing at the corner of Seymour-street; Berry passed me two or three times -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080142"/>he then went round the van, he could not find the glass, and said to Lawrance, "Where is it?" Lawrance said, "If you can't find it, I will;" he then went, reached it down from the van, and gave it into Berry's possession - Berry went off down Seymour-street with it; I immediately informed the carman - I saw Berry at three o'clock next day, and gave him into custody; he had a different coat on, but I knew his face.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How often had you seen him before? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. How much did you have at the house? A. A pint of beer, and half a pint of gin; I did not drink it all - I did not notice how many girls were there; I treated nobody but the prisoner - I merely went to out of the room - I did not send her out for gin, nor give her any money at all.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was he not very much intoxicated? A. Not at all; the first thing the prisoner said to me was," Is the man got out of bed."</p>

The prosecutor told me he had taken 2s. of this man - I did not write this paper; I saw it at the Northampton Arms, Pentonville - the prosecutor was there, drinking with Mr. Meares and two young men; Meares in a bird fancier, at Pentonville - I saw the paper in Lewis' hands; Lewis wrote the body of it, and Mosely put his name to it, but not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper, is not the whole of it in one handwriting? A. I should not think the name was written by the same person - I was not present when it was written at all; the prosecutor told me he had received the 2s., and did not want to hurt the man.</p>

On the night of the 7th of September, I met the prisoner in company with another woman in the Strand, they went with me to a public-house and had something to drink; soon after I left the house and missed my watch - I was not aware that the prisoner had followed me out; when I missed it I charged her with stealing it - she ran away from me; I saw her throw the watch down in the street - I picked it up, and afterwards stopped her in a street which she turned down, and kept her till the Policeman took her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q. What time did you first meet her? A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock -I called in Soho-square; I had been to Westminster Abbey; it was between three and four, that I was in Soho-square, I drank a pint of ale there; I did not dine at all - I had a pint of ale near the Abbey; I stopped several hours at Soho-square, playing at bagatelle - I was not at all inclined to be intoxicated before I went into the publichouse with her; I had two or three pots of ale there; I was not tipsy when I came out, but I was inclining that way; there were two coal-heavers in the house, and they took part of the ale with me - I was talking to them and the girls.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it likely you would have stopped in such company, if you had not been drunk? A. Very likely; it is just according to the humour I am in - I frequently associate with coal-heavers and women of the town, scores of times - she threw the watch down the moment I charged her with it; I was able to run - I did not fall till I ran against a stone.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Where are you a student of medicine? A. At the London University; I have been often at publichouses with women of the town and coal-heavers.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 8th of September, about twelve or one o'clock at night, Mr. Kay gave the prisoner into my charge near the Adelphi - he produced a watch, which he charged her with having stolen - she denied it; the watch-glass was broken - the prosecutor was not in liquor, he knew what he was about; he might be getting a little hearty.</p>

On the evening of the 24th of August, we had seven 5s. papers of copper in his bed-room, tied up in newspapers - I went into the room, and saw them all safe at nine o'clock; my uncle was then at home - he went out just afterwards, and the prisoner left about half-past eleven; he had no business in that room, but could get there- as soon as he was gone I went into the room, and missed one paper; my uncle came home soon afterwards, and I informed him - he went after the prisoner; I have since seen the paper of copper found on him - it is in the same paper, tied in the same way, and to the best of my belief, is the paper which was missing.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went in pursuit of the prisoner with the prosecutor, we overtook him in Whitechapel-road, and found on him a 5s. paper of copper, tied up in this newspaper - the paper broke, but I have preserved it, and produce it; I went to the prisoner's lodging, No. 20, Alfred-street, White Horse-lane, Stepney, and found there, a bottle of wine, a bottle of brandy, and some other bottles, with Mr. Brett's seal on them - before we went befor the Magistrate, I said to the prisoner, "Mr. Brett has lost several papers of coppers;" he said he had never meddled with any before, and he did not know what induced him to do it then, except that he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to MR. BRETT. Q. Had you not given or sold spirits and wine to the prisoner? A. I certainly had both given and sold him some about Christmas, in consequence of his wife being confined, but I am quite confident I never gave him this brandy.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How long had he been with you? A.About two years; I always considered him a very good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

On the 23rd of July I met the prisoner in Shoreditch; he gave me this parcel - it is directed "Mr. Hall, passenger to Reading, Sunday, July 24;" I had some suspicion, and gave information to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Were you employed by the prosecutor to carry parcels? A. Yes, occasionally; I was not intimate with the prisoner - I made a box for him, for which he pair me, and he lent me 2s. about a month ago, since I had this parcel from him; the prosecutor had not forbidden me to come to his house -I have carried parcels for him for years.</p>

On the 22nd of July, I took in a letter by the Twopenny-post, and handed it to him; he read it, and said he must go out of town, on account of the illness of his sister - I think he said to Reading, in Berkshire. On the day following, I went to Peacock's house - this parcel was there - I opened it, and these articles were in it; I can swear to the print, from its matching, where it is cut, with the piece left; the prisoner has taken goods, and charged himself with them, but I had told him not to do so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.But he has charged himself with goods? A. Yes, he had done it more than once; I have employed Peacock as a porter, and about the shop, but he had not so much access to it as the prisoner -I had told the prisoner not to encourage Peacock there, on account of an opposite gin-shop - the prisoner remained in my house an hour of two after I discovered these goods.</p>

            . I took the prisoner on the 2nd of August; he cried, and said he was very sorry he should be guilty of robbing his master, and begged his master to forgive him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he would have paid him for them? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Trendall allowed me to have goods, and post them to myself; he never to me expressed any disapprobation of my conduct - I could not agree with Mrs. Trendall, and she used to make differences be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080149"/>tween my master and me; when we were called up to sacred devotion, she desired the servant to put pins in the sofa, to injure my person; and, on another occasion, to get cowage for the same purpose; my master found this out, and went up to speak to my mistress about it - knowing she was my enemy, I ran out of the place; I afterwards surrendered, and when I returned to my master, he said to me, "James, if I don't prosecute you, how can you get your living?" I said, I had an uncle who would take me; he then consulted his wife, and I was taken.</p>

               <p>MR. TRENDALL. I did consult my wife, undoubtedly; I never heard of pins being put in the sofa, or of the cowage, nor do I think it likely my wife would have desired it to have been done. My wife had gone to Margate, and on her return, the prisoner spoke in a very improper manner to her, and from that time, I believe, she had a sort of prejudice against him - I had no suspicion of him before this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he any opportunity of posting these things in the book? A. Yes; after I had received the information, I went up stairs, and was there for ten minutes, and he might have booked these articles; I owe him his quarter's salary, 7l. 10s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you gone up stairs to speak to Mrs. Trendall just before he went away? A. Yes, on account of the information I had received; he could only imagine that I was speaking about this information.</p>

King had asked if I knew of a small house at Deptford, as his wife was ill in town, and he wished to bring her there; I was going to Wales, and took a house in King-street to put my furniture in, and gave J. G. King the use of two rooms, to look after my furniture and take care of my wife - I locked my property up in other rooms; I then went to Wales; I gave Goodman King(not the prisoners) the key of my apartment; I returned about the end of February or March, but, being ill, did not go to Deptford for three weeks - I saw J. G. King before the Magistrate; he was not then in the Police -I found my house in King-street in possession of a stranger, and all my property gone; I asked J. G. King, before the Magistrate, what had become of my property; he said he knew nothing of it, but that his brother was at Royston - in August I went to a house in Ironmonger-row, and found J. G. King there, and in the back-parlour a piece of oil-cloth and some crockery of mine - I gave him in charge; I found my beer-machine in May last at Phillips' in Chiswell-street, and found my property at different places.</p>
               <p>J. G. King. Q. Did not you place the whole of your affairs in the hands of Goodman King? A. And your's also - he did not have the pumps of the engine - I sold him goods to the amount of 9l. 13s., to provide my wife with things during my absence: it was for none of these things he was to advance that, but she never had a farthing - I did not let the house to Goodman King - I gave him the key; you were to move on the night I went to Wales, (looking at a letter) this is my writing - I only sent for 5l., and never received a farthing.</p>
               <p>The letter being read, among other things, stated-DEAR SIR, - I am without a penny; I have sold my umbrella to get a bed and some bread; I have only had sixpenny worth of bread, and four pints of beer since Monday - please to draw 15l. on some broker; I will sell all belonging to me as soon as I come to London, which I hope will be in a week, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM COCKMAN. I live in Hackney-road. I took some goods to Deptford for J. G. King, and brought some back; it was about the 24th of January, I think - there was a beer-engine and other things; he helped me to remove them; Goodman King was there, and said they were his; there were quart-pots with Watkins' name upon them; they were found at my house - I lent Goodman King 3l. on them; Goodman King said the machine was his own invention.</p>

            . The prisoner never accounted to me for these sums in any way - I did not know they had been paid till after I had discharged him; I then went to him, and told him he was charged with embezzling my money; he said I was liar - he was confused; I gave charge of him- the officer afterwards brought me a bill of sale, saying he would pay by instalments.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Did not he give you notice to quit? A.No, Sir; I discharged him for spoiling the bread - I had lent him some money, and took 1s. or 2s. a week of him, as he could spare it; the security he offered was not for that money - he said it was for the money he had wronged me of; I charged him with embezzling 6l. -I know this bill; (looking at one) it is a bill of last January - my books are not confused; I am the only person to whom the prisoner accounted for money which he received - the prisoner left a sovereign with my wife and one with her mother, but I do not call that accounting to them; I have never said I would give 500l. to send him abroad.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character, and a master promised to employ him.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty about a quarter before four o'clock, as the King was returning - I saw the prisoner busy behind the prosecutor's back; I watched him, and saw the four finger and thumb of his right hand take the 1s. 6d. out of the pocket, which was turned inside out - he put the money into his left hand; I seized his left hand with the money in it - he struggled to get away, and in the struggle tore his coat: I did not lose hold of him - he threw the 1s. 6d. on the pavement; I took it up, and this is it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am positive the officer must be mistaken - I heard some money fall, and he accused me of stealing it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 5th of August, in the morning, the prosecutrix gave me information of the robbery; she described the prisoner by a mark on his left cheek, and gave a very clear account- I knew him before; I looked every where for him, and on the 9th of September I apprehended him at a publichouse in Clerkenwell - I said, "I want you, Symons;" he said, "What for?" I said, "For those two gowns, a pair of stockings, shoes, and a piece of print, from a young woman, in a coffee-shop;" he said, "Oh, I'll soon settle that" - I took him to the office; the girl identified him the moment she saw him - my brother officers had been looking for him night and day, but he changed his lodging.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The morning I sold the gown to the witness I had occasion to go down a court, and saw that old gown on a dunghill, and inside it was the ticket of another gown; two or three people said, "It will suit Jones;" they called her, and asked what she would give for it - she gave me 8d.; I can prove I was never away from home - the witness has been and slept in the same place as I was since.</p>

            . I heard the Policeman was after my brother, and went to my mother's four days after the robbery; I there saw the prosecutrix, and asked her if she knew the young man who had robbed her - she said distinctly, "No, I do not;" she had met my mother, and stated to her that she was without a lodging - my mother took her in, and she stopped all night; my brother came in at ten o'clock, and he sat up in the room all night, not liking to go to bed - in the morning the prosecutrix had her breakfast at the same time with him; I told my mother it was strange she should come there, as she said he had robbed her - he did not leave home for three weeks after the robbery.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You knew the Police were after your brother? A. Yes, and so did he; I cannot account for his keeping away - I blame him very much; I do not live at home with my mother, but he slept at home - he says so, but I do not know where he was in the day time; I have not spoken to the prosecutrix but once - I heard something about a dunghill about a week after.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 6th of September, at five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming down Little Drummond-street, about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's yard, with this sack rolled up under his arm - I asked if he had any thing there; he said, "You see what it is as well as I do;" I asked if he had any thing else there - he said No, but I found the four weights in the sack; he immediately knocked at his own door, which he was close by - somebody opened it; he immediately plunged in, but I went in and secured him - he made great resistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you he had found them? A. Yes - he did not say where; he was not going towards the prosecutor's house.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming towards this man's place - the Policeman asked what I had got; I said a sack and four weights which I had picked up in the field.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I heard Croft's description of the boy; I was going up Crawford-street, and saw Fleming running as hard as he could, with another person; I took him, and found the silver table-spoon in his left hand, which I saw him take from his pocket, wrapped in a green cloth - I took it from him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Croft's Defence. I was putting some shavings away in the cellar, and found this spoon - I cleaned it, and asked this boy to mind it for me till morning, when I meant to return it.</p>
               <p>Fleming's Defence. He came to me, and said he had found the spoon in the vault - he did not know whether it was silver, but if it was he would take it back in the morning, and asked me to mind it for him, as he did not want his father and mother to know it; in the morning the Policeman came and made a noise about it - I came out, and ran across Crawford-street; the Policeman came up, and I gave it to him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You trusted the entire management of the farm to him? A. Yes, he did not buy and sell at his discretion - he has perhaps bought corn, which he got from a person I sent hay to; he frequently sold hay without consulting me - he took it to market, and when he wanted corn for the horses, he got it from the person I sent hay to; I charged him before the Magistrate with not accounting to me for what he had sold, and I produced the receipts for these two particular sums the Magistrate dismissed him, and ordered the book to be given him to see if there were any errors; it was returned to me in about a week - it contains an account of goods sold to persons for me, and at the end is a general statement of his account; that has been made since he was before the Magistrate - I had a previous account, in which he marked some errors; here is one of 3l. which is now added - the account is headed "Cash received;" he charges himself with gross sums, without naming persons, and makes a total of 731l. 1s. 8d. - he then strikes a balance, making 9l. 5s. due to me; the two sums in question amount to between 8l. and 9l.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you prove these sums are not in the account he renders? A. These sums are taken from accounts in the book; and they are not named in those accounts - he once mentioned an error of 3l. to me.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you gone through them to see if you have received the sum of 2l. 17s. or 5l. 8s.? A. He never gave me either; his duty was always to hand over the money to me, not to lay it out - it is the information I received from Mr. Wells which makes me prosecute him; neither of these sums are mentioned in his account, which embraces the time before and after October.</p>

            . I am a hay-salesman, and live at Hendon. I was in the habit of selling hay for the prosecutor, which was brought by the prisoner for that purpose: on the 2nd of September, 1830, I sold for the prosecutor, by the prisoner's directions, a load of hay for 3l.; my commission was 5s., and I gave the balance to the prisoner - on the 5th of October I sold a load for 3l.; and on the 25th of September, one for 2l. 18s.; making together 5l. 18s.; my commission was 10s., and I paid him 5l. 8s. at once; we generally settled once a week - I was before the Magistrate at Hendon; these two sums were mentioned there - the prisoner was dismissed to make up his books; he called on me three or four days after, and saw this account; the said he had not had the load of hay on the 2nd of September - he marked it, and said I ought not to put that down; I said I paid for it - he made a mark against the 28th of September and the 5th of October, and said I was not to put them down, but to make a fresh bill, for he had not got them in his account - I am quite sure I paid both these sums to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Did he not tell you there must be some mistake, for he had never, on those days, received those sums? A. Yes; I said "Here is my book, and I cannot alter it" - he insisted that his account was right.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is, in his book, "25th of September, 2l. 13s., and the 7th of October, 2l. 15s." - that makes 5l. 8s.? A. It does, but I have not seen his book; I am quite sure I paid the 5l. 8s. in one sum.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. On the 2nd of September you paid him 2l. 15s.? A. I do not say I paid it on that day, but in the course of a few days; he had had a week given him to make up his books - he has written "left out," against these sums, which means I was to leave them out in the account: there were sales on the 25th of September and the 7th of October - besides these items, there were two distinct sales, which had nothing to do with this sum of 5l. 8s. - I have gone through every item of his book, and these two sums are left out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was only brought here on Saturday; I never received 5l. 8s. from him at one time in my life - I used to receive the money by instalments, and have rendered a true account, and after my book was delivered into their hands they altered it; there are four loads of hay I never received any thing for.</p>

I was in his shop on the 18th of August, in the afternoon; he sells ready-made clothes - the prisoner came in with another woman - they asked for two aprons; they tied them on; I said the price was sixpence each; they said they were going for some money, and wished me to trust them till they returned - I refused; they took them off, and returned them; this gown laid on a table, about a yard from the counter: they left the shop; the other woman took the gown and gave it to the prisoner, saying, "Take this, we will have something;" the prisoner walked out with it; they had not asked the price; I did not leave the shop, as there was nobody there - Mr. Dyner came in in about half an hour; I described them to him; he went to the top of the street - I saw the other woman in custody that afternoon, and the prisoner was taken next day - the other woman was discharged, and the prisoner would not have been committed, but she put up her fist, and cut my mouth open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not a woman come to the door, and give you half a crown for a gown? A. Yes - that was a gown outside the door; the other woman stopped behind, and abused me in the shop.</p>

I heard of this on the 19th of August, and took the prisoner that day in Seven-dials; I told her it was for stealing a gown - she said, "The gown be d-d, it was ginned," and she scratched my face very violently - when before the Magistrate she knocked Brooks down.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q.Had you known him before? A. I had seen him once or twice - one part of it was across his feet, about three yards from the door, where it had been; there were three persons in the shop - he had been in the shop an hour and a half before, and I consider he loosened the string, so that a slight pull would get it down; he ran about fifty yards.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 30th of July, I was in Whitechapel; the prisoner left a cart, then came to me, and said, "What do you think of these waggoners? they would not give me a ride to Spitalfields:" I said I would not be under an obligation to them - he then asked if I had seen two men with baskets - I said No; he then crossed over the road - I stood at a door, and watched him - I saw him go to this waggon, take the basket, and run round a corner; I pursued, he dropped the basket: I pursued to Colchester-street, and found him squatting down behind an old boiler - I sprang my rattle, and another officer came, one went round one way, and the other the other; we took the prisoner - he then pretended to be very drunk, and suffered himself to be dragged out; I then took up this basket.</p>
