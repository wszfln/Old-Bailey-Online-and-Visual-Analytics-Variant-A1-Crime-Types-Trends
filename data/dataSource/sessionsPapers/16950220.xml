The Prisoner was found in the house alone, and no one else; and there was a Fire-place where there had been a Fire lately made, for the Bricks were even hot when they came into the Room, and in the house there was several pieces of false Metal found. There was a stranger who was wont to frequent the house, who was suspected to be a great Clipper, &amp;c. and an Associate of the Prisoners, but he is fled, and not yet taken. The Prisoner said, when first apprehended, that he had let the Room to one Baldwin, but could not produce him. He denied all the matter of Fact, and said that he knew nothing of the matter. So he did at the Tryal, saying Baldwin had taken the Room of him, and what he did there he knew not; neither could he tell where he was, nor the stranger, and denied that he knew him. But the King's Witnesses swore, that he barr'd the Door against them, and stuft the Key-hole with old Rags, denying them entrance at first. He disown'd all that was swore against him.

               <p>The Councel for the King, first opened the Nature of both the Indictments to the Gentlemen of the Jury, shewing how malicious a Fact, and what a Barbarous Murder the Prisoners at the Bar stood charged with; it being the more aggravated, because the Relation and Affinity was so Conjugal as the Wife to the Husband, therefore it was no less than Petty-Treason in her, as well as Felony and Murder: Therefore it was a Crime of a very High Nature in them all, if so be that they should be found guilty of it; and it required their serious and mature Consideration.</p>
               <p>Then the Witnesses for the King were called and sworn; the first was one Jane Williams, Mr. Symbole's Servant, who de<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16950220003"/>posed, That on the 30th day of January last, Mr. Reginer, and Mrs. Symbole's two Sisters, viz. the other two Prisoners, came to Mr. Symbole's House in the Afternoon, and found Mrs. Symbole in the Kitchen; so she ordered her to make a Fire in the Parlor, which she did, and then they went to Cards. Mr. Reginer had brought some Wine with him, which they drank, and were merry. Then Mrs. Symbole sent the said Williams for her master to one Mr. Lamberts, but he did not come home till <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note> of the clock at night; when he came in, a Supper was ordered, which they eat together, seeming to be good Friends; and after Supper they went to Cards again, playing at a Game called Bone Ace, at a Farthing Bone, and a Farthing Ace. Then she went down Stairs, and there fell asleep; afterwards awakening, hearing the Watchman knockt at the door, she went up stairs, where she found Mr. Reginer standing in the Room with a Naked Sword in his hand, all bloody, which he wiped   his Coat; and her master she found sunk down in his Chair behind the table, with one Leg upon the Chair. She going towards him, he put his hand out to her, and made as if he would speak, but could not, and immediately died. In the mean time the said Reginer got away, as also the two Sisters, her mistress Symbole being only left, who seemed to be in a great Agony; then she run down stairs, and called one Stoneman, and one Springback, that were Neighbours, who came immediately, and lifted up Mr. Symbole from the ground, and perceiving his Lips to move, they got Strong-waters, and poured into his mouth, but to no effect; for he instantly died. Stoneman and Springback deposed the same. A Watchman being sworn, declared that he was at the Door but about a quarter of an hour before the murder was done, and knockt at it, but some Woman answer'd him out at the Window, saying, All was well. There was other confirming Proofs how, and in what manner Mr. Symbole was found, and that Mrs. Symbole was much troubled, crying out, She was undone. Being asked, Who it was that murder'd her Husband? She would give no account at first, only said it was a Lawyer belonging to the Temple; at length when more people came in, she told them his Name was Reginer. It was further deposed, that Mrs. Symbole nor the other two did not offer to stop the said Reginer, but suffer'd him to go away. The Surgeon gave in Evidence, that upon search of the Body of the deceased, he found no less than 18 Wounds about him, five of which were mortal; that they were all made with one and the same Sword as he believed; and that there was a Bruise under his ear, which was perhaps done by his Fall off his Chair, for one of the Searchers (an old Woman) swore that she thought that was done by a fall, for it could not be blacker, except he had died at the Tree, as she call'd it; she knew it very well, she said, by experience, for that she had been an old Stripper. This was the sum of the Evidence for the King against the Prisoners, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then they were all call'd upon to make their Defence; and Mrs. Symbole first began, who said, That she was wholly Innocent of the Murder, and declared the whole matter, how that Mr. Reginer, and her Sisters came to her House whilst Mr. Symbole was abroad, and brought some Wine, and that she sent to look for Mr. Symbole to come home and bear them Company, so they went to Cards; and about Nine or Ten a Clock at night Mr. Symbole came home, and was in a very good Humour, very kindly embracing Mr. Reginer, telling him that he had highly honoured him with his Company, and complemented him very civilly; after which, a Supper was provided (by Mr. Symbole's Order) which they eat very amicably together; after which they played at Cards again, at Bone Ace, and Mr. Symbole and Mr. Reginer, happening to turn up two Sevens each of them; Mr. Symbole said, That the Cards should be dealt again, which Mr. Reginer denied, upon which high Words arose: Mr. Symbole telling Reginer, That he had been in the Crown-Office. Reginer replying, That he never was in the Pillory; so to boxing they went, and Mr. Reginer drew his Sword and stabbed Mr. Symbole. She further declared, That she was so much affrighted, that she knew not what she did, and that she screamed out as loud as she was able; but the Old Woman being asleep in the Kitchen, could not make her hear, besides, she called a whole Cloud of Witnesses to prove that her Husband and she had always lived very lovingly together, and that Mr. Symbole had been often times heard to speak very respectively of his Wife, and loved her very well; besides, she had divers very credible Persons, who appeared in Court, and gave an Excellent Testimony of Mrs. Symbole's Reputation; and that she had been always bred very Religiously, and had a very modest Carriage and Behaviour, not guilty of any manner of <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note> or Disregard in the Comporting of herself towards Mr. Symbole, never since she was his Wife, and being much surprised she knew not how Mr. Reginer got out of the House, it being supposed that her Sisters had gone out before him, and <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note> ; so he got away before any Assistance came.</p>
               <p>One Sister in her defence, alledged, That she was there the same night the Murder was Committed, and that Mr. Symbole and Mr. Reginer were good friends, till they fell out about turning up two Sevens; and that she being so much affrighted when she saw them fight, she ran down Stairs and went home crying out and making a noise, but did not know what she did, only she remembered that in the Quarrel, Mr. Symbole called Mr. Reginer Cowardly Rogue, and told him, That he had been in the Crown Office. Then Mr. Reginer replied, that he never was so great a Rogue as to stand in the Pillory.</p>
               <p>The other Sister declared to the same effect, as did the former, That she was also much affrighted, and her Sister going away in the time of the Quarrel, she went also; but as to the designing any Murder, she knew not. They had both the same Evidence as to their Reputation, as had Mrs. Symbole. So, then all the Witnesses having been examined fairly on both sides, with a great deal of patience and Indulgence from the Court, for their Trial lasted very long; the Court gave the Charge to the Gentlemen of the Jury, distinguishing the Law in the Case of Murder; and because, where any Person shall stab another, other People being by, and not interrupting him yet he only is guilty of the Stabbing and Death of the man, because he gave the thrust; so this Evidence did not affect the Prisoners upon the Statute of Stabbing, so they were all acquitted of the Penalty of that Statute; and there being no positive Proof that they did Abet, Aid, or Assist the said Reginer in the Perpetration of so Barbarous and Bloody a Murder, or had any hand in the same, the Jury brought a Verdict that they were all <rs id="t16950220-18-verdict74" type="verdictDescription">

The Evidence was first Mr. Hall who swore, That the said Bates sent for him to a Tavern, where he went; and immediately the said Lane and Tuttle came into the Room, and Lane presently charged the said Hall with Buggery and Tuttle took him into another Room and told him, That he had committed the Sin of Buggery with Bates. And he answered that he was innocent of such a thing being a Person of another sort of Conversation. But then Mr. Tuttle still persisted and told him, That he could produce one that would swear it, so said Lane it is so, said he. So Mr. Hall being in a great Consternation, agreed with Tuttle to give him a Bill of 36 l. which he did, but Lane only said thus, Mr. Hall it is so, and we can prove it. Mr. Bates Sister swore, That the Prisoner and Tuttle came to her Brother; and he told the Court, that Tuttle would have perswaded him to lay the Buggery upon Mr. Hall, and if he would do it, then he should be provided for as long as he lived, &amp;c. But Bates refused it; and could not say, That Mr. Lane spake any thing to him. The Prisoner called some Witnesses to prove his Reputation, who all said, That he been bred well, and served an <rs id="t16950220-30-deflabel123" type="occupation">Apprenticeship to a Wier-drawer</rs>

For says the Court, What business had Mr. Lane with Mr. Hall, along with Tuttle; Was it to advise him about the Charge and Conspiracy, how to defend himself? Surely no, for he was altogether a Stranger to him; therefore it must be conjectured that he went along with Tuttle out of a sheer design to get money out of Mr. Hall. And the Gentlemen of the Jury were to consider of the business of the Fact, that men should be so impudent to impose upon a Citizen, and so worthy a Merchant, as Mr. Hall was.

Mrs. Mottershed swore, that the Prisoner came to her House with another man, one B - and told her that she was a Clipper, and would swear it, giving her threatening language, that she should burn as Fire burned. But before this, the Prisoner asked her to lend him some money, for that he was in Law; but she refusing it, he caused her to open her Trunks, wherein was the Watch and the money. He pretended to search for Clippings and clipt money, but found none; the Watch and the money lying upon the Bed, whilst Mrs. Mottershed went into another Room to dress herself (to go to Newgate as she thought) being in great terror, did not mind the Prisoners motions, upon a sudden the Prisoner, and the other man B - (not yet taken) went down stairs, and away they went with the Watch and money.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner alledged that he was maliciously prosecuted, and that Mrs. Mottershed went by several Names, viz. Tomson, Sturgess, and Mottershed, and that all her Neighbours knew her to be a Clipper; but that was no such thing, for she was a person of known integrity.

               conspiring against the said Mr. Powell and his Wife, for falsly charging them with the Crime of High-Treason, thereby to bring them to final death
            </rs>. The Evidence for the King first swore, that the Prisoner said he had been with the Parliament to get a Warrant or Order for to take up the Clippers, and Mr. Powell declared that the Prisoner came to him to his house, and told him that there were two men at a Coffee-house hard by, had a Warrant of High-Treason against him, and he knowing him to be his Friend, and a worthy Person, he came to let him know of it to secure himself; so he and Coppinger went out to a Tavern, and just as they were entring in at the Door, comes Brandon and Smith up to him, and in a rude manner accosted him, telling him that they had a Warrant against him and his Wife for High-Treason; and immediately seized him, and took him into the Tavern, and threatened him in a strange manner, with horrid Oaths and Execrations, that he and his wife were Clippers, and that he should be hang'd, and his Wife burnt; at which Mr. Powel was much surprised; and they went and fetch'd Mrs. Powel, and then removed from the Tavern to an Alehouse, where they said that they would swear it downright against them; upon which Mrs. Powell was very much affrighted, and fell into a Swoon; so Coppinger came to her, and bid her not to be troubled, pretending to be a Friend, and that it was nothing but a Trick, and that the two men were Rogues, and only wanted money; so they at last compounded the matter, and took 30 Guineas, which Mrs. Powell had fetch'd from home, unknown to her Husband; so away they went. They came with a Warrant, but without any Constable; and it appeared upon the whole matter, that the Prisoner Coppinger was privy to the whole Design, and joined with the said Brandon and Smyth in carrying on the Villany, and that he was at the Horse-Shoe Tavern in Drury-Lane just after they had received the money. Mr. Powel did not know the said Brandon nor Smith, nor had any great Acquaintance with Coppinger. Other Evidence proved that he had part of the Guineas to his Share: And that he made his humble Application to Mr. Powel (by Letters), That if he would pardon him, and be so merciful to him as to make him an Evidence against the said Brandon and Smith, he would upon Oath discover the Design, for that the said Brandon nor Smith did ever know the said Mr. Powel. He could not urge any thing material in his Defence; and the Court being very well satisfied of the Heinousness of the Fact, and of the Innocence of Mr. Powel and Madam Powel, being Persons of an unblemish'd Reputation; this therefore was duly considered by both Court and Jury; So he was found <rs id="t16950220-35-verdict146" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Whereas by sad Experience, the currant Coyn of this Kingdom is diminished, defaced, imbased, and counterfeited to less than one half of the due Intrinsick Value, to the Ruin of Trade, and great Dishonour of the Nation, which we find by Exchange abroad, and to our great Detriment at home, if not speedily prevented by some new Law, which shall punish Confederate Dispersers of Clipt money, and mercenary Exchangers of Broad money, as well as the Criminals taken in the Fact of Clipping, will have a great tendency to the inevitable Ruin of Trade, and Disturbance in the Kingdom, than can be retrieved.</p>
               <p>That we conceive there is a necessity of further Power to be given to Justices of the Peace, and other Magistrates for frequent Examination of Loose and Unsettled persons that have no Habitation nor Business, but live on Pilfering and Begging; and upon Examination of such Persons so found and detected, that they be imployed in the Service of the Kingdom, as Soldiers, would prevent the unreasonable Imposition by Press-masters; and the loose vicious Women, and Black-guard Boys be sent to the Plantations.</p>
               <p>That Salisbury-Court, White-Friers, and other pretended Priviledge places, are notorious for entertaining Lewd People, Clippers, and Highway-men, and sheltering such as Defraud their Creditors.</p>
