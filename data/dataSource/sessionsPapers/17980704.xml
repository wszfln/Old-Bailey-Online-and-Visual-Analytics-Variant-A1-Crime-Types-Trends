            , one of the patrols belonging to Bow-street; On the morning of the 29th of May, a little before one o'clock, I was standing at the turnpike-gate, in Tottenham-court-road, in the Hampstead-road, I observed the prisoner at the bar leading a horse towards London, it was just light enough to discover him; I went on to the turnpike-gate, seeing he wanted to go through without the turnpike-man getting up, and I knocked the turnpike-man up; he got up, and the prisoner asked him what the toll was; he said, three halfpence; he said, he had got but a halfpenny, which he held up; I then said to him, whose mare is this, for I know the mare somewhere; he said, he had brought her from the fair; I then asked him who his master was; he said his master's name was Waterman; he said to me, I dare say you know two or three of that name; he said he lived no great way from Highgate; he then said to the turnpike-man, I will go back and get some more money, he turned the horse round and away he went. I went up to my father, who was just coming off duty, and told him what I had seen, and he came down with me towards the turnpike, and we met him on this side the gate coming to town; he had not come through the gate, he had got round by some houses; there was a woman on the mare, and the prisoner was leading her; we then took him to the watch-house; this is part of the halter he was leading the mare with, (producing it); we took the mare to Mr. Francis's, about three o'clock in the morning. On the Tuesday following, I had got the mare out giving her some water, and Mr. Cook saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the mare you took from the prisoner was the mare that Mr. Cook saw a week after? - A. I am perfectly sure of it; he immediately owned her; Mr. Johnson has got the mare now at Hampstead.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know why Mr. Johnson is not here? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Cook.) What is the value of this mare? - A. About three or four pounds.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

The prisoner bought the horse of John Meredith; some time after that, a person came to the prisoner, and after examining the horse, told the prisoner it was his property, he believed, but added, it was a hard matter to swear to the same; he went to the fair, and some hours after, returned to his house in Kenr-street; the prisoner continued working the horse, which the prosecutor Knowles was well acquainted with, till the 12th of June; the prisoner said, he would not give it up without an officer; the prosecutor then used him very ill, he was advised to go to a Magistrate, which he did, when an examination took place, and the prisoner was committed; in about a week, Meredith, whom the prisoner bought the horse of, was apprehended, but the Magistrate did not think proper to detain him; the prosecutor says, he bought a brown horse, but the horse that the prisoner bought of Meredith, was a black horse.</p>

At the time Mr. Henley was speaking to me, a lady said, in the hearing of the prisoner, I saw that young man take it out of your pocket; I asked her to go down to the office, but she refused.</p>

             sworn. - I am a private watchman: On the 24th of May, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at the bar, and another man, coming across a field at the back part of Gower-street; I asked Collins what they had got there; Collins made answer he had nothing; upon that, the other man threw the property down, and ran away; Collins had not got the property; upon that, I laid hold of Collins, and took him to St. Giles's watch house, another watchman went with me who is not here; the lead was carried there in my presence; I searched him, and found two or three duplicates upon him, but no edge tool at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the place, where you stopped the prisoner, from where the lead was taken from? - A. I suppose about five hundred yards; I was present when the lead was compared, and it corresponded, except the gutter.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been to Sommers-town, and got very much in liquor; I came away between eleven and twelve o'clock, I fell asleep in a field, and there I laid; when I waked, I saw a man coming across the field with a load, I asked him what it was o'clock; and he said, between twelve and one; then the watchman came up, and the man threw down his load, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Ledwich.) How far were the two men from each other? - A. The man with the load was about four yards behind the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. When did you take out a warrant? - A. I think it was in May last.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any notice of the warrant? - A. I believe he had, from Mr. Railton, who wrote to him upon the business.(Mr. Garrow took an objection, that the prisoner ought not to have been tried in the county of Middlesex.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. This offence is not committed in the county of Middlesex, and it has not been proved that the prisoner was apprehended in the county of Middlesex; the first marriage was in Ireland, and the second in Lancashire, and here is neither warrant nor recognizances, nor apprehensions, nor any one thing to prove the case.</p>

            . Now Mr. Hill knows that my name is John Portees, but he chuses to alias me, because he wishes to defame me. Mr. Hill, the whole time I was with him was in the constant habit of pawning every little trifling thing in the house; I have known the house many times bare of every thing, without a table-cloth, or a tea-spoon in the house. Mrs. Hill can neither read nor write, and she has given me the tickets to pick out particular things for her when she has wanted them out, and I have seen even the ticket of a child's cap, that had been pawned for four-pence, and they always pawned things in other people's names, particularly in the name of Mrs. Williams, of Tottenham-court-road, a person not of the best character in the world; two children used to fetch and carry these things backwards and forwards. When they have had company, they have been obliged to borrow tea-spoons, because their own were in pawn; I only came down here last night between eleven and twelve o'clock, if I had had further time, I should have had some witnesses to prove what I have already stated. When I was taken up, I had Lord Kenyon's subpoena about me, to attend the Grand Jury, at Westminster, to give evidence upon a bill of indictment against Mr. Hill, for perjury; he said to a person that is now in Court, that if I went to give evidence against him, he would take me up upon that warrant, and as soon as I came out of the Grand Jury room, I was taken up upon that warrant. With respect to pawning the book in question, I solemnly declare to your Lordship I never did; and, with respect to the second witness, a very few days indeed will shew what a situation he will be in, on account of some transactions at Manchester; there have been several persons up from Manchester to take him, but have not yet been able to find him.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Kirby: I went up with a person of the name of Pinder, who is mentioned in that subpoena, upon an Habeas Corpus, to Guildhall, Westminster, to go before the Grand Jury, I went up with Jonas Waite, one of my fellow servants, and several debtors; as we were going into Westminster-hall, it being too soon to go before the Grand Jury, I saw Mr. Hill, Mr. Hill said, take care of that fellow, meaning Pinder; after we had stopped there some time, I thought it was time to go to Guildhall; we went to Guildhall, that was at ten o'clock, and we were informed the Jury would not meet till eleven; Pinder said to me, we may as well walk up and down here till eleven, and then we shall not be out of the way; we walked about, and met with the prisoner; when we got to Guildhall door, I saw Mr. Hill again, he came up to me, and said, so I see you have brought up Pinder; yes, Sir, says I, I have; why, says he, there is that other fellow that is with him, if he attempts to go before the Grand Jury, the moment he comes out I will apprehend him upon this warrant, shewing me the warrant; then he asked me if I knew of any constable about there, there was one belonging to Bow-street standing close to me; I told him that was an officer; he took him on one side, and shewed him the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he would have him taken up for? - A. He said for a felony.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay there till after they had given their evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mr. Hill? - A. With the officer, at the door; and the moment he came out, he took him up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Matthews. Q. How long was this ago? - A. I believe it was last Monday was a week, or Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. And you recollect precisely the words he said? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now were not these his words: I have had a warrant against this man a considerable time, I have not been able to find him till now, and as soon as he comes out I will apprehend him? - A. No; he said, if he attempts to go into the Grand Jury-room, the moment he comes out I will apprehend him upon this warrant.</p>
               <p>Hill. My Lord, I beg leave to explain this.</p>
               <p>Court. We do not sit here to hear speeches, but to hear facts.</p>
               <p>Hill. I only mean to state facts. I went down for the express purpose of preferring a bill of indictment against Pinder; I preferred my bill, the Grand Jury found it a true bill, and threw out theirs. Happening to be down at Westminster, I asked the last witness for an officer; I gave the warrant to a man of the name of Rice; the prisoner had been out of the way five months, and I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040012"/>Rice I would be glad if he would take him as soon as he came out of the Grand Jury-room, but particularly desired him not to molest him, or take any notice of him till after he had come out of the Grand Jury-room.</p>

I detained him, and advertised the box, but have not been able to find the owner.(The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows):</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I most humbly beg leave to crave your Lordship's attention for a few minutes. When I last appeared at this bar, I felt the ignominy of my situation so much, that I was determined, had not the Royal mercy interposed, to have devoted my future life to a sincere repentance for my past indiscretions; but his Majesty was pleased to pardon me upon condition of serving as a soldier in the 60th regiment, which I joined at Tobago; and having done duty there for three months, was reported unfit for service, and sent to England under the command of Major Martin and Captain Court; we arrived at Spithead in September, 1796, and were discharged in the October following; I then returned to London to a distressed and disconsolate family, thinking I had received a general discharge from the army. I trust I shall be able to prove what I have here stated. Since I came to England, I have conducted myself with the greatest property, but, unfortunately, when a man has once appeared at this bar he is ever looked upon with suspicion; I therefore throw myself upon the candour of your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, convicted they will act with that impartiulity which so peculiarly characterises the Juries of this country.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go under any pardon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes; he went over in the same ship with me; and served some months in Tobago; he was then examined by the doctor, and was declared unfit for service, and sent back to England.</p>
               <p>Q.What was his complaint? - A.Age, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get home? - A. I was wounded in the right leg, and discharged from the regiment. (Produces his discharge).</p>
               <p>Q. If the prisoner had come over as an invalid, would not he have received the same sort of discharge - this is a regular discharge? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come home in the same ship with you? - A. No; I was a corporal in the regiment when he was sent home, I saw him go on board the ship; I understood he was discharged from the service.</p>

               <p>JOHN SHEPHERD, clerk, sworn. - On Friday morning, the 8th of June, I lost a copper, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040013"/>might have seen it two or three days before, it was set in brick and mortar, as coppers are generally set; it was not missed till six or seven o'clock in the morning; I had been up the night before as I usually am, reading or writing, till one o'clock in the morning. I found one half of the circle of the brick-work knocked down upon the floor.</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER CRIDLAND sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Bow-street: On the 8th of last month, between nine and ten at night, I was going upon duty down the Uxbridge-road, and under the wall, going to Bayswater, I saw the prisoner with a sack on his head, which contained this copper,(producing it); I asked him how he came by it, and he said he found it. I took him to the watch-house, and finding that Mr. Shepherd had lost a copper, I desired him to come down to the office.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Shepherd). Is there any road from your house to Bayswater? - A. Yes, the commonest road in the world, infested by thieves every evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that copper? - A. This copper very much resembles mine, I cannot be physically certain, but I believe it to be mine; I sent for a builder, who measured the diameter of the copper and the diameter of the circle, and they corresponded, it was formerly a brewing copper, but has been lately used as a washing copper; the bottom of it was convex instead of concave, but I cannot say whether the convexity of this copper may not have been occasioned by the bruises it has received; there is also an incrustation round the bottom, occasioned by a sediment left from the washing; there was a sheet of lead at the upper part, which went down on the inside an inch, or rather more, and either the cement or the lead had left a little whiteness on the copper, and there is something of that kind upon it now; but that white mark appeared stronger than any white mark that I perceive here.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the appearance so singular as to enable you to swear to it? - A. Yes; and there is a white mark round the top, by which I know it to be my master's.</p>

             sworn. - I am a deputy cornmeter: I was going up Jewry-street, about ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040015"/>minutes after nine o'clock, I heard an uproar at the bottom of the street, and a man came running up Jewry-street crying stop thief, stop thief, and seeing nobody before him I naturally thought he was the thief; I then tripped up his heels, and he chucked away the watch with his left hand, we both sell together, I turned round and caught him by the collar; in the mean time a young man came by, and seeing the watch he picked it up, and said, here is the watch, his name is Phillips; when the prisoner fell, I saw him slide the watch along the pavement to a considerable distance, he did not chuck it away, I saw the watch-chain in his hand; I delivered him to Mr. Pinner, in Jewry-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What part of Jewry-street was it that you stopped the prisoner? - A. That end next Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Q. And because the prisoner called out stop thief, you were kind enough to suppose he was the thief? - A. I had every just reason; I looked straight forward and saw nobody before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, don't you know you will have a share of a forty pounds reward? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear of a reward of forty pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Roe-buck public-house in Shoemaker-row - do you know Mr. Chapman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Mr. Chapman it might be a nice thing for you? - A. I told Mr. Chapman if I had any share of it I would put it to a good use, I would give it to some charity or other.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you or not know that there is such a reward? - A. I do not wish to have it; but if I was to have it, I would give it to some charity; I come here to speak the truth, I know nothing of either of the parties.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about the dusk of the evening? - A. It was between fifteen and twenty minutes after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that he threw away the watch, before you fell or after? - A. We both fell together, and as soon as we had fell, he scaled the watch away.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you even see the watch in the man's hand at all? - A. I saw the chain, and not only the chain, but I afterwards saw him chuck it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the watch since? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watch-glass broke? - A. There was nothing broke.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer,(produces the watch): On the 31st of May, between nine and ten at night, near my own house, I heard a cry of stop thief; I went out into Jewry-street, and found Mr. Smith, the corn-meter, had got hold of the prisoner; I took hold of the prisoner directly, and enquired who gave charge of him; somebody said, the prosecutor was in the highway, but had fell down; with that, I brought the prisoner to Mr. Smith, in the middle of Jewry-street; while I was going with the prisoner to Mr. Smith, Phillips holloaed out, here is the watch, I have found the watch; Phillips gave me the watch, and I have had it ever since. Mr. Smith immediately said, that is the man that robbed me just now; I asked him if he should know the watch; he said the maker's name was Grant, in Fleet-street. I searched him, but found nothing upon him except this whip, which he had in his hand. (Produces the watch).</p>

               <p>Mr. Smith. This is my watch, I know the maker's name but not the number; and I know it by the seal, the keys, and the chain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was coming along I heard the cry of stop thief; I never had the watch in my custody at all.</p>

               <p>(Mr. Knapp contended, that being in the power of a constable, when he was asked the question, amounted to a threat or promise, and that he was induced to confess, in consequence of being in that power.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. The oil was in flasks? - A. Yes; the prisoner went past the warehouse, and said, he believed he took them from there, and then he came into the warehouse, and said, that was the place he had taken them from; there was a vacancy in one half chest of two flasks; I tasted the oil, and it was the same sort of oil, it was new oil, and I was satisfied it must have come from that warehouse.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that work-shop a part of your dwelling-house? - A. No, it is not under the same roof; there is a little bit of a yard between, of about eight feet, more or less, or it may be ten feet; the dwelling-house fronts Worship-street, and we pass<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040017"/>through the dwelling-house into this small yard, and then there is a wash-house, and the work-shop is over that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fasten it the night before? - A. No, my son did, he is not here; the back door of the shop had been opened, and the fastening thrown upon the ground, the window appeared to be just the same as usual. About ten o'clock in the morning, I missed two pair of shoes; I did not miss any thing else till I saw the planes at the office; and seeing a bag on the table, I thought I saw the toes of my shoes through the bag, there were eleven planes, a saw, and two pair of shoes in the bag; they were all mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had this apprentice of your's been the night before? - A. He had left me a year and a half; I cancelled the indentures before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the planes and the saw before? - A. I cannot positively say; I might have used them the day before, or perhaps not for two or three days; I had seen the shoes the day before, I hung them up myself.</p>

               <p>- YOUNG sworn. - Mr. Taylor and I were returning home to Enfield, and observed the prisoner getting over a hedge; I rode up to him, and asked him what he was breaking the fences for; he said he wanted to sleep; I asked him what he had got in his pocket; Mr. Taylor said it was a ham; we jumped off our horses, and took him by the collar; he then got out of the coat, it was a very large great goat, and he and Mr. Taylor had a struggle; we took him just by the George; a constable came up, and we delivered him to the constable.

               <p>THOMAS MUMFORD sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Bow-street; I took the prisoner into custody about eleven o'clock last Saturday morning, in the pawnbroker's shop; I took her to Bow-street, and found fourteen duplicates in her pocket, but none belonging to the sheet; I asked her where that duplicate was, and she said, she had lost it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was not at the pawnbroker's at all, I was not out till half past seven o'clock, and then I only went out for a bundle of wood.</p>

               <p>WALTER JENKINS sworn. - I am a watchman; between two and three o'clock last Saturday was a fortnight, the 16th, in the morning, the prisoner passed my box; I asked he what she had got there, she said, washing-tubs; she said, she had brought them from Mookwell-street, and was going to take them to one Mrs. Hart, a dealer, in Spitalfields-market; I told her to go along, and she turned down Horshoe-alley, and I went after her; I told her, that was not her way to Spitalfields-market, and then I suspected her, and took her to the watch-house. (Produces the tub.)</p>

               <p>Court. (To Gordon.) Q. Did you sell him more than one side? - A. No, he cheapened but one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. Which side of the calf was it he bought of you? - A. I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Q.And yet you can take upon you to swear, that that was the identical veal? - A. Yes.</p>

            Hammerton four times over, I am in possession of the iron that marked them; there are marks upon the sacks which our man will prove; he said he had bought the sacks at a broker's, about fifteen or eighteen months before; afterwards he denied it, and said he had bought them at a sale but could not tell what sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long this cart had been made? - A. Not above ten months, there is the maker's name upon the cart; he afterwards said he had bought it of a man who had bought it at a sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Palmer afterwards? - A. Yes, at the public-house adjoining the office in Worship-street; he said, he wished to speak to me, he wished to turn evidence, and he would disclose such a scene that I should be astonished at; I told him I thought I knew enough already; he said, I did not know one twentieth part respecting the mills, and other concerns too.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What did Palmer do respecting Innes? - A. He said he did not sleep there; and then afterwards, when I insisted upon searching the house, he told me where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. You went afterwards to Mr. With's who keeps a corn-chandler's shop? - A. Yes; and a baker's shop somewhere else.</p>

               <p>Q. And he went with you and the officer? - A. Yes; and two other men, Moses Speckernell and Absalom Phillips; and in the warehouse we found a bolting-mill, which I do not think any corn-chandler would have, but there it was; there was every apparatus for dressing flour, as complete as Mr. Hammerton could have them at his mills.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do not bakers use a bolting-mill? - A. No, not in town; they may in the country.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Palmer? - A. Yes, at a public-house joining Worship-street-office, the same morning he was taken; he asked me if I would speak to Mr. Skillick and Mr. Hammerton, and know if he could be admitted, that he would inform them of many things that would surprise them.</p>

            , and another with the same mark; there are four with that mark.</p>
               <p>Griffiths. I found all these sacks at With's.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Speckernell.) Did you ever see any cart belonging to With come to the mill? - A. Never but once; a cart of With's came to Palmer's; I saw the cart afterwards, in the custody of Griffiths, that was the same cart I saw in Palmer's premises, the name upon it is John Tilyard, Hendon, Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you saw the cart upon Palmer's premises was there any name upon it? - A. No; but I believe it to be the same cart; it is not like a town cart, it is a country cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The only reason for your knowing that cart to be the same is, that it is a country cart? - A. No; the man that was in the cart gave me great reason to believe so, his name is Limerick, I saw him in the cart about half a mile from the mill at Clapton.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040024"/>Q.These sacks have the names of persons who have occasionally ground corn at Mr. Hammerton's mills? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When they sell a sack of flour they send it out in the sack, do they not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Griffiths.) Q.Where did you find these sacks now produced? - A. In Mr. With's granary; I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How many more sacks did you find that you did not take away? - A. A good many, I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>ABSALOM PHILLIPS sworn. - I am employed by Mr. Hammerton: I have seen sacks with the same marks in Mr. Hammerton's mill.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the cart that was in Griffith's possession? - A. No; I have seen it upon the road, but not to take particular notice of it; I have seen Limerick with it, but did not know his name at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This gentleman is a large dealer in flour and corn, and sends sacks about the town? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you cannot swear to these particular sacks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Killick. I have seen the cart since, and I am confident it is the same cart that I have seen at the side of Palmer's house; the name upon that was

             sworn. - On Thursday last, about four o'clock, the two prisoners at the bar came to the door, and looked at some muslins hanging near the door, she objected to them, and I asked her to come in and look at some others; I shewed her some, and she looked at one, while the boy was looking at another; I brought it forward, and the boy staid behind; I then observed him reaching over the counter, where I had left the printed cotton, with his hands stretched over, but I had no suspicion of him at all, on account of his youth; she looked at the muslin, and seemed very well satisfied with it, she said, she was going further for some shirts, and would call again for it; immediately after she was gone out, I went down to the bottom of the shop, and missed this piece of print; I told my fellow shopman of it, and said, I was positive it was there just before she came in; I have never seen the print since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Trebeck. Q. You saw the woman and the child the whole of the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She was bargaining fairly with you? - A. She did not bargain for any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had any suspicion, it must have sell upon the boy? - A. I had no suspicion of either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had your eye pretty much upon him all the time he was there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he took it, then it must be at the time you saw him with his hand stretched over the counter? - A. No, he could not possibly do it at that time; after that, he went into the inner shop, and came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. She could not have done it? - A. I should imagine not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say in the shop, that you were sure the boy had taken it? - A. I said, I thought the boy had taken it.</p>

             sworn. - When I brought the prisoner back from Tower-hill, she had this piece of cotton in a handkerchief in her hand, with which she was endeavouring to cover the print; I saw the print clearly, I took her to my master's, and the cotton was delivered to the constable, George Wade.</p>

               <p>Bengough. (Matches it with a piece which he took from his pocket). This is the piece that was on the counter when the prisoners came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the value of it? - A. It cost twenty shillings and upwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Trebeck. Q. Is that the whole piece? - A. No; I had sold three gowns, fifteen yards of it; the piece was twenty-one yards, and this is six yards.</p>
               <p>Q. This may be one of the three gowns that you sold, for any thing you know? - A. No, that is impossible; the fag end matches exactly with the end that is cut; I took it down five minutes before they came in.</p>

             sworn. - I was nearly opposite Mr. Marchant's house, at the corner of Dean-street; I heard a cry of stop thief, I turned round and saw the two prisoners come running up the street; I stood till they came opposite to me, and saw Bamber with the coffee-pot under his coat, some part of it, I believe, was covered with his coat; Bamber is the tallest of the two, I ran after him, and he slung it in at a cellar window in Eagle-street; I ran after him a few yards further, and laid hold of him, I held him till more assistance came up, and we took him to Mr. Marchant's house; I saw the other prisoner run past me, but I saw nothing more of him till he was brought back to Mr. Marchant's. The coffee-pot was brought to Mr. Marchant's house by a gentleman that had hold of Bamber at the same time that I had.</p>

             sworn. - I was within a few doors of Mr. Marchant's house, when I heard a cry of stop thief; I saw Bamber run across the way from Mr. Marchant's shop, he ran up Dean-street to the top of it, he turned round the corner, and threw this coffee-pot into a cellar, it was a public-house, the sign of the Crown; I immediately laid hold of him; I then went to the landlord, and he went down, and brought it out of the cellar.</p>

             sworn. - I was at dinner at my master's, in Dean-street, on the 13th of June; I heard a cry of stop thief, I saw the tallest prisoner running, and I ran after him; I saw the other prisoner run down Eagle-street, but I had not a proper fight of him; I pursued him down King's-gate-street across Holborn, towards Queen-street, then he went a little way down Queen-street, I lost sight of him then, but in about a minute or two, he came back into Holborn again, and went up towards St. Giles's; and then I called stop thief again, and ran after him; he was rather winded, and then he was taken.</p>
               <p>RICE EVANS sworn. - I am a patrol of St. James's; I saw the prisoner, Singures, cross the way as fast as he could run, he was quite wearied out with running; he took out this milk-pail and spoon from his coat, and threw it into a baker's shop, three doors from Queen-street; I went into the baker's shop, and picked it up just by the parlour door, and I gave it to the mistress of the baker's shop.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Marchant). How did you get possession of that milk-pail again? - A. A Mr. Hewlett, an opposite neighbour, fetched them from the baker's.</p>
               <p>Evans. I went with Mr. Hewlett to shew him the house; I saw him come out with it in his hand, but there was such a mob round the door, I could hardly get near it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say positively that that is the milk-pail that the prisoner threw into the baker's shop? - A. Yes, I am certain sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Marchant.) What is the value of that coffee-pot, as silver? - A. Above six pounds; the milk pail is worth fourteen shillings, and the spoon is worth one shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lowe). You saw two persons running up Dean-street, are you certain they were the two prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Singures's defence. Going up Holborn, I heard a cry of stop thief, I saw a mob, I turned my head, and this man laid hold of me immediately, and took me back to Mr. Marchant's.</p>
               <p>Bamber's defence. I heard a cry of stop thief, I ran, and they laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Marchant). Is this shop part of your dwelling-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Bamber, called two witnesses, who deposed that he always paid them very honestly.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the officers belonging to Worship-street: In consequence of Mr. Simpson applying for a search-warrant, I went, in company with Mr. Simpson, to the prisoner's apartments, in Bedford-street, Strand; I enquired for the prisoner and he was denied, and I went into a room upon the ground-floor, where the prisoner was in bed; I searched his breeches-pockets, and found three two pounds notes, and two ones, a half-guinea, and seven shillings; I found a key which led to a drawer in the adjoining room, there I found five guineas and a half; I searched further, and in another room I found a five pound note, two half-guineas, a guinea, and a seven-shilling-piece; I secured him and his wife, and coming along in the coach, he begged for mercy, and said, he had taken it for the sake of his wife, and meant to have replaced it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him to induce him to say that? - A. No; he said he owed a number of small debts, and that this was change out of the forty pound note.</p>
               <p>Simpson. He gave me a list of the places where he had disposed of the money, and how he had disposed of it. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make use of any kind of promise or threat? - A. No; he told me he had taken the note off the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how much the note was for? - A. Yes, forty pounds; the list that he gave me amounted to 41l. 17s. 11d. he said he had some loose cash about him which made the difference.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at all mentioned in his hearing that it was a forty pound note, specifying the sum? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Tuesday, the 22d of May, a forty pound note was missing, I was in the warehouse, I heard of it; there was a noise about it, and we were all called up except one, a Mr. Jones, who I believe is a partner with Mr. Simpson, who might have had it for any thing I know; Mr. Simpson has a great number of servants; I was searched from top to toe and nothing was found, none of the rest were searched; I went to work as usual till Whit-Monday, and then I begged for a holiday, which he agreed to, and then I told him I had got a place superior to his, and I did not go again till Thursday, when I was apprehended; I did not make any resistance. <rs id="t17980704-39-verdict191" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - The prisoner at the bar brought a horse to where I live, at the Bull-inn, the bottom of Hatton-gardon, for sale; I looked at the horse, and said, it was in a very bad state; he asked me 5l. for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a gelding? - A. Yes; I told him, I would not give more than two guineas and a half for him; he went away and came back again; he then said, I should have it; I told him, I thought he had come dishonestly by it; he said, he had not, his mother had desired him to have it killed, but he thought it was too good to kill; he gave me his direction, No. 5, Garden-row, City-road; I told him, if you will stop till I come back, and I find you have come honestly by it, I will buy the horse of you; I went immediately, and found the prisoner's father there; I returned home, and the prisoner was gone, he had left the horse, and I went to the Daily Advertiser Office, and advertised it, that was on Wednesday afternoon, the 20th of June, and on Saturday Mr. Turner and Mr. Gevers came to my house to look at the horse, I believe they are partners.</p>

               <p>Douglas. Mr. Turner came to me on Saturday and claimed the horse, after keeping it about eight or nine days, I restored the horse to Mr. Turner.</p>
               <p>Turner. I am a horse-dealer in Islington-road; the prisoner applied to us for a horse to go to Tottenham High-cross, on the 20th of June, between seven and eight in the morning; he made the enquiry of Mr. Gevers, I stood by at the time; he said, he was the son of Mr. Gilliard, of Islington-road, schoolmaster. On that account, knowing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040029"/>Mr. Gilliard, we lent him the horse; when he went out of the yard, he said, he should be home between seven and eight in the evening. At ten o'clock I went to Mr. Gilliard, and asked him, if he expected his son home that night, and he said, he had no son; I described the lad to Mr. Gilliard, and he thought it was the prisoner, who went to school to him, but we could not find any thing of him till last Saturday; Mr. Douglas came up to our yard, and told us he had got a horse of ours, and knew the lad to be at Kensington; we went to see the horse, and knew it to be ours, it was a bay horse with a bald face, there are no particular marks upon it, we had had the horse about six weeks, we found the prisoner at Kensington.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner at Kensington, he had enlisted for a soldier there, that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence to the following effect.</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. I shall not intrude upon your time by entering into a long detail of defence, nor is it my wish or principle so to do. I had hired the horse of Mr. Turner, and had rode the horse so hard, that I was afraid to return. I solemnly declare that I was totally ignorant of the consequences attending such imprudence and juvenile indiscretion, and that it was not from the possession of a dishonest or depraved heart; I most humbly, therefore, throw myself before you, my Lord, the Prosecutor, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, craving that mercy which has so highly distinguished a British Court of Justice, and my future conduct shall atone for my past indiscretions.</p>
               <p>Lucas. The prisoner had deserted from one regiment, and entered into another; his father is a very respectable man in the India-house.</p>
               <p>Douglas. The horse had been rode very hard, and was in a very weak state. <rs id="t17980704-41-verdict201" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Look at the note, is that the same? - A. It is; the man's name was Long, as I found afterwards, he came for a pair of boots that I had had to repair, he asked what they came to; I told him half-a-guinea; upon that, he pulled that note out of his pocket, and gave it me. I went to the Three Tuns to get it changed; I afterwards had reason to believe it was a forged note, I returned it back to the man that gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were you to repair these boots for? -

            .</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what Long told you, did you go any where and find Thomas Phillips? - A. Yes, I went with him into Portman-square; when we got about half way down the square, Phillips came up to us, and we told him it was a bad one; in consequence of that, Phillips took us to a public-house in Marybone-street, kept by Mr. John.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what Phillips and Long said to you, who did you find there? - A. When we came there, the prisoner was not there; I went to Berners-street, and when I came back he was at the public-house; I asked him how he came by the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew him the note? - A. After a bit he saw it; he said he had taken it at the Duke of Portland's office, he said he was at a King's Messenger; then I asked him if he would go with me to the Duke of Portland's office; he said, yes, as he was King's Messenger, he had taken it there in part of his salary.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you shewn him the note by this time? - A. After that, he asked if he might see the note; I took the note out of my pocket and shewed it him, and he said it was his note; he asked what it was; and I told him it was a one altered into a five; upon that, he said he should be under the necessity of making an affidavit that he had taken it at the Duke of Portland's office, or he should be four pounds loser; upon that he went out, and stood in the passage talking with a woman at the bar, whom I afterwards saw, and who turned out to be Mrs. John, the landlady; after he had spoke to her, he came back, and said he thought he had taken it at the Duke of Portland's office, but the landlady had given it him.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he tell you under what circumstances, or how the landlady had given it him? - A. No; he then, to the best of my knowledge, asked me to take his measure for a pair of boots, that he had great connections, and it might be the means of getting me a deal of work, I took measure of him for a pair of books; upon that, Long said, he wanted to speak to me, and I went out with him; when I came back, Crawford asked what business we had to go out, he said, if we had had any thing to say we might have spoke it there; then Phillips and he rather abused Long for calling me out; with that, I went to the landlady and enquired for a constable, I went away to Marlborough-street; when I returned I shewed him to the runners, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp - Q. When you first came back to the public-house there was some conversation before the note was produced? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, it was impossible for him to understand whether your conversation applied to that note or any other note of five pounds? - A. That note; he acknowledged the note.</p>
               <p>Q. But your previous conversation was not applicable to that any more than any other five pound note? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not till after he had had some conversation with the landlady that he corrected himself, and said he had it from her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it before he had been the note that he said he had had it from the Duke of Portland's office? - A. Yes, before he had seen it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You told him it was a forged note? - A. The two young fellows had told him so.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew it was a forged note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was given to understand that you were going for a constable-you had said so? - A.Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, notwithstanding, he knew you were going for a constable, upon your returning with a constable, you found him at his lodgings at the public-house? - A. Yes, in the public tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there? - A. There was nobody that heard the conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in the public tap-room? - A. Yes, and several persons came in and out.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.After the note was produced, did he say any thing about the Duke of Portland's office? - A. He said, he was a King's messenger, several times, and that he had received it as part of his salary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp Q. Did he not say, after he had had a conversation with the woman, that he thought he had received it from the Duke of Portland's office? - A. Yes; but then he said the landlady had given it him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. After you had shewn him the note, he said, he was a messenger, and had received it is part of his salary-was that before he had had the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040032"/>conversation with the landlady, and after he had seen the note? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. I went to Mr. Ashfield's, for a pair of boots, Thomas Phillips desired me go there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take that note to him? - A. I took a note, but I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. The note you produced to Ashfield, you received from Phillips? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PHILLIPS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. I gave the last witness a five pound note to pay for a pair of boots of mine that had been repaired. I met with the prisoner opposite Mr. John's door, about two o'clock in the afternoon of the Monday, I had got a pair of books in my hand, I told him, I was going to sell them; he said, they were not big enough for him, or else he would buy them; I told him, I thought I had a pair that would just suit him; he desired me to fetch them; I said, I could not, they were at the boot-maker's and I had no money; he asked me what I thought they would come to; I said, about ten shillings; the prisoner then gave me the note doubled up, and said, it was a five pound note; I owed Mr. Ashfield a trifle of money, which I was not able to pay, and I asked Mr. Long to go for the boots for me, because I did not like to make free with Crawford's money any further than he had given me toleration to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note you gave Long the same you received from Crawford? - A. Yes; I did not open it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Long came back to you? - A. Yes, he did, in the square, Mr. Ashfield came back with him; I went with them to Mr. John's, to see for the prisoner, we waited till he came; I told him, it was a bad note; he said, he was very sorry for it, he must be the loser.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say where he had taken it? - A. No. There were several people in the taproom; I believe every one in the tap-room might hear the conversation about the note and every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about where he got it from? - A. I understood that he had received it from the Duke of Portland's office, and afterwards, he said, he had found himself quite mistaken, he had it from the landlady.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.All the conversation that passed relative to this note, passed in the public tap-room, did it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And every body near the place might have heard it very plainly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He said, he had found himself mistaken, he had had it from the landlady? - A. Yes, and the landlady came forward to say it was the note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. (To Ashfield). Q. How long was it after you had left the house to go to Marlborough-street, that you came back? - A. It might be fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNEDY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am one of the officers of Marlborough-street: I went with Mr. Ashfield to a public-house in Marybone-street; the prisoner knew me before I knew him, he asked me how I did; I told him, very well; I asked Mr. Ashfield, where is the man that gave the note to you; he said, he was not here; Mr. Crawford made answer, the note is mine; I said to Crawford, you must give an account how you came by that note; he said, he took it at the Duke of Portland's office, he was one of the King's Messengers. The landlady came forward, and said the note was her's, and he acknowledged he received it from her; I took him into the back parlour, and searched him, but found nothing on him but a sixpence and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any question asked at the Magistrate's before the examination? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was it not taken in writing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it afterwards put into writing? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. So when you came in, he knew you, and knew you to be a public officer, and he gave you the account that you have described, immediately, saying it was his note, and that in the public tap-room? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you return it to her? - A. I had paid it away, and it was returned back to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went back to Mrs. John, and you had an opportunity of telling her of it, was any person with her? - A. Yes, the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he heard what passed? - A. I believe he did. I told Mrs. John, it was a one pound note made into a five pound, and the prisoner at the bar looked at it, but I did not hear him make any observations upon it. Mrs. John said, she must be the loser of it; says I, you will lose but four pounds, and that is better than losing five, but, perhaps you may recollect in a few days where you took it.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave her no advice? - A. None at all.</p>

               <p>Q. You kept the note about a fortnight? - A. Yes; I had it in my own possession about a week, and then I paid it away to Mrs. Kinsey, she is here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Did Mrs. John make any other observation? - A. No; she said, she could not recollect where she took it unless it was from No. 29.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you able to say what that note was originally? - A. It was A.9749; it was a one pound note at the time that I signed it; here appears to he an alteration in the date, from the 10th to the 16th, and the one is altered into a five.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember being desired by the prisoners to ask your aunt to lend a sum of money? - A. No. On Sunday morning, the 17th of June, he asked me for change for a ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the day before he was taken up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you a ten pound note? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he was in the habit of borrowing money of Mrs. John? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this desire, did you go up stairs to your aunt? - A. Yes, she was ill at that time in bed; I went up and asked her for change for a ten pound note for Mr. Crawford, and she gave me the keys of the drawers to take it; I took out of the drawer five pounds, four guineas and a half, and some silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was a five pound note? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you correct in stating exactly what Crawford said at the time he desired you to go up to your aunt-did he ask for change, or cash, or in any particular way? - A. No; he only asked for change for a ten pound note.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. He said no further than I might take the cash back again, he did not want it all.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The last witness is your niece? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner is a lodger in your house? - A. Yes; and has been for about these twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. On Sunday the 17th of June were you unwell? - A. I was very ill in bed, with a rheumatic pain in my head, which I am subject to.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your niece coming up for change for Mr. Crawford? - A. Yes; she came up for change for a ten pound note, I told her to take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040034"/>the keys and get it, and she gave him that note, which she did not know had been returned to me by Mr. Bateson.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember afterwards, Ashfield, Phillips, Long, and Kennedy, coming to your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember admitting before those persons, that that note was given by this little girl to Crawford? - A. Yes; and knowing I had no other five pound note by me, I knew it was the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Crawford had lived with you during a twelvemonth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been in the habit of borrowing money of you before? - A. Yes; half-a-guinea or so, at times, he always paid me very honestly; I have received four pounds and five pounds of him at a time, but never gave me a note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. How does he get his livelihood? - A. He was a servant out of place, and being a good writer, he used to make out bills for the coachmen and footmen, and they paid him for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the little girl bring you up a ten pound note? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever happen to say she did? - A. I did, when I was very much flurried.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Bateson coming to your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Crawford being there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four other witnesses, who had known him from a year and a half to thirty years, and gave him a good character.</p>

            ? - A. Yes; the last time I saw him, he was a corpse at his master's house, on Stepney-green, that was on Monday the 12th of March; I saw him between ten and eleven o'clock, on the 4th of March, in a field behind a public-house, called the Ben Johnson, he was then fighting with a person of the name of Niblett, a <rs id="t17980704-49-deflabel232" type="occupation">publican</rs>

                        targets="t17980704-49-defend367 t17980704-49-deflabel232"/>, they were fighting from twenty minutes to half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to you to fight fair? - A. Yes; I saw no foul blows struck. Before the last three rounds, Turner expressed a wish to leave off, his second, Homan, prevented him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Niblett express any wish, either to persist in fighting, or to leave off? - A. Not that I heard, either the one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. During those three rounds, did they appear to fight fair? - A.Homan urged the renewal of the combat to Turner, and Turner got up and walked on to meet Niblett, and the last round but one, Turner evidently got the worst of it; Niblett had got his wind, and struck very hard and violently about the head; but the last round but one, Turner made an attempt to throw Niblett, what they call a cross-buttock, and in Turner's endeavouring to do it, his strength left him, his legs gave way under him, and in that position he fell; at the end of that round, I begged Homan for God's sake, not to let him fight any more; his answer was very rude indeed, in very coarse language, he d-d my eyes, and what was it to me, the man was not beat yet; he was led up the last round by Homan, and there was a wildness in his eyes, and when he went to meet Niblett, he went a great way to the right of him, and Homan said, where are you going? there is your man, and then he took him by the arm, and absolutely led him up to Niblett; there were three or four blows past that round, he received some blows upon his head, and the last blow he fell upon his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike at all at Niblett the last round? - A. He had the use of his hands, but he was extremely weak; for the last quarter of an hour there was an incessant torrent of blood poured from his nose and mouth; at the end of the last round, he was picked up, and even then he had strength to walk to the man, that they call the bottle-holder, and sat down upon his knee, and they called out,"time," and Homan said, "why do not you let the man stand up," and the moment he took his left arm from his shoulders, he fell down double; I observed strong convulsions, and he appeared to be choaking; after that, a vein was opened in his right arm, by a surgeon, but then he was in the agonies of death; they took him out of the field, and he lived till he got to his master's house; I think it was a quarter or an hour after that, I went to his master's house, I went up into the room, and saw him, he was then a corpse, he had just expired; I went to Niblett immediately after that, and he was in bed; I told him of the circumstance, I went to purely to enquire where Homan lived; Niblett expressed a very great contrition indeed, and I believe it was sincere, he said, when I told him of it,"good God, I shall never be happy again," and then shed a flood of tears.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe, when you saw him in bed, it was from the bruises he had received? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Homan was the principal promoter of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040035"/>business? - A. Yes; and there is not a doubt but his life might have been saved but for him.</p>
               <p>Q.Had it not been for Homan, there would have been a stop put to the battle sooner than there was? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN PAULIN sworn. - I knew nothing of the deceased till this happened: On the 4th of March I saw the battle between the deceased and the prisoner; I saw them before the battle commenced; Turner was in the field first; I enquired the cause of so great an assemblage of people; they told me it was a fight, and pointed out Turner to me as one of the combatants; I afterwards saw Niblett come into the field, and I thought I discovered in Niblett a disinclination to fight; I finding that, took him aside, and endeavoured to persuade him to go about his business, that it could answer no good purpose his fighting; he said, sir, I am obliged to you for your advice, but the matter is gone so far that it must be decided in this way; they then went to fighting; I saw nothing in the fight but what is called fair fighting, I believe the mischief happened through Homan; I believe Niblett would have been very happy to have been taken away, that was the impression it made on my mind; it appeared to me, that the fear of being called a coward was the only thing that induced him to fight; I broke into the ring after the last round, and told the second, if you set these men to fighting any more I will have you taken up; he d-d me, and said, the man should fight as long as he could; they were not put together again then; as to the condition of the deceased, I was outside, and therefore could not so well judge.</p>
               <p>JOSIAH WATERLOW sworn. - Q. Do you know Turner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Niblett? - A. Yes; the deceased sent the challenge by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with either of them before the battle was fought? - A. Yes; previous to their fighting, on Wednesday, the deceased talked with me about it, but I did not say any thing to Niblett about it till the Saturday night; I told him you are going to fight with Turner, and he told me to hold my tongue, he did not want to hear any thing about it, and that was all that passed on the Monday; they had been fighting some time before I went to the field.</p>

               <p>Q. How many rounds do you suppose they had? - A. A great number, I cannot say how many; they fought a great while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any soul play at all? - A. No, I did not; Turner seemed to have the best of the battle till within the last round or two.</p>
               <p>Q. What appeared to you to be the change in the battle till within the last round or two.</p>
               <p>Q. What appeared to you to be the change in the battle? - A. I am no great judge of that, but when he was turning to throw Niblett a cross-buttock, he fell upon his head, and I think he might, at that time, over-strain himself; after that, the blood flowed from his nose and mouth very fast.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COLE sworn. - I am a sack-maker; I know nothing at all about the battle, but I know both the people, that is all I know; I was not there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp contended that this case could, at most, amount to no more than manslaughter; and also submitted to the Court, that, from the circumstances of the deceased falling upon his head in endeavouring to throw Niblett a cross-buttock, and the blood flowing from his nose and mouth, they must infer that he did not meet with his death from the hands of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The Court were of opinion, that there was a case to go to the Jury upon the question of manslaughter.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WINDLE, Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live at Mile-end: the prisoner lived with me a year and a half, he was a man of a humane, good disposition; I should not have parted with him, but he was going to settle.</p>
               <p>Rev. Mr. THIRLWALL sworn. - I have known the prisoner several years, he always maintained a sober, honest, humane character.</p>
               <p>Mr. EDWARD MARTIN sworn. - I am a surgeon and apothecary, at Mile-end: I have known the prisoner five years, his general character is that of a humane man.</p>

            ? - A. I did not know either the one or the other: The deceased took hold of my left arm on Sunday night, the 3d of June, and asked me to have something to drink, I had got through Temple-bar, beyond the Church, going towards Drury-lane; I said would he give me any, and we walked on till we came to a very low public-house, the Cock and Magpyer in Drury-lane; there were three in company, him and two others.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of those persons? - A. The prisoner was one of the two that was with the deceased; we all four went into the public-house, and had half a pint of gin, and two pots of beer; we staid there about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it? - A. It was about ten o'clock at night when the deceased first took hold of my arm; I continued with them till, twelve o'clock, when the murder was done; while we were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040036"/>in the public-house, the prisoner at the bar was trying to get me away from the deceased man, they had not any words, but talking to the deceased man, and trying to get me away from him; after drinking the liquor, I went out at the door with a tall man, in a light-coloured coat, who wished us a good night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he one of the three that you met with at Temple-bar? - A. Yes; he bid us good night, and went towards the New Church in the Strand; the deceased and the prisoner came out together directly after, and we went up Drury-lane, towards St. Giles's; walking up Drury-lane, two or three times, the man that is in custody there, tried very much to get me from the deceased man, saying, he would have me from him, and the deceased man said he should not have me; the deceased man and I agreed to go and sleep all night together, and we walked up Drury-lane trying to lose the prisoner, that be should not see where we were going; we walked up three or four times, and the prisoner became very resolute, insisting upon having me from the deceased man.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by being resolute? - A.Putting his arms round my necks, trying to get me away, and the deceased man was squeezing my left hand not to give any ear to him, not to go with him; upon that, the prisoner said, d-n his eyes he would have me, or he would have his life; accordingly he stabbed at him with a stick, he had a kind of a came in his right hand, and he shook it, and the bottom part flew off, he jabbed it at him immediately, and the second jab he dropped, and never spoke at all; and he jabbed at him a third time, after he was down.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts was this? - A. Opposite Queen street, in <placeName id="t17980704-50-crimeloc236">Drury-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner? - A. I do not know; when I screamed out, several watchmen came up, and I went away and left the man lying there, and the watchmen round him; the prisoner threw away the stick in a careless manner, and almost struck the watchman's feet, and he ran up Drury-lane towards St. Giles's; the watchman, instead of going after him, stooped down to pick it up.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the deceased dressed? - A. In a blue coat, a round hat, a broad striped waistcoat, a kind of a brown stripe, and broad striped breeches of a kind of a brownish colour; his hair was rather long, but of a dark complexion.</p>

               <p>Q. What colour was it? - A. A kind of a lightish cane.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to see the sword, or whatever it was, so as to tell us the length of it? - A. Yes; after he shook the cane, he gave it a sudden jerk, and the bottom part slew off; it was about the length of two fingers.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man that did this? - A. I am positive he is the man, and no other; I was in his company two hours, he was with the deceased man when he caught hold of me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What way of life are you in? - A. I am an unfortunate girl, getting my bread at different times in the street; I am never long in London together.</p>

               <p>Q. And you told him none at all, did not you? - A. I did not understand the way that he asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you say it was a mistake? - A. I did not understand him.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us, at this time where you lived, and who you lived with? - A. I lodged with Mrs. Welsh, No. 2, Coal-yard, Drury-lane; when I come from the country I always go there; I am there sometimes for a week or two.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time this happened were you a lodger of Mrs. Welsh's? - A. I only slept there till I could get the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you slept there before this matter happened? - A. I reached home on the Monday as this happened on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had been at Mrs. Welsh's from the Monday night? - A. Yes, when I could get in; sometimes I could not get in, and then I was obliged to walk about all night.</p>
               <p>Q. What public-house was it you went with the deceased to? - A. The Cock and Magpye in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house were you in? - A. In the box No. 2.</p>
               <p>Q. I tell you fairly, the people of that house are here - now do you mean to say that you four came into that house, and sat in the box No. 2.? - A. Yes; I sat down underneath the number.</p>

               <p>Q. Then he held one end of the stick? - A. Yes;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040037"/>the knife part was very picked at the point, and got very thick towards the top.</p>
               <p>Q. You screamed out murder three or four times? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you staid till the watchman came up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes; because, after the third jab, he threw the stick towards the watchman's feet, and the watchman tried to pick up the stick instead of going after the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the watchman was as near to the prisoner as I am to you? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you after this? - A. I was almost ready to swoon away with the fright, and I walked away; when I came to myself, I found myself in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go after the watchman to enquire what, had happened? - A. I did not till Monday morning; I went to Mrs. Welsh in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you that night enquire what was become of the body? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the gentlemen of the Jury telling you to your face, that they did not believe a word you said? - A. I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you were taken before the Coroner's Jury, this man was taken up, was not he? - A.He was taken up about twelve o'clock on Monday, I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. You were before the Coroner's Jury, and charged this man with the murder, after he was taken up, did you not? - A. No; on Tuesday morning I went before Mr. Addington, to his own house, and had a private examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go and give evidence before the Coroner's Jury after this man was taken into custody? - A. I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember giving your account before the gentlemen that sat on the body? - A. That was in the evening.</p>

             sworn. - I was at the apprehending of the prisoner, and searched his house; I found a blue coat and a hat, on Wednesday, the 6th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were his? - A. I found them in the room where he slept, and he owned them at Bow-street. Here is a dagger that came from St. Giles's watch-house, (producing it); I received it from a servant of Mr. Romley, the watch house-keeper, on the Monday, I think; I am not clear to the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the prisoner's lodgings? - A. In Dudley-court, Denmark-street, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Pearce). Look at that dagger, is that the kind of thing that you have described? - A. No, it was a kind of a cane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it that guard round it, that kind of circle? - A. No, it was no such like thing as this at all.</p>
               <p>- HEALEY sworn. - I knew the deceased for twelve years past; I saw him on the 3d of June, he Sunday he came to my apartments, about six, o'clock in the evening, in George-court, Piccadilly, he had a blue coat on and a swansdown waistcoat; I think so, I am not particular; I was in his company from six till within a few minutes of eleven o'clock at night; I left him in Wild-street, in a public-house called the Black Horse.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you leave with him? - A. I left him with a countryman of his own, a schoolfellow of his, named Neville, and another gentleman that he called Doctor; Neville was dressed in a blue coat, the Doctor was dressed like a gentleman in every respect, in a blue coat.</p>
               <p>Q. How near eleven was it when you left him? - A. When I got into Little Russell-Place, I asked the watchman what it was o'clock, and he said, he was just going to cry eleven; I walked very smart, to the best of my belief, I was not more than five minutes; that is nearly opposite Drury-lane playhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this man after his death? - A. I did, on the Thursday following, at St. Giles's work-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What had happened to him to cause his death? - A. It appeared to me that he had been stabbed with some very desperate weapon, but no one could go close to him at that time that I saw him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040038"/>Q. Was the prisoner at this Black Horse? - A. I never saw the prisoner till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a person was the deceased? - A. of the two, my Lord, I am rather taller than the deceased. (The witness was a short man). I went a second time to see to get him away, because he was in liquor, and I could not get him away.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his complexion? - A. He was of a fallow complexion, quite sun burnt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have known him for twelve years? - A. He and I were very intimate seven years in Dublin; we had been in partnership in business.</p>
               <p>Q. You were with him from six till within five minutes of eleven? - A. Yes, I was with him from eight o'clock till near eleven, without ever stiring out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever at the Cock and Magpye, in Drury-lane? - A. I never saw such a house to my knowledge, I was not there that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in the course of that evening, see the woman that has just given evidence? - A. No. From six in the evening, he never opened his lips to a woman; the deceased had come from Ireland that day, with a wife and two children, between four and five in the evening, he called upon me directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he never picked up any woman before you left him? - A. He never spoke to any woman of any kind.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Pearce.) Did you ever see this man after his death? - A. On the Monday, I saw him at St. Giles's work-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was the body of the man that was with you? - A. I am positive he was the man that was in my company all the evening, and I am sure the prisoner at the bar is the man that stabbed him; I was very desirous of going to see the body, to know whether it was the same man or not, and I am positive he was the man that I had been with the night before.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman; On Sunday, the 3d of June, I was alarmed by a screaming, I was at the corner of a baker's window in Great Wild-street, it might want five or ten minutes of twelve at night, I heard a man's voice call out, watch, stop that man.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that baker's shop from the corner of Queen-street? - A. It was about the middle of the street; I turned my head round, and saw a man going into Wild-court, that turns to the Mews; I went down Little Wild-street, which leads into the same Mews, and in going down Wild-street, he passed by me by the Black-house Livery-stables; as soon as I perceived him, I sprung my rattle, and pursued him into the King-head yard, leading into Duke-street, I sprung my rattle there, and in going along the middle of King's-head-yard, I heard something fall like a piece of glass or a knife falling, it ring upon the stones.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that yard a thoroughfare? - A. Yes, three; one goes into Duke-street, facing the Roman-Catholic chapel, and another into the yard, that goes into Great Queen-street. When I got into Duke-street, I lost sight of him; he was a tall thin man, dressed in a light coloured coat, white waistcoat, white breeches, and white stockings; when I found that I had lost the man, I returned back into King's-head-yard, and curiosityaded me to look what it was that made such a noise; I opened the door of my lanthorn, and to my great surprise, I picked up the fatal instrument, with the blade of it all over blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that instrument? - A. This is the same. I immediately carried it to St. Giles's watch-house, and left it there, in going along, after I had found the instrument, when I came to the pump, there was a great noise of rattles; I went up with this instrument in my hand, and there I beheld the deceased lying upon the ground, at the corner of Prince's-court, Drury-lane, almost opposite Broad-court.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from Queen-street? - A. About one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any woman's voice crying stop that man? - A. No, it was a man's voice; and what alarmed me the more, was, that nobody came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you sure the man that you pursued had light coloured clothes on? - A. Yes; something like the colour of whited brown paper.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not a dark blue? - A. No; if it had been a dark colour, I could not have distinguished it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were there many people about the body? - A. I suppose there were about ten people, watchmen and all.</p>
               <p>PATRICK SHEHAN sworn. - The prisoner and I lodged and slept together: I saw the prisoner on Sunday morning, before eight o'clock; I called between three and four in the afternoon, and he was in bed again, I did not disturb him nor speak to him; about a quarter of an hour or ten minutes before eleven at night, I went into bed, and he was then in bed, and remained there till six o'clock next morning; when I awaked in the morning, he was in bed with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040039"/>Q. Where were you all that time? - A.Walking backwards and forwards smoking my pipe, and talking to my neighbours. I went in for a pair of stockings between nine and ten, and he was then in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not absent from the court all the time? - A. Yes, about ten minutes, while I was drinking part of a pint of beer at a public-house, with a friend of the name of William Doyle, that came from Westminster to see me.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, upon your oath, that it was not ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before twelve? - A. Yes, I am sure it was not; I know it was before eleven, I had heard the clock strike ten in the house, while I was sitting with my landlady; we are not above one hundred yards from the church clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not hear it strike eleven before you went to bed? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You saw him in bed between nine and ten? - A. Yes; he was ill all the day, and Nelly, the servant, gave him some bread and milk for supper. Nelly is here.</p>

             sworn. - On the third of June, as near as I can guess, about half past eleven o'clock, I was coming down Drury-lane, I had just walked up Drury-lane before, from Clement's-inn, with a friend, we walked up the same side of Drury-lane, on which the man was murdered.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you passed Prince's-court with your friend? - A. Yes, and turned into Long-acre; when he turned into Long-acre, I walked further on up Drury-lane, not so far as Broad-street, Bloomsbury, but pretty near as far as Broad-street, I then turned round and walked back, meaning to go to Clement's-inn, and as I was going along, I stumbled over something, I looked down, and saw a man lying on the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. What length of time was there between your first passing Prince's-court, and the time when you stumbled? - A. I do not think it could be five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether, when you passed Prince's-court first, that body was lying there? - A. No, it was not lying there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard any cry of watch, or murder? - A. As I was coming down Drury-lane, I heard a rattle spring, but it seemed at a distance, and towards Bloomsbury, but I heard no cry.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Scott.) Did you see any woman near the place when you went with the body? - A. No, I saw no woman there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it very dark? - A. It was dark, and the streets were very quite.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, I have been thinking of this case, and I really think, in a case in which there appears so much doubt, you would not be warranted in finding the prisoner guilty; if you wish to hear the rest of the evidence, we will go on.</p>

            ? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes. On Saturday the 3d of June, I was at the Royal-oak, in Whitechapel-road; my husband and I had been out to spend the evening, it was about half-past twelve o'clock when we entered the house; we enquired at the bar for a person we wanted, and he was not there; my husband said, we will go backwards into the parlour, and see if he is there; we went in, and there sat the prisoner at the bar, and the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be sitting on good terms or bad? - A. I cannot say, she came out, and I came out with her; we went about thirty yards down Whithechapel-road, and she cried to me upon the ill usage he gave her; I said, I would not stay with him; she then said, she would not stay with him, that on Friday evening, he came and used her very ill, broke and destroyed all she had in her place; she shewed me her left hand, it was very much swelled, and she said, that was through the ill usage she had had on Friday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Were her arms black? - A. I do not know, she did not shew me her arms; we then returned to the house, and the prisoner and I had a glass of brandy each, at the bar, and a piece of bread, and then my husband and the deceased came out together with a pot of beer; my husband, and I, and the deceased, and the prisoner, all sat down together in a box, the deceased and the prisoner began to quarrel immediately after they sat down.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they man and wife, or did they only live together? - A. I did not know but what they were man and wife, till after the examination before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long they had lived together? - A. I look upon it, about two years; my husband said, what you have got to say, say at home, do not say it in a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to her? - A. He d-d her eyes and called her a b-h.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he charge her with any thing? - A. Not that I heard at that time; then he struck her in the face with his hands clenched; I made answer, and said, do not use the woman ill, for I know to my certain knowledge that she has been a wife to you, and a mother to your child, and then he struck her again; I called him a blackguard, upon that he struck me, and sent me almost the length of the settle, and then I threw the pot at him; and my husband said, do not strike her, I have had her ten years, and never struck her in my life, and you have no business to strike her; then he called me a w-e, and I said, I was none; he said, he was not the first Jew I had had.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the deceased? - A. A painter and glazier.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a Jew too? - A. Yes; and then he called me w-e again, and we made a laugh at it, and we all sat down again; then they got to words again, and he said to her, I will make a small one of you; upon that, he took her by the left hand, and twisted her arm round, and fell a beating of her, then she took her arm from her right side, and made a blow at him, I thought with that it was with her hand, but presently after, he says, you have got a knife, he opened his breast, and the blood issued out; my husband said, let us be out of this, and then we went away.</p>

               <p>Marsden. Houghton asked me to let him have seven of mine, to make up the number, as he had lost seven, and I told him I should do no such thing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Shelton. You stand convicted of felony, what have you to say for yourself, why you should not receive judgment, to die according to law?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I pray the benefit of the statute.(Mr. Ward, Counsel for the prosecution, put in a plea, stating, that the prisoner was not entitled to benefit of clergy, because he had been before convicted, which was read by Mr. Shelton.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. Prisoner, what you have heard just now read is an allegation that you have been previously convicted, about two years ago, of another offence, of uttering copper money for less than it imported to be worth, and that if you were so, you are not entitled to the benefit of clergy; what have you to say in answer to that charge, of having been so convicted two years ago of another offence, namely, that of uttering copper for less than it imported to be worth?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I thought it was not a capital offence the second time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. Q. Were you convicted two years ago of that offence?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was only three papers of halfpence, I did not sell them to the man - I was cruelly used.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. Do you admit that you are the man that was then convicted - you may say, you were, or you may say you were not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. Prisoner, the offence of which you have been convicted here, during this session, is that of putting off to one William Houghton, forty-two pieces of counterfeit milled money, to the likeness of a shilling, not being cut in pieces and which you put off at a lower rate than they imported to be worth, that is to say, these forty-two counterfeit shillings, for the sum of one guinea, which is just half what they would have been worth, if they had been genuine pieces of money. As to what you said sometime ago, that the offence of which you have now been convicted is not a capital offence; if it had rested by itself, and there had been no former bad conduct on your part, amounting to a felony, it would have been, as you suppose, it would not have been a capital offence; but our ancestors have very wisely, for the public, provided, that men shall not be permitted to offend, from time to time, and be allowed the indulgence of what is called, a clergy, when they are called up to say whether they have any thing to alledge against a sentence of death being passed upon them in a case of felony. It is now a great many years ago, as far back as the reign of

            . when the legislature, in considering this question, I think wisely concluded, that any man, who had once had the benefit of clergy allowed to him, should not, for any future crime, be entitled to that benefit. If a man had been convicted of a felony, and was entitled to his clergy, that proceeded wholly from the lenity, and from the mercy of the law of this land; that lenity was founded upon the idea, or at least the hope, that the man who had been convicted of a felony, might see the extent of his guilt which he had committed, that he might repent, and might afterwards become a useful member of society; but they were satisfied, that as men were so hardened in their dispositions, that by their future conduct, they proved to the world, that they were unworthy of the mercy that had been shewn to them; it should not be extended to a second crime, and therefore, at the time I mentioned to you, the legislature provided, that no man, who had once had his clergy, should have it again; perhaps, in making that provision, they rightly attended to the interests of the public at large - we do find, from the records of cases which have passed in the Courts of Justice of this country, that in the last century it hardly ever happened, that a man, who was convicted of a second felony, was suffered to pass without undergoing the execution of that judgment, which it is my duty to pronounce upon you - perhaps the practice of that time might be more beneficial to the public than that which has prevailed in later times - undoubtedly, we do find, that at the period when that rule was attended to felonies, bore no proportion to what they do in the present day. If the lenity of Courts of Justice has contributed to the multiplication of crimes, it is much to be lamented. It has been the practice, not only of this Court, but of all criminal Courts, to look with an eye of compassion upon the case of the prisoners who are tried; and if any circumstances can be found, which, in any degree, will justify a Court, in interposing in favour of a prisoner, and in lessening that share of punishment which belonged to his crimes, the Courts have most readily interfered; and I am afraid, that in many instances, they have done it beyond what the interest and welfare of the public would warrant. But when we come to the case of second offences, the hands of Courts are considerably tied down; for, by the statute that I have stated, the legislature has provided, that in cases which otherwise would not be liable to the punishment of death, if they come before the Court as a second offence, if it be proved that the prisoner, guilty of that offence, has previously committed another, for which he has been allowed his clergy, that shall not be allowed again, and if the clergy be not allowed, nothing remains, but the Court is bound to pass judgment. There is no case in which, by the laws of this country, our most gracious Sovereign, from whom mercy flows, may not, if he thinks sit, in his wisdom, relax the rigour of the law; but if it be established in this place, that an offender, standing at this bar, has been already allowed his clergy for a former felony, the law says, that for a second felony, on conviction, he is liable to suffer death, and therefore, in the situation in which you stand, it is the bounden duty of the Court to pass that sentence upon you, which is, that <rs id="t17980704-52-punish245" type="punishmentDescription">

            , Nathaniel Lynham, Luke Ball, and John Warwick, and the indictment charges them with a conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Gentleman, on the present occasion, I have the honour to represent a very useful body of respectable gentlemen, master printers, who are induced, in consequence of very great concern for the interest of the public, to bring forward these five men, who are men of very decent appearance, and certainly not men of the lowest understanding, although they are charged with an offence now upon the records of the Court.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the crime of conspiracy has always been looked upon in a very aggravated light indeed, and a more dangerous thing to the public can hardly be stated, than that of a set of men conspiring to obstruct the progress of any one trade; and it is to be lamented, that hardly a year has gone on without a conspiracy having been brought forward by some active men against their masters.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, with respect to the present case, the trade of printing, in this metropolis, has been interrupted from time to time by the journeymen printers, in attempting to get their wages raised, which has been resisted, and with a good deal of effect by the master printers, who were obliged, on the occasion, to have recourse to their apprentices; therefore it was thought expedient by these journeymen printers, that their masters should be prevented from taking more than a certain number of apprentices, for which purpose they formed a meeting together, which, from its appearance, certainly bore no reproachable mark upon it, it was called A Friendly Society; but, Gentlemen, by the means of some wicked men among them, this society degenerated into a most adomnable meeting for the purpose of a conspiracy; those of the trade who did not join this society were summoned, and even the apprentices, and were told, unless they conformed to the practice of these journeymen, when they came out of their times they should not be employed.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, this kind of proceeding went on for a considerable length of time, till about March last, when the master printers then intimated to each other, if those proceedings went on any longer, it would lead to a very dangerous tendency, as they were under the necessity of performing the work with their apprentices, and their own hands.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the masters then caused public notice to be given, purporting, that unless these men would return to a sense of their duty some prosecutions should be commenced and brought against them; then it was that this conspiracy began; the principal leader of which was not then known, but with held from the knowledge of the master printers.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, on the 10th of March, the master printers, in consequence of information given them by the pressmen met at the York Hotel, and there the five defendants came clothed as delegates, they represented themselves as the head of a parliament, as we may call it. The principal spokesman, and the leader of those five defendants, was the defendant Atkinson, and they proposed to the masters five propositions, as conditions, not that they would individually do such and such an act, but that the whole body of pressmen should not come to work, but under certain conditions.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in what situation are we, if those sort of meetings are permitted to go on, or these five men are suffered to take upon themselves, of their own authority, to guide and direct the work in this manner; however, this was the case, Mr. Atkinson was the spokesman, and delivered the following propositions, which the masters took down in writing.</p>
               <p>The first was, that there should be three apprentices to seven presses, allowing another should be taken when the eldest is in the last year of his time.</p>
               <p>Now I will prove to you what was the policy of this resolution, and then it will appear clearly, that if they are limited, they cannot carry on the work.</p>
               <p>The second was, no boy to be admitted upon poundage, unless he be turned over; this is not so material.</p>
               <p>The third was, no apprentices to be permitted in any house, beyond a reasonable time of trial, without being turned over.</p>
               <p>The fourth was, apprentices not to be allowed equal to journeymen, not less than what will properly support them.</p>
               <p>The fifth was, no apprentices to be taken pending the negociation.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, they gave the masters some time to consider of these propositions, and the answer that they returned, was, it could be of no interest for the masters to stop the trade; the interest of the masters, and the interest of the men, must be one and the same, therefore their wish was not for them to do any thing that was prejudicial to the workmen.</p>
               <p>Now, gentlemen, was this a conspiracy or not? Was it not a widely extended conspiracy? Gentlemen, you may judge of that, by what even passed at the meeting of the 10th of March, for no sooner had this meeting broke up, than Mr. Thorn addressed himself to Atkinson, and said, I am in a most disagreeable situation, in consequence of the workmen having left me; I really cannot bring the paper forward, but if Young would assist me, I could bring the paper forward; upon which, Atkinson wrote a note to Young, and actually gave permission for Young to work for him, and he did come forward and work for him.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, messengers were addressed to almost every printing-office in London; to the gentlemen of Mr. Barker's office; whether

            , or whoever was the person employed in this business, is not material, but the contents of this message one would almost shudder at, it is as follows:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, it is the opinion of your committee, that unless your employer gives you a strong assurance, that he has seceded from the body of the masters, you are to consider your engagement this day as at an end."</p>
               <p>Can there be any doubt of a conspiracy of the most dangerous nature; but, if there should be a doubt, I will shew you, that wherever this message was sent, the men came forward and insisted upon an answer.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I need not state to you, when Mr. Atkin<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040050"/>son has stood forward as secretary, that there can be any proof wanted, that this Mr. Atkinson was the author of this message; but if there should be, we have abundant evidence to prove, that this is actually the hand-writing of Atkinson himself.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in consequence of this, these persons all of them struck, and in this situation it is they are obliged to come forward, not merely for the sake of punishing these men, but for the interest of the public; and I am instructed to say, if these men will now give up this conspiracy, and return to their masters, and work as usual, that the masters will stop this proceeding.I do not expect these terms will be acceded to; but, gentlemen, if that is not to be done, if these men will not repent of their wickedness, I hope this Court will have it in its power to inflict a severe punishment upon them, and I trust others will take warning by them. I will prove these facts to you, they lay in a very narrow compass, and when I have proved them to you, there can be no doubt but this conspiracy exists in this metropolis.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I hope the landlord of the public-house, where this meeting was held, will be taken notice of in another place.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I will also prove to you, by a number of witnesses, several of them master printers, that there are a number of journeymen, who are willing to work, but they have been intimidated and told, they shall never get bread if they offer to work; and those, who ar apprentices, are told, when their terms expire, after seven years service, that all their previous labour shall be defeated, and they shall not be employed.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson.I am a master printer, I live in Red-lion-court, Fleet-street: There have been very considerable disputes arisen between masters and journeymen printers.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the master printers increased the number of their apprentices? - A. Yes, they have.</p>
               <p>Q. Since that increase of apprentices, have the pressmen, to your knowledge, struck? - A. The increase was made upon different houses, but very few; it was in consequence of not obtaining sufficient journeymen that the increase was made, and they struck in my own house, and several others.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any application being made to you, and the other masters, to meet the defendants at the bar? - A. Yes; there was an application made by Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence then of what you had heard, did the masters, or any part of them, meet? - A. They did, at the York Hotel.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it? - A. I cannot positively say, with respect to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell nearly? - A. It was in the month of April; it was at the York Hotel.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the defendants at the bar; were they present? - A. They were all present.</p>
               <p>Q. Now state, as distinctly as you can, what passed when you were there - in what capacity did they come? - A. I understood they came as a committee from the general body of journeymen; they did not say they were a committee, but we met them as I committee, and some as propositions were proposed.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them made those propositions? - A. Sometimes one, sometimes another; they were not all delivered by one person.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they delivered in words? - A. I took them down myself verbally.</p>
               <p>Q. What character did Atkinson appear in? - A.As secretary.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect which of them made the propositions? - A. I before said, they were made sometimes by one, sometimes another; Mr. Atkinson made one, Mr. Lynham another; and then sometimes two were speaking at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they, or not, generally discourse upon the propositions that were made? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, that you took down their propositions? - A. I did; this is my handwriting, a great part of it was made at the time, except the two or three lines at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you read over to them what you had wrote, as their propositions? - A. Yes; I read it over to them, and asked them if it was their meaning or not, and they said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of them state any objection to those propositions when you read them over? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. State what those propositions were? - A. The first says, three apprentices to seven presses, allowing another should be taken when the eldest was in the last year of his time; that was the first proposition. The second, no boy to be admitted upon poundage unless he be turned over. The third, no apprentice to be permitted in any house beyond a reasonable time of trial, without being turned over. The fourth, apprentices not to be allowed equal to journeymen, nor less than what will properly support them. The fifth, no apprentices to be taken pending the negociation. These are the whole of the propositions that were delivered at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what answer the masters gave? - A. The answer given was at some length, and put into their hands for their consideration; they took it into the coffee-room.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time? - A. Yes; they took it into the coffee-room, and some short time after returned; and after some little altercation, and some few objections, they were apparently satisfied with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did what you call the negociation conclude at that time, or was there a further time allowed for an answer? - A. Yes, a month; this was, upon recollection, on the 10th of March, at the York Hotel, Bridge-street, Blackfriars.</p>
               <p>Q. A month was to be allowed, for what? - A. To give a final answer to the journeymen, and the trade at large, respecting the propositions made by the journeymen.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040051"/>Q. And they were to go to work till that answer should be delivered? - A. Yes; they agreed to go to work directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean generally, or till that answer should be delivered? - A. Immediately; Mr. Baldwin was in great necessity, and, I think it was Mr. Atkinson, who said, he would send a man directly; it was one of the persons who had struck, that he should return to business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if the masters returned any answer to that? - A. They did return the answer promised, within a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know to whom the answer of the masters was returned? - A. Yes; it was returned to the committee, but to whom I cannot precisely say; it was done by a person that transacts the business, and Mr. Bensley the secretary.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if the masters received any reply from Atkinson, in answer to their answer? - A. I believe they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen one of them? (Shewing him a paper.) - A. Yes; this is the answer that I understood had been delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen it before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen it as his answer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After this reply was given, what was the consequence? - A. They struck.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, that they struck in one office, or more than one? - A. They struck in several offices after the reply was sent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your men strike? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did they assign for striking? - Mr. Knapp. His men are not the defendants, and therefore, what they said to him cannot be evidence against these men.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I submit to the Court, that this is good evidence; we are first to prove a conspiracy; we then alledge, that in consequence of that conspiracy numerous workmen struck; why then, the the conspiracy being alledged, I take it, the conduct of the persons who did strike, is evidence; the conspiracy being first established, that their conduct arose from that conspiracy; for it is charged as an overt act of the conspiracy that they did strike.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It is already in evidence, that the present defendants met the master printers, as a committee; that they made propositions to the masters in the name of the pressmen; that they delivered in those propositions for the pressmen; that at the end of that month they struck a second time, which your Lordship will have most strictly in evidence; and you will find, that instantly after that answer is so given, the pressmen, in the office of Mr. Thorn, struck; and when the answer of the masters is given, they assign that as the reason why they left him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. I apprehended they must prove a knowledge in these persons as connected with the conspiracy stated upon the record, or else your Lordship sees the extent to which it will go; for, unless some knowledge is proved in the defendants upon this record, they might as well extend it to what passed at York, or any other part of the kingdom; and I am sure your Lordship would tell me directly, unless these defendants could be proved to have a perfect knowledge of what these men were about, it is utterly impossible to give that evidence which is contended for on the part of the prosecution; it does seem to me, that what passed at Mr. Thorn's office, with respect to his men striking, unless they prove a concert, and a knowledge in the defendants of what had passed, it is impossible that they should give in evidence any thing like that. I therefore hope your Lordship will be of opinion, that they are not entitled to give any such evidence.</p>
               <p>The objection was over-ruled by the Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Did you converse with your men on the subject of striking? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me the names of the men that you so conversed with? - A.Wm. and Henry Medcraft.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send this man, or any of your journeymen, to the committee? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you send them? - A. They went to the committee.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.How do you know that? - A. They told me so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. That will not do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. What was the purpose for which you sent them? - A. To enquire whether they might be permitted to return to work; they returned in about an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what day this was? - A. It was on the Tuesday; they struck on the Saturday immediately preceding the Sunday, this was on the Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it after the answer was given by the masters that your men struck? - A. The next day, or the next day but one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have stated a meeting in order to enter into a negociation with the journeymen, is that the only meeting you have had in order to settle you differences? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a meeting in the February preceding, at the Globe Tavern? - A. We had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been letters passed between the journeymen and the masters relative to the dispute even previous to that? - A. I believe there were letters passed between the committee and a Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was communicated to the committee? - A. Yes, occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that meeting, at the Globe, had there been any communication, and correspondence, had between the journeymen and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040052"/>masters? - A.Between the journeymen and Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that correspondence regularly communicated to the committee? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this communication been going on? - A. I suppose near two months.</p>
               <p>Q. On both sides it was intended to communicate between you, in a friendly way, upon the subject of your dispute? - A. It was always the desire of the masters so to do.</p>
               <p>Q.You attended the meeting at the Globe Tavern? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at the instance of the masters, desiring a part of the journeymen to meet them at the Globe Tavern? - A. I cannot precisely say, I believe it was through the representation of Mr. Gosnell.</p>
               <p>Q. A master printer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. One of your body? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And through his representation, you think it was, that a meeting was called at the Globe Tavern? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any propositions at that meeting, either from the masters or journeymen? - A. The masters requested, as a preliminary, that the men should return to their work, and give up their opposition.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they submitted no propositions to the committee? - A. Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there not a conversation between the masters and journeymen, relative to the dispute of taking too many apprentices out door and in? - A.There was a conversation on that subject.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a conversation upon that subject before you broke up - was it not expressed by the masters, that the journeymen had conducted themselves in a fair and candid manner, making known their objections at that time; I mean at the Globe Tavern, on the 14th of February? - A. I do not precisely recollect that there was any thing of that kind passed.</p>
               <p>Q. I will put the question again, I ask you - whether, in the course of that conversation, the masters did not express themselves satisfied at the fair and candid manner in which they had treated the dispute, and urged their requests? - A. No, I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will put you in mind of them - did nothing like this take place, that the journeymen said, we hope, gentlemen, you do not mean to take any advantage of us on account of the part we have taken in the business, with a view to bring about an amicable adjustment of the dispute; in answer to which, the masters, all of them, immediately said, no, by no means, we hope you will not think so, God forbid that we should attempt it; do you recollect any thing of that sort? - A. Yes. I recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, after having stated to the Court, that you recollect that, perhaps your memory may be a little refreshed - I ask you again, whether the masters did not express themselves satisfied with the conduct of the journeymen at that time, in having met so reasonable a set of men, telling them at the same time, that they might depend upon it that they would be their friends - do you recollect that? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the men then, in the result of both these instances, were given to understand that they had conducted themselves decently and properly to their masters, in urging their request in the reasonable manner in which they had urged it? - A. Yes, up to that period.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you appeared perfectly satisfied with the conduct and the manner in which the journeymen had conducted themselves, and they went away with the idea? - A. They went away without any particular determination; the matter still hung in suspence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, in order to satisfy every body, submit to shake hands before you parted? - A. There was no kind of animosity, I believe, but there was no shaking hands.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear there was no shaking hands? - A.There was no such thing as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. After that time, and between the 14th of February and the 10th of March, and the meeting at the York Hotel, did there continue a negociation at all between the masters and journeymen - was there any correspondence kept up? - A. I believe there was with a Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed with Mr. Davis, was made known to the committee of the masters? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that a negociation was kept on foot previous to the meeting at the Globe Tavern, at the Globe Tavern, and down to the York Hotel, on the 10th of March - did you, at the York Hotel, join in the wish to negociate the business upon an amicable footing? - A. Most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. The meeting at the York Hotel was at the desire of the masters convening a part of the journeymen? - A. No, at the request of the journeymen.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, at the request of the journeymen, whom you had been negociating with, they, of their accord, desired you, the masters, to meet them again at the York Hotel? - A. They did, by letter.</p>
               <p>Q.And in consequence of that, did they attend the committee? - A. They did, the five defendants.</p>
               <p>Q.And then the propositions were made, that you have stated to my learned friend? - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you again, whether, even after these propositions were made, and the negociation had subsisted between you from the beginning to the end of this date, whether you did not even<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040053"/>then part friendly with the journeymen, and promise to be their friends? - A. We parted friendly at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you part almost in the same terms as at the Globe Tavern? - A. We parted with still greater hopes of the matter coming to a conclusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those hopes increased from the conduct of the journeymen? - A. Yes; from the manner in which they received us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you then, with these hopes, promise to be their friends, and not to take advantage of them? - A. There was no promise made.</p>
               <p>Q. But was it stated by any body at that meeting? - A. I do not thing it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did part with them better friends than before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you institute this prosecution? - A. Better than a month; it was not determined on till after the men had struck.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon did you institute this prosecution, after the month agreed upon between you, the masters, and the journeymen? - A. It was after the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it two or three days, or was it a week? - A. I believe it might be three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard it stated, that this is a mild prosecution, and that peace is all that the masters want - did you take up these men upon warrants, the moment the indictment was preferred? - A. That I cannot say, I believe they might; I do not know whether they were or not.</p>
               <p>Solicitor for the prosecution. They were; two of them were taken up on a warrant; one of these defendants was taken on the Saturday, and continued till Monday; that was Warwick, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. I would just ask you, whether, after the meeting of the committee, at the York Hotel, and after the month had gone by, whether, even on the part of Atkinson, from the committee of journeymen, a negociation was not further urged to the masters? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard of it? - A. I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. Bensley? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is the secretary to your committee? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not communicated to him, that the journeymen wished to have a further negociation with the masters? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You belonged to the meeting of the masters? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And you help to carry on this prosecution - do not you expect to pay your share of the expences? - A. The same as the fund on the other side.</p>
               <p>LUKE HANSARD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did the defendant, Atkinson, ever work with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that paper, and tell me if you believe it to be his hand-writing? - A. I do not think the paper is; I believe the signature to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that paper? - A. I believe that also to be his signature.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Atkinson work with you at the time the journeymen struck? - A. No, he did not.</p>

To the master printers, Gentlemen, the pressmen were in hopes, from the length of time you have taken, and the promises you have made, when last they had the honour of meeting, that the business would have been more amicably adjusted; nor can they help saying, that your answer tends to no regulation respecting the apprentices, the origin of the present dispute; and unless your body come to some regulation on that head, the pressmen consider the negociation at an end.

               <p>Cross-Examined by Mr. Raine. I observed something in that paper respecting regulations of apprentices - I ask you, whether you think it reasonable that masters should take apprentices out of doors, without stint, and without number? - </p>
               <p>Court. You cannot ask that; it is no part of this question, whether the journeyman's request is reasonable or not, it is the mode and not the thing that we are to enquire into.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. I beg your Lordship's pardon; I submit that we are to enquire into the thing as well as the mode.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly not; we are not sitting here to arbitrate between the masters and the men; I do not think that it is any part of the question, even in mitigation of punishment, it is only wasting the time of the Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. I believe you know there is a Friendly Society subsisting among the pressmen? - A. I have heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, you know the nature of these societies, that as Friendly Societies they are extremely beneficial? - A. Yes, I believe they are.</p>

               <p>Q. Therefore, you had an opportunity of seeing his general character and conduct? - A.While he worked with me, I respected him as a good, sober workman.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know, whether before the meeting on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040054"/>the 10th of March, at the York-hotel, the pressmen in the trade had struck? - A. Yes; my men had struck long before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge, whether the trade has been at all obstructed in consequence of that striking? - A. To my knowledge it has.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you speak of yourself individually, or others? - A. I speak of myself individually, and others besides.</p>
               <p>Q. After the meeting at the York-hotel, do you know whether, on the 10th of March, the journeymen came to work? - A. They came to work on the Monday following; my men, who had been absent and refused to come to work for some weeks, I believe, did then return; the meeting was on the Saturday preceding; till then, I could get no men to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether your men, or any other men, in the employment of any other persons, pressmen, struck, after you had returned the answer to the pressmen? - A. After we had returned our answer, my men left me.</p>
               <p>Q.When did they leave you? - A.Four weeks after the 10th of March; I do not recollect the day, some of them gave me warning, that is the usual course of the trade, the others left me without warning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, from that time, been able to get any pressmen to work for you? - A. Two old men, who are, I understand, proscribed, by the rest of the trade, continued to work for me; and one, who came from Scotland, has worked for me for some little time; besides that, I have no men.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in want, and have you been, of more men? - A. Yes; I have been in great distress for more men, and was at the time they left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing the defendants, or any of them, at the York Hotel? - A. Yes; I recollect seeing them all at that meeting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hovel. Q. You, perhaps, know, of your own knowledge, there does exist a friendly society of journeymen? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never had occasion to know, that any of the defendants belonged to a Friendly Society of journeymen? - A. Not to a Friendly Society.</p>
               <p>Q.How many out-door apprentices did you happen to have, at the origin of this dispute? - A. At the origin of this dispute, I had two.</p>
               <p>Q. Only two? - A. Only two.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that been the greatest number you ever had from that time to this? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many more have you got at this time? - A. I have now four, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you recollect the exact number? - A. Yes, four in the whole, and one in doors; I have had five at one time, but one of them ran away upon my desiring him to bring up ano her, because I could not get journeymen.</p>
               <p>Q. I think I understand you to say, that you did not know of this Friendly Society of journeymen? - A. I understand there was a society of pressmen existing, but not a Friendly Society; what I understand by a Friendly Society, is a Benefit society; as such, I do not know, nor do I understand there is any such society existing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of the articles of that society-perhaps it may happen to you to have read them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you saw these articles, perhaps you read them attentively? - A. I think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in them, at that time, that was repugnant to your feelings, or judgment? - A. I think there was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the person so that shewed them to you? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps, to him, you expressed an approbation of them? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at them in the presence of the person who brought them? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with that person about them? - A. I don't recollect that I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a printed copy of the articles of this Society? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the book again? - A. I think so.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the? - A. I believe these are the articles, I do not remember the index.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the title page - do you find the term Friendly in that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you have no recollection, or ever heard of a society denominated a Friendly Society? - A. I did not say so; I have heard of such a Society, but I did not believe there was such a society existing.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a copy of the articles binding that Society together? - A. I do not believe these articles do bind that Society together; I take that to be an insnaring question.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you believe it to be an insnaring question? - A. I do not believe there is any such society existing under these articles, as a Benefit Society; I never heard of any one man being upon that Society.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any conversation with Atkinson upon the subject of these articles? - A. I cannot say; if I have, it has escaped my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell atkinson, that you thought the object of the society good, and the regulations proper? - A. I do not remember telling him so.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not? - A. No, I will not swear it; I do not recollect it; if I had ever said so, I am convinced I must have added; If they adhered to those articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have some recollection of it? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040055"/>Q. Then how can you put that interpretation upon it? - A. I put no interpretation upon it.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you ever at Hicks's-hall, Clerkenwell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion? - A. Attending the trial of some of my own men.</p>
               <p>Q. For a conspiracy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it? - A. It was removed by a certiorari.</p>
               <p>Q. Who removed it? - A. My attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you prosecute it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you speaking of the present prosecution? - A. No; of a prosecution that I had commenced against my own journeymen, for a conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Q. To do what? - A. To injure me, in preventing my taking apprentices.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that indictment either given up, or prosecuted? - A. You were there, and therefore you know.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not standing in the evidence box, it is my business to ask you questions, and you must answer them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that a prosecution for an offence, making a part of this conspiracy? - A. Yes; I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago, was it a month? - A. No; a few days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was a part of this conspiracy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only time you have ever been at Hick's Hall? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion have you been there? - A. I have been there to enter into a recognizance.</p>
               <p>Q. To try these very persons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever there at any other time? - A I do not remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Then these were the only times you had been there? - A. Yes; I was there once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion were you there then? - A. On a trial, respecting an apprentice, about three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What, your apprentice had indicted you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.For what? - A. For assaulting him.</p>
               <p>Court. That can have nothing to do with this question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hovel. My Lord, I conceive it is competent for me to try the credit of this witness; I submit to your Lordship, that it is the only way we have of trying it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. He was convicted of that assault.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis. I was convicted, and the fine, I think, was fourpence, and the apprentice wanted to return to me after that; and before the trial, he offered to return, if I would give him one shilling a week for wages; at that time he was not my apprentice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hovel. Q. It was a tristing switch that you beat him with? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it as thick as my wrist? - A. No; about as thick as my little finger.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the fine no more than four-pence? - A. I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was not the reason you gave to the Court, last Monday, for withdrawing that prosecution, that you would prosecute the ringleader first? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you one of the masters that resisted the regulations, respecting the apprentices? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. At one time you had five apprentices? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, should you have had so many apprentices, if you could have got journeymen to work? - A. No, upon my oath, I should not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hovel. Q.Were you driven to take these apprentices, because the journeymen refused to work? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take them at the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How many? - A. Three.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any one of these taken during the month allowed for negociation? - A. They were all in the house before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any one assigned to you from any other person? - A. I am not quite clear whether the articles of one were signed, but they were all taken before that; my men had struck long before the general conspiracy; the conspiracy began in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any one apprentice after the meeting at the York Hotel, when it was agreed by the masters, that you should take no more apprentices during that month? - A. It was not so agreed that I know of; it was agreed, that we should take no more than we had.</p>
               <p>Q.Was not the articles of this one boy signed during that month? - A. I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.You had received them into the house before the meeting? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am a master printer, in Union-street, Blackfriars, in partnership with my father: I was at the meeting at the York Hotel, on the 10th of March.</p>
               <p>Q.Had your men struck at that time? - A. My men never struck at all.</p>
               <p>Q. At the York Hotel, had you any conversation with Atkinson? - A. Yes; upon coming out of the room I met Atkinson, and I told him the difficulty I should have in working the newspaper that afternoon, for the men were not present; I said, I suppose, in consequence of the agreement that had then been made, the men who had been before in my service would return immediately to it; I said, I wanted a man of the name of Young<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040056"/>he said, stay, I had better give you a note; I saw him go into the back coffee room and write it, he delivered it into my hands, and it contained, as nearly as I recollect, the following words -</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the note directed to? - A. I am not confident whether it was directed or not.</p>
               <p>Q.For whom did Atkinson tell you it was intended? - A. Mr. Young, the pressman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send it to Young? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did Young come to work-after? - A.Inconsequence of it, immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. That note is not in your possession? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Young was one of those pressmen who had struck? - A. My men had not struck, I had discharged them; I requested them to work a form for Mr. Davis, whose men had left him, and they all refused, and therefore I told them, if they would not do as I requested them, they should not work for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you one of the committee of master printers? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the Globe Tavern at the meeting of the 14th of February? - A. I cannot recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it the day on which the masters invited the journeymen to meet them? - A. I did meet the journeymen, and the proposition was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the conclusion perfectly friendly between the masters and journeymen? - A. I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the masters, during the negociation, making use of any expressions of this nature, upon the journeymen saying this: we hope, gentlemen, you do not mean to take any advantage of us, on account of the part we have taken in the business, with a view to bring about an amicable adjustment of the dispute; in answer to which, the masters, all of them, immediately said, no, by no means, we hope you do not think so; God forbid that we should attempt it? - A. I do recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect this likewise: the masters telling the journeymen, at the same time, that they were perfectly satisfied with their conduct, and were happy in having met with so reasonable a set of men; telling them, at the same time, they might depend upon it they would be their friends? - A. Not precisely in those words.</p>
               <p>Q. To the effect then? - A. No, nor to the effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether the negociation was not on foot even between the meeting at the Globe Tavern and the meeting at the York Hotel? - A. There was something like a negociation with Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was communicated to the committee? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And at the meeting at the York Hotel, some propositions were made? - A. Yes; I know it was generally understood, at the York Hotel, that no criminal notice should be taken of the defendants for what passed at the York Hotel.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether their conduct, at the York Hotel, was not such as induced you to believe that there were better hopes than even at the Globe? - A. By no means; I did not understand it so.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there not been, since the meeting at the York Hotel, a negociation fought for? - A. I have never attended any meeting since the meeting at the York Hotel.</p>

               <p>The Court were of opinion, that as the witness had sworn that he always carried it about in his pocket, and lost it, it was to be presumed it was not in existence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Look at that paper, are the contents of that similar to the note you received? - A. I believe it is.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Clifton one of your men? - A. Yes; he struck with two others; I call it striking, because he left me without notice.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of any note being sent to your office? - A.Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your trade suffer any obstruction from it? - A. Yes; very great, for a considerable time since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the trade in general has been obstructed from this striking? - A. From what I can learn, it has very much.</p>

               <p>DEODATUS BYE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a printer: My journeymen pressmen left me on Easter Tuesday last, somewhere about the 10th of April.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did your business continue deserted by your men? - A.Till about a week previous to Whitsun holidays.</p>
               <p>Q. How have you been able to restore to yourself the power of getting men? - A. My business pressed me so much, I was obliged to comply with their requisition.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you comply with their request from a conviction of it's propriety, or from the impossibility of conducting your business without? - A. I could not conduct my business without.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you express any consent to this, till you were in absolute want of men to carry on your business? - A. By no means whatever.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am a master printer; my men did not strike till the 7th of April, they left me without notice.</p>
               <p>Q. That was after the answer of the masters had been given? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if any letter came to your house? - A. No; I cannot speak to that, I have every reason to believe there did, but I cannot swear to it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. May it please your Lordship, Gentlemen of the Jury. At this late hour of the day, it falls to my lot to address you upon the present occasion, in behalf of those defendants, who are called in this indictment, and who are proved to be, journeymen pressmen.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this cause has been ushered to your notice, with all the zeal and all the ability that this Court could produce; and give me leave to say, the learned Gentleman who opened this cause, has a little outstepped his usual outgoings, in his opening of this case. Gentlemen, I have attended this Court a series of years, and do assure you, upon my honour, I never heard from my learned friend, or any one in his place, a speech more inflated with a zeal borrowed from his clients, than the one with which he introduced the present cause. But I have the happiness to address twelve gentlemen, selected in the usual way, who have lent their attention to every circumstance that has been given in evidence, and given it all the consideration that they were called upon to do; and therefore, upon that circumstance alone it is, that I feel myself confident in the event of the conflict which is now before you, that it will be fortunate to the present defendants.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, my learned friend set out with stating to you, that he represents a body of useful and respectable gentlemen, whose zeal for the public interest is, perhaps, only exceeded by the riches they possess. Gentlemen, in what character do I appear before you? I represent a body of honourable and useful mechanics, who have a right to a claim of justice at your hands, and I am sure you will give every effect to the evidence that you can, in their favour.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, my learned friend has not conducted himself as he usually does in other cases, with observing upon the sort of conspiracy stated upon this record; but, I suppose, in order to inflame your minds, to lead you away from the true point in the cause, he has thought fit to state to you that which I confess I never before heard stated in a Court of Justice, that conspiracies of a nature like the present, have been examined over and over again, and sifted to the bottom for twenty years last past, in this Court and others. Gentlemen, do I deal hardly with my learned friend, when I say it is unusual, when I say it is a sort of argument, that he should not have used upon this occasion, he having introduced to your notice, that which does not belong to the cause; because he hopes, from the weakness, I suppose, of the evidence in the cause, with the assistance of the zeal that he has displayed, and observations that do not belong to the cause, to bring you to that conclusion, which I undertake to say you cannot come to after the observations that I shall make.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, my learned friend sets out with stating to you, that this, which is called a Friendly Society, has other objects in view, and he would insinuate, though he has not proved it, that, from the evidence that he has been given, you must come to the conclusion, that they had no other object, but that of distressing their masters, and obstructing the trade. Gentlemen, is that fair argument against honest and industrious men, who have deserved well of their masters, for that is the character given by his own master of one of them, and which I have no doubt they all possess. Gentlemen, have you lived in this great metropolis long enough to be totally ignorant, or have you lived long enough to know what the objects of a Friendly Society are, and that it is a benefit to a class of poor mechanics, who have lost their bread, and have nothing to depend upon but their brother workmen, who are earning, by the sweat of their brow, a small pittance for their families. Have not you learned, that that is a laudable undertaking, it is for the advantage of the lower order of mechanics, and if it is carried on for the purposes for which it was instituted, most undoubtedly nobody could complain of it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I hold in my hand, the articles of this society, and they are entitled, "Articles to be observed by the Society of Journeymen Pressmen, held at the house of Mr. Amory, at the Crown, near St. Dunstan's Church, Fleet-street;" and then it proceeds to state, In italicks, what is the purpose of their institution; it says, "A number of pressmen having entered into a society the better to support the trade." - Now look a little, gentlemen, do you think this society, which prosesses to support the trade, can have any idea of doing that which my learned friend would impute to them, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040061"/>of destroying the trade; but here you see their institution was for the purpose of better supporting the trade,"and those that are distressed." - Look at it, gentlemen, is it a wicked, or a criminal thing, to assist the distressed? And I am extremely happy to be able to state the humanity of these persons, that they have the opportunity and the inclination to assist their poor distressed brethren in trade. Then it goes on, that they thought it necessary to bind themselves together under the articles thereto subjoined. Gentlemen, it does not belong to my practice to state, at great length, to you, that which, perhaps, in the end, may not be very material, and therefore, I will not pursue article by article, the contents of this book; not that I could have any objection, but it would be needless to take up your time. Now, Gentlemen, look at the insinuation that is cast out; to support the trade is the original purpose of the institution, and yet my learned friend would have you believe they mean the destruction of that trade upon which they live, upon which they feed, and by which they maintain their families. But, Gentlemen, I think, when you come to draw your conclusions upon the subject, you will be of opinion, that those who wish to live by a trade, will not associate for its destruction.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, my learned friend begins with the meeting at the York Hotel, as if nothing had happened before. Gentlemen, had it its origin there? - Not one question to that point is put by the learned gentlemen, all three of them, anxious enough to call to their assistance both evidence that has been determined to be inadmissible, and that which has been admitted. Zeal, such as I have seen to-day, I never before saw, especially in a case where the punishment of the delinquency is to be so great, for this Court has the power of fine and imprisonment-nay, I believe, has the power of subjecting to the pillory those men who have been proved, by their own masters, to be skilful workmen, and to have conducted themselves honesty and laboriously.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, before we come to the York Hotel,(for I take it up at a date considerably antecedent to the time of that meeting), had there been any dispute in the trade? - Oh, yes, there had. - Had there been any negociation set on foot before that meeting? - Oh, yes, there had, at the Globe. - Had there been any meeting before that? - Oh, yes, there had - Why then let us look a little at the conduct of the masters, and of the journeymen. - Here are letters pass, a correspondence takes place. - The defendant, Atkinson, acted as secretary to this Friendly Society, which was a mere benefit society, and a laudable institution, and they themselves think sit to apply to their masters, and their masters afterwards send to them, giving them reason to expect and hope every thing from them, and desiring that a person from their committee, (which the masters knew had been instituted many years before), might meet themselves to take into consideration-what? - The subject matter of this conspiracy; - Oh, say they, but you call them delegates. -Why, Gentlemen, what magic is there in the word delegates? the masters desiring that a delegation from their journeymen might attend them to take into consideration the dispute between them, and see whether it could be amicably adjusted.</p>
               <p>Now let us look what has been the conduct of these men, and see whether they have been inclined to rip up, by the roots, that trade in which they are engaged. -Why then, at the Globe meeting, you have it come out, that there was an enmity subsisting between the masters and the journeymen; that they went before the Grand Jury at the next Sessions to prefer a bill of indictment for a conspiracy; that they took up one with a warrant and committed him to prison, when there was no chance of his running away, because his family, and every thing that was dear to him, remained here; the negociation was still on foot, another meeting was desired by the masters with the journeymen, which was held at the York Hotel, and there, though not in terms, yet in substance and effect, the same conduct was observed as at the Globe. - Did the negociation cease? It did not. -There were propositions submitted, which the masters must have thought reasonable; because, no other man living, who has attended to the case, can think them unreasonable; a month was given to them to consider, and not till the expiration of that month do we hear of their taking it into consideration, or giving it an answer. During that month the men had returned to their work; and it was understood, between the masters and the men, that at the expiration of that month, there should be an end of the negociation; the masters then conceived that they were, at that moment, at liberty to take up these deluded wretches; I say deluded wretches, because they have deluded them, and made them the objects of prosecution.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, with what demeanour, and in what terms, did the journeymen conduct themselves in their different meetings during the negociation? - Was it in terms of enmity, or rancour; were they insolent to their masters, or did they conduct themselves as only wishing to have relief from what they conceived to be an injury, and with all the decency belonging to their character? - Why then is this to be called a conspiracy; here are invitations from the masters to settle a dispute that had been long subsisting between them. - Will you not then suppose, that these men were to consider themselves disengaged as at the beginning of the negociation; and that, upon the faith implicitly observed between them, they were not to be brought into a Court of Justice. They had, themselves, promised that no advantage should be taken of them, and that they would be their friends. Gentlemen, Is this being their friends? - Is it thus that they take no advantage of them? - It seems to me, that you will all answer in a chorus with me, that the masters have taken advantage of them; they do not think it to their interest to listen to them, and therefore they institute a prosecution. Would any of you have expected, after what you have heard, that a prosecution would have been instituted after so long a negociation? I know what your answer will be from the attention you have given to the evidence. It appears, upon the evidence, that these men have actually been endeavouring to renew the negociation, after this prosecution was instituted for this dark, this vile, this wicked conspiracy, which had for its origin to root up the trade, and destroy every thing that is valuable in our commerce.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Let us go along with the masters a little further, and see what their conduct is - My learned friends thought it necessary to put them upon their character in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040062"/>the world, and upon their wealth; I am not at all disposed to quarrel with their characters, or with their wealth, but, in my turn, I put my clients upon their characters. - Gentlemen, within four days of the termination of that negociation, they institute a prosecution, after the negociation had been wished to be continued on the part of the journeymen; they would not hear any thing the journeymen had to say upon the subject, but they think fit to find a bill on a Friday and on the Saturday they take up one of his Majesty's peaceful subjects upon a Bench Warrant, and imprison him till the Monday; and would have imprisoned the others, but, I believe, the truth was, that they could not find them when they wanted them; and now they make a merit of letting them be out upon bail - Is peace then all they desire, or is there not a malignant spirit that arises in their minds?</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, my Lord, in the course of this trail, has hinted to my learned friend and me, that, with respect to the law of this case, there can be no doubt, because he says, which I admit, that, even persons conspiring among themselves to do a lawful act, is an offence that the law is cognizant of; most undoubtedly, I admit the law, as I am bound to do, when it is laid down by so great an authority. - But, Gentlemen, I do not go upon the law of the subject, except as it accompanies the fact; and I say, in order to constitute this a conspiracy, the thing itself in its origin must be unlawful, and, that they must have had an intention to do those overt acts, which it is stated they did; and if you can find that they originally intended to disturb the whole trade, and ruin themselves, it seems to me, you will be doing more injury to plain facts, than any Jury that ever sat in a Court of Justice have yet ventured to do.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it may not be known to you, but it is well known to my learned friend who sits here, that, by the Charters of the City of London, if any money is given to an apprentice to do the work of a journeyman, it will break up the indentures, and both master and apprentice shall be disfranchised. Gentlemen, you will find that in an Act of Common Council, passed the eighth of 
               <persName id="t17980704-61-person463">
                  Henry

                  </persName>
            . Now is that a reasonable sort of ordinance, or is it not? - No money was to be paid to an apprentice - Why? - Because the City of London had for it's object, to protect the trade in general, and it could not protect the journeymen while it allowed the masters to pay the apprentices that which, if it was otherwise applied, would go into the pockets of the journeymen; and therefore it ordained, that they should not have wages, or if they had, it should disfranchise the person apprenticeing, and the person apprenticed. In this case, you find that one of these gentlemen was not content with having four apprentices, but must extend the number to five, one in doors and four out - You will see, Gentlemen, also, that, by this ordinance of the City of London, they had another good object in view, they wished to ordain, that apprentices should always be boarded with their masters, because they should be under the controul of their masters, otherwise, persons of young and tender years would be liable to go astray, they would be liable to get into bad company, and commit those sort of depredations, which would make them liable to the pains of the law.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, let us see whether the mutual interests of the journeymen and masters go hand in hand, because my learned friend says, the master printers have nothing in view but the welfare, the good order, and the interests of the journeymen - their interests are inseparable - Can you say their interests are inseparable, when you see what they do, when the masters are paying to apprentices, who work out of their house, a poundage upon that work, which would otherwise, most undoubtedly, go to the journeymen? - The more out door apprentices they can get, the less journeymen they would want, and the poor class of men that I represent, would be obliged either to starve, or seek another employment; therefore it was, that the journeymen, in a decent manner, thought proper to enter into a negociation with their masters, upon the subject; and that is the crime for which these men, honest in their line of life, are called upon here to answer to day; for you to say, whether you will doom them to the horrors of the place opposite to me, or whether you will restore them to their business, and to their families.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it appears in evidence, that at their meeting, the words, criminal prosecution were mentioned; nothing of a criminal nature was to be pursued against them; we will promise you not to institute any criminal prosecution; and then, like serpents, we will turn round upon you, and, as the Scripture says, out of your own mouths we will convict you.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, have I made fit observations upon this case; if I have, for God's sake, restore these men, that they may bring to a sense of justice their masters, and let them be put upon a footing with journeymen of every other trade and description of commerce. - Gentlemen, I wish it to be understood, that I cast no imputation upon them, but we are all liable to mistake; and I say, the masters, as a body, have been mistaken in their conduct. Gentlemen, my learned friend has made this offer, if you will return to your duty as you have hitherto conducted yourselves, and subscribe to the regulations which we have made, we will give up the prosecution. - Now Gentlemen, let us see whether justice calls upon us so to do; for if justice does not call upon us so to do, I am sure you will not. - First of all, is the desire of the journeymen reasonable or not? Is it reasonable to suppose, that journeymen, who have, many of them, perhaps, entered into the holy estate of matrimony, will submit to give up a part of their profits to younger hands, while they look upon their families, and say, we must starve. - Do I look at humane, calm, dispassionate, well-judging, minds? Am I addressing myself to Gentlemen who have been in a Jury-box, in a Court of Justice, before? Am I addressing myself to Gentlemen who feel no prejudice on either side? Am I addressing myself to Gentlemen who win, and seek for nought but justice in every verdict they give; if I am doing so,(and I have no reason to doubt it), I am sure you will be of opinion, that if this is what the journeymen ask and desire, they desire nothing more than any subject of his Majesty has a right to petition, even his Majesty himself for; they, having toiled through the most laborious part of their business, at a time of life, when many of them, perhaps, may not have youth on their side, they ask for that pittance which, by law, ought not to be given to an apprentice, and which would otherwise go into their own pockets - Is that reasonable, Gentlemen? I am now appealing to your humanity, is it reasonable, or is it not? - Now, Gentlemen, I will make them an offer - if they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040063"/>will consent to limit the number of apprentices, the men shall return to their work. - It is quite beside the question, whether these men are guilty of a conspiracy or not; but as offeres are the fashion, that offer I give to them.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, it does seem to me, after the observations that I have made, that your verdict, if you give it for the prosecution, must be given upon this ground, that, going to bed with as peaceful slumbers as surround you each night when you do go to bed, you can believe that these men intended to limit the number of apprentices by going throught thick and thin, to make the masters do that which the prosecutors insinuate. Gentlemen, I am sure that every part of this case that has been repeated before you, has been attended to by you, with that attention, that will do honour to you so long as you live; but I will just read to you the language of the masters at the Globe Tavern; the men say, "We hope, gentlemen, you do not mean to take any advantage of us, on account of the part we have taken in the business, with a view to bring about an amicable adjustment of the dispute." In answer to which, the masters say, "No, by no means, we hope you will not think so, God forbid that we should attempt it." -Thus, you see, making an appeal to our Maker, that they would not take any advantage of it, and yet a case of a criminal nature is brought before you for your consideration. - Gentlemen, they do not stop there, but they go on to tell them that they were perfectly satisfied with their conduct, and were very happy in having met with so reasonable a set of men, telling them at the same time, that they might depend upon it they would be their friends; and yet, Gentlemen, they have done what I have described to you.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I beg pardon for having detained you so long - I have made such observations as have occurred to me upon this case, and it seems to me impossible, under the circumstances of this case, for men, acting upon their oaths, to pronounce a verdict of guilty.</p>
               <p>Summing up.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury. The charge imputed to the present defendants, by the law of this country, is a very heinous crime, and is properly so considered, because the consequences of it must be very fatal to society; nothing can be more injurious to society, than men meeting privately to do injury to large bodies of men, therefore it has at all times been considered, by the law of this country, as a very serious offence. In the present instance, it not only affects the peace of society, but also the commerce of the country, and for that reason is punished by very severe penalties. When, on the one hand therefore, you find the interests of society affected by it, and on the other, severe penalties attached, it becomes a very serious case for the consideration of a Jury.</p>
               <p>The learned Counsel has gone very much into the nature of the propositions made by the men to the masters, and has given you to understand that they are good and wife propositions, and that they could not do wrong upon those propositions. Now, the law is decidedly the reverse of that, for, even if you believe that they united together to do a god and useful act, the mode which they take to execute their purpose, is by a conspiracy, and that, in all the books, is held to be a conspiracy. You have had a speech from the Counsel, as if he had been addressing the House of Commons at the bar of that House upon the merits of the question. I forbear at all to go into the question, whether it is a fair or reasonable proposition; and as to the question, whether it has been an improper prosecution, and brought from improper motives. It has been proved on all hands, that a great part of the journeymen have struck; I therefore, do not think, that the prosecution brought by the masters, is to be reprobated under these circumstances; but I wish you to try this cause with all the temper you can, neither taking a prejudice in favour of the masters or of the men; while they conduct themselves peaceably and with good order in society, they are both valuable; journeymen are as necessary to the public in trade as the masters, and therefore as long as they conduct themselves with propriety on the one side, and on the other they deserve to be respected; if they do not, but go the length of offending the laws, they must take the consequence. The only question is, whether these five men have offended the law in the way that I have stated, namely, that they have conspired to injure and obstruct the trade of their masters.</p>
               <p>In the first Count is contained a special charge, which I must say, the evidence does not prove; but I think the evidence does prove the general Count; and if that is made out to your satisfaction, it will be an offence for which they are answerable.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall state shortly the points to which your attention ought to be directed. I think it appears by the evidence, that after the 7th of April, when the agreement was at an end, and they refused to come to terms, a great part of the men struck; now, if they did strike, that was certainly an act that tended to impoverish the trade; and if so, the next question is, whether, in consequence of any proceeding which took place by Atkinson, or any of the defendants at the bar, that took place which is stated upon the evidence; for, upon this indictment, supposing any one of them to have acted in concert with the other, the crime is made out against them. You have been told that these people have been acting as a benefit club; these men might have a benefit club, but it does not at all follow, that pursuing that benefit club, they might not do the acts stated upon the indictment; they may have taken the advantage of that meeting to apply it to other purposes, which are illegal, therefore it is for you to collect from the whole of the evidence, whether these five persons, who appear to be members of that club, did take that part which is imputed to them; and if you think you can fairly draw that conclusion, you will find them guilty; but if you are not satisfied, that there was that sort of concert, and that in consequence of their recommendation the parties struck, you will acquit them.
