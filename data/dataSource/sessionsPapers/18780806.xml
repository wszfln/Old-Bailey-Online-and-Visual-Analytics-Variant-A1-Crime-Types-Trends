                  </hi>. I live at 34, Bridge Road, Ham<lb/>mersmith, and am a retired lieutenant-colonel in the British Army—in December, 1876, I was desirous of purchasing 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Egyptian stock; that was the nominal value—I did not buy it myself, I employed Mr. Byers, a stockbroker—the real value of it was 10, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid 369<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and arranged with Mr. Byers that he should effect a loan with the London and County Bank for 10,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for it—I gave Mr. Byers 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of London Chatham and Dover Stock to lodge with the London and County Bank for what they term a margin—the value of that roughly was between 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think the loan was for six months—I left the matter to be carried out by Mr. Byers—I afterwards had to arrange with Mr. Byers about renewing the loan—I was under the belief that the Egyptians had been purchased and deposited with the London and County Bank with the London Chatham and Dover stock, and that the loan had been effected on my behalf in the way I have mentioned—in September last year I arranged with Mr. Byers that the loan from the London and County Bank should be paid off, and a loan obtained from the Bank of England, and in consequence of what he stated to me about the extra margin required, I gave him 100 shares of the Lombardo-Venetian Railway; they were of the value of 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I believed that the fresh loan had bean effected in that way—I think I first discovered' in March that my stock had not been deposited with the Bank of England—I communicated with my solicitor and the bank, and an inquiry took place, and I then instituted this prosecution against Gattie, Keymer being then out of the way—that was in the beginning of April—the result has been that I have parted with my London Chatham and Dover stock and the Lombards, and got nothing in exchange.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have known Mr. Byers several years—he had not acted for me before in matters of speculation—I knew he was not a member of the Stock Exchange—I employed Mr. Foster, a stockbroker, to purchase my London Chatham and Dover stock—that was no speculation—I was not aware who Mr. Byers was employing for the purpose of carrying out this transaction—I did not know that Mr. Foster had anything to do with the transaction in reference to the Egyptians—I don't know in what way Mr. Byers was to be recompensed for his trouble; there was no arrange<lb/>ment between us, I paid him nothing; he did it as a friend—I told him to buy 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Egyptian stock—I knew he had purchased them, because I saw both the brokers through whom he purchased them, Mr. Foster and Mr. Davenport; he bought 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. through each—I can't tell you the date when I ascertained from them that the speculation had been completed, I left it to Mr. Byers—I think it was at the latter end of 1876—I have not ascertained that the Egyptians were got rid of early in 1877; we have got some accounts which only came in on Saturday, which I think will explain it, but we have not had time to go into them; we got them from the accountants who were employed when Keymer was made bankrupt—I think those accounts disclose the transactions between Keymer and the brokers he employed—I only saw Keymer once in my life before this affair; that was on one occasion upon renewing the loan; some time in 1877, at Mr. Byers office—Keymer was the party negotiating the loan on the Egyptian stock and the Chatham and Dover, which was collateral security for the loan—I am not aware at what date the Lombards were sold; I don't know that they were sold for Keymer by a Mr. Sichell on 29th September last for 652<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the first loan with the London and County Bank was for six months; it may have been only for three; I don't remember—when the time for renewal came I left it with Mr. Byers and Mr. Keymer—I paid Mr. Keymer a commission—I think I paid him a cheque direct to himself, through Mr. Byers—I paid him on the first occasion 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, by cheque; I think I paid that through Mr. Byers—on the second occasion I paid him again by cheque, but the amount was reduced one-half; that was by an arrangement; that was 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—on all these occasions I had no reason to doubt but what the loan was effected with the London and County Bank; I thought they had the Egyptians—Mr. Byers understood that they had; I don't remember that he actually told me so, he took it for granted; I was satisfied because he was satisfied they were there—I was satisfied with what he told me—I knew him very well for many years; he had been secretary to a company with which I was connected—I had no receipts for the commission I paid, the cheque itself would be a receipt—I have not got it here—I think it was in March I first heard something about this matter from Mr. Byers—at that time I think Keymer had left the country—it was after Christmas, 1877, that I first heard of the London Chatham and Dover stock having been converted—I don't remember when I first heard of Mr. Gattie with reference to this matter; it was from a commission from Mr. Byers, not from the Bank of England—I made inquiries at the Bank of England ultimately—Mr. Gattie had then been discharged—I think this was the only transaction I had through Mr. Byers's instrumentality.</p>

               <p>but not a member of the Stock Exchange—I became acquainted with Colonel Fielding in 1871—I had been buying and selling large quantities of stock, and keeping accounts for him; through members of the Stock Exchange, they of course paying me a commission on what business I brought—I kept the accounts; I acted as a kind of secretary to Colonel Fielding—in December, 1876, I was requested by Colonel Fielding to buy for him 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of Egyptian stock, and to try and obtain a loan on the deposit of that stock, and also 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. London Chatham and Dover stock belonging to Colonel Fielding, as a margin, without naming any bank—I arranged the loan through Mr. Foster, through whom 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was pur<lb/>chased, and Mr. Davenport bought the other 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Foster was to arrange the loan—I obtained from Colonel Fielding the transfer of the London Chatham and Dover stock, he handed them to Mr. Foster in my office, and Mr. Foster arranged the loan with Keymer and Co.—he did not deliver the Egyptian stock to me, I took no part in it after—I did not go to the London and County Bank—I did not know Keymer at that time—I had never seen him before—I was afterwards informed that the transaction had been carried out with the London and County Bank—the loan was for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the period was, I think, for three months—I am not sure the purchase<lb/>money was 10,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Colonel Fielding paid Mr. Foster a cheque for 367<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—10,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced—I got my commission from Mr. Foster and Mr. Davenport—I did not see Keymer till I heard of his failure—the loan had then been arranged—it was renewed for three or four months, perhaps six, up to September, 1877—I did not personally renew it, Colonel Fielding merely sent me his cheque to pay the commission, and I handed it over to Mr. Foster—I did not know Keymer in the transaction—I first saw him about May or June—nothing was arranged between us as to obtaining a loan from the Bank of England—I had casually asked him about Colonel Fielding's stock, that I hoped his failure had not affected it in any way—from the con<lb/>versation I had with him I believed that the Egyptian and Chatham and Dover stock was all right at the London and County Bank—it was ultimately arranged that a fresh loan should be obtained from the Bank of England to pay off the loan to the London and County Bank, because the Bank of England would do it cheaper—I agreed with Keymer in September that he should do that—he said that Egyptians had fallen in the market price, and consequently they required an extra margin of about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for security—I communicated with Colonel Fielding and got from him 100 Lombards about the 27th or 28th September—I had seen Mr. Gattie before that—he called at my office, Mr. Keymer brought him, I should say a day or two before I got the Lombards—Keymer introduced him, he said that Mr. Gattie was a very old clerk in the Bank of England, and that he had facilities for pro<lb/>curing loans that other persons had not, and that he had arranged to renew this loan through the Bank of England, owing to his father's connection with it and his long servitude, and that his father used to sign the bank-notes—it was at that conversation that the extra margin was spoken of—I cannot recollect what further conversation passed—the Colonel was prepared to give any amount of margin that was required—when I got the Lombards I went to the Bank of England—Mr. Keymer enclosed me this letter first, it is dated 28th September: "Dear Keymer, I have got the transfers for the 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Chathams, and also the 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Egyptians, please therefore send me the 100 Lombards. You will have to wait about an hour before I can give</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060004"/>
               <p>you a receipt.—Yours truly, Wm. Gattie." After that he called on me and we went to the Bank of England.; I took with me the 100 Lombards—I there saw Gattie in the bullion office behind the counter—I gave him the Lombards and he gave me the receipt (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Bank of England, Sept. 28, 1877. Received from Mr. William Gattie, per Messrs. Horace Keymer and Co., 12,680<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Egyptian preference stock, 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Egyptian unified stock, 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. London Chatham and Dover Railway stock, and 100 shares in the Lombardo-Venetian Co., as collateral security against an advance of 9, 427<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for four months, at the rate of 4 per cent per annum.—E. H. Palmer.") On reading that receipt I noticed that it did not state that it was Colonel Fielding's stock—Keymer said if I could come round to the bank he would see Mr. Palmer and get him to say the stock belonged to Colonel Fielding—he left Gattie and went with me to one of the offices of the Bank—he went round the corner and made some inquiry there, and I heard the reply distinctly that Mr. Palmer was out—we then returned to Gattie, and I told him that the receipt did not state that the stock belonged to Colonel Fielding—he said yes, and he proceeded to write, and Keymer said "I will write the receipt," and he then wrote the letter which Gattie signed in my presence. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the stock in question was the property of Colonel Fielding</hi>.) I assumed that the receipt was the genuine receipt of Mr. Palmer, and that the stock had been actually deposited by Keymer with the Bank of England—I enclosed the receipt to Colonel Fielding immediately I got them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. For some years, from 1871 up to the time of this trans<lb/>action, I had frequently made purchases of stock for Colonel Fielding, both speculative and for investment—the Egyptians were an investment—it was the beginning of December, 1876 that he first spoke to me with reference to the Egyptians—I heard only last Saturday that the Egyptians were disposed of to Taylor's early in 1877, and the Chatham and Dover stock in February, 1877, according to Messrs. Taylor's accounts; they are stockbrokers, with whom Keymer had transactions—in March, 1878, I heard from Gattie him<lb/>self that he had the Chatham and Dover stock in his possession—I don't think that was after Keymer had absconded—I got 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission from Foster and Davenport—the Bank of England charged 3 1/2; per cent interest, and the London and County 4¼;—I don't know that that was the attraction—the attraction was this, that Keymer said he could get the stock renewed through the Bank of England, because Gattie was an old friend of Mr. Godrich, his partner's father, and he carrying on his monetary trans<lb/>actions through Gattie—I did not know Keymer previous to his failure—I knew him through Mr. Foster as a financial agent and stockbroker—I had every faith in him—I had no conversation with Gattie after the receipts were given—I had never seen him till he was introduced to me as I have described—Mr. Foster told me he had seen the stock paid over—I placed confidence in him—we had large transactions together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Gattie had dealings with Messrs. Taylor in other matters—Colonel Fielding was from time to time credited with the dividends on the stock up to the last renewal in January, 1878.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stockbroker, of 30, Throgmorton Street, City—in December, 1876, I was instructed by Mr. Byers to make a purchase of Egyptian stock for Colonel Fielding, and to obtain a loan through the London and County Bank for the purpose of paying for it—I bought 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the stock—I had 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. London Chatham and Dover stock given to me to deposit with the Bank by Colonel Fielding in the presence of Mr. Byers in his office; the transfers were made out at the same time—it was through Mr. Byers that I had to do with it—I knew Colonel Fielding before—I was to pay 5,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Egyptians—I knew that Mr. Davenport had purchased the other 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the day the loan was completed—I did not sell the stock; I had nothing to do with it beyond taking it there—I gave the back contract to Colonel Fielding through Mr. Byers—I obtained the delivery of the whole of the Egyptian stock—I got manual possession of it, and gave it to the London and County Bank, or rather to Mr. Keymer there; I gave him 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Davenport was there with the other 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock—this was on 15th December, 1876—the London Chatham and Dover stock had been given a day or two previously, in order to give him time to arrange the loan—Mr. Keymer was at the London and County Bank for the purpose of completing the transaction, and he handed me a crossed cheque for 5,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my proportion of the Egyptians—I demanded bank notes, which I got, and then I gave him my stock, and Mr. Davenport did the same; he also got</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060006"/>
               <p>bank notes—I was under the belief that the Egyptian stock had been deposited with the London and County Bank for the loan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I had known Keymer about a year and half previous to this transaction—he appeared to be a very energetic young man in business, and I should think very clever—I had no other transaction with him—I had acted frequently for Colonel Fielding and Mr. Byers—the cheque Keymer gave me was on the London and County Bank; it was signed "Horace Keymer and Co."—I was aware that he had an account there and at Glyn's—he said that it was in consequence of his having an account at the London and County that he thought he might be able to obtain facilities for advance from them—I walked on with him to Glyn's, and waited outside—he said, "They do not care about lending on Egyptians, but I have no doubt my other bankers will do it," and he brought out a piece of paper, and said, "That is what they will do it at; I have just had an interview with the manager"—I have been engaged on Stock Exchange transactions over 20 years—Mr. Keymer was a person who conveyed to me the impression that he had means, and substance, and position, because he had a partner who was stated to have forty or fifty thousand pounds—he said his particular business was financial, not Stock Exchange—he had three or four partners, very large offices, and he banked at the Bank of England, I understood, at one time, besides Glyn's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>.

I shall be 24 in November—in 1876 I carried on business with Mr. Goodrich and Mr. Dalgairns as Keymer and Co.—Mr. Goodrich's father had capital and we had capital in the business besides—we were stockbrokers and financial agents—I was not a member of the Stock Exchange—I had a private account, and the firm banked at Glyn's, the London and County, and the National Provincial—</p>

               <p>Mr. Foster consulted me about obtaining a loan—that was the first trans<lb/>action with him—the securities were to be these Egyptian and Chatham and Dover stocks—I went to Glyn's—they would not advance the money—I went to the London and County, and Mr. Howard, the manager, agreed to advance 3,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the London Chatham and Dover stock—we had a balance at the London and County Bank—I gave Mr. Foster a cheque for 5,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Mr. Davenport a cheque for 5, 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 3,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was placed to my credit—we retained the Egyptian stock—my partner, Mr. Dalgairns, is about 40 years of age—he is now, I believe, in Italy—he signed the document in respect of this loan—I found myself in difficulties, and having been called upon to pay the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I sold the stock hoping to be able to replace it—that was on 1st January, 1877, or December, 1876—the loan was for three months, and when the three months expired we took up the stock and sold it—the Egyptian stock was ultimately sold—the value of the Chatham and Dover stock was then about 4, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the Egyptian about 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—on my liquidation in May, which was very sudden, Mr. Byers and Mr. Foster came to me and asked what I was going to do with respect to the loan—they seemed anxious on account of Colonel Fielding—I assured them the stock was at the bank—Mr. Foster asked me for Mr. Goodrich's address—I did not want Mr. Foster to go to Mr. Goodrich's house, so I gave him the address of Mr. Frederick Goodrich, my own partner—Mr. Foster went away—a long time afterwards Mr. Byers told me that he had been to the London and County Bank and had ascertained that the stock had been sold—he said he did not want to hurt me, but something must be done, and if I could state that the stock was all light and could be replaced in three months, he would take my word for it and would let the matter be renewed for three months—about 27th September, 1877, I went to the prisoner Gattie, at the Bank of England, and asked him to become a nominal holder of the London Chatham and Dover and Egyptian stocks—Gattie agreed that the stock should be transferred into his name, and that he should lend money on it—nothing was said about the Bank of England—I may have mentioned Mr. Palmer, but not Mr. Palmer of the Bank of England—Gattie said as he was incurring no liability, nor infringing any rule he should be willing to do it—I told him he would have a commission—that was all the inducement Gattie had—Mr. Byers afterwards requested to see Mr. Gattie, and I took him to Mr. Gattie's office, and Mr. Gattie said what I told him, that he had heard that I wanted an advance of, I think, 9,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he could get it—Mr. Byers agreed to give the requisite security for the 100 Lombard shares, but that there must be a margin—nothing was said about the Bank of England—Gattie merely acted as the nominal holder of the stock—on the 28th I went with Mr. Byers to the Bank with the shares—Gattie had nothing to do with drawing up the receipt—I drew that up—that is why I have pleaded guilty—Gattie did not know its terms—he has not seen it—the receipt was given to Mr. Byers in an envelope—I am not sure whether the envelope was fastened—the letter referring to Mr. Palmer as "your director" is my writing, but the words "a director of the Bank of England" I added afterwards at Mr. Byers's request—I left the country on 17th March—Mr. Gattie did not know the receipt was forged.</p>

I think—it had been owing some time—I had not pressed him for payment—I also had some stock-broking transactions with him—I had a stock account with him, which began the end of 1877 or the beginning of 1878—he owed me 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then for differences—I know Mr. Alexander, of 2, St. Michael's House, Cornhill—I think he is a director of some company—I decline to answer questions about my transactions with him—it might criminate me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Randall and Angier, of Gray's Inn, and have carried on business there for something like 27 years—we had a client in 1875 named George Baden Crawley, who had been for about two years a solicitor in partnership with his father—we represented him in a supposed claim which Mr. Noyes had against him—from time to time a number of cards were brought to my notice addressed to Mr. Crawley, and shortly afterwards I received cards of the same description—this card with the postmark of 9th May was delivered by post at our office—the defendant had called on me, and I had had a conversation with him. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "George Baden Crawley, care of his two attorneys, Randall and Angier, Gray's Inn Place, W. C. If the two cruel rogues and sharp practitioners who have conspired with the felon George Baden Crawley, to cheat his creditors and defraud his partner, enable him to escape judicial retribution for criminal. conduct in a Criminal Court, as so many black sheep of their corrupt pro<lb/>fession are in the habit of doing in parallel cases, do not lake their names off the Rolls of their profession, their names will be taken off by the Lord Chancellor ere long.") I had had nothing to do with the defendant when I was concerned for Mr. Crawley—he was an entire stranger to me, but I know his writing—this post-card is his writing—I subsequently found it necessary in the Chancery suit to make an application to the Master of the Rolls, and while it was pending we received these nine post-cards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), they are in the defendant's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. We have acted for G. R Crawley for about 18 years—I do not know how many times he has left England since that, or how many years he has resided abroad—he has been in Mexico, France, Belgium, and Spain—I believe he first acted as your solicitor in the matter of this mine—I am not aware that he was expelled from his firm in 1861, certainly not or that a circular was sent to the clients of the firm to say that he had left it, and was going to reside abroad—I do not know the date than an agreement was entered into between him and you, there was an agreement between you and others—I have no recollection of seeing it—I am aware that you put 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the mine, but not that you lent it to Mr. Crawley for the purpose of working the mine—I saw Mr. Maskelyne once, three, four, or five years ago, but I do not think Mr. Crawley put the papers into my hands at that time—I saw a note of hand in Court for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and recognised Crawley's writing—I am not aware that a joint account was opened in his name and yours at Hughes's bank—you produced an account in your joint names—I am not aware when it was—two or three solicitors</p>

               <p>have applied to me saying that you had a claim against Mr. Crawley, but I have not refused to furnish the accounts to them—your solicitor issued a writ against Mr. Crawley, but I do not know the date—I filed a demurrer on Mr. Crawley's behalf—when I obtained a warrant against you I did not tell you that I elected to proceed criminally against you, and intended to abandon the proceedings in Vice-Chancellor Malins's Court—I said on the return of the warrant, that if your friends would take charge of you I was prepared to abandon the proceedings—I did not proceed against you before Vice-Chancellor Malins while I had you locked up at Clerkenwell, without giving you information that I intended to do so—Mr. Maskelyne produced a bill for 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about 20 years old, and said that he believed it had never been settled, and asked if I would undertake, if proceedings were not taken, not to plead the statute—I said that it was a very stale thing, and I could give no undertaking.</p>

                  </hi>. I acted as your solicitor in 1858, but not to your father and yourself—I entered into some agreement with John Edward Hibbett Pearl", but I cannot tell you what it was—it was a long time ago—I did not represent a mine in Glamorganshire as being of very great value—I said that I knew nothing about it—I am not sure that it was not you who introduced Mr. Jones to me—I knew nothing but what he told me—I do not know what your occupation was, or whether you knew anything about mining—now you mention it, I remember that you were employed at the Home Office—I cannot say whether I invited your father to provide capital to work that mine, but he did advance 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to you, and you were to work it—as far as my memory serves me, you and your father borrowed money, which was what I was principally doing for you—the 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced by your father to both of us; he would not advance it unless I joined in taking a share in the mine, if I remember rightly—I do not admit giving you a note of hand for 1,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but from what I have heard I believe it was so—I paid that note of hand by giving you up my half of the property, and handing you over the balance—that was at the end of 1860—I handed you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060011"/>
               <p>something above 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we settled accounts, and I handed you over the balance, but I cannot tell you where the receipt for it is—I have not got the originals of the three agreements between us—I have detained no documents whatever. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a notice to produce the documents, which he had served on the witness and on Mr. Angier; Mr. Angier stated that he had never seen the original documents</hi>.) I gave up every document, and I presume that, when I settled with you, you took them—it it possible that I destroyed them when I was removing from 117 to 104, Bishopsgate Street—I burnt several cartloads of paper, but I set my clerk to work for days, and the only documents he found I gave to Messrs. Randall. (<hi rend="italic">The</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was in Bucharest ten days ago, and was requested by Messrs.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. EMMETT</hi> (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Solicitor</hi>.) I began to correspond with Randall and Angier with regard to your claim against Mr. Crawley in October, 1877, as far as I believe—they were acquainted with your claims against Mr. Crawley last year, long before this writ was issued—they did not plead ignorance of your claims against him—you placed the papers in the case submitted to Mr. Southgate in my hands—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the document referred to—I cannot say whether it contains a fair statement of your claims as they are founded upon your own statements—your demurrer was an admission of the facts, and I so advised the Counsel.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner in his defence stated that he was a County Magistrate, and would not make any statement which he did not believe to be true. He com<lb/>plained of the absence of his solicitor with some most material papers, and that he had not subpœnaed Mr. Pigeon, and contended that by the evidence he was justified in his conduct, believing that Messrs. Randall and Angier were cognisant of all that Mr. Crawley had done, and were therefore his accom<lb/>plices; that what he had written under the belief that he had been grievously wronged was not a libel; but, having been told that Randall and Angier were innocent, he would withdraw the accusation against them, which he believed to he true when he made it.

I am a Licentiate of the College of Physicians—I attended Mrs. Ringrose in her confinement—her child when born was per<lb/>fectly healthy and full-grown—on the third day when calling at the house my attention was directed to the child's stomach—I found swelling and red<lb/>ness all over, more especially around the navel and about the genitals, and in every crease and fold of the body, the ribs and thighs—there was also discoloration and hardness all about the stomach, and all parts wherever the inflammation was—those appearances seemed to me to have been caused by some irritant poison—I there upon made certain inquiries, and was shown some violet powder—I had not had my attention called to anything in the newspapers, or heard anything of the matter—I took some of the violet powder away, and directed them to keep the remainder—I continued to attend the child daily until its death on the 7th June—it got worse each day—on the fourth day, the 1st June, sores appeared on the stomach, round the navel—they presented a very darkened appearance—they were about the size of the end of a pin's head, and increased in number and size down to the time of death—those sores fortified my opinion as to the appearances having been originally caused by some irritant poison—sloughs also formed along the groin, and round the navel—I reported the case to the Coroner, and about 12th June I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—a pupil from the hospital assisted me—the head and brain were perfectly healthy, also the lungs and other organs, except the liver, that was very much enlarged and congested; that confirmed my view—an irritant poison goes immediately to the liver—in my opinion the actual cause of death was exhaustion from the inflammation—an irritant poison like arsenic would cause the appearances</p>

                  </hi>. I am a B. M. And Fellow of the Chemical Society, professor of chemistry and medical jurisprudence at the London Hospital, and medical officer of health to the parish of Islington—I am joint editor of a work on medicine and toxicology—I have had a large experience in poisons—on 14th June I received these two packets of powder from Dr. Brown—I analysed them; they presented the same analysis: White arsenic, that is arsenious arsenic, 38.5; potato starch, 54.8; a little magnesia, with possibly a little lead and lime, very small, 6.7; making 100 parts—it was scented, but I took no cognisance of that, it was so minute—the ordinary proper violet powder ought to be made of starch, with a little orris root, and scented; the best is made of com flour—I think it is very undesirable to use <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi>, that is sulphate of lime—the chief use of violet powder is to prevent chafeing; it is used for children, and by ladies, and for footmen—<hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> is very often used in inferior kinds of violet powder; it is much cheaper than starch—the outward application of the powder containing 38 per cent of arsenic, or any arsenic, would have an injurious effect on children of tender years—it would be absorbed, and in dusting a child with it, no doubt a certain quantity would get into the air and be inhaled; the application of it to the genitals and the rectum would be another means by which the arsenic would find entrance into the system, and after washing, the absorption would be more rapid; if there was any cracking of the skin it would be very rapidly absorbed, and even in a sound skin—I have heard Dr. Brown's description of the state of this child, and in my opinion those appearances would be produced by the outward application of violet powder containing arsenic—on 26th June I was at the London Hospital, when the body of the child was shown to me by Dr. Brown; it was in a very advanced state of decomposi<lb/>tion, too far to allow me to give an opinion on the special <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances—I first removed the liver, and found in that 1 1/2; grains of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060016"/>
               <p>arsenic: in the stomach and intestines 1 grain, and a trace of arsenic in the kidneys; and from all the other parts I obtained 4 grains, making altogether 6 1/2; grains—that was decidedly sufficient to cause death—the eruption was one of the symptoms of arsenical poisoning—one grain of arsenic is recorded to have killed a man—I think the arsenic I found here might be produced by the outward application of the powder containing it—the relative weights of <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> and arsenic are 2.3 and 3.7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I heard Dr. Brown say that the child died from exhaus<lb/>tion—I think the arsenic I found in the body might have entered through the mouth, and the vagina and rectum, apart from that absorbed into the skin; that would account for the exhaustion—the greater the quantity absorbed, the greater would be the exhaustion, and the more speedy if taken in through the apertures than if through the skin—as a ride arsenic is a preventive to decomposition, but there are exceptions where it has been hastened rather than delayed—I do not think the decomposed state of this body was inconsistent with death from arsenical poisoning—I had the prisoner's formulas for the preparation of these powders laid before me; there were two qualities—there was nothing but starch in the first—there was no apparent difference in bulk between the two; unless weighed there would be no perceptible difference to the hand; there might be to the eye—I think I could tell the difference; it is difficult to speak for others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Kidd, of 10, Wellington Street, Shacklewell—he keeps a general shop—we had violet ponder in stock; it was in stock when we took the business fifteen months ago from Mr. Kemp—there was a cardboard box full of penny packets—I can't be sure whether the box had a glass top to it; the packets were in white paper with blue letters, and the name of King on them, like this produced—Mrs. Ringrose was a customer at our shop—I cannot remember whether I sold her any powders—I read in the paper that there was something wrong about these powders, and I then collected all we had left, about fourteen; they were in the box—Mr. Walton, Mr. King's traveller, called on us, and we handed them to him—I thought we had better not sell any more—he called for orders, and I mentioned it to him, and he said, "You had better give them to me"—I can't say how many we had sold—I dare say fifty or sixty—I think there was about half a gross in the box.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Walton did not call to ask for the packets; he called for orders, and I said. I thought we had better not sell any more, and asked if he would take them, and he said "Yes"—I don't recollect his telling me that he was going the round of his customers to get them because of the communications that had been made to him—he said he would return us other powders for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I bought the business of Mr. Kemp on 12th February, and amongst the stock was some violet powder in a box—I saw it from time to time—the packets had on them "Henry John King, Violet Powder for the Nursery"—it was a white paper with blue printing—I have no remembrance of buying any Violet powder—I used to deal with Mr. King for other articles, Seidlitz powders, cough drops, and other things—he came for orders every Monday—I don't know what has become of Mr. Kemp—on Monday, 26th May, I remember Mr. Walton, the traveller, taking away</p>

               <p>what was left of the packets of violet powder; he called for orders; there was another traveller, a miller, in the shop, and a conversation arose about the violet powders, and Mr. Walton said, "By the bye, have you any left; if you have I will take them away, for there appears to be something wrong with them"—I don't think my wife was present the whole time—she was in and out from the private parlour—I found all the packets I could in the window, where they were always kept; there were about eight or nine packages; they were done up in brown paper and handed to him—they were not in a box, they were loose in the window; the box had got broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Fox Lane, Haggerston—I have been travelling for Mr. King eight or nine years—his place of business is 14, Abbot Street, Kingsland—he is a wholesale druggist and drysalter and general packer—my district includes Wellington Street Shacklewell, and Mr. Kidd's shop—I knew the shop when Mr. Kemp carried on the business—I called there for orders every Monday—I cannot give the particulars of the various orders, the old books have been destroyed—Mr. King dealt in violet powders—I used to take orders for them all over London and deliver them—I have no recollection of taking any order for violet powder from Mr. Kidd; I used to call there for orders in the usual way—I heard from Mr. King that there was something wrong about his violet powders; I believe that was some time in May; he told me that he had had a letter from the Treasury, specifying that there was something wrong with the violet powders; that they contained some poisonous matter—he asked me to collect in all powders that I knew of, and give notice to his customers for the carman to bring back any violet powders which they might have by them, and he would send fresh in the place of it—I went to Mr. Kidd's on Monday, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. st May, or the following week, on my ordinary round—I saw Mr. Kidd in the shop and another young fellow—I asked him if he had any violet powders; he fetched them from some part of the window; they were not exposed to the eye; they were laid about loose—he gave them to me; I think there were about nine packets like these—I took them and gave them to Mr. King; I told him where I had got them from; I saw no more of them—some years ago I have seen the violet powder manufactured—I had a good deal to do with it about five years ago; I used to assist in the manufacture—Mr. King assisted at times; he gave out the materials, and gave the orders to whoever was employed—I don't know who weighed out the materials; Mr. King and sometimes Mrs. King gave out the quantities; they had a formula, a receipt-book—the materials were kept in a kind of stock-room—when they were mixed they were put in little packets with papers round them, and the boxes were filled from the bulk by one of the daughters or one of the girls employed—there was no weighing at all—I never made violet powder from <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi>; only starch—there was no <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> used at that time; it was first used about two years ago, instead of starch, and the price was re<lb/>duced from 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they were placed in quarter-gross boxes, with glass tops—after this I collected violet powder from other customers besides Mr. Kidd, by Mr. King's direction—I ordered them to be sent in at once when on my regular rounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The orders I took were entered in book by Miss King, and when my commission was paid I destroyed my books—when we</p>

               <p>wanted to manufacture some of the violet powder the materials were put in a large tray by the party who was going to make them; about four persons were employed in making them; they were weighed, not by any particular person, but by whoever happened to have the order from Mr. King—I have seen Mr. King mix them, and then he would no doubt weigh the materials himself—he gave the quantities from his receipt-book on each occasion—I can't say that he was always present; he kept the receipt-book—when I have made it up it has been already weighed out; Mr. and Mrs. and Miss King would be the persons in possession of the receipt-book; I could not tell the receipt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. It is a small establishment—about three or four girls were employed, and a young chap about eighteen or twenty to look after the horses—no one but the girls was employed in the manufacture; their work was filling and folding, not mixing; they had very little to do with the mixing—occasionally they did—various persons mixed the stock; I could not tell who; it was either the girl or the young man that was employed at that time—they passed it through the sieves at different times, so that it might be well mixed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Inspector</hi>.) On 20th May I went to the prisoner's premises, and served him with two summonses—I read them to him—he made a statement to me which I took down in writing. <hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I make two kinds of violet powder, best and common. The best is composed of 28lb. Of starch powder, two and a half magnesia, llb. orris root, and five drops of essence of roses; the common of 14lb. of <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi>, 21 of potato floor, three of magnesia, one of orris root, one and a half violet perfume, and five drops of essence of roses. These I purchase of W. and J. Bush and Co., of 21 to 24, Artillery Lane, Bishopsgate. I first purchased <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> of this company on 21st February, 1878; previously of Mr. Fox, chemist and druggist, of Bethnal Green Road. The last purchased of him was on 27th October, 1877. I have Bush and Co. 's invoices, but none from Fox, as all purchases from him were for cash. I have never purchased arsenic, and do not know how it got into the powder. I do know there was arsenic in it, as Mr. Barnard analysed about six packets for me, and found arsenic in two. Directly I received the letter from the Treasury, I sent round to my customers and destroyed all the powder collected." He also said, "I have two horses and three travellers, and one man and four girls in my packing-room." He showed me over the premises—I saw girls there making up Seidlitz powders—he gave me, amongst other things, a specimen of his <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi>, to see whether there was</p>

                  </hi>.

We generally weigh the goods as they come in; the <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> is generally weighed because we generally find it abort weight—the arsenic would be weighed in the same machine; it is a platform machine—I never knew an arsenic cask leak, they are always very strong—we take the arsenic out of the cask with a scoop, which is kept in the cask—all</p>

               <p>the persons employed have access to the poison room—if the man brought down 20lb., when only 14lb. was wanted, he would have to take the surplus back; if he forgot it I think someone else would see it—<hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> and arsenic are very similar.</p>
               <p>

I am a brushmaker, of 42, Stepney Green—in February, 1877, I had apartments in the prisoners' house, Stewardstone Road, Bethnal Green—their baby was then about six weeks old, and was healthy, as far as I could judge—early in June our attention was attracted by a noise as of an altercation in the prisoners' room, and we heard our name called—my wife and I went down, and the male prisoner was striking his</p>

               <p>wife, who had the child covered up in her arms—I induced her to give it up, in case it should get a blow—my wife took it upstairs, and a horrible smell came from it—I cannot recollect what Frederick said to his wife, hut there was a quick succession of blows—I went upstairs and examined the child, and from the lower part of the lower jaw up to the hair was not one sore but a numerous quantity of sores—I examined its body, it was raw all round the crutch—its mouth was going—my wife dipped her finger in some butter, and it took it very ravenously—I called the male prisoner, and he came up—I was very much excited, and said "Good God, Wise, look at that poor child, it is absolutely starving; look at the state its face is in, you must know it, sleeping in the same bed"—he said "Yes, it has been ill"—I said "You must see a doctor at once"—he said "It's too late to-night, I will call on Dr. Berdoe in the morning"—that was on Thursday, but the child was not seen by a medical man till the following Tuesday—I went downstairs to see if there was any provision for feeding the child during the night, and after searching they produced a feeding bottle, which looked as if it had not been used for some time, as there was curdled, putrid milk in it—after a time a tube was found, and afterwards a teat, which ways so broken and bent about that I considered it useless—the father and mother tied it together with a piece of string—after the child was seen by a doctor, woman was appointed to sit up with it, and take care of it during the night—I asked Frederick whether he had provided the child with sufficient clothing, as my wife had to lend it clothes—a portion of the clothes it had on when it was taken to the workhouse were mine—about a fortnight after the doctor was called in my wife applied to the police, as the inattention was occurring again, and the child was removed to the workhouse—Frederick Wise worked in High Street, Borough—I worked beyond him, and used to pass his place of business, and have seen him there—he left about 7 a.m., and had about three miles to go to his work—he returned about half-past 7 or 8, sometimes later, but sometimes he was at home all day on Saturday, and sometimes half a day, and all day on Sunday—he was moderately sober—I have seen him in liquor, but it was not his constant practice—I have seen the woman drunk in the day time as well as at night—I have seen her lying on the kitchen floor—the child was generally lying in a box in the kitchen—when my wife com<lb/>municated with the police the male prisoner abused me very strongly, and called my wife a filthy name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—we lived in the prisoner's house for some months—the child was about four months old when I first saw it; it was then very thin—I overheard a conversation about its being very bad and not likely to live—I knew there had been no doctor and that it was dying—when I first saw it it was in a little boy's arms in the passage—I examined it; it seemed to be very ill, and there were sores on its face—I got the mother to come up with it into my room; she was moderately sober—I tried to induce her to have a doctor; she said she dare</p>

               <p>not do so—I have often seen her drunk during the day—the child was sometimes in bed in a little box in the kitchen—I never saw her feed it in a proper manner; a bottle was put for it, but it was quite useless—I drew her attention to it many times—the father was away during the day—early in June my husband and I heard him swearing at her—we went down and I took the child upstairs; its face was sore, and the lower part of its body was very bad indeed: it was sinking for want of nourishment—I gave it a bit of butter, as I was afraid life was leaving it—I went to the mother next morning and tried to impress upon her to get food for it and to have it washed—I washed it myself in the evening—I expected then it would die in my arms—I had told her many times to get a doctor; she assured me that she dare not do so, as her husband would not allow her—I said that I should do so—on the day I took the child upstairs I went down to look for its bottle, and found it clogged up and of no use at all, and bad food in it—I had often remonstrated with her about the state the child was in, and spoke to her about bandaging it—it was laid on the bed about ten in the evening covered with the sheet, and the woman had gone out with her husband—they returned in about half an hour, and I told her that I found the child crying, and that it was too tightly bandaged and could not grow like that; she would kill it—he thanked me, and said that she was a silly bitch and did not know better—I frequently said to both of them that the child was being murdered—I once found it in the passage, and accused her of its being badly treated—I did not know till June that the lower part of its body was covered with sores—I spoke to them both one Sunday morning about six weeks ago, and gave them some linen rag to put to its wounds, and told them to be sure and attend to it—she said that she would do so—I once found the child in bed with a pillow over its head, suffocating; that was on the Friday that I went to the police, and previous to that I found it on the bed nearly suffocated; that was about six in the evening—I removed the pillow, and went up and found the mother in a lodger's room intoxicated—I told her of her cruelty to her child, and said that she ought not to have a baby so young—she said that she could not attend to it—her husband had not then come home; but I told him in the evening that I found the baby suffocated with a pillow over its head, and a blanket, and that if he did not prevent it, I must do so—he said that he meant to leave her—I begged him to think of his children—he said that he should not think of the children.</p>

I live at 56, Victoria Park Road, and have been in the habit of attending the prisoners—I delivered the woman of this child on 20th January last—it was perfectly healthy—I attended her for a few days and saw nothing more of her till on Saturday evening, 8th June, the male prisoner called and said, "Doctor, our baby does not seem to thrive"—I asked him in what way, and gathered that it was gripes or disturbed bowels—I gave him a bottle of medicine, but did not see the child—on 11th June the child was brought by a woman, who said that it was Mrs. Wise's child, who was unable to bring it herself—it was horribly emaciated, weighing apparently 4lb. or 5lb.; it was a mere mass of skin and bone, with sores on its face and body—experts give the weight of a new-born child at about 7lb., and in a respectable class of persons it is more; it weighed less than when it was born—I was very angry at the condition it was in, and gave it some strengthen<lb/>ing medicine—the male prisoner called the same evening in a considerable state of alarm at the remark I had made—he said that I had been saying that the child had been improperly treated, and if that was the case, it must have been by his wife during his absence, as he wished it should have proper care and attention; that I knew the drinking habits of his wife, and she most have kept the child without food while he was away, and that on one occasion it had been left without food about 12 hours when she was in a drunken stupor, and he had kicked her to arouse her—he begged me to do all I could to pull the child round, but I said it would certainly die, nothing could be done for it—I called two days afterwards, and saw the female prisoner; she was very rapidly feeding the child with a spoon—I asked her what she was giving it—she said egg and brandy, which some neighbour had recommended—I scolded her and said that when the child died I should order an inquest—she said "The child shan't die, I will bring it round"—I ordered it cod-liver oil, and saw it on June 14th, 17th, and 21st between 12 and 4 o'clock—the man was not there then, but he called on me in the evening of each of these days—he showed me some biscuits he had purchased, and asked my opinion of them—he said that sometimes he would bring beef, and asked if it were advisable—he expressed every anxiety that the child should be saved—on, I believe, 21st June, he said that the relieving officer had called, saying that he had been informed that the child was being starved, and he would take it away unless the father could bring a certificate from me that the child was not in danger, and might be safely left—I refused to give any such certificate—he urged me very much to do so, and I wrote one to say that the child had been grievously neglected, and was suffering from improper food, this is it—in consequence of that, the relieving officer called on me—I advised him to remove the child to the workhouse, and he took it there on the following Monday—I know that the mother is addicted to habits of intemperance—I have attended her for <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—the husband has expressed great concern about his wife's drunken habits—the child died on 6th July from gross neglect and improper feeding; from star<lb/>vation, in fact—I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Sumner Place, South Kensington—last December I was living at Woodson, in Worcester, where I was farming—I had known the prisoner some years as chief clerk to a firm of solicitors in the City who had done business for my late brother—at the end of last year I contemplated giving up farming and taking a wine store in the city—I went to the prisoner's office about the end of November and made known to him my wishes, and told him that the lease of my farm would expire on 25th March last—he said that he could find me something suitable and I engaged him to do so—early in December I saw him again, and he said he had heard of a place called the Horns, in Fetter Lane, and we went to look at it—he said he thought he could purchase it for me; I told him to do so if he could advantageously—he said that the price was about 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not always say the same price—he asked me if he could get it for 2,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., whether he might purchase it—I said very well, he was to do the best he could; the better he bought it the more he would have for himself—he said if he could get it for 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I ought to give him 100 guineas for his trouble, and I said "Very well"—I said I would pay him handsomely if he bought the thing well for me; he was acting as my agent—I received this letter from him of 11th December, 1877: "Dear Sir,—I hope to be able to give you some definite news to<lb/>morrow or the next day as to whether or not the Horns can be purchased on terms that would suit you. I have taken considerable trouble in the matter, and have every hope of success, but it is very risky to allow people</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060030"/>
               <p>to carry on a business after they are aware it will leave their hands at a fixed date," &amp;c.—I cannot say whether I replied to that—I afterwards received this letter of 17th December: "Dear Sir,—I was in hopes all last week to be able to write you with a cut<lb/>and-dried scheme for this place, but was unable to," &amp;c.—I after<lb/>wards received this letter of 19th December: "Dear Sir,—ReHorns. I fear, indeed I am almost certain, that the vendor will not take less than 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, more especially if they agree to delay the transfer and payment of the balance," &amp;c.—I believe I had written him this letter the day before, dated 18th December—on 22nd December I wrote a letter in pencil to the prisoner, which is not produced—I also on that day received this letter from him: "Dear Sir,—Thanks for the turkey and apples, which I have no doubt will arrive in due course," &amp;c.—on 27th December I received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi>, "I am still working for the Horns. They require, first, a heavier deposit; secondly, a larger price; and thirdly, to complete on 1st January.") In reply to that I wrote this letter on 29th December: "I duly received your letter on my return from visiting my brother at Ashford," &amp;c.—I afterwards received from the prisoner this letter, dated 1st January, 1878: "I have purchased the Horns—100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a week. It has been a touch-and-go case. It may please you to hear that yesterday I went to a house on which 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been spent, and it was remarked by a solicitor who was there at the time, 'What good stuff the place in Fetter Lane is selling now,'" &amp;c.—I wrote this letter to the prisoner in reply in reference to the deposit: "J. Pensam, Esq., 50, Bow Lane, London—<hi rend="italic">Re</hi> Horns—Dear Sir: I am in receipt of yours of this post, and will endeavour to meet it in some way. Let me have full particulars by return," &amp;c.—"B. Powis" is in the extreme comer—I afterwards received this letter from the prisoner, dated 5th January, 1878: "Dear Sir,—The Horns. I have been compelled, as I will explain when I see you, to agree to complete on the 21st, and to make up the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Wednesday next. You must therefore come up on Tuesday or Wednesday morning," &amp;c.—on 7th January I came up to London, and went to the office of my nephew, Mr. Bale, 20, Budge Row, who made a statement to me—I saw the prisoner there that day, and he said, "I have had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Manfred, but the trustee was not at home; you must be prepared with the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by to-morrow or Wednesday"—I said, "All right, I shall be prepared"—he showed me the proceeds of Manfred's cheque, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—I saw him again next day, the 8th, when he said, "I have fixed with the trustee for 12 o'clock to-morrow, and you must be there with the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make up the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay the deposit. You must have the money ready, or the thing will go off"—he told me, as a reason for changing the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, that the trustee would not take cheques; he would have either bank notes or gold—at 12 o'clock next day I went with my nephew and the prisoner to the office of the trustee, Mr. Ashdown, and then on to the office of the solicitor for the trustee—I had with me a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—the prisoner went, into the inner office—I was in the outer office with my nephew, and I heard the prisoner ask one of the firm of solicitors to have the agreement ready, and to send it round to 50, Bow Lane the first thing to-morrow morning—that would be Thursday, the 10th—when he came out he said the agreement was not ready, and he had fixed for the next morning at ten o'clock, when the agreement was to be sent and the money paid over, and I was to be there at 10—I went accordingly, and the prisoner was not there—I was there from 10 o'clock to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060031"/>
               <p>6 p.m.—while I was there the clerk to the solicitor of the trustee brought the agreement, and I read it—I then arranged with the prisoner's clerk to go there again the next day, Friday, when I again waited all day, off and on—on leaving, I met the prisoner on the stairs, and said to him, "Pensam, where have you been to?"—he said, "Oh, all right, old fellow; I have been at the Court; be here at 10 o'clock in the morning; I have put it right with the trustee"—I said, "Very well, I will be here, but it is very inconvenient; I want to be away home; you have kept me here two days"—I went the next day, the 12th, about 10 o'clock—the prisoner was not there, and I remained until about 12.30—his clerk knew what my business was—I then went home—on the 13th I wrote this letter to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Woodson, Tenbury, January 13th, 1878. Dear Sir,—You cannot delay the completion of the Horns; it must go," &amp;c.—in reply to that I received this from the prisoner; "14th January, 1878. Dear Sir,—The Horns, As I anticipated, I received a communication from the solicitor on Saturday, couched in most peremptory terms, to complete at 11 o'clock on that day. I returned reply that I must have agreement left with me for a day, and would complete on Monday. The agreement was sent, and cannot be objected to. On going to Manfred he said he had the cash," &amp;c.—I afterwards received this letter from him: "17th January, 1878. Dear Sir,—The Horns. Although I know of another house of a somewhat different trade, it is very desirable not to lose this, and although it has placed me in a very unpleasant and possibly losing position, I am anxious it should be secured. If you will send me the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance by return of post, I still think I can secure it. I expected to receive a reply to my last"—I then wrote this letter to the prisoner: "January 18th, 1878. Dear Sir,—Herewith you will receive cheque, Thomas Baker 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. You must find the other 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to complete, &amp;c." That letter contained this cheque (On <hi rend="italic">the City of Worcester and County Banking Company, Limited. Drawn by T. R Baker in favour of Mr. Powis for</hi> 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">dated</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th January</hi>, 1878, <hi rend="italic">and endorsed by Benjamin Powis</hi>.) In reply I received this letter: "19th January, 1878. Dear Sir,—Yours to hand. I note your request as to time. Being a short day I have not succeeded in seeing the other side, but will do so on Monday. Will then see Manfred, who perhaps will help me, &amp;c." I afterwards received a letter from the prisoner of 28th January, and on 4th February I wrote this letter to him: "Dear Sir,—Re Horns. I am surprised you have not written me ere this, and returned the letters enclosed to you," &amp;c. I got no reply to that letter until 11th February, when the prisoner wrote me this letter: "Dear Sir,—I have to apologise for not answering your letter. Absence in the country, subse<lb/>quently laid up at home, and want of time, &amp;c., prevented my replying, &amp;c. I do not wish to give up the Horns yet if I can get it at a slight premium, I have another which I think will suit. I think as all the work was done for the Horns I ought to be allowed one-third of the fee; half to be allowed out of the commission of any other house I might find for you and you purchase." I replied on 15th February, 1878: "Dear Sir,—I cannot under<lb/>stand your way of doing business. I again ask for my money. Yours truly, Benjamin Powis. P. S. Also return of Adams's two letters which you neglected altogether." I never got any reply to that letter, nor have I had a farthing of my money—I went to London, and repeatedly tried to see the prisoner—I spent nine days successively in trying to do so, but I never saw him between 11th January and 24th Apr I—prior to 24th April I had applied</p>

               <p>at the Mansion House for a summons, which I obtained, and which was returnable on 24th April—on that day I was in my nephew's office in Budge Row when the prisoner called—he said "I am very sorry it has occurred, I hope you won't appear against me, and that you will forego this prosecution"—I said "Certainly not, the case is in the hands of the Lord Mayor and my solicitor, and I shall decline to interfere"—he promised to attend at the Mansion House—he then left—I attended at the Mansion House with my solicitor, but the prisoner was not there—there was a solicitor there to represent him, and the case was remanded until 3rd May—the prisoner was not there then, and it was remanded until the 4th, when he again did not appear, and the Lord Mayor granted a warrant for his apprehension—I had in December deposited 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with my nephew Mr. Bale—the other cheque for 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been returned paid.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi>. I have known the prisoner for a con<lb/>siderable time—I asked him to find a wine store for me—the house was mentioned the first time—he had first called my attention to the Mitre in the Temple, for the purchase of which, I believe, he had entered into negotiations on my behalf—I became acquainted with the statistics of the Mitre, and several letters passed between the prisoner and me about its purchase—I was very anxious to get it—I don't recollect the price—I had not got the money ready for that, and it fell through—they asked more for it than it was worth—I then requested the prisoner to look out again for a house to suit me—I don't know that he went and inspected many houses with a view to their suiting me—my nephew, Mr. Bale, also undertook to look out for a house for me, and in December I deposited 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with him—Bale and the prisoner were great friends—Bale was not to use the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he found a house—the prisoner was to buy the house, and Bale to have the money ready—Bale recommended the prisoner to me—I went and saw the Horns, and went thoroughly into the matter with the prisoner, and I believe I said the place would suit me to a T—the price agreed on was 2,275<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was prepared to pay the deposit and 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. t February—the prisoner was to borrow the rest—he did not press me earnestly not to attempt to take the house if I could not carry it through, that I know of—I will not swear that he did not—I said "I will manage it somehow, for I am sure I shall do well there"—he told me that the former tenant was a man named Anderson, and that the place was for sale by the trustee in bankruptcy, a Mr. Ashdown—I believe he showed me some letters from him, and he told me the Horns was already under offer to other persons—I have no reason to doubt it—I never handed the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the solicitor for the trustee—when I was in the outer office I heard the prisoner talking about an agreement to be sent the next morning, but I cannot tell you the exact words—when I sent up the 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had not that day the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay, but Bale would have found the balance in a moment—I wrote and told the prisoner to find the other 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know Mr. Ashdown—I know this case was to have come on last session, and was postponed at the prisoner's request—he certainly never made a tender to Ashdown of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not see the lease of the Horns—the agreement is what the solicitor brought to Bow Lane on Thursday, 10th January—the prisoner wrote to me after he had received the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with regard to other houses I believe—nothing was mentioned besides a house in the Strand to the best of my belief—the prisoner did not offer me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he asked me to withdraw from the prosecution—I refused to accept the offer of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never had an offer of the whole.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been analytical chemist to Messrs. Siemens since May, 1877—since that time I know of no mercury being sent off the premises for the purpose of distillation—I purified what mercury I required purified—the prisoner has asked me for mercury, a pound or two at a time—mercury loses by evaporation when distilled—it leaks through the apparatus—I saw no xanthine in the prisoner's possession.</p>

I have studied the properties of gutta-percha since 1877—I was previously unacquainted with its nature—I was appointed to assist you—I am aware that the specific inductive capacity of gutta-percha may be modified by the addition of various chemicals—a gutta-percha of low induc<lb/>tive capacity is supplied by Messrs Willoughby—Messrs. Siemens do not supply similar material—they have made experiments to obtain gutta-percha of low inductive capacity—very little information about gutta-percha is given in books, and the little that is known is confined to specialists—a practical man would not publish what he knows—Professor Wheatstone used mercury standards of electrometrical force, the mercury for Which would have to be purified, not exactly distilled—that is one way of purifying it—if you distilled and re-distilled mercury, there would be a corresponding loss of material—if you started with 50lb., and distilled it 40 times, you would charge it as 50lb. of mercury re-distilled 40 times—you carried on some of your work in secrecy—I came into. your room about once a month—I com<lb/>plained to Mr. Loeffler that you wanted confidence in me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Twickenham—I was bathing with Brench<lb/>ley, and the prisoner and his wife came along and asked what business we had there—Brenchley said we had leave from Mr. Hall—the prisoner swore at us and called us b—liars—Brenchley said he was a liar—he said "If you are not off I will pull the trigger"—I and Brenchley ran away, the other boy was in the other field—the prisoner held the gun up to his shoulder—we were between 40 and 50 yards from him—Brenchley ran to get behind an iron tank, and I ran to get behind the hedge—I heard the discharge—Brenchley came up to us and said he was shot—he showed us some wounds; he was bleeding a little—I helped to take the shots out and we threw them away; they were No. 5 shot, I think, used for sparrows, like those produced.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody at his house on the Sunday night—I told him the charge—he said he could not have hurt the boy, as he had no shot in the gun—Brenchley, who was with me, said "I had six shot wounds on me"—the prisoner said "A good job if you had twenty"—in going to the station he said "I fired at a black<lb/>bird; I did not see the boys"—I found this gun, powder, flask, and shot<lb/>flask at the prisoner's house, and five shot in a bag in a drawer, marked No. 5—there was powder in the flask, but no shot in the shot-bag—he said he had been using the gun during the afternoon scaring birds.</p>

               <p>you strike me?"—I called Cousins, the mate, who-was to leeward of the mizen mast, and told him to hold Ryan till I got the handcuffs—Cousins took hold of him and he struck me again—I gave him to the mate and went and got the handcuffs and put them on him, and he went forward—about 8 a.m. I sent the mate forward to tell Ryan to come aft to me; the mate returned and told me he would not come—I then walked forward and said "Ryan, I want you for a few minutes, please"—he began to abuse me; he said he would murder me and used other imprecations and expressions that I cannot remember now—I then went aft and went ashore in the boat and sent a police officer on board to arrest Ryan—he was taken before a Magistrate and a sentence was passed upon him, but I requested that he should be sent on board, and he was sent on board under arrest—he had been boatswain up to that time, I then disrated him, and put William Glanville in his place—the ship sailed on 20th February—on the 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. t Ryan was continually using threatening expressions upon myself, the ship, and those in charge—on the night of the 26th a quantity; of cooking utensils were thrown overboard, and we stopped the coffee; that was not as a punishment, coffee was served afterwards; through the cooking utensils being thrown over we could not or did not serve any more, unless we had put extra labour on the steward; the men had the allowance of coffee served out weekly and they could make their coffee if so minded in a pannikin; the coffee pot was thrown overboard—on 4th March I found that the flying-jib had been cut away—on 6th I spoke to Leverson about steering badly—I requested him to keep the ship her course, she was ranging off her course from 1 to 5 1/2; points—he replied with a lot of cool insolence, I cannot recollect the expressions; I have forgotten; this <hi rend="italic">educated</hi> insolence we don't understand, not to keep it in our heads for a con<lb/>siderable time—on the 10th I again requested him to keep the ship her course—he said she would not steer—I said she would, and told him to put the helm down—he did not do it at first; I ordered him a second time and he did not care to do it then, and I put it down myself—on 24th March Ryan was in charge of the wheel, he ran away from the wheel, leaving no one there, to aid and abet Leverson to fight with West, another seaman—. the mate sang out to him to go back; he did go back in about two minutes—on 23rd April, about 2 a.m., when we were off the Cape of Good Hope, the mate told Clifford to haul tight the lee jib sheets—Clifford told him to go to hell—I went to see how the compass was, and as I returned I saw the mate on the deck scrambling towards me—Nash, the steward, came out of the cabin, and I gave the mate into his charge; he was bleeding; he made a complaint to me—on 11th May, at I am., I went forward and found Clifford asleep; he should have been on the look-out—I woke him up and cautioned him that that was no sort of a way to keep a look-out—he said he got up every five minutes or so—some time after that, after we had passed the line, in consequence of a complaint the mate made to me, I went forward to Ryan and asked why he did not attend to his duty in keeping a look-out—he said he did keep a look-out—I said the house was no piece to keep a look-out in, and asked why he was so insubordinate and insolent to the mate—he said he would plug the mate's nose—on 10th June I heard him say to the mate "You old b—, if you came here again I will take you by the breeches and throw you overboard"—Ryan was at the wheel and the mate was walking the poop, and went aft to look at the compass—on 28th June,</p>

               <p>at 10.45 a.m., I was awoke by a disturbance on deck—I went on deck, and Ryan came running aft, saying that Clifford had threatened to murder him, and he wanted me to put Clifford in irons, saying "That is the man that cut your jib, captain; that is the man that struck the mate"—Clifford replied "That is the man that was going to sell your hawsers, captain; that is the man that cut the ropes" (speaking of Ryan) "and threw things overboard"—in fact, he said a great deal which I cannot remember now—I told them to go to their duty, and at 12 o'clock I would give them a hearing—at 12 I could not call them; but at 1.30 I called them aft to know what their com<lb/>plaint was—they had very little to say; I could not give you the exact words; I think it is in the log, but I would not be certain—the ship arrived in London on Saturday, 6th July, and the mate, in my presence, gave Ryan and Clifford into custody—Levereon was given in charge on the Monday through the declaration made by Jacobson—he had previously left the ship—I was at Arbour Square, and heard Jacobson make a statement before the Magistrate there; it was after that that he was taken into custody—during the voyage from Port Adelaide to London the mate made complaints to me on several occasions.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Leverson was not at Arbour Square for the purpose of preferring a charge against me—I have received three summonses for assault, not at that time, it was some time after—Ryan was one I was summoned for assaulting—Leverson might have been one; I really can't remember; I took very little notice of it (<hi rend="italic">There were five summonses produced, three for wages due</hi>—25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to Leverson</hi>, 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d. to Clifford, and</hi> 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to Ryan—and two for assaults on Leverson and Ryan</hi>.) The Magistrate declined to hear those summonses until this case was finished—I did not stop anywhere on the way from Port Adelaide to London—I did not stop at St. Helena; we went close by; it is in our course—I did not think it worth while to make any complaint there—I took provisions on board there—I did not make any complaint or mention the matter to any one—I was not justified in making any complaint—I did not choose to stay there—the harbour-master came on board—Ryan and Clifford were given into custody directly we arrived at St. Katharine's Docks, as soon as we were alongside and the ship was fast; the mate gave them in charge to a policeman—it was on 12th May that we were off St. Helena—I did not let go the anchor there—before the surveyors came on board at Adelaide I did not give Ryan orders to shift part of the cargo in order to get a defective place above the water line and alter the list of the ship—the surveyors suggested that the ship had a list, and I spoke to Cousins to righten her—the surveyors sealed the pumps in order to see whether she made water—the stevedores had left her with a list on her—she did not list all the way from Adelaide—it was a very little list; it was only just to shift a few bags of cargo—there was not a quarter of a plank under water on one side more than the other—she might have had a list of an inch or three-quarters—Ryan did not say why he wanted to go ashore and see a Magistrate—he did not complain that the ship was unseaworthy; she was perfectly seaworthy—we had to pump every two hours throughout the voyage—I thought that necessary for the protection of my cargo and to get my ship home—she might have been making an inch and a half of water an hour—it was a private leak that had been in the ship since she was new—I have since had her in dock and had the copper stripped off, and we found a small bolt-hole in the bilge: that was where the water</p>

               <p>Adelaide to survey the ship; the list was discovered on the first occasion and was corrected before they came again—they came the second time through the letter Leverson wrote—I could not say exactly what water she was making then; it is entered on the surveyor's certificate; it was very little, nothing unusual—the crew consisted of myself, the mate, steward, and six able seamen—I could not have navigated the vessel with only three able seamen—I can't say whether I could have shipped hands at St. Helena, I never was ashore there.</p>

In February last I was mate of the Argosy—I kept the log and entered there what occurred every day—I have my log here—on 18th February, at 6 a.m., I saw Ryan strike the captain; he wanted to go and see a Magistrate, I don't know what for—I had heard him say three or four days previously that the ship was unseaworthy—she did make a drop of water in Adelaide, 4 3/4; Inches in 18 hours—he said he wanted to leave the ship because she was unseaworthy—the captain told him he could not go now as he was ready for sea—he struck the captain with his right fist and the captain called me to get the handcuffs and put on him—I held him and the captain went and got the handcuffs—he did not struggle while I held him—at 8 a.m., in consequence of instructions from the captain, I went to Ryan in the forecastle—he had not got the handcuffs on then—I told him to come aft, that the captain wanted him—he said he would not, and if the captain came there he would brain him—I went and reported to the captain and he went forward, and Ryan said he would brain him if he came nigh him—next day, after returning on board from the Magistrate, he refused to set the anchor watch; he refused to do anything in the ship, and hoped his right hand would drop off if he did—he said then or the next time that if he had two men to join him he would take charge of the ship altogether—on 7th April it was my watch on deck from 8 to 12 p.m.—about 11.30 to 12 o'clock the wind shifted, and we were setting sails; Clifford, Leverson, and West were on deck, and Ryan was standing at the door—Jacobson was inside—I told him to set the mainsail before we went below; he declined to come out of the forecastle—I went in and told him quietly to come out and set the mainsail, and he struck me, and the other two joined, and then Leverson joined them—Clifford said "Now is your time to drive your knife through him"—I was knocked about and scarred about the face; I felt a prick of something, but it was dark and I could not see—Jacobson struck me with his fist, I could not say who else struck me, I was right among the gang, they were all round me—after that they went to their duty—on 21st April, at 2.20, I and Clifford were engaged in stowing the jib and coiling the ropes, and I ordered him to hold tight the flying-jib sheet; he grumbled and refused to do it—I asked him three times to do it, and he then came and struck me with his fist in the face; then Ryan joined in and struck me three times in the face with his fist, and as I was going off Clifford struck me with a belaying pin and knocked me on the deck sense<lb/>less for three or four minutes—when I came to my senses I scrambled up on my knees and met the captain as I crawled to the mainmast and he took</p>

I live in the same house with the prisoner and prosecutor—previous to this Wednesday evening they had been drinking violently all the week—he gave her a severe beating on the Monday night, and on Wednesday morning he nearly strangled her on the stairs—in the evening she went out and had a drop of drink and came home very tipsy, and seeing the chopper lying on the floor, she took it up—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is an old chopper without a handle, which she used for breaking coke—she came down to me and said "Oh, Polly, see what I have done"—I went up—he was lying on the bed bleeding, but not very much, from his head and hand—I got some water and bathed him—I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself; indeed I consider he ought to be there, (<hi rend="italic">In the dock</hi>) instead of her—the police came and took them away—the prisoner, when not in drink, is a nice, quiet, comfortable woman, and very clean—when she is in drink she is excitable, because her brain is not right—she is 50 years of age, and certain things have settled in her brain.</p>

I am a surgeon, of Spital Square—on 31<hi rend="italic">st</hi> July I saw the prosecutor at the station and dressed his wounds—he had a clean cut at the side of the head, about three inches long, reaching to the bone; the nail of his ring finger was separated, and the soft parts of the finger separated from the bone; he also had several minor cuts across his knuckles; he will probably have a stiff top joint of his finger for life—the wounds would be caused by such an instrument as this—I saw the prisoner at the station—she was excited by drink—she said she was sorry she had not taken his life.</p>

When I pawned these glasses, I was known to live close by. Mr. Archbutt knows me. I only put "Harry" instead of "Charles" in a moment of thoughtlessness. Ten days elapsed after I pawned them before I was taken into custody, so that I had every opportunity to assume another name, but I apprehended no danger. Smith has always known and addressed me as Charles Hall. I have never been in prison, or convicted before. I have suffered three weeks' remand, and I hope you will give me the benefit of any doubt.</p>

On 23rd July I was on duty in Buck's Row, Whitechapel, where the East London Railway. runs in about 40 feet of cutting—there is a railway bridge and at the end of it a hoarding—I saw the prisoners pick up several brickbats—there is a gate at the side of the hoarding with a wooden bar across, and they got up and reached over, and as the trains came in and out I saw them throw three at two different trains—they had three <hi rend="italic">shies</hi> each as near as I can tell—trains approach the station and leave it rather slower, and persons can tell by the noise and steam when the trains are coming—when they saw me they got off the hoarding and ran away—I got the assistance of another constable and sent him up Wood's Buildings—they ran up by the school and I caught them—they said they were over there to ease their bowels—I took them to the station master and from there to the police-station.</p>

                  </hi>. I was manager to Oswald Arthur Beaumont, who trades under the style of R. A.

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 29th May, and stated that the amount claimed had been already paid to the prisoner, and that no sum of</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was paid on the</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.) The prisoner had credited Mr. Smallman with 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as paid on 25th May, and he had remitted that amount on that date—I communicated with the prisoner and received a telegram from him and afterwards saw him—I asked him for an explanation of this letter of Mr. Smallman's, and what he meant by giving him credit for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when Mr. Smallman had never paid it—he said it was a mistake, he could not understand it, or something of that kind—there were one or two other little accounts similar, and I said "How do you account for those?"—he said he could not account for it, it was a mistake, or something of the kind, and went off on another subject—he said "You know what a lot of accounts I have to pay for you," and he also said that I did not understand his position, and the expense he was put to—I asked him if there were any other amounts similar that he had kept and not paid to the firm—he said he did not think there were, but he could not possibly tell unless he saw his books—I insisted upon his letting us know at once, because he was putting us into a false position with our customers, as we were sending out accounts that were paid—he said he would look at his books and let me know—I said he must let me know on Monday or Tuesday, this was on Saturday—he said he could not see his books, they were down in the country, at Manchester or Birmingham—on the Monday his wife came and brought this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Gentlemen,—I am sorry I could not get together more cash than I did on Saturday, but if you will only give me sufficient time, I will do my utmost to pay you as quickly as possible.

               <p>the prisoner and told him I was very much annoyed at the matter, and asked what he meant by collecting this money and not accounting for it—he did not say much, he looked very uncomfortable, and beat on the table, and tried to make, some excuses, and said his expenses were heavy—I asked what he did with the money—he said he had used some of it in his own business—I believe he had a business of his own, as I found out afterwards—I called his attention to his commission account being overdrawn 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., apart from this—it was as to that he said that his expenses were heavy; he said he would work it out in good time as he was getting such a good business—I then left him and communicated with our solicitors—he was in the habit of sending off cash and what he called a balance-sheet once or twice a week—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of them—these are books supplied to him; there is a tally in the book, he tears this part off and sends it with the money—he was instructed to remit immediately—on 31st May he represents 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as his balance in hand, and <hi rend="italic">in</hi> all these accounts the balance from the last week is carried into the next—I sent him a cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. every week drawn to his order; he often came for it.*</p>

I am assistant to Henry Soames, a pawnbroker, of Fulham Road—he has three shops in Chelsea—I have been twelve years in the trade—on 12th July, about 9.30, the prisoner came and wanted me to send for some Apolonaris water and brandy, and to advance her half-a-sovereign on a cheap common ring; but I only advanced her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she came again about 10 o'clock and asked me to lend her 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this bracelet—she asked to look at some things out of the window, which came to 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether, and the put the other bracelet in and asked me to make them 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that I did not think I could—she said "Yes, you can; they are splendid brilliants, and this one cost 300 guineas," or pounds—I agreed to advance her 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the two, upon that representation—I would not have done so if I had known that she bought them at Mr. Pike's Abyssinian shop—she subsequently purchased another ring for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave me 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the change I gave her, and this metal bracelet, to make the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but she said nothing about the value of the bracelet, and I did not try it, as she took me off my guard—I afterwards found that the bracelets were not gold, and that the stones were paste, and that Mr. Pike had charged about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them all—I let her have the value of 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, goods and cash—she called next day, about 11.30, in a Victoria and pair, and produced a locket, two pain of earrings, this pendant, a bracelet, and something else, and asked for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them—I said "They are paste and metal"—she said that I most be mistaken; she never wore fictitious jewellery, and if I did not like to lend it she would take them round to Mr. Young—I then found that the goods she pledged on the first day were worthless.</p>

I was on duty in Acton Street about 12.25, and saw the prisoner loitering in front of Nos. 11, 12, and 13—I stepped back into another street, where I could see, and saw him walk down two or three times, and then put his hands on the railings of No. 11, and jump down into the area—he had his hat on—I saw no one else in the street—I looked down in two or three minutes, and saw the outer door open, and the prisoner forcing the inner door—he saw me, and laid down beside the door—he got up again, and called out "Charlie," and put his shoulder against the inner door and burst it in—I called the prosecutor up, and went down and found the prisoner in the kitchen, going into the area—I caught hold of him, and asked him what he was doing there—he said that somebody had thrown his hat over—his hat was then on his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The area is the ordinary depth—his hat was on when he jumped over—on the way to the station he said that a man had thrown his hat down the area, and he had no intention of taking anything from the house.</p>

I am a draper, of 133, High Street, Camden Town—on 31st May I went to bed about 1 o'clock, having seen the house securely, fastened—on 1st June I was awoke about 7 o'clock, went downstairs, and found the inner shop iron door leading to the house, broken open—some goods were pulled out behind the counter, and spread over with tallow candle—I missed a piece of silk, a piece of satin, several pairs of stockings, and several silk scarves, and from the drawing-room, two silver cups and an opera glass; a desk was broken open, eight doors were broken open from the inside, all the doors but one, which is the one leading to the back stairs—the policeman called my attention to the skylight—this satin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is precisely the same as what I missed, in quality—I cannot tell the quantity because it was in cut lengths—these two scarves and these stockings are mine—Miss Holli<lb/>day is in my employ, and lived in the house.</p>

I live with my mother, at 148, Copenhagen Street—I know the three prisoners—Morris kept company with me in May and June—on 1st June I visited Esther Lacy, Minnie Collins, and the three prisoners at 3, Cromer Street—Lacy and Lowther lived together, Powell was keeping company with Collins—I slept with, Esther Lacy, and saw the three prisoners come in between 5 and 6 a.m. on 1st June—they had a piece of satin, and several pairs of stockings and neckties, two silver cups and an opera-glass; Powell took the satin out to give to his mother, the other articles were taken out by the prisoners, and I did not see them again, these are them produced—I identify this satin—a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> was kept between the bed and the mattress on which I slept, but I did not know it then; that was in Lacy and Lowther's room, the room in which I saw the three prisoners—this <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi> produced is very much like it.</p>

On Monday, 8th July, about 2 a.m., in consequence of information I received, I went to Gooding's house with Baker—I saw Gooding, and said, "Gooding, some trucks at Temple Mill siding have been robbed on the previous day, and some of the property has been found," and that I was going to take him into custody for being concerned with others in stealing it—he made no answer then—I commenced to search the front room—Baker then came in—Gooding asked Baker to allow him to go and wash—they went into the washhouse—I heard Gooding say in the washhouse, "If there is anything found in my locker, somebody else has put it there; I have not"—I had not heard any one say anything about the locker—I gave Gooding to another constable, who took him to West Ham station—I sent another constable for Elliston, who was also brought to the West Ham station—I there said to him, "Elliston, I am going to take you in custody for being concerned with others in stealing a quantity of property from trucks at Temple Mill siding"—he made no answer—I had previously said, "I am going to search your house; have you any property belonging to the company there?"—he said, "I know nothing at all about it"—the charge was read over to the prisoners by the acting</p>

                  </hi>. I live on my means, at 4, Maria Terrace, Stratford—early in January, 1878, I purchased a plot of land at Wellington Road, Forest Gate—I employed the prisoner to negotiate the purchase for me and paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his trouble—about the middle of January I had a verbal arrangement with him to do the building for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I said "If you can do it for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you shall have the job to do; how much shall you want a week?"—he said 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "I will give you 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you are to buy the building materials for me in the cheapest market, and if you can build the houses for anything like 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will sell them and give you half the profits; you are to buy everything, but nothing in your own name; I will pay ready money for everything"—he entered on the ground and began opera<lb/>tions immediately—he was to engage the men, and I was to pay them every Saturday, but I told him I was not allowed to—I visited the work some<lb/>times three or four times a day, and sometimes I did not go for a week or a fortnight—he used to come to my house on Saturday morning for money for the payments if I did not take it to the works—he never gave me any account—he would never let me know what he had spent—I said on several occasions "Let me know what you want and what you are doing with it," and that I was not going to part with hundreds of pounds in that loose way without looking for an account of it—I paid him every week the money he required, which included the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his wages—about the middle of March I got this account-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and took it to him and wanted him to enter the men's wages, but he said that that was such a bothering affair of Proctor's—I next saw the book on 27th April, when he gave it to me filled up as it is now—the last date is 20th April—it is made up from 29th Jan., and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is put down every week against Nicholson—every bricklayer and carpenter's name is down—April 20 is the last date I gave him money—I gave him a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque on that day at my house on his word, without seeing the book—I knew that he was working on Mr. Proctor's property, adjoining mine, at the same time—I believe I was on the premises on 26th April, and saw a quantity of timber and flooring boards both inside and outside the premises—the prisoner had bought that timber for me of Messrs. Carter, these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the invoices—I had paid all these accounts but this one, which I have paid since—they are made out in my name—the last time I saw that timber on the premises was Saturday, 27th April, and also some slates, which were stacked against the wall at the back of the premises; they had been purchased of Mr. Alfred Braby—this is the invoice with my cheque attached (<hi rend="italic">For</hi> 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—I paid that on 4th June—the prisoner was not at work on 27th April; I was there a little after 5 a.m., and waited till about 6.20—I saw him about 7.30 over the railway bridge, and asked him what sort of a game he was up to—he said that he should put the shutters up at 11 o'clock—I told him he was not master yet—I saw him</p>

               <p>again about 4 p.m., but not at work—I had employed him to work—he was in the bar of the Tower Hamlets Arms—I had been to my premises and could see by looking through, that the materials were there, but the doors were barricaded up to keep any one from going in, there were no shutters—he said "My men are waiting over the other side, and want paying"—I said "There have been no men at work for me there," and there would not be above three or four men at work that week, it being Easter week—he handed me the book and said "Here is your book;" he was beastly drunk—I did not give him any money that day, and he never did any more work, but I saw him on the premises—I employed another man—on the Thursday, which was the next time I visited the premises, Nicholson's labourers were carrying bricks and mortar off my premises to Proctor's; I had sold Proctor the bricks—there was not a foot of timber left and not a slate, except four or five broken ones—the scaffolding was all gone; Nicholson had provided that as arranged between us—the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week was for the use of the scaffolding and his wages—I then went to see my solicitor and charged the prisoner with stealing the timber—I did not charge him then with stealing the slates—he had authority to use the bricks at Proctor's but not timber, because I could measure the bricks—I gave Proctor authority to use the bricks, not the prisoner—I decidedly did not give the prisoner authority to use on Proctor's premises the timber I had bought</p>

I would sell and give him half the profits—he got his 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week besides—on my oath the 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week was mentioned before we started—I know a man named Tayler—he was not employed by me to make up the accounts between me and Nicholson—the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week was not suggested by Taylor as a fair charge for the use of the scaffolding and plant—there was not to my knowledge a piece of ground in the Woodford Road bought of a person named Haws for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know the name—know nothing of a piece of ground in Woodford Road bought of Haws for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and sold to Bartlett for 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not agree that 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. should be knocked off for expenses,</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Dated 29th April</hi>)—he used his own discretion as to what he wrote—I told him to write "There is a mortgage for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which Mr. Randall paid off"—I paid Blackstone 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then I stood in the position of Blackstone—when disclosed the mortgage I demanded 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lent him 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. one day to pay Pavitt for the stock on his place—that 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not there at all—I make up the 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up in this way; he bought a lot of furniture, and he came hack the same day and asked me to let him have 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay Pavitt, which I did—that is how I say I am entitled to 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is made up of 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which I hare an <hi rend="largeCaps">IOU</hi>, and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay Pavitt—that leaves the other untouched—I have sold a portion of those three plots to Mr. Proctor, and received a deposit from him of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I do not know on what day—I did get 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him—Nicholson did not point out to me that it would be disadvantageous to part with the piece I was going to sell—he pressed me to sell it to Proctor, or else I should not have done so—he said Proctor was going to build a stable—I then sent Proctor back a cheque for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not say to Proctor that my partner had pointed out that I had done wrong in undertaking to sell that piece of ground—I did not say to Proctor in Smith's presence "I have done wrong," as I did not know what my partner would say—Smith is a man I never was in company with, but he used to go in front of the bar—I sold Proctor 15 feet of land—he never had more nor less than I sold him first—there was an arrangement to build half of a wall 7 feet high—that was not at the same time as the sale—when I sent his 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back he came to my house and I was lying on a couch—I sent it back because he wanted me to build a 9 Inch wall 7 feet high, and I would not—I agreed to build half of it, and said he should have the bricks at what they cost—I had nothing to do with the labour—I knew nothing about a coach house and stable going to be built, but it is built—I did not promise Proctor to build a coach house and stable at the cost out of my own pocket—I did not speak to Nicholson to get his consent to that arrangement—I do not find the bricks charged in this book—here are 3,000 old bricks charged at 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the bricks charged in this account were not Fruend's bricks, nor were they used in building this very wall and stable for Proctor—I took criminal proceedings against Nicholson on the Monday after 1st May—he came to me one Sunday night when I was going to bed, and I would not see him—he could hear me tell the servant to say so—that was the Sunday before he took the things away, and on the Monday I went to Mr. Handall, a solicitor, and we took the summons out on the 6th May—I attended on the first occasion of the summons being returnable—it was dismissed—it was put down to be called on at 12 o'clock, and it was called on at 11, and we therefore had a fresh summons granted, free of cost—the slates were not charged before the Magistrate—I do not think we had missed them—I have seen a gentleman here who supplied the slates—I called to pay for them because they were put on my houses—they said they did not know Lancaster—I then said, "Nicholson is building for me," and they referred to the ledger, and found that Mr. Nicholson's name was entered, but they did not even know him—that was on the 4th June—it was headed 26th April—the invoices were sent to my foreman—I never had it till the day of the receipt—the slates had no business to be supplied in Nicholson's name—I had never seen the invoice—they were put on the houses before the invoice was sent in, and that is how</p>

               <p>they knew how many slates were used—the houses were roofed in on 26th April, bar the back kitchens, and there were slates on the ground—I went to pay my debts after Nicholson was committed lor trial, and found that he was charged by Mr. Brady with the whole sum 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not charge Nicholson with having unroofed my houses—I went on 4th June, and paid the account entered in Brady's ledger to Nicholson, and then I charged Nicholson with stealing the slates—I know nothing about this account of battens, gutters, and other articles, or whether Mr. Fruend supplied those goods to Nicholson—if they were used on Proctor's job, that has nothing to do with me—I have not got these things on my property—no such materials have been used—this is for ironmongery—no nails had been used, as none of the flooring in my houses was done at this date—those nails were used on Proctor's job—he was doing the job for Proctor—I have not said in the presence of witnesses, George Baylis being one, "I and Nicholson are doing the work at Proctor's at cost price"—here is a bill of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on this file, not one item of which has been on my premises—it is for ironmongery—here are two or three more of them—I did not say in Baylis's presence, or to him, that Nicholson was going to build the place as cheap as he could, and that he and I were going to divide the profits, nor did I say in his presence that I had 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to speculate with in building, and was going to make a man of Nicholson, or words to that effect—Baylis was not employed to do the plumbing of the houses—he fitted some gas up, and charged 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and here is the receipt—I did not complain of his charges—he did not lay on the water that I am aware of—I know of no other plumber than Baylis being employed—about the time of the sale of the land to Proctor for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I did not say to Edward Barritt "I shall get into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with my partner Nicholson, and I do not know what I shall say to him for letting him have the land so cheap"—I know Thomas McGovaran, landlord. of the Pigeons, Stratford—I cannot say what I may have said in a public-house bar—it may have been that McGovaran put the question point blank to me "Who is going to build?" and that I said "Fred Nicholson," but I don't think that he asked me, because he well knew—I did not say to McGovaran "I and Nicholson are going to sell the house when they are up, and then divide the profits between us;" I should say "I shall sell them"—I said "I shall give him half the profits if he does it for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I did not say to McGovaran that I had given Nicholson instructions to do the work at Mr. Proctor's—I have been served with this writ (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to wind up a partnership which was never in existence; to have the accounts taken, and there never were any accounts to take.</p>

I could have it—when Lancaster asked me to borrow money of him to pay Nicholson he was in my bar parlour—it was just before the bill was paid—I purchased the house of him—he has bills of mine running of 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each at three months, which are paid as they become due—he has never had to press me for payment or to threaten me with pro<lb/>ceedings, I have paid it to a day—I have paid too much for my bargain, but I did not complain—I have not the slightest ill-will against Lancaster—I thought he was going to act like a gentleman, though I feel I have over-bought the house—I have no animosity—I have threatened to bring an action against him for defamation of character—I cannot have him going about calling me a thief—I have not threatened anything, but I said that I must stop his mouth—I have not said that I would give the old scoundrel a sweating, or that I would stop his month with my fist—very likely I said that he was an artful old b—, that was not at a time when I felt lamb-like towards him—he said that I was receiving stolen property, that is the defamation of character which I am complaining of, but I have no ill-will against him.</p>

               <p>materials—I made this copy weeks after the book was made up—I suppose it was about 9th March—I made this first entry in the ledger on 29th January—I see in several places the words "Nicholson, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," written between the lines, that was after the account was opened; that was done because the prisoner had omitted charging anything for his cords, ropes, and boards—he asked how much should be charged—I reckoned how much a pole was worth, and how much a rope was worth, and put this 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in myself; that was done by both our directions; he brought the receipts forward and I entered them into the book—it is interlined first and afterwards it comes regularly—I made the suggestion to him about charging 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week two or three weeks after the book was started, it was on 29th January by the book—it would not be in March, because on 16th February I put it down in regular course, but on 13th February it is interlined—Lancaster and Nicholson were always together, they were very good friends—I saw them on the buildings together—before Lancaster let his public-house he used to say that he should have a lot of money and they would build together, and the arrangement was that they were to purchase ground and to build, and when done the buildings were to be sold and the profits equally divided—I never saw any money divided—I compared Mr. Lancaster's banking account with the ledger; he asked me to do so—I remember seeing this ledger in Lancaster's possession one Sunday morning three or four months ago—I know it was cold weather—Nicholson and Lancaster were there making up their accounts, and when they had made them up Lancaster said to me, "I want you to go through my banking account"—I went through it, and found an error of a figure or two—I added the total up of what he had withdrawn from the bank—I have heard Lancaster's statement that these entries were made at different times—I compared this white paper with the items on this page with the ledger, and they corresponded—I ticked off each item—I am positive that the words "Half profits 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." were in the ledger—there is no difference between the white paper and the ledger except the words at the bottom—I am positive of that—I notice this bent page has nothing in it about half profits; that is not the account that I checked it from, but this is the book to the best of my knowledge—when they got to the "brick accounts" they said, "This is how we stand," and they went through the items with me—I cannot say whether anything was said when we got to "Half profits 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," but I believe something was said as each item was gone through—I know Mr. Bartlett bought and sold the ground—I see my figures in the book—you will see I have altered one figure here, and I have not the slightest doubt this is the book that I made up, and in which I saw the words "Half profits 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—one morning Lancaster was ill in bed; I went up to see him, and he said that he had got a summons out against Nicholson—I said, "Are you aware they have got a paper with ' 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. half profits' on the ground?"—he said, "They won't see that," and that that would not appear in his ledger—I suppose he was referring to the ledger I had previously seen—I think the pages on which I saw that were lower down than than this page which is torn away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I made up this small book as near as I can guess about April 20th—I cannot say for certain whether it was made up first before April 27th—Nicholson asked me to make it up, and I did it as a favour to him—I said at the police-court "I have only done the account book according to the defendant's orders"—he asked me to make a copy of the ledger, but</p>

               <p>he did not hand me this book—I made the entries about January or February—the whole of these entries down to "Miller 1—7 1/2;" must have been made at different times—I went to Nicholson's to make up the book once a week or once a fortnight—I pledge my oath that the entries were made at dif<lb/>ferent times—he gave me the materials from which to make them—Mr. Lancaster knew I was making a book up, but he did not know anything about the 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. till I told him what I was charging—I said at the police-court" I received the instructions to make up the book as regards the charges, from the defendant"—Mr. Lancaster did not know anything about it till he had the book—I said "Fred, Mr. Lancaster is charged 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for scaffolding," and he said "I do not think much of that"—I have seen Nicholson since his committal for trial—I told him months before about the scaffolding—Lancaster knew nothing about the charge except the 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I wish to add that to what I stated at the police-court—Mr. Yelverton cross<lb/>examined me there—it was not my business to remember everything there—my deposition was read over to me, and I signed it; but there are lots of other things I remember now—I did not notice that I had omitted saying any<lb/>thing about the 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I tore the pages out of this book, it was an old book of Mr. Pavitt's—I do not say that the page was torn out of Mr. Lancaster's book, but what I saw in it I do not see now—it was Sunday morning—I cannot tell whether it was the 30th February—I hare seen that book on more than one occasion that I have been at Lancaster's house—I cannot say whether I made this alteration on February 25th, the date which it bears, it was in in cold weather—it was on the date whenever it was that I compared this slip of white paper—I compared the accounts up to the 16th March, but all I know is that it was on a Sunday morning—I was not asked a single word about the half profits—I was sworn to tell the whole truth—if I were to tell you all that passed, it would take 12 months—I said I always supposed the claimant and defendant were to share the profits—I never saw this white paper till Saturday—I was not asked by Mr. Yelverton whether there was not an agreement to share the profits—I did not say that there were, because I could not remember everything—no question was put to me as to the page being torn out of the ledger, and I did not say a word about it—I will swear that that paper was not put to me in the police-court, IIford—I know the solicitor instructing you—I will swear this paper was not shown me at the police-court—I was not asked questions about it</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I was called upon to give evidence in Nicholson's favour at the police-court—Mr. Fullager did not come to me to be a witness; they subpoenaed me—I believed he was a solicitor—he never spoke to me—I told Lancaster that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was charged for the hire of the plant—Mr. Fullager examined me; but he never asked me anything about the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—when Lancaster called me in on the Sunday night I was sick—that was a day or two after the summons was issued—he afterwards called me as his witness—he did not say why it would not appear—I asked him not to subpoena me, as I did not want to have anything to do with it, and he said "I want to subpoena you for the books"—I compared the white paper with the January entry in Nicholson's presence and Lancaster's—this in the ledger is an entry of each item as it is on the white paper—when I made up the books Nicholson pro<lb/>duct the tickets for the lime and the timber—these receipts of Fruend's were also supplied to me, and I made correct copies of them—I did not have anything to do with carrying them into the ledger, because the slates were not paid for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Braby, of Bangor Wharf—I wrote this letter of 9th April, and sent it to Mr. Nicholson. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he ordered a truck-load of slates to be sent to Stratford station on Thursday morning</hi>.) I also wrote this letter of 10th April: "Dear Sir,—I enclose order to the station-master for truck-load of slates as arranged"—on 17th April I wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the slates had been delayed in consequence of the illness of his wife</hi>)—this invoice was sent from my firm to Nicholson about 26th April, and on 4th June Mr. Lancaster called—he gave his name—I said "I do not know the name"—he said "Perhaps you know the name of Nicholson?"—I said "We have a customer of that name on the books"—he intimated his wish to pay the amount for the slates—I referred to the ledger and found that Nicholson was charged, who was our customer—we knew nothing of Mr. Lancaster till that day—a copy of the account was made out, and I drew out this cheque for Lancaster, which he signed, and a day or two afterwards I got the receipt altered to his own name, but I was not present—he got one of the clerks to alter it when I was not there—I gave a proper receipt, which has been suppressed—the other one was destroyed at the time, so our ledger-clerk told me—Lancaster called some days afterwards and claimed the return of 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the carriage and cartage of the slates, in answer to a note sent him by one of our clerks—there was no doubt about it in our minds, because he had already paid the account, and on 15th June we signed this note and sent it to the prosecutor with the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.: "Please receive herewith 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. carriage and cartage of slates.

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Nicholson had to cart them to the ground, but that was included in the price—all the work was done before 26th April, when we completed it—it was taken at so much per square.</p>

I am a dairyman and market gardener, of Forest Gate, near the Tower Hamlets public-house—I have kown Lancaster seven or eight years, and Nicholson about four years—I was at Nicholson's house on a Sunday in January when Lancaster called—he and Nicholson both came in together—Lancaster said "Well, I have sold a plot of ground to Proctor for him to have a stable and coach-house built on—what do you think of it?"—Nicholson said "Well, as you have done so it will alter all our arrange<lb/>ments, and we shall not be able to build the five cottages as we were going to"—they were there together most of the afternoon, during which time Lancaster said "Well, Fred, if you are not satisfied I will send the deposit back; I have given no receipt for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Nicholson's boy afterwards drove Lancaster home in the pony trap—one evening I was at Nicholson's house with my wife and my sister-in-law and a cousin, when Nicholson said to Lancaster "I have bought a plot of ground"—I cannot remember the name of the person who he said he bought it of, but he said "I have sold it again for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. clear, free of conveyance"—that was the profit—he said "Fred, that will do; there is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for each of us; that will be 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for you, and the odd 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you can have for your expenses"—I was in Procter's</p>

From the time I heard the noise to the time I went into the parlour two or three minutes elapsed—I ran up directly—the parlour is at the-back of the shop, which is open to the Camberwell Road; you go down a flight of stairs to the yard, and down three stairs more to the kitchen—the yard runs alongside of the yard of the prisoner's house—at the back of the prisoner's house there is an additional building which is used as a dining-room, and the smoke went in there—there was scarcely the distance from his window to the fire that there is between you and me; a paling intervened—if I said that Catherwood was kneeling over Mr. Pike I meant kneeling on him—my mistress tried to separate them—I left the room, and did not see her take her husband away—my master was in the shop on Thursday serving customers—he Was first imwell on the Friday—he went to the doctor on Sunday, and took to his bed on the following Wednesday—he was a little deaf—he used to put his head on one side when you spoke to him—the prisoner looked very excited.</p>

"and he said Yes"—I have never mentioned before to—day what my mother said to the deceased, but she did say so.</p>

On the day of the assault, when I went into the room, I saw that my son's mouth was swelling and bleeding—the prisoner was in a state of great excitement; he kicked me violently and hurt me—I had come out of the garden, where I was putting the fire out with a stick—I think I had it in my hand when I was called; but I did not use any violence to the prisoner with it—my son was twenty—four years old—he was a little deaf with one ear; that was the ear on which he said he had a blow from the prisoner—it was the left ear, I think; on whichever side he was deaf, that was the side on which he was struck—he always enjoyed good health—Dr. Smith, of Newington Causeway, is our medical attendant; but he had not been called to attend him for eight years—the assault was on Thursday—he could hardly open his mouth the next day—he took to his bed on the Tuesday night, and never left it again—the prisoner never came to make any inquiries after the assault, nor any of the family, although they lived next door.</p>

               <p>ground, when he again struck me in the same place, and I became uncon<lb/>scious. I know nothing more of the case"</p>
               <p>—— <hi rend="smallCaps">MOORMAN</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi>57). I took the prisoner at a few minutes past 1 on 4th July; that was a fortnight before the statement was made—I charged him with assaulting Mr. Pike, and showed the warrant to him—he said, "All right; I will go with you"—on the way to the station he asked me if it was right for a Magistrate to grant a warrant after such a lapse of time—"I said Yes, it is quite right on sworn information"—he said, "I don't deny the assault, but I think they have taken a very extreme course"—he then said that he was subject to epileptic fits, and if he should be taken ill would I send for a doctor, mentioning Dr. Carpenter and another, who, I think, was Dr. Smith—he was taken before Mr. Bush by the same afternoon, remanded for a week, and admitted to bail—he was brought up again, and it was adjourned for another week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Those two adjournments were for the prosecutor to attend, and it was adjourned a third time for the Inquest—I have seen the prisoner in a fit this morning—he looked very ill—he keeps a grocer's shop, and is postmaster.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been family doctor at Mr. Pike's seven or eight years—I knew the deceased during that period, but had not attended him—he appeared to enjoy excellent health—on 21st July I was called in to see him, and found him lying on a sofa—he got worse, and I called in Dr. Clutton—he died on 19th July—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi>—the cause of death was an abscess on the brain, which proceeded from the ear, and which was of recent formation—I saw during my attend<lb/>ance that the membrane of the ear was perforated—the abscess might arise from a blow under the ear—I saw nothing in the condition of the brain to account for it, independent of the perforation of the ear—a blow might perforate the membrane, which is generally followed by inflammation—there would be deafness and discharge from the ear, but he might not know that it was perforated—I assume from the perforated membrane that there was disease of the ear, and that would account for the abscess—I found the abscess which I expected. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. From the appearances which presented themselves on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination there was nothing inconsistent with the man having died from natural causes—there was nothing to lead to the conclusion that it resulted from injury inflicted—by perforation I mean the drum of the ear being broken—a person may go through life for many years with a broken drum of the ear and be none the worse, except being a little deaf—I should say there would be a discharge of blood when the perforation took place—I examined him on the Tuesday, and listened to what he said—I found no bruise behind his ear and no marks of violence on his person—I was not surprised at that—a blow behind the ear is likely to cause a fracture of the drum—I did not make a minute examination of the ear at the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi>, that was entrusted to Mr. Clutton—I saw nothing of the inner ear—an abscess is an advanced stage of inflammation—the abscess was set up by disease of the ear—there was nothing inconsistent with the man dying from natural causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I have sworn that he died from the result of an abscess—in my judgment he died from the abscess; that was consistent both with disease of the ear independent of violence, and with violence used behind</p>

               <p>the car—assuming that there was old disease of the car a blow would accelerate it—I do not think it was consistent with a simple blow behind the ear—he had a discharge indicating recent inflamation of the ear.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. I think the abscess had occurred during the last two or three weeks of life, because an old abscess is surrounded by a cyst, and this was not—I attend both the prisoner's and the prosecutor's family.</p>
               <p>— <hi rend="smallCaps">CLUTTON</hi>. I am resident surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination by the Coroner's order—I had never seen the man during life—he died from abscess of the brain, secondary to disease of the ear—it might have been forming from three weeks to two months; I cannot fix a time—you cannot have an abscess in the ear without pain—a blow would not be necessary to produce the abscess, and there was no evidence of any injury—I found a perforated membrane, but that was not caused by violence in my opinion—assuming a blow behind the ear, and finding the abscess, I should not consider the two consistent in this case, because he had disease of the ear—a blow operating on disease of the ear might cause acute inflamation, and that might cause an abscess—it did not surprise me to find the abscess and acute inflammation when I found he had been suffering from deafness, and when I heard that he had had a blow behind the ear—I should rather expect to find it because he had disease of the ear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The disease of the ear was of long standing: I should think from childhood—both ears bore evidence of disease—I am aural surgeon at St. Thomas's—I found nothing in the head or ear inconsistent with his dying from natural causes—in a man with the disease of the ear which he had, all the results which I found might have arisen from an ordinary cold.</p>
