                  </hi>. I am an excavator, and live in Tudor-place, Tot<lb/>tenham-court-road. On Saturday, the 2nd of January, about twelve o'clock at night, I was in the City-road alone, going from my house—I was walking on the footway, with my hands in my breeches-pockets, going to look for a lodging—I met the prisoners—I never saw them before—theywere on the same path that I was—I did not speak to, or even look at them—the prisoner John exclaimed, "Here is a b—Englishman," and hit me in the left eye with his bent fist, and knocked me down—when I was down, the prisoner Michael kicked me in the ribs, and about the left side of my body two or three times very hard, it broke two of my ribs—I knew at the time that something was broken, for something ap<lb/>peared to go off like a popgun in my inside, and I said, when I got up, that my ribs were broken, I was sure they were broken—I cried out "Police," and "Murder," and John said, "Kick him in the month," three or four times—Michael then stepped forward, and made a kick at my head, but he kicked a scraper, my head laid between two scrapers—I saw him kick at me—the scraper broke the force of the kick, it caught me in the right eye and cut my eyelid quite through—it bled, and bled all day Sunday, and Sunday night, and part of Monday constantly—by this time twenty or thirty people came up, who cried, "Police," and the prisoners ran away—assoon as I got up, I went round the corner after them, and met them again—they both made a rush at me, and I went down again—that was not above two minutes after the other time—John was the first to knock me down the second time—I was only struck once—it was a sort of push to get me down, not a blow—nothing was said then—when down I was kicked by both (I am quite sure of that) in the arm and shoulder, and about my body, and they kicked one another in trying to kick me—I can<lb/>not tell how long the second kicking lasted, they kicked me and ran—the whole transaction did not take five minutes—the mob collected, and sung out "Police!" but not one of them attempted to protect me—the pri<lb/>soners ran away—I was picked up—I saw Michael after that, running away in the City road, with a short stick in his hand—I saw them both at the station in about half an hour—I had never had any quarrel with them, and never saw them before—I am universally respected among Irishmen, and likewise among Englishmen—no Irishman ever attempted to ill use me before—Mr. Nott, the surgeon, saw me at the station.</p>

On Saturday night, the 2nd of January, about half-poet twelve o'clock, I was in the City-road, and heard a cry of "Police" close to where I was—I saw the two prisoners run from Tabernacle-row, round the corner into the City-road—I said nothing to them—I saw the prosecutor getting up off the pavement on the oppo<lb/>site side of the street—he called out "Police," and followed them into the City-road—when they found he was following them they made a full stop, and I saw them knock him down—when down I saw the prisoner Michael kick him—John was close to him at the time—I cannot say that he kicked—I heard no words pass—they ran away, and I went and picked the prosecutor up on his legs—he was bleeding from the eye and mouth—he seemed insensible at the moment—I left him, and followed the prisoners, and in three or five minutes I saw John in custody of a policeman—a few minutes afterwards, I saw Michael come out from some place, out of a hiding-place, I fancy—he seized the policeman's staff from him, and knocked the policeman down with if—I did not see Michael taken, but I saw both the prisoners at the station, in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I am confident the prisoners are the men—I never saw them before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and live at No. 12, Great Chapel-street, Westminster; I am single, and live by myself. I first saw the prisoner Fletcher on Friday, the 27th of November—between seven and eight o'clock that evening, I was looking in at a picture-shop in the Strand, at the corner of Southampton-street, and somebody pushed against me—I moved to the other window, and felt the push again from somebody, I did not know who—I did not see Fletcher there—I then went into the City, and on my return home about ten o'clock, through Spring</p>

               <p>Gardens, Fletcher tapped me on the shoulder and demanded 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said if I did not give it him he would instantly charge me with an attempt to commit an unnatural crime—being frightened I gave him the shilling—I did not say any thing—he said before I gave it him, that he wanted it to ride home with to a lady that he lived in the Regent's Park with—he said nothing more after he got it—on Sunday night, the 29th of December, between ten and eleven, I met the two prisoners together in Pall Mall—Fletchersaid, "You are just the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> we want," and then they both asked for something to drink, Fletcher first, and Chittem afterwards, and Chittem said if I did not give it them they should press the charge that Fletcher had persevered in on the Friday, and under the fear and dread of being accused of such a crime, I gave them drink—first of all I tried to take shelter from them by going into a public-house in Duke-street, they came in after me, and after we had got into the parlour they ordered a pot of half-and-half, a glass of rum and water, and two cigars—they left the house first—I staid behind and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the articles—it came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I had no more money in my pocket, and could not pay the demand for the cigars—when I went out I saw nothing of them till I had got across the Park in my way home—when I got into James-street, near Buckingham-gate, Fletcher accosted me and said he wanted 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he was Lord—'s servant, that he was locked out from the barracks, and if be did not have the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he should press the charge against me still—(Chittemwas with him then)—I told him I had no money with me, that if be wanted any he must come round to where I lived—they walked round James-street into Little Chapel-street—Fletcher remained behind there, and Chittem came round to the door—I opened the door and went into my house—I went round the counter, got 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the till, and came round with the intention, if I saw a policeman, of giving them in charge—Idid not see one, and gave Chittem the money—he said nothing, but went away—Fletcher was then in Little Chapel-street, not within sight or hearing—on the 13th of December Fletcher came to my house by himself, and said he wanted 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and when he had got the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he said it was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that he wanted, and not 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him three more shillings, and he went away—on Saturday, the 19th, between nine and ten at night, I was proceeding up Strutton Ground, Westminster, and saw the two pri<lb/>soners—Itried to avoid them by going down Artillery-place, and round into Little Chapel-street home, but when I got into Little Chapel-street Fletcher first of all came up—he called Chittem by the name of <hi rend="italic">Jem,</hi> who then came up, and when they were both together, Fletcher said he wanted a sovereign—I told him I had not got any money—he said he must have it, and if I did not give it him, he would go round to every neighbour in the place and tell them that I was such and such a character—upon that, through the fright and fear of being accused of such a thing as that, I went over to a neighbour, very nearly opposite, and borrowed a sovereign—he lent me a half-sovereign, two half crowns, and the remainder in shillings—Ihad first of all been to my own house, but had not the money—I gave the money to Fletcher in Chittem's sight—Chittem directly said that he wanted a sovereign, for he had had an accident to break the window of his master's carriage, and he must have it—I told him that I had not got it—he said he would press the charge, he would go round as Fletcher bad said and tell the neighbours I was such and such a character—I then went down to a friend of mine in Tothill-street, and borrowed another sovereign—they fol<lb/>lowed</p>

               <p>me—on getting the sovereign I gave it to Chittem, and told him if ever they came down again I should instantly give them in charge, but that was not in Fletcher's hearing—I saw them again on Thursday, the 24th of December, as I was in my shop—they waited about half an hour before any notice was taken of them—I then told my father of what had taken place, and asked him instantly to go out and speak to them—he went out and spoke to Fletcher—I saw him, but did not hear what he said—myfather came in and told me something—they both waited about an hour after that before they went away—I suppose they went because they were tired of waiting any longer—on Monday morning, the 11th of January, the prisoner Fletcher came to my house about eleven—he was very abusive and used a great number of bad words—he said that I was a s—, and that he would not go away from the place till he had given me in charge—I told him he had better go about his business, if he did not I would most as<lb/>suredly give him in charge—he still staid—I sent a girl that was cleaning for me in the house, through the premises of a next door neighbour, to fetch a policeman—she came back and said she could not find one—a friend then went out, saw a policeman, and brought him in—Fletcher pushed open the door, rushed into the parlour, and there he staid bullying and abusing me till the policeman came—I gave him in charge to the police<lb/>man—Chittemwas not there then—he was taken up the same after<lb/>noon, and was brought to Queen-square between four and five—I did not order him to be taken, but Mr. Burrell, the Magistrate, did—I had never seen either of the prisoners before this occurrence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single. I was living with Miss Quinlan, No. 6, Crescent, Minories—On Wednesday, the 6th of January, about noon, the pri<lb/>soner came and asked what apartments we had to let—I showed them to him, and he agreed for the back-parlour and third floor bed-room—my mistress was not in at the time, and I did not ask him for any reference—he wrote something on a piece of paper, which my mistress afterwards gave to the policeman in my presence—this is it—"Mr. Porter, 2nd officer, barque Bolena"—the prisoner said he would go and order his luggage to be brought, and he would return and wait for it—he left, and came back in about half or three-quarters of an hour, and was shown into the back-parlour—after he had been there some time Hancock called with a parcel—heasked for Mr. Porter—(the prisoner had told me his name was Porter)—I showed him into the back-parlour where the prisoner was—Idid not go in—he was there about ten minutes, but I cannot exactly say—Idid not see Hancock go away—about ten minutes after I let him in the prisoner came to the top of the kitchen stairs, called to me, and said, "When that young man comes back say I shall be home in five minutes"—he then went out—I went to the front parlour-window, and saw him crossing the Crescent with a parcel under his arm—I did not look at the parcel which Hancock brought, and cannot say whether it was that—I went into the back-parlour after the prisoner had gone, and there was no parcel there then—he never came back.</p>

On Friday morning, the 8th of January, about eight o'clock, I came down stairs to breakfast, and left the prisoner at his bench in the shop on the ground-floor—in about five minutes I heard the street-door shut—I spoke to Newton, who I had left in the shop, about it—he said it was William—I went up—I found the prisoner—I asked where he had been, and where was the wood he took out—he said he had not taken any—I sent my son for a policeman, and gave him into custody for taking some<lb/>thing out of the shop, I did not know what—about ten o'clock at night, Featherstone brought these pieces of wood, which are called cornice laths—Idid not see them in the shop when I went down to breakfast—they are worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they are unfinished—I have a great many about—I am sure they are ours.</p>

On the 21st of January, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, from information I received, I went out of the shop, and saw the two prisoners, about thirty yards from it, running away together—Ipursued them—I passed King, and followed Birch—he ran up and down several streets—at last he entered a house, ran up stairs, and was con<lb/>cealing himself behind the door when I entered the room, seized him, and he dropped the trowsers at his feet—I took him to the station—he resisted—Ihad a struggle with him—he struck me, and I had a black eye, which I carried for a fortnight.</p>

               <p>street, Camden Town. The younger prisoner was in my service for seven weeks—the other prisoner is her mother, and used to come and visit her—Ilived in Baham-street when she first came to me, and I moved from there to Grove-street while she was there—I discharged her at my present resi<lb/>dence—Ihave known her mother many years, and she brought her to me—hermother stole two sovereigns from me—she assisted her daughter to pack up when I moved—on Sunday morning, the 3rd of January, I said to the daughter, "You will find some money under my pocket handkerchief"—she said, "There is neither money nor a pocket handkerchief"—I said, "Are you certain there is no pocket handkerchief"—she said, "Ma'am, you never brought it home last night"—I said I was certain it was in my cloak pocket last night—she said, "Indeed, Ma'am, you never brought it home"—I went to my trinket-box and missed a silver scent-box—I imme<lb/>diately applied to the constable, and said, "Here are circumstances which must place beyond a doubt that what I have lost must be lost through Mary"—I went to her lodgings and found her there—I said, "Mary, what have you done to my silver scent-box"—she said, "What do you mean, ma'am?"—I said it was at the top of my trinket-box—she said, "I have neither seen your trinket-box nor your silver scent-box"—I said, "You had my keys and the care of all my money, how could you avoid seeing the box?"—she said, "I know nothing about it"—I turned to the officer and said, "Take her before a Magistrate"—a woman in the room said, "Pray don't take her, ma'am, she is related to you"—I afterwards missed the other articles stated, part of which were found at the pawnbroker's—sheaccused the mother, or she would not have been taken.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184102010079"/>
               <p>kindness"—she never reproached me for the example I set her daughter, and say she would inform my husband of it—I understand you—I am of your country, and we are both too passionate, perhaps, you want to frighten me—I sometimes swear a little—I am not at all tenacious—I did not swear when the mother called on me; how could I, when she almost went down on her knees, and said, "I never received so much kindness from any body?"—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. rent for her when she was in distress.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you use an oath, and say you would stab her, or take some other means of <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> for her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, Sir, I am on my oath, such an occurrence never took place—such an expression never passed, not even a tendency to it, never indeed—I did not go to her lodging in Gee's court, Oxford-street, two days after the daughter left ray service—it was the third day—there were two women in the room—I charged her with taking my property—shepositively denied it—Weaver was with me—he did not search the lodging on that occasion, not till the tickets were produced—Mary said, "Positively, I know nothing of your box"—the woman entreated me not to take her—I said, "Constable, do your duty"—the woman said, "Pray, be still a minute, I will produce the ticket of the box," and, going to a shelf or cupboard, she brought down some tickets—I said, "Give me the tickets"—she said, "No, let me get the right ticket"—presently she pro<lb/>duced the ticket of a table-cloth—the constable immediately said, "Give the tickets into my hand, or you will render yourself a party to it"—she gave the two tickets to him—I had not missed the gold locket—the table-cloth I knew was out of my linen chest—the prisoner said, "It is not my doing, it is my mother has done it"—she ran across the room, and got hold of a box—the constable said, "Mary, what have you there?"—she said, "No<lb/>thing belonging to you"—I said, "It is something belonging to me"—the constable <hi rend="italic">capsized</hi> the box, it was turned out, and, among the rest, was a duplicate of a sheet and shift—he did not make any search, but only <hi rend="italic">cap<lb/>sized</hi> her box—I gave Mary leave to go after a place on the 2nd of January, on which day the sheet was pawned—she was not taken into custody on the 3rd, on the 8th I went to apply to the Magistrate for a search<lb/>warrant—hesaid, "Take her into custody"—I said to Weaver, "How do they take people into custody, what will become of her if she is taken?"—he said, "Lock her up"—I said, "Is there a fire and bed for her?"—he said, "There is neither one nor the other"—I said, "Then let it be till to<lb/>morrow"—onthe 9th she said it was not her, but her mother, and the woman in the room said, "I declare it is not Mary; she is honest, but her mother is a thief"—about ten days elapsed from the time I found the prisoner till I took her into custody—I took the mother in her master's shop, in Green-street, Leicester-square, and he said he would not keep her longer, for she was tipsy that night—I get tipsy sometimes, I take a little sometimes, but not to disguise myself—Iam sure my Lord will not allow such impertinent questions; it is illegal, I think, to answer them—I could have had counsel if I wanted them, but I wanted to keep back as much of the accusation against them as I could—that I swear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why did you bring out what was not in the indictment, that the woman stole two sovereigns from you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I did at a moment—Ihave not sworn to that, but decidedly she did doit—there is not a syl<lb/>lable of doubt that she has done it—the younger prisoner said before the Magistrate that she had received these things as presents from me—I never</p>

               <p>gave her any thing but a pair of boots—I never get tipsy—if I was to tell you I did not take any thing, I should be perfectly wrong—I never gave any of the articles to either of the prisoners; is it likely I should go to my trinket-box and give her my property? I—I never heard of her going to be married while in my service—she brought in a silk handkerchief one day; her mother was in the kitchen; I said, "Mary, how came you by this fine silk handkerchief?"—the mother laughed and said, "I suppose Simon, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> or somebody gave it her to hem"—I said, "Who is that?"—she said, "A sweetheart, I suppose"—I never made her any present—I do not know that she ever slept on the sofa while in my service—she slept with me mostly every night, I believe regularly; but in Sahara-street I did not wish to place so much confidence in her—I wished to be a greater stranger to her—she might have slept on the sofa in Baham-street—she did—I think she lived with me in Baham-street five weeks, and a fortnight in Grove-street—Weaver never brought two blankets for her to lay on in Baham-street—he brought one, and he was to sell that to me.</p>

On the evening of the 3rd of February, I was at the Hanover-square Concert-rooms, sitting on one of the benches—I had, in my coat-pocket, a pocket book containing the money and bills of exchange stated—it was quite secure at the time—after I had been in the room a short time, I missed it—I immediately gave no<lb/>tice to the different persons who were near me, and to a policeman, who</p>

We are in the habit of engraving plates for country bank-notes—the note in question is from one of our plates—I should call it an India proof, taken from the genuine plate—it is on India paper—it is usual to take proofs on India paper, in the first in<lb/>stance, for the purpose of proving whether the plate is perfect and finished, and afterwards for the purpose of circulating as specimens among bankers who may want new plates executed, but we always paste them on thick</p>

               <p>"Dear Sir,—I am this morning distracted; nor do I wonder at it, after the transaction that occurred last night; for I know the figure I must cut in your eyes, and I upbraid myself for a want of courage to meet you, from inability to take up the notes before I left London; and the reason is, I was yesterday induced to make several purchases, and pay two or three accounts that I was not called on to pay for the present. I have been thinking that I might be able to raise or borrow the money in London, but on further consideration, I find it is impossible; but what I propose to do is, to give you my bill, at thirty-one days, for the entire amount of what I lost last night, and you may rely on its being regularly met when at matu<lb/>rity. I got the notes from an old school-fellow, in payment of a bet he lost to me at a race in Ireland; and I was yesterday congratulating myself on my good fortune in having met him; but how soon our joy is often turned to sorrow! When I reached my lodging after I left you, to my sur<lb/>prise, I got his letter, cautioning me against using the notes; and he says they are not forgeries, as they are not signed in the name of the managers, nor do they bear dates or numbers of the notes of any similar amount, but that they are the first proofs of the engraver's plates before delivery to the banks. How this is I cannot pretend to say. I can get the money the instant I reach Ireland, but not sooner, as my writing home would alarm my friends, and prevent their remitting it to me. My address is,' Castle-grove,</p>

               <p>County Louth.' Please give the bearer a written answer to this, as I do not wish him to know any thing of the transaction. Should this pro<lb/>posal meet your approbation, I will give you my bill to-night, as I am anxious to go home to-morrow. I remain, dear Sir, in haste, your obe<lb/>dient servant,"<hi rend="smallCaps">RICHARD MOORE</hi>."</p>

It is a house kept for the purpose of play—I am waiter and also an assistant in the house—I know the prisoner—I have seen him at the house on two or three oc<lb/>casions—he played on two occasions—I first saw him there eight or nine days before the 29th of December—I saw him on Monday night, the 28th, about half-past twelve o'clock—I was in the billiard-room when he came—he asked me if there was any play—I said uo—he asked me to go up and play with him—I did so—there was nobody else there—be<lb/>fore we began to play he asked what bank there was, and I showed him 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in Bank of England notes, in the cash-box—that was all the money that was in the bank—we began playing at hazard—he lost 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he paid in 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. country bank-notes—he went away, and returned in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and proposed to play again—we played at hazard—he lost 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he paid in country bank-notes, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and among them was one of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Air. Thompson, who is the pro<lb/>prietor of the house, came into the room while we were playing, and as<lb/>sisted at the table in gathering the counters—he came in during the time he was playing on the first occasion, and was present on the second occasion, but went away after the prisoner left a second time—he was there all the time of the second play—after the second play the prisoner asked, if he went and got some more money, whether we would play with him again—I said it was late, it was past our hour, which is twelve—it was then five or six o'clock in the morning—he went away, returned in about twenty minutes, and I played with him again at hazard—he lost 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the third occasion—he paid it in a bank post bill of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and another for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then went away and did not return again—he lost altogether 525<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I put the notes he had given me into the cash-box with the Bank of Eng<lb/>land notes—there were no country bank notes there before—Mr. Thomp<lb/>son was gone when the prisoner came back the third time, and the house was shut up—I was going to bed, and was partly undressed—I told him it was past hours, and we could not play; but he said he would have satisfaction, he had lost a good deal of money, and I had a right to give him a chance to get it back again, and he produced a pocket-book, and said, "There is money in that;" so we played—I put the whole of the money into the bank—it is a mahogany box—I took it from the box about</p>

               <p>nine o'clock in the morning, when he left, put it into my pocket, went to Mr. Thompson, and gave it to him—I counted it before I gave it to him—it was 525<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in Bank notes besides—I afterwards accompanied Mr. Thompson into the City, to get the notes cashed—Mr. Thompson gave me two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes to take to Masterman's—I believe those now produced to be the same—I presented them, and they were not paid—I waited there about five minutes—I had two other notes, on Glynn's, in my pocket, one for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave them to a gentleman at Masterman's—these notes look like them—I gave them all up to the same person.</p>

On Monday night, the 28th, I was at the rooms, No. 7, Leicester-square, and saw the prisoner and Chappell playing at hazard—they played after I went in for about three-quarters of an hour—the prisoner lost, and I saw him pay country notes—he went out, returned in a short time with a fresh supply of notes, and played again—I played—he lost about 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the second time—he paid that in the same desecrip<lb/>tion of notes, and as he went away I heard him say something about having an 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank post-bill, and he should not be above a quarter of an hour, and would go and fetch it—I did not wait, as it was very late—it must have been some time after four—there bad been 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the bank the night before, in Bank of England notes—in the morning, Chappell re<lb/>turned me that money, and country notes to the amount of 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—two Manchester bank post-bills, one for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the other for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I proceeded, with Chappell, to the City, to get the notes cashed—I went to Mr. Bull's, in Cheapside, and parted with 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes not payable in. town—he</p>

On Friday morning, the 14th of January, in consequence of information, I went there and found a dial had been taken from the theatre of the institution, and a rope from the lower part of the premises, which are occupied by me, and some padlocks from the barriers or avenues through which you pass to the theatre—I also missed two or three glass-holders belonging to the lamps—the clock and padlocks belong to me as one of the members, and the fixtures generally were mine—I had not seen the things for a long time before.</p>

On Friday morning, about twelve, I observed a trap lifted up between the seats in the theatre, which communicates with Mr. Ball's warehouse below—the whole of the house is let to the Institution, but not the ware-house—that is over a stable, and the theatre over that—the theatre is part of the house, but there is no internal communication between the stable or warehouse and the house—the trap-door is never used, indeed I never knew there was one there—it fastens underneath by two bolts—there is a separate entrance to the warehouse and stable—we have nothing to do with them—I missed the clock and other articles, which I had seen safe on the Thursday morning—the parties must have entered by the trap-door—I found no mark of an entry in any other place—the secretary, Mr. Wil<lb/>liam Holl, and his family live and sleep on the premises—he has the second and third floors—he has nothing to do with the rest of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Smith-street, Birmingham, next door to the prisoner, who is a tailor. Our families were acquainted—he sometimes came to my house, and I some<lb/>times went to his—I am married, and have no children—he is also married, and has one child, which has died since this—on the 30th of December I received a letter, which I have here—I do not know whose hand-writing it is—in consequence of that letter I went to Wolverhampton, which is about twelve miles from Birmingham—I did not find the person I expected, and who I supposed to be the writer of the letter—I went away from home at a little before eight o'clock in the morning, and returned a little after four in the afternoon—I then found almost all my furniture gone, and my wife also—there was nobody in the house—I went into the prisoner's house, and found he was not there—I got information, and between eleven and twelve, that same night, went to Messrs. Pickford's, the carriers, in Birmingham, and found my property there, all packed up, and directed to "Thomas Wood, London, to be left till called for"—I saw articles among them, which I knew to belong to the prisoner—there was a bureau bedstead of his, and a bed of mine inside it, and other things mixed in the same</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184102010111"/>
               <p>way—on the following morning I started by the train from Birmingham, and when I got to Hampton, about ten miles from Birmingham, as I got out of the train there, I saw the prisoner just coming down from Hampton with a young man—I collared him and accused him of stealing my pro<lb/>perty, and running away with my wife—he said he had nothing at all to do with it, and knew nothing about it—I gave him in charge—he was taken before a Magistrate at Birmingham, but having no evidence to support the charge he was dismissed—I then went to the station to stop the property from going to London, but it was gone—I came up to London that even<lb/>ing by the train—I arrived here on the 2nd of January, and went directly to Pick ford's warehouses in the City-road—I found that my goods had all arrived there—I got an officer, and went with him on the Monday morning to Pickford's—I found my goods still there, and while I was inquiring about them my wife came in—I came out soon after, and found the pri<lb/>soner in a street just outside the warehouse, walking backwards and forwards—I pointed him out to the officer, who took him—I then examined the property at Pickford's, and found the articles stated, which are my property, and other things belonging to the prisoner—a fender and fire-irons of mine were paeked up in a sofa of his—a chair and basket of mine were packed up with two chairs of his—the things were intermixed in that way—the parcels were all directed, "Mr. Thomas Wood, London, to be left till called for"—both his goods and mine—the knives were wrapped in a parcel directed to "Mr. Wall"—I work at my own house in a shop adjoining—some things might have been taken a day or two before and I not miss them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you believe in the book you are sworn on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I do believe in the authenticity of this book—if I belonged to a society, five or six years back, what has that to do with it?—I do not belong to any society now—I never denied the Scriptures in my life—I never said I did not believe God would be so foolish as to entrust a poor weak man to write such nonsense as is in the Bible—when I went into your house, after missing my furniture, I saw your wife, and asked if she knew any thing of my furniture, as the house was nearly stripped—she said she knew nothing at all of it, and she came in, and seemed com<lb/>pletely struck—I asked if she knew where my wife was—she said, "She is gone out to tea, I believe"—I went to where I thought she was, but she was not there—I returned, and told her, and then she said she had missed you all day—I asked the Magistrate to remand you till I could seek for evidence to prove you had something to do with it—the Magis<lb/>trate told me to go into a private room to search my wife, to see if she had any thing in her possession, and when I came out I did not see you again—I understood you were liberated—you were not taken into any room to be searched to my knowledge—you were searched in a room in my presence, but not in a private room—I do not remember seeing any ring—the officer took 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from your pocket, and he said, "Give the poor devil that, that is all he has got," and he gave you the money back—the officer did not come before the Magistrate with the things found on you and ask me to identify them, to my knowledge—nothing was found on you that I identified.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate tell you you had better go to Pickford's, and take your goods, and you consented to it, and I was discharged? <hi rend="italic">A. I</hi> did not</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carter at Birmingham. On the 31st of De<lb/>cember, I went to Mr. George's house with my cart, and got several boxes and goods from there—the prisoner and Mrs. George gave them to me—while the cart was being loaded a policeman went by, and then they shut the door—after he had passed it was opened again, and I was ordered to go on—I took the goods to Taylor's warehouse, in Warwick-street—Mrs. George and the prisoner ordered me there—they were both present—I left them there—the prisoner came there just as I had unloaded the cart, and gave me 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get some drink, which he said was all the money he had got—William Taylor and Thomas Hill went with the cart that day—I saw the prisoner put "No. 27" on one of the packages—nobody else was doing any thing with them while I was there—they were afterwards removed in our van to the railway station, to Pickford's warehouses—the prisoner ordered me to take them there, and he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get some ale—I went to a public-house in Canal-street, and was to wait there till he came to us—I waited about half an hour; he then came with a clothes-horse in his hand, which was put with the rest of the things when they were unloaded at Pickford's—the prisoner told me to take them there, and he asked the clerk when they would go—I believe they said at half-past one o'clock—this was about seven—there were twenty-seven lots numbered, and he asked Pickford's clerk to make a ticket, No. 28, for the clothes-horse—I cannot read, and do not know the direction.</p>

Some of these things were left at my mother's house a short time—the prisoner helped to load the cart with the goods—I do not remember who fetched the cart—I saw him first at his own house on the Monday night—on the Thursday morning I saw him by the side of the chapel, about half a mile from Mr. George's—he told us to stop till he came and met us—our cart was not loaded then—he asked why we did not bring more help—we had the cart with us—he fetched more help, came back, and told us to go on to Mr. George's house, which we did—he did not go with me—I got the things loaded there, and took them down into our yard—the prisoner afterwards came down there with a clothes-horse—I believe the young roan who helped to load had that—at night the things were taken from my mother's to the station, the prisoner carried the clothes-horse to the station, and asked the book-keeper to make him a ticket for that as high as twenty-eight—there were twenty-seven packages besides the clothes-horse—I have been to Pick-ford's, in the City-road, and seen the twenty-seven packages—the pri<lb/>soner said in reference to a chest-of drawers, "Please to mind and not</p>

I have been looking for you a long time"—you told us to go to the public-house and have something to drink—I have not had any thing given me to tell this tale—I have not been bribed to tell it—nobody has made it up for me—I am sure I heard you say to Pickford's man, "Please make me a ticket for this, No. 28"—I was standing at the top of the stage at the time when you were having the things booked—I am sure you were there at the time—directly you had all the goods booked, you went off saying, "You can go and get something with that sixpence."</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother, who keeps the Sun public-house in Clement's-inn, foregate. On Sunday night, about half-past eleven o'clock, I observed seven or eight persons drinking at the bar—my attention was directed to them particularly—two or three left together, then returned again, and then they went away, leaving one behind—in conse<lb/>quence of something I heard, I went out to Mr. Ptarse's after the last one left the bar—I saw the shop-door on the jar—I ran to the door and laid hold of the handle, and as I pulled from the outside, I fancied somebody was pulling from the inside—I kept my hold about five minutes—Slade, a policeman, came—I told him to hold the door while I got assistance—we afterwards went in, and found the prisoner in the shop—he was one of those who had been drinking in my house—next morning I saw a crow-bar produced.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a buyer of hosiery for Messrs. Morrisson, of Fore-street. I made some purchases of Mr. Cotton, a hosier in Notting<lb/>ham, and on the 22nd of December I received five hampers in Milton-street, near Fore-street—they contained from 80 to 130 dozen pairs of stockings each—there was no invoice with them—that came by post—the hampers were numbered—among them was one No. 29—it ought to have contained 52 dozen of No. 7, and 69 dozen of No. 8, of women's cotton stockings—there was a deficiency of three dozen in the paper marked No. 8—the woven mark on the stockings was No. 300—I did not ascertain the quantity that was in the hamper till after the policeman came, which was, I should think, about the 25th or 26th of December—I can undertake to swear that the hamper was in the same state when I looked at it as when it came to our house—the hampers were removed, but none of the goods removed from them—these articles were at the top of the hamper, under the lid.</p>

Person's—I saw them on the 18th, and they were in good condition—it was part of my business to remark if the packages were disturbed, and I should have marked it in the way-bill—these hampers were sent round to what we call the order warehouses on the 19th—on the 18th they remained on what is called the receiving bank, which is a raised part for goods—the prisoner was in the employ of Messrs. Pickford in the up side, in which things come from the country—those goods which are to be delivered in town are put into the wagon, and the others in the order warehouse—it would be the prisoner's duty to have them sent there, and</p>
               <p>he had access to the warehouse.</p>

I saw the prisoner and two others in company—in consequence of something I observed, I went up to the prisoner—he seemed confused—he had a bundle under his arm—I stopped him, and the other two made off in the direction of Oxford-street—I asked the pri<lb/>soner what he had got—he said, two coats, which were his own, and had been so for six months; and if I would go to Pitman's-buildings his wife would prove it—I produce the coats—they are old, and appear to have been worn by some gentleman, being of a superior make—one of them is a frock-coat, and the other a close body-coat—I took him to the station, and in his trow<lb/>sers I found this packet of stockings—I said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "They are stockings"—I said, "Is it any use going to your wife?"—he said, "No—she knows nothing at all about it—I found them"—in going to Hatton-garden on the Monday, he said he picked the bundle up in St. Luke's churchyard on Saturday night, the coats tied in a hand<lb/>kerchief, and the stockings tied at the top of the bundle—Saturday night was wet and sloppy, and the bundle was quite clean—I found on him two knives and some papers belonging to Mr. Fickford, which led me to make inquiries.</p>

I accompanied Roscoe to the prisoner's residence—the door was shut when we arrived—Roscoe knocked, and it was opened by the prisoner—it did not appear to be fastened more than the ordinary lock—on opening the door we entered, and Roscoe said. "Well, Taylor, what are you about?"—Taylor replied that he was asleep—he said, "You will find no<lb/>thing here, I have got none by me, and don't mean to have any more"—Roscoe commenced searching under the stairs, and I noticed the prisoner apparently throw something into the fire—I said to Roscoe, "He is throwing something into the fire"—Roscoe immediately left he place he was searching, and began raking the fire out with an old file—there was nothing found in the fire—it was bright—he then raked behind the fire, where there was a quantity of cinders and rubbish on a ledge, and turned up a small bundle wrapped in dirty rags—I produce the contents of it, which are, a pipkin, containing some white metal, with a counterfeit shilling in the metal, as if it had been thrown in when the metal was soft—it is fixed; and in the pipkin there were also thirteen counterfeit shillings, and three plaster moulds—on these being found, the prisoner knocked at the next house, and said, <hi rend="italic">"Johnny,</hi> come in, the police are here, and have found two pairs of moulds"—he said, "The officers are here, and have found two pairs of moulds, but, so help me God, I know nothing about them; God strike me dead if I do"—I am not aware that he men<lb/>tioned the name of either of the officers in calling to the person—I knew him before—I partly searched him—his pockets were turned out—I found nothing—he had his shoes off then—I remained in the room till he was taken away—he put on his shoes when he left—I was present when he was searched at the sfation, and saw three counterfeit shillings found in his shoes.</p>

On the 25th of January I left the house, about half-past four o'clock, with my cousin, leaving nobody in the house—I shut the street-door, and am quite sure it was fastened—I returned between nine and half-past, after Mr. Martinelli, and missed three gold rings, four sovereigns, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, a small-box, a dress, two shawls, a pencil-case, and two handkerchiefs.</p>

On the night of the 25th of January, I was coming home about ten minutes before seven o'clock, and saw three young men near Mr. Martinelli's house, whispering together—I passed them, and spoke to Churchill, who returned with me, and then I saw the same three young men come out of Martinelli's house—Churchill ran after the prisoner, who was one of them, and took him—two of the three had bun<lb/>dles, the other had not—the prisoner had a bundle—I went, and called a policeman—I pointed out the direction in which the young men had run, and he picked up a bundle down a street at the corner of Martinelli's house.</p>

On Wednesday, the 20th of January, in the evening, I was going to my employer's in the London-road—I was going up Duke-street, and as I came on the opposite side to No. 3, I saw Edwards and another man come out of Mrs. White's house—Edwards had a bundle—they left the street-door wide open—I saw some others lurking about outside, and fol<lb/>lowed them—they were three suspicious characters, as I considered—I saw three standing near the spot, besides the two who came out—they were doing nothing, but standing close on the spot—Edwards and the other walked down Duke-street, and I followed them, leaving the three men where they were standing—Mrs. White is no acquaintance of mine, but I live in the same street—I could see into the house, and could see nobody but the men who came out—I knew they did not live there, as nobody but Mrs. White lives there—about the middle of Duke-street they parted, Edwards walked sharply away, and turned the corner into Webber-row towards Waterloo-road, and at the corner of Waterloo-road I laid hold of his collar, and said, "Come back"—he made a stop, and I thought he seemed to put himself in an attitude of defence—I put my hand into my pocket, and said, "If you play any tricks with me, I will shoot you on the spot"—I had nothing to shoot him with—he said nothing, but walked quietly back with me to Mrs. White's—the bundle turned out to be a clock—he had it with him—I sent for Mrs. White, who came—I asked if she had lost any thing—she</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Great Charlotte-street, Blackfriars-road—the prisoner, Francis Chamberlain, was my shopman. On the 6th of January, I saw him give his father a brass fender, and my attention was called to the articles stated, which I missed—I went to the house of the elder prisoner at half-past ten o'clock that night—I knocked at the door—he was in bed—I rung the bell—he kept me waiting some time at the door—at last he came—I then said, "Oh, Mr. Chamberlain, I have called for a brass fender, if you please—he looked at me some time but said nothing—I said again that I had come for a brass fender—he denied having one—he then asked me in and said, "How is this, where is Fran<lb/>cis?"—Isaid, "Never mind, I want a brass fender, a pair of trowsers, and a piece of cotton, which you have had away from my house to<lb/>night, and I won't lose sight of you till I have them"—he said they were not there—he then said, "Come along up stairs, and I will see about it"—he took me up and down two or three different times—I said, "It is no use running about in this manner, if you don't give me my property directly I will smash one of the windows and call for a policeman"—he said, "Don't do that, there is no occasion for that, I will give them you"—he then took me down stairs into a back yard and I said, "There is your fender, take it"—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am partner with Mr. Charles Knight. We are pub<lb/>lishers, carrying on business in Ludgate-street—we have a warehouse in Cornwall-road, Lambeth—Kingate has been in our service, as warehouse<lb/>man and porter, upwards of two years—he was employed great part of his time at the warehouse in Cornwall-road—we have a very large quantity of publications there in quires, and amongst the rest, nearly the whole of the stock of the Penny Cyclopæedia—there is a particularly large number of sur<lb/>plus volumes of Nos 1 and 16 of that work—up to the 31st of December Mr. How had the entire superintendence of the property at the warehouse in Cornwall-road—he then left, and went into business with another gentle<lb/>man in Fleet-street—in July last Mr. How directed Kingate to take stock at the warehouse, in conjunction with another person from the house in Ludgate-street—Kingate must have known then that there was a large sur<lb/>plus of Nos. 1 and 16 of the Penny Cyclopædia there—I believe he did not know it before—a person, named Durrant, slept on the premises at the warehouse, and had the charge of the premises at night—I saw about 9cwt. of paper at Union-hall, which is our property—it had never been sold, nor made up for sale—it was part of the stock from our warehouse, and is in sheets, as we keep our stock there—we are the sole publishers and proprietors of the Penny Cyclopædia—I never authorised either of the prisoners to sell any portion of it—Kingate was discharged on the 5th of December—I gave him warning a fortnight before—I had not at that time found out that any felony had been committed by him—neither of the pri<lb/>soners had any authority to sell any waste paper of any kind.</p>

I am in partnership with Mr. Young—I saw some of our Penny Cyclopædia at Mr. Pegg's, a stationer, in Upper Ground-street—heis a purchaser of materials for paper-making—he buys ropes and waste paper—I went with the offiecr there on the 23rd of December, and found ten luindles of paper there—I think about five or six cwt.—the</p>

Q.</hi> Did you see Mr. Pegg? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was exceed<lb/>ingly willing to show every thing—we traced from Mr. Hatherwgy, that Mr. Pegg had sold some to him—Mr. Pegg was taken as a witness on the part of the prosecution, and examined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JEREMIAH</hi> How. I am a partner with Mr. Parsons—we are publishers in Fleet-street—I was the superintendent at Mr. Knight's, till the end of December—I had the control of their warehouse in the Cornwall-road—Kingatewas in the prosecutor's employ, and was principally at the ware-house—in July last, it became desirable to take stock there, and Kingate was employed to do it—that would enable him to ascertain the number of volumes of the Penny Cyclopaedia which were there—the whole stock went under his eye—I do not know that it was removed at all, but it must have been referred to, to ascertain the quantity—Denny was recommended to us by Kingate, as we wanted assistance about the spring of last year—I knew him by sight before, but had not employed him—he was employed occasionally, and paid by the day—I authorized his being engaged, and he went to assist Kingate at the warehouse, or at the house in Ludgate-street, but not without my authority—Kingate had no authority to aet him on, either at the warehouse or at Ludgate-street, without receiving orders from me—Denny continued as an occasional servant up to the time of his appre<lb/>hension.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever find Denny where you did not expect to find him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, once at the warehouse in Cornwall-road—Kingate was at work there at the time—I complained to Kingate, and to the shopman who paid Denny, for employing Denny there without my orders—I asked Denny how he came there, he said Kingate had employed him—I told Kingate he had no right to have him there, as he well knew, without my authority, and I sent Denny away—I never authorized either of the prisoners to sell waste paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it at the house in Ludgate-street that you desired Denny to go away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, at the warehouse, I am quite sure—on another occasion I sent him away from Ludgate-street—after that I sanctioned his services, when he was wanted—there is a person named Wakefield in the prosecutor's service—he is shopman at Lndgate-street—I never heard him say that he had promised Denny a job the first opportu<lb/>nity, and from that Denny was employed—Kingite ought to have gone to the house in Ludgate-street every day, and then to have come to the ware-house, but on magazine days, and busy times, he was kept at the house—when stock was taken, opportunity was given to Kingate to see the publi<lb/>cations at the warehouse—no person was employed in that but Kingate, and Denny when he assisted him—the general stock of the house was kept there—there are three or four printers and persons employed there, but not in the warehouse part.</p>

               <p>taken from the warehouse without the knowledge of Kingate, from the opportunities he had of being employed there—the 5th of December was not a magazine night—it was the duty of Kingate to have been at the warehouse till he was discharged that day, and he was there the whole day I know—that was the day he left—if on that day five or six cwt. of paper was taken away, it could not have gone without his knowledge—it was on Saturday—Kingate was there till the evening—I know he was there till after five o'clock, because I sent a messenger to him about five o'clock.</p>

Knight and Young, and live on the premises where their warehouse is—I have the care of the keys of the warehouse after the persons engaged in the service leave it—I remain on the premises there, unless I have occasion to go to Ludgate-street or elsewhere—Kingate generally came about half-past nine, or from that to eleven o'clock—it was my practice to deliver the keys to him there, and I received them from him in the evening—the usual time of leaving was at dusk—the binder's men usually opened the gate, and it was my duty to see that it was fastened—there is a large pair of gates, which it is not usual to open except for carts—I have seen the property which is sworn to as Messrs. Knight and Young's—I am certain that could not have left the premises by the smaller gate without my atten<lb/>tion being called to it—the keys of the warehouse would remain in Kin<lb/>gate's possession from the time I gave them to him in the morning till he left in the evening—I was not employed in the warehouse, but in ao en<lb/>tirely different part of the premises—I had nothing to do with the ware-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Pegg, in Upper Ground-street, Blackfriars-road. I was so in December last—I have known the prisoner Denny since last May, I think—I became acquainted with him by his bringing waste paper to sell at Mr. Pegg's—before he brought any, he came and asked me if we bought waste paper, and what we gave for it—Isaid we could not tell till we saw it, and then he brought us a bundle—Ido not recollect any other conversation—he came to us on the 5th of December, about half-past five or six o'clock in the evening with another man, and brought with him some paper as he was in the habit of bringing—<hi rend="italic">bebrought some of the Penny Cyclopaedia—I do not know whether</hi> there was any other sort—I believe there was some of the Bible—he brought then 4cwt. 2qrs. 14lbs. —I weighed it—it was in the state that these bundles are—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I cannot distinguish which of these bundles it was—it was in this state in quires—it has not even been stitched for the purpose of being sold—we gave him 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt., and that lot on the 5th of December came to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him at first where he came from, and he told us from Messrs.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> who was the person with Denny on the 5th of December? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it to be Kingate, to the best of my knowledge—I have no doubt—Ibelieve it to be him, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first went before the Magistrate, was Denny in custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I was asked if I knew the other person—I was asked to pick him out of the crowd—he was standing in the audience of the hall of the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> were you brought up a second time before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Kingatewas at that time in custody with Denny—l was asked some question by the Magistrate—the two person. who came to my master on the 5th of December came together—the person who came with Denny brought in one bundle of paper, and then went out again—I did not look outside to see if he came in a cart or with a truck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in the service of Mr. Pegg? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four years and a half—I was not aware when I went to the police Court that my attention would be drawn to some person there—the Magistrate told me to go round the Court and see if I could find the man—I went round the Court, so as to give myself an opportunity of seeing the persons that were there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you then tell the Magistrate that you saw nobody there that you recognise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did say so at first, but I did not see all the persons in the Court then—my attention was again directed to the persons by the Magistrate—I walked round again, and then I picked out Knight—I said that I picked him out because he seemed to be the most likely person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the 5th of December, was Mr. Pegg in the way when these things were brought? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was passing through the shop—he saw Denny—Ibelieve he did not see the other man—I saw the other man then, and I had seen him on the night before—I only saw him on those two occasions—Mr. Pegg was not in the way when the man came the night before—Mr. Pegg drew the cheque on the 5th of December—I took it up to him, and brought it down to Denny—the other man was then gone—it was dark—the gas was lighted—the other man was no longer in the shop that night than he was the night before—I heared Denny make was examined—he was noit examined on oath the first time, but he was the second time, for the procecution—I saw my master last Monday week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> were you not asked by the Magistrate whether you should have known the man you picked out if you had not him in the street, and did you not say no? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said I did not know that I should—perhaps if I was looking after him I should—Mr. Pegg deals largly in waste paper— publicationsthet don't sell are often brought in this state for sale, and law books amongst others.</p>

Young, about twelve months—I never received any paper from him to dispose of—the paper I took to Mr. Pegg was delivered to me at different times by a man who had an open green cart and a grey bone—he came to me at my house the first time, about four months ago—I do not know his name, nor where he lived—he said he understood I was out of work—I said I was—he said if I would meet him in the after<lb/>noon about four o'clock, at the corner of Rennet-street, to take a load to Mr. Pegg's, he would give me the job—I went, and he gave me several bundles of paper wrapped up in brown paper—he told me to take them to Mr. Pegg's—I did so—they were weighed and 1 was paid for them—I gave the money to that man—he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a part of a pint of ale—I have been so employed by that man about twenty times—he used to ap<lb/>point a time for me to meet him again before we parted, or he used to call at my house—he always paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—I should know that man again—I was aware it was the Penny Cyclopaedia, and said it was Knight's work—the man never told me where he got it or any thing about it.

Knight and Co.—I bought it and sold it as waste-paper—I never saw the prisoner Kingate in the transaction—I sold a quantity to Mr. Hathaway of the same—Denny told me he brought it from Messrs. Knight's, and I bought it believing he was sent directly by them, and I offered to send my horse and cart if there was any quantity of it.'"</p>
               <p>"Wednesday, Dec. 30, 1840. Thomas Alliston, servant to Mr. Pegg, on his oath, says, 'I believe the prisoner Kingate to be the person who came twice with Denny, and brought paper to my master's house; the last time was on the 5th of December; I identified him this day, whilst stand<lb/>ing with others in this public Court.'</p>

               <p>"William Pegg says," I never saw Kingate; I saw Denny several times; he told me he was sent by Mr. Knight's foreman to sell it; I told him, if there was a quantity, I would rathers end mo horse and cart, and give a cheque for it. He said he would speak to the foreman. When I saw him again, he told me that the foreman wanted the paper out of the way. My boy could buy paper, and it might not nppear entered in my</p>

The greatest quantity brought to me at one time was 200lbs.; it was all brought by Denny; I know nothing of Kingate; I pur<lb/>chased above 30 cwt.; it came in a bookbinder's bag, and always in the day-time.'</p>
               <p>"Thomas Alliston further says," The greatest quantity I bought from the prisoner Denny at one time was 200lbs. '"</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When Kingate was brought up on the day he was identified, was he in the first instance put as a person accused, by the side of Denny? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt they were both put into the slip, or place which we call the dock, in the first instance—he was afterwards taken out from there, and put amongst the persons in the Court, to be identified, and the witness was ordered out of Court, when he was taken out of the dock and mixed with the people, and then the witness was to go and find him.</p>
