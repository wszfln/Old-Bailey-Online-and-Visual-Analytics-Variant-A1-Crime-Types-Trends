               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How was he disguised? A. When I saw him he had no coat on, but when I took him he had, and his hat was over his eyes. I think he had a hat on when I first saw him.</p>

I proceeded to the shop, which is part of the dwelling-house, and found the things in great confusion; I missed the articles enumerated in the indictment - they are worth above 30l. I found some implements of house-breaking in the kitchen and garden; my son was the last person up the night before. All was safe at ten o'clock, when I went to bed.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I secured the house at ten o'clock at night - it was dark then. A little after two o'clock in the morning I heard a noise of some persons walking in the lower part of the house - it was not light. I gave an alarm, and then heard persons escaping; there is a light fence on the top of the garden wall, and the rails broke as they got over them; I looked out of window, but it was not light enough to see them - from the noise they made I am sure there was more than one person. I called out of window Stop thief. The two bolts which secured the kitchen window were forced back, and the window open. The property stated was all taken away - it was safe the night before.</p>

I heard Read cry Stop thief! and in two minutes I saw two men running down Philpot-street, as hard as they could - that street leads from behind the premises to the back of the London Infirmary - I pursued, springing my rattle; I could not catch the first man, but took the second, which was the prisoner; I took him half way up Storey-street - he had this cloth round his body, and a new great coat on.

I walked on - then one came and jumped on my back - he did not throw me down; I screamed out, and one clapped his hand on my mouth - then another took hold of my pinafore, and shook the money out of it - he tore the pinafore. The money fell out on the ground; they picked it up, and ran away with it. A gentleman brought the prisoner to me while I was going home - I cannot say whether he was one of them; I cannot speak to any of them. I did not pick up any of the money myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The boy could not jump heavy on your back - he did not throw you down? A. No. I did not shake the half-pence out - it was between seven and eight o'clock, and quite light - I have got 2s. 3d. back since.</p>

I went on, and when I got about a hundred yards I heard a scream; I got up on the clay, looked on the hill, and saw three or four boys round this child; the prisoner had got hold of her by the shoulders - another had his hand over her mouth - another, who was before her, took her pinafore and tore it; I saw the half-pence drop out - she ran away. I saw them picking the money up, and they all ran away. I ran towards the prisoner, who had held her by the shoulders, and took him - he dropped some halfpence from his hand before I got up to him. I took him to the girl's father, and sent for an officer. I returned to the spot, and picked up 9d. where I had seen him drop part of the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner had his hands on her shoulders? A. Yes. They picked the halfpence up before they ran away. I was about thirty yards off.</p>

            . I am a chimney-sweeper, and live with my father, in John-street, Tottenham-court-road. I have known the prisoner a long time, by his selling dog's meat about. On Sunday afternoon, the 14th of May, about half-past five o'clock, he came to our house with this horse in a halter, and offered him for sale to my father, and said he would leave it on trial for two days, and if he liked it he was to give 8l. for it - he only asked that, and said he had given six guineas for it that day; I put it into our stable, and next morning rode it to Notting-hill, to try it - Milton stopped me in Oxford-street with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you known him? A. A long time - he knew I could find him, and I found him at his work when I was stopped with the horse - I knew he occasionally jobbed in horses; we told him we should ride it to Notting-hill and Hammersmith, to try it; he did not object to that.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You missed them on Saturday, the 10th, and saw the heads on Tuesday? A. Yes. Graziers generally mark their sheep with ochre- I believe we are the only persons who mark them round the eye - I will not swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen other heads with this mark round the right eye should you have claimed them? A. Yes. They were found about a mile and a quarter from where I live. I do not know the prisoner - he lived in a cottage by the side of this cut, and about one hundred yards from where the skins were found.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What mark is on the skins? A. The two strokes down the off side; I made them myself - on the Wednesday before they were stolen; the mark round the eye is done with wet ochre; I did it myself, and believe it to be my own mark, and on the skin also; the water has washed it out a little, but it is visible.</p>

On Monday, the 12th, I went with the prisoner's landlord, Mr. Saunders, of Kensal-green, on the Harrow-road, and in consequence of what he said I went to a cottage there, close by the Paddington canal side - the cottage was fastened up, and on the back door I observed the print of a hand with bloody finger marks, and on the privy floor I saw a bloody foot mark. I went to the back door, and perceiving a very bad smell come from the house I endeavoured to get in that way; I forced a window up and got in, and in that back room, hanging on the mantel-piece, were the plucks of three lambs and two sheep, and on the hearth were the heads of three lambs and two sheep - part of paunch and a quantity of fat in the cupboard; there was no furniture in the cottage - it did not appear to have been occupied; there was a quantity of blood on the floor, as if sheep had been slaughtered there. I let every thing remain in the state I found it, fastened the door, and went to the office. I got a warrant against the prisoner, and was out with Webster till three o'clock on Tuesday morning, by the house, but he never came near - he was apprehended next morning about eleven; Webster brought the prisoner and the heads to the office.</p>

I had only seen the prisoner at the cottage once, that was on the Monday after the 2d of June - he had no furniture there - I only saw some parcels - he never lived there; he said he took it for his wife and two children. - I asked him on the 2d of June for a reference; the person he sent me to did not know him. When I saw him at the cottage there were some parcels there, but I did not go in- I thought he had received them by the canal boat; he sent them away by the errand cart.

I went at nine o'clock on the morning of the 13th, and left about eleven, leaving a person to watch; he fetched me, and when I got within a hundred yards of the cottage I saw the prisonner peeping round the corner of the house, as if to see if he was being noticed; I kept on the opposite side of the road, crossed over, and collared him; I told him to consider himself my prisoner, for I had a warrant against him for felony - he made no answer; I asked him what he had got in the cottage; he answered nothing at all; I said,"Are you sure you have got nothing at all?" he said nothing but some knives and hooks; I said, "Then what have you done with the heads and plucks that were there- have you flung them in the water?" he said No, he had tied them up in a basket, and they were outside the house- I asked for the key of the cottage - he asked me to take it out of his right hand pocket, which I did; we unlocked the door, went in, and found two knives, some books, and a piece of wood, which I believe they use to hang sheep on - there is a hole in it for the hook - it is a little bloody. I went outside the house, and found the heads and plucks in a basket, tied up in a small bag, with a quantity of fat; I asked what he was going to do with them - he said he was going to take them away; I asked if he was married, and where he lived - he declined answering till he got to some other place. Saunders and I had before that found part of the sheep's guts in the canal, which is about six yards from his cottage; we brought him to town with the basket - Saunders took the skins off the lambs' heads, with the mark round the eye - I produce them.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Coppicerow, Clerkenwell. I have dealt once or twice with the prisoner. Last Friday or Saturday week I sold him ten sheeps heads and plucks - he had bought such things three or four times; I only knew him by his passing. I bake heads and plucks of an evening. He was passing by, and I asked if I had anything to suit him, and sold him these.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you sent for to Marlborough-street? A. No; I do not know where the prisoner lived, and did not know him by name; I thought he kept a sheep's head shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you ever seen sheep marked with a red spot round the eye? A. Very often - it is not uncommon; I think I could produce one or two heads from my shop now with the same mark. I buy about sixty sheeps' heads every week. I have lived at No. 6, Coppice-row, four years.</p>

            . On the 10th of April, about eight o'clock in the morning, Mr. Rush gave me a 10l. note at our private house; I put it into my pocket-book, and came to town in the gig; the prisoner rode post to town; the pocket-book was safe when I was in Berner-street; I had it in my pocket; I took it out in Berner-street, to put a bill into it, and cannot say whether I then returned it to my pocket, or put it into my muff; I kept my muff in my hand; the prisoner was by the side of the gig. I got into a shop on Ludgate-hill, about two o'clock, and missed the pocket-book and note. I have not seen them since.</p>
               <p>Mr. RUSH. Mrs. RUSH came and informed me of her loss, and on the 22d of May the prisoner was going to leave my service, having had notice before; on my going to town on the 22d I told him I wanted information about a watch and seals which I had seen in his possession a few days after the 10th of April, and said I suspected he had got the note which Mrs. Rush had lost - he said, "Oh! Sir, I hope you don't suspect me;" he said he had got the watch from one Button, who lived on Snow-hill; he was in the chaise with me, and soon afterwards said Button lived in Hatton-court, Snow-hill; between twelve and one o'clock that day I went to Snow-hill, but could find no Button, nor any Hatton-court - he drove me home that afternoon - I called him in, and asked how he could deceive me in saying Button lived in Hatton-court; he then said he had told me Cock-court, and would put the horse in the chaise and drive me up to the man immediately; I told him to stop at home - I drove to Cock-court, and inquired at every house in the place, but could find no Button. In consequence of what Winsled told me I went home with a constable; I told the prisoner I would forgive him if he would confess having the note; he told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220007"/>I could not compel him to confess, and he would say nothing; he left my service that night; I had asked him to let me see the watch and seals, which he did, and I refused to return them till he gave me an account where he got them. I traced the watch next day to Mr. Frodsham. He called for the watch three days afterwards - Mr. Frodsham was present, and he said he had paid Mr. Frodsham a 10l. note for it.</p>

On Tuesday, the 11th of April, I received from Larkman a square brown paper parcel, tied up and directed to Robinson and Co., Birmingham - he told me it was worth 535l. - I put it into an inside seat of the coach, (I cannot tell which) for safety - it goes from the Spread Eagle to the Bull and Mouth - it was missed on the road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe some persons were cruel enough to suspect that you did not put it into the seat at all? A. A great many were cruel enough against me; the prosecutors had me apprehended- I was in gaol for a fortnight at Birmingham, and was then brought to town; I swear that I put it inside the seat - I saw Foyle at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Have you always said you saw it inside the coach? A. Yes; it was missed down at Birmingham, and I was put into gaol next day.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at King Norton, Worcestershire. On the 11th of April I got into the Birmingham coach at the Bull and Mouth; the prisoner and a gentleman were inside when I got in - the prisoner was dressed very shabbily in black, which fixed my attention on him - I am certain of him - I noticed him as I had property about me; I merely asked him how far he was going - he said to Stoney Stratford - I asked afterwards if he lived there - he said No, he was only going there for a few days; the coach stopped in Market-street, Bedfordshire, to supper - it is about thirty miles off - I got out first, the other gentleman next, and then the prisoner - we had taken up a female at Islington, and put her down be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220008"/>fore we got to Market-street; I took some refreshment, but did not observe the prisoner till I had nearly done supper - he got into the coach with us again - I was the first who got in.

            . I keep the Bell inn, in Market-street. On the 11th of April, about ten o'clock at night, the Birmingham coach arrived - three passengers got out- Mr. Chase was one, and I recollect the prisoner very well - he took some liquor and water, but did not sit down; I noticed that he went out of the house three times while the coach was there, and the last time he staid in the passage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You must have taken great notice of him? A. Yes. Persons do not always take supper; some only take liquor and water; they more generally sup than not; I noticed the prisoner by his going out three times - there was a back place for him to go to without going out in front.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. You learned soon afterwards of this loss? A. Yes, on the Friday.</p>

            , JUN. On the 11th of April I remember the Birmingham coach stopping at my father's - I was on the near side of the coach when the prisoner got out - I was looking after the coach to see the things were all correct, and observed him go to the near side and open the coach door, while the others were at supper; on hearing it open I went to the near side - he left the coach, and afterwards went away in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were watching the coach - now did he take any thing out? A. I did not see him open the door, as I was on the other side - it hardly took me a second to go round - his right foot was on the step; I asked him what he wanted - I saw him leave the coach but cannot say whether he had any thing in his hand or not - I saw him shut the door with one hand - I told him what he wanted to ask the guard for, (and he went towards the house) because the guard said he had lost two coats a few nights before - I was with the coach from the time it arrived till it started - there was a lamp on each side, but no other light.</p>

            . I am guard of the Union Birmingham coach, which meets this coach at Stoney Stratford. On the 11th of April, about one o'clock at night, we met it about a quarter of a mile on the other side Stoney Stratford; at Stoney Stratford the prisoner asked if I had room outside to London - he was very meanly dressed in black, and had no great coat - it was a very wet morning - I lent him my box coat - he came to London with us, and got down at the Pitt's Head public-house, at the corner of Old-street, about eight o'clock in the morning. The rain cleared off about day-break - he pulled off my coat, and from inside his coat I saw him pull a smallish parcel, covered with a kind of light brown paper - it appeared to be chafed a little on the edges with wet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. A person with plenty of money would rather go inside? A. He said he had not plenty of money - the parcel appeared to be in common rought brown paper - I only saw it once, as he pulled it out to look at it and put it in again.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a light whitey-brown paper parcel? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Inspector's office in the Bank. On the 12th of April, about one o'clock, the prisoner brought two hundred 1l. notes, to be changed for gold - they were in four parcels of 50l. each. with the Bank halter on them - we always issue them tied in fifties; I am confident of his person; he handed this paper to me as his address, "Thomas Matthews, No. 21, Euston-square; 200 1l. notes;" I have kept the paper ever since. I inspected the notes, then took him to the Treasury, to get a 200l. note for them, which I gave him, with a pen, to write his name on the large note, which he handed to the pay clerk, with a name on it - it was quite a new note, with no writing on it; I delivered the same 200 1l. notes to the cashier at the Treasury, but did not see the 200l. note after he wrote on it; I saw him deliver it to Mr. Higman, to get gold for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he his hat on? A. He took it off in the office, but when I first saw him it was on; he was there full twenty minutes; I do not suppose more than one or two other persons were with me that day - ours is a private office; he happened to be admitted within the office by accident, that makes me remember him - he was shabbily dressed.</p>

Watts had a bed there on the 29th - there were three beds in the room - the prisoner slept in one of them - the other was unoccupied - I and the servant made up Watts' bed after the prisoner was in bed; he had slept there for a month or five weeks; he got up about six o'clock and went away; he knocked at my door and called me and the servant up; he never returned but was apprehended about two o'clock that day. Watts complained of losing his money, and when the prisoner was taken a silk handkerchief of mine was found in his pocket - I believe I had left it in the bar a few days before - nobody could have been in the room without our knowledge.</p>

I had information of this robbery, and apprehended the prisoner at Mr. Barclay's, No. 381, Strand, at work; I said I must search him, and asked if he had any money; he said "No, only a few halfpence;" I searched him and found no money, but he had no coat or waistcoat on; I asked him where his halfpence were - he said in his waistcoat pocket; he went to a cupboard and gave me his waistcoat, in which I found some halfpence; he was then fumbling about his coat pocket, in the cupboard, with his back turned towards me, and putting something into his trousers' pocket; he then gave me his coat - I found nothing in it; I said"What have you got inside your shirt?" and I there found this handkerchief, in which was a purse with three sovereigns; I said I thought he had no money - he made no answer; I took the money, and he said "Ar'n't you going to give me the money?" I said No; he said "I will soon make you return it;" I took him out - he knocked me down and ran away - I followed him to the corner of Bow-street, where a patrol stopped him.

            . This is the handkerchief I wrapped the money in - I have had it five years. When the officer took her, he said it was for robbing Mr. Guerin; she said"No, I never robbed him - his wife gave me the money;" my wife is now in a dying state; she told me I might do my best - that she got drunk, and was robbed of the money on the step of a door. My wife was dangerously ill at that time, and it was all the money we had in the world.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, in her defence, accused the prosecutor of illtreating his wife, and stated that she gave her the money when nobody was present.</p>

            . I live in Brownlow-street, and attended the prisoner as char-woman for three or four months. I usually went to her lodgings about eight o'clock in the morning. On Wednesday, the 7th of June, I went there at eight o'clock - she opened the door to me, looked at the clock, and said it was late - I made no answer, but proceeded to light the fire; she was then in her bed-room- she came to me - I said "What a violent pain I have in my head;" she said "That is bad;" there is a small room next to the bed-room where this child slept - I went there for a duster, and saw the child laying in bed asleep - it had a colour on its cheek, and appeared in good health; the prisoner's husband was dressing in his bed-room; I went out for some bread, and when I returned she was poking the fire; I was not gone many minuts - I noticed how dull the fire burnt, and asked her if I should put the kettle on - it was on a trivet then; she said it would boil time enough; I asked if I should fetch some butter - she said there was enough - but there was scarcely any; I left the house about twenty minutes to nine, and in about half an hour I heard that a murder had been committed. I had noticed for the last three weeks that she had been very low - I saw her at Marlborough-street about twelve o'clock that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Eight o'clock was your usual time to go there? A. Yes; I got there rather before, and yet she said I was late, and said there was plenty of butter when there was hardly enough for a slice of bread. No mother on earth could behave kinder to a child than she did to this; for three weeks previous to this she had sat moping about; she always appeared kind and humane. On this morning I had left a very good fire, but she had nearly put it out; she had made a sort of confident of me, but for the last three weeks had hardly spoken.</p>

Mr. Brown ran up stairs - I called out "What is the matter Brown?" he made no answer, but ran up - I followed and met him coming out of the middle room, tearing his hair, wringing his hands, and stamping; he turned round, followed me into the room, opened the door of the third room, where the child lay, and said "For God's sake look at my baby; Price, look at my baby;" it lay on the floor with its throat cut, smothered in blood; he was quite frantic; I was going out of the room but met the prisoner, as I got on the landing, coming up stairs; her left hand was covered with blood - she walked by me into the room, and said "Price!" but I do not know what else; she went into the sitting room, and said "Where is my child - what have I done?" she stood up, and by this time a dozen persons had got into the room; she spoke in a violent manner - as soon as her husband came into the room he said"Ann, what have you done? you have murdered my baby;" she made no answer, but kept saying "Where is the child - what have I done?" Brown laid hold of her round the neck - they both fell on the sofa - he kissed her- she appeared faint, and he was frantic - he got up and walked about stamping - two women held her, fearing she might commit self-destruction. I remained there till the officers came, which was about ten minutes past nine - she seemed in great grief, and frantic; they took her away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220011"/>- I saw her at Marlborough-street about twelve o'clock, and shook hands with her - she seemed then much in her usual way; I saw a knife in her husband's hands, while she was in the front room - he took it from the sink - it was steeped in blood; the sink is within a yard of where the child lay; I have not observed any difference in her conduct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you attend to your business? A. Yes; there is a window between my shop and theirs; she must pass through the street to get to the shop; she made the discovery herself - her manner was wild and frantic - she had had the child there about eighteen months, and was extremely kind and tender to it; we have noticed her being remarkably kind to it.</p>

            . I live in Queen-street, Seven-dials, right opposite to the prisoner - I have known her nearly seven years; she is fifty-one years old, and her husband about twenty-eight; I visited them - they kept a coalshed. I have lately observed her dull and heavy, and particularly on the Tuesday before this happened. I saw the child several times on Tuesday - it was noticing my dog at the door, about three o'clock in the afternoon; it used to ride on it, and that pleased the prisoner, but on this occasion the child pulled her apron to attract her notice, and said, "Mammy," but she stood leaning on the door-post for a quarter of an hour, and did not notice the child, though it kept wishing her to look at the dog; her conduct to the child was very good indeed; I knew she was not its mother; she always let it go to see its mother whenever it was wanted. I never heard any dispute between her and her husband - they lived more happy after the child lived with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you hear of what happened? A. Mr. Brown came over and took me to his passage. I saw the prisoner in the shop all bloody, holding her hands up, and saying,"What have I done?" she did not notice me; I looked at her hands, and asked what she had done - she made no answer. I went up stairs with Brown, into the little room where the child slept, and found it out of bed, laying in the corner, on the floor, by the window, within arms length of the sink, which is in the other room; the child was warm, and the blood flowing; I was lost for a few minutes, and after recovering I helped the beadle to place the body on the table - its head was nearly cut off. I saw the prisoner again about twelve o'clock, before the Magistrate - she stood there agitated, and working her fingers about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she bear the character of a humane person? A. She did. I never saw her in a passion; she humoured this child more than I would mine - she has seemed lost lately.</p>

            . I am assistant overseer of St. Giles's; Queen-street is in that parish. On the morning of the 7th of June I saw the prisoner at the work-house, in a ward where we put mad people; she was in a straight waistcoat, sitting by the side of the fire very quietly - several persons were in the ward.</p>

               <p>JONATHAN LIDDIARD. I am a bricklayer, and live in Great Earl-street, Seven-dials. On Monday, the 7th of June, about ten minutes past nine o'clock, I went to this house, and took the prisoner into custody; the moment I took hold of her she said, "What have I done?" and in going along asked me several times where the child was - she appeared very low; I took her to the watch-house, and afterwards to the work-house; I ordered that she should not wash herself - they thought it best to put on the strait waistcoat, that she should not alter herself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who did you find in the room? A. Two people were holding her on the sofa.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was taking the prisoner to the office on the morning of the 7th of June, and knowing her I said "What, in the name of God, could passess you to do this?" - she said it was done in a moment, and she was very sorry for it, and did not know at the moment what she was doing; she then cried. I asked where the child was at the time - she said it was asleep in bed - that she laid hold of it, took the knife off the table and did it. She then complained very much of a person named Easley continually annoying her, and one Bentley encouraging her in doing so; I know she was tensed by these women coming opposite her house with a child. I have known her twelve months; she bore an excellent character.</p>

            . I live in Bolton-row, and have known the prisoner thirty years - she lived in my mother's service, and was in our house about a year and a half, in a deranged state; her countenance to-day is just the same as when she was in that state - it is not her usual appearance; she was under the care of her mother in our house, who lived forty years with us, and died in our service. - The prisoner left us, and went into Mrs. Cosard's service, but was sent back to us, in consequence of attempting to drown herself, and was placed under her mother's care - she was once out all night, and came home in a desponding state, and said she had been on London-bridge all night. When she was in this desponding state she would sit, pretending to be at work, but doing nothing, and would never speak - at other times she was quite communicative; she had nursed two of my brothers; they had been ill. My mother and her's were worn out with attending them; she came up, and asked if she could be of any service - that was the first symptom of her coming to herself.</p>
               <p>Mr. BARRY. Q. What are you? A. I give instructions in fencing. I think this circumstance took place in 1805. Mrs. Cosard wanted to have her again, but the late Dr. Baillie thought it not proper, from his opinion of her mind.</p>

I am certain she was in a state of mental derangement - Dr. Baillie said she must not be kept where there were children, and she was sent back to Mrs. Angelois.</p>

I soon became stunned by the fright and loss of blood, and do not know what passed - he stabbed me below the pit of my stomach. I recovered in about a quarter of an hour, and found myself in bed; he said nothing to me before he stabbed me.

I walked into the passage to look for Collier; two watchmen were going up stairs, and by their light I saw Collier standing in the passage, opening the cellar door; he exclaimed, "Go on - he is up stairs" - I said, "This is the man," and put my hand on his shoulder. He went down the cellar stairs so fast I was obliged to loose my hold; I got a light, and searched the cellars and back gardens, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is not uncommon for there to be a noise in this house? A.

Whether Westerfer was quarrelling I cannot say.</p>

            . I live nearly opposite to Westerfer. I was going home, and heard a noise at his door, with Mrs. Collier and her grand-daughters - Westerfer stood at the side of the door, with Barton. I was going up to them - Collier came down stairs, clapped Westerfer on the shoulder, and said, "Westerfer, I want to speak to you"- I fell back for him to go in - there was a bit of a skirmish in the passage. Collier ran, and stood on the first stair, and said, "I have done for the b - r;" he then went up stairs, came down with his hat and coat on, and went down the cellar stairs. I and Barton caught hold of his coat, and he said the man who had done the murder was up stairs; he got away from us, down into the cellar. I saw no more of him till he was in custody. Westerfer was taken over to Barton's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Barton was alongside of Westerfer when Collier tapped him on the shoulder? A. Yes - he was close to him. Barton must have heard it.</p>

            . The prisoner afterwards told me voluntarily that he had intended this for the last eleven months - there had been such disturbances in the family, and he was determined to do it; he had stabbed him, and knew he had murdered him, and therefore gave himself up; it was at four o'clock in the afternoon. I understood he had been at the office that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it your habit to talk with prisoners? A. No; I asked him no questions at all; he told very thing himself. I have no doubt of his being a little in liquor, but not much - he had told this story to other officers, but they sent him away, as a drunken man.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the prosecutor on the night of the 13th - he had been stabbed or cut with some sharp instrument; the wound was rather more than an inch long - I should not term it a grievous harm; it was just on the edge of the cartilege of the chest, in an oblique direction.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They have all sworn falsely. I came home about ten minutes past eleven o'clock, and found my house surrounded. I was informed my wife and the prosecutor had been quarrelling - I went up stairs, but my wife took no notice of it to me - at supper time I said "I find you have had a quarrel with Mrs. Westerfer"- she said, "Yes, she has got drunk, and has been abusing the girls;" I called one of the girls up - she did not come, and I went down with a piece of bread and the knife in my hand; I said to the girl, "Why don't you come up." The prosecutor heard my voice, and began striking at me, but could not hit me - he turned out of doors went out to ask why he hit me; as soon as I mentioned his name he rushed in, and said, "You have been telling somebody that I said something about you;" I denied it- he said, "You lie, you old b - r," and struck and kicked me; I resented the blow with the knife in my hand, and he said he was stabbed. I immediately thought of the knife, and was so frightened I got my hat and coat and made my way out. I was drinking, and mentioned it to a man in Drury-lane; he advised me to go to Bow-street, which I did, and they laugthed at me; I said we had been at variance for eleven months, but with the man himself I never quarrelled. I never said I did it wilfully.</p>

            . I am a weaver, and live in Parliament-street, Bethnal-green. I was coming home between eleven and twelve o'clock on this night, and in Hare-street I heard a quarrel; I saw the prisoner come down stairs, eating his supper; I heard the prosecutor's wife call the prisoner's two grand-children, two wh - s, and using dreadful language; Westerfer came out - the prisoner said it was very wrong for the prosecutor's wife to use such language, which she knew was false - he called Westerfer a rogue and villain, for suffering such language - Westerfer immediately struck him - Collier appeared quite calm and cool - he returned the blow, but I did not know he had a knife; I thought he struck with his fist.</p>

Hailstone (who was in the room) took her away - I was taken to the Hospital; I had not lifted my hand to her; she had five knives and forks in her hand at the time - she had taken them off the table; she drew this from the rest and struck me; I had a cut in my cheek, and another in my forehead.</p>

I am certain of the prisoner's person.</p>

It belongs to the Two-penny Post-office; the men were strangers there - I should know them again; they stood near the dong-hill; I have no doubt but he threw the watch there; I lost sight of him twice in turning the corner for a moment.</p>

On Monday last I met the prisoner in Butcher-row, and said he was the man who had stolen my clothes, which he denied; I took him to the house; his hand was behind his coat, and I found he was breaking up some duplicates - he told me at last where he had pawned them.</p>

            . On Monday night I heard the deceased challenge Palmer to fight - he did not wish it, and declined; on Tuesday he came down, and said he would have it out that evening; Palmer wished not to fight, but they called him a coward several times - at last he said he did not wish to fight, but he did not mind - they fought for three-quarters of an hour. I desired the deceased to leave off after the first round - he said he would not; I told him Palmer was too powerful for him - he said No, he was not; I remained in the field, but not near enough to notice the fight, and saw no more.</p>

I heard him say "It is a bl - y hard thing that a fellow should swing for it;" he had got the mares two or three hundred yards from the common, in the highway leading to Clapton; I was only walking towards him - he got off and ran away before I spoke to him.</p>

I fetched the watchman, who took him; there were a few keys and things found upon him; I had left my hat on a shelf, and my wife's bonnet was kept in a box on another shelf.

I went and called Haywood; at a quarter to two o'clock I had seen the prisoner go out, by the light of the gas, and am sure he is the man. When he was taken in the room he said if Haywood would let him go he should lose nothing by him; Haywood said he missed a bundle of linen - he said he had taken it, but would not tell where - the hat and bonnet were tied up in a handkerchief, on the ground.</p>

The prisoner was brought to the watch-house about four o'clock in the morning; I searched him, and in his breast pocket I found eight keys, one of which was a latch-key, and opens Haywood's street door - and in his right-hand breeches pocket I found another key, which opens the back attic door, where the things are kept. I have seen them tried.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Who did you give the keys to? A. I put them on the constable of the night's table, but I took particular notice of them first, and observed the mark of a vice on the latch-key. Furzman opened the door with them in my presence. I am sure they are the same; this key has been forced.</p>

I was much intoxicated at the time, or I should not have acted with that impropriety. I never had left the house from the first when I went up stairs - I did not open any door in Mr. Haywood's house, and had not intent to rob any one.</p>

I opened the window, and saw the prisoner go out with a bundle; it was between the lights, just break of day; I should not have been able to swear to him without the gas-light - I am sure he is the man; he walked across the road, and turned the corner as quick as possible - I saw him afterwards in the house, and knew him to be the same man; I am certain of the time, for I looked at the clock.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I am charged with entering the house with a latch-key, and the room door with another, which I do declare was never opened by me. I was out at a friend's house, and did not leave until near three o'clock, and this robbery is stated to be between one and two. I have been all my life-time in respectability, succeeding a father-in-law, as a jeweller, when he retired from business in Paris, where all the family still remain; I have always had a supply of money when required, with my own industry - I never have had cause to commit such a dreadful act. The witness states she saw me run across the street - it could not be light enough to distinguish any one.</p>

On the 16th of May, about half-past six o'clock, we turned about sixty cart horses into the field opposite Limehouse church, and on the 17th, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I went into the field, and this gelding was missing; it was a black gelding. I found it at Brentford between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, in possession of Hitchcock - the prisoner was there in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIIPS. Q. Has your master any other Christian name? A. No; the field is railed all round, about four feet high; I believe the gate was locked - I know I shut it; there is a footpath through the field; I fastened the gate with a hasp; there is a small opening for persons to go through, with a post to it. I found the gate shut as I had left it.</p>

            . I live at Northall, near Harrow. - On the 17th of May I saw the prisoner at Brentford, with a horse; I wanted one, and asked him the price - he asked 25l., then agreed to take 20l., then 18l., and at last came down to 13l. - I asked him if it was sound - he said Yes, and a good worker; I thought it was not his, and would not pay him, but took him with it to the Pigeons, public-house, Brentford, and gave them in charge. Young came there, and claimed it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he sober? A. He looked intoxicated. I asked him whose the horse was; he said his father's, and that he was authorised to sell it for him; he appeared to me to be tipsy.</p>

I found my house all in disorder; the thieves had broken in at the back yard door; my shop-shelves were empty; the bundle contained three coats, ten waistcoats, a quilt, a stocking, a pillow-tick and case, a gown skirt, a shirt, a petticoat, a boy's dress, two gowns, an apron, and a handkerchief, all of which have my shop-mark upon them.

I have been with the prosecutor two months - they used to turn us out of the shop sometimes, when they were going to rob him - I did not tell as they said they would whap me, and did whap the other boys; I told Ireland, the other boy, and they said they would whap me. I never was at a police-office, I swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your brother? A. He was sent away from here - transported about a handkerchief. I did not tell my master till after Capel was taken up. The first time I saw master robbed was the second day I went there.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old; if I take a false oath I shall be punished in the next world - I do not know my catechism. I work in the same room with Pickering - I saw him put some silk and cotton in a bag, and put it between the boards, about a fortnight or three weeks before he was apprehended - I did not tell what I had seen before he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are fourteen years old - have you ever been to church in your life? A. No; I have been to a Catholic school - I heard there about another world - I have been to chapel - I do not know the Creed, Commandments, or Lord's Prayer.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. You did not see them before you missed your handkerchief? A. No; Prighe came back willingly; the gentleman gently laid hold of his arm; I cannot say whether Prighe said I or we, when he asked about remuneration; I had seen them together for a minute and a half before I went up; they were in conversation - they walked leisurely - I said to them both, "You have robbed me," and took hold of Cherry, as he was nearest - Prighe turned and walked off- the street was very thin of people - Cherry made a shew of fight to the officer, and resisted - the officer knocked him down - they both resisted, and wanted a coach, saying, they would not be exposed in the street. Prighe said he was an innocent man, and it would injure his character.</p>

I was coming up Ludgate-hill and saw a crowd; Mr. Lund had the prisoners in custody, and was just entering a shop door; Prighe denied the charge; I found the handkerchief in Cherry's bosom, between his waistcoat and shirt - they did not like to go through the street with their hands tied together - they did not resist till I tied them together.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>CHERRY'S Defence. The handkerchief being found in my possession may confirm the prosecutor's statement, but my fellow prisoner I never saw till he came with the prosecutor, and was accused of being concerned with me. I picked up the handkerchief, which two women observed, and told the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>PRIGHE's Defence. I am a respectable young man, and my father was a citizen - I have always lived respectable. I had been to Mr. Barnard's printing-office, in Playhouse-yard - I stood at the picture shop, at the corner of St.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220024"/>Martin's-court, for twenty minutes, then crossed the Old Bailey; I was dressed respectably, though he says it was shabby; he told the Alderman he came after me himself; I was not in company with a soul all day; when the gentleman came after me he said, somebody wished to speak to me - I went back with him - he accused me of the robbery, and I said, on a proof of your being mistaken, what reparation do you suppose you can give for the injury of my character. I insisted on going into a shop to be searched.</p>
               <p>Mr. LUND. Prighe was certainly not dressed so respectably as he is now, but be was tolerably well dressed.</p>

Reeves interfered to get me away from losing my watch - he was knocked down - another scuffle ensued, and in a short time they all ran away except Abrahams, whom I collared - they had not robbed me then; Abrahams called out for the other four to return, and not let such a d-d thief as me take him; they all four returned, and I was knocked down. Reid was the most desperate of them - they took off my hat, which was torn a good deal in the struggle - I produce it; I was hallooing out Watch! for full five minutes; when they got my hat they all ran away - the watchman came up, sprung his rattle, and I saw Reid drop the hat; I picked it up - Burke pursued him, and neither of us lost sight of him till he was taken; he was taken to the watch-house, and as I came out of the watch-house door, the first man I saw was Abrahams, standing outside the door; I recognised him directly, and collared him till Killmartin came up and took him into the watch-house. I swear positively to both of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. You had been making merry with your friends? A. No; I was quite sober - there had been no quarrel - my hat was certainly taken with an intent to steal it - they tried to get my watch first- Reid took my hat off when they returned to rescue Abrahams, but after they had rescued him, not while they were doing it.</p>

On Saturday night, about a quarter past twelve, I heard a scuffle, and call of Watch! in Compton-street; I saw Reid run from where the scuffle was, and saw him drop a hat - I pursued him down Church-passage, through two courts, into St. Andrew-street, where Price stopped him, without my losing sight of him. I am certain he is the man who dropped the hat. I took him to the watch-house, and, as we came out, the prosecutor pointed out Abrahams, and gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am the wife of James White. On the 4th of June, at seven o'clock in the morning, I was at home, with my two children and my son William: we all slept in the front room on the ground floor. I awoke at seven in the morning, and saw my window open - the shutter was torn quite down, and the sash thrown up - the prisoner Pray stood at my bed-side, with my pocket and needle-case in her hand, and my money in the other hand - she had silver and halfpence; she lodged on our second floor - Walker was standing against the window in the room. When I went to bed I had placed my pocket between two pillows, with four half-crowns, three sixpences, and 3s. in copper, in it, and a needle-case; Pray had slept in the house that night. I said "Oh, dear me, I am robbed;" Pray answered "You bl-y old wh-e, if you speak another word I will knock your bl-y eye out;" they must have got in at the window for the room door was double locked; I found it so afterwards - the window is three or four feet from the ground. Pray threw the pocket on the pillow again - Walker then went to the window and got out - Pray followed her out immediately; I took up my pocket and all the money was gone; I am sure the money and needle-case were in it when I went to bed; Pray lodged in the house that night, but I heard her go out at four o'clock - before my husband - she has lodged there seven or eight months. I immediately dressed myself - I saw them outside the window, and saw Pray give some money to Walker; Walker said, "Have mercy on your fellow creature;" Pray said "B-r you, take it;" I got out of the window - they both went up the court - I went in pursuit, and found them in a public-house in White-cross-street - Banks, the landlord, was there - I asked him to take charge of them till I could get an officer - I sent for Lock, who came and took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. Had not Pray lodged with you ten or eleven months? A. No - seven or eight; I did not know her before she lodged there - I had not quarrelled with my husband - we live very happy.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not awoke at two o'clock in the morning by a cry of murder? A. No; I was with a person who was ill, and did not come home till one o'clock. I have seen Walker backward and forward with Pray but never knew she slept there; I came home very tired - there was no drinking in my room that night, nor had my husband locked me out - when he went out at four o'clock I told him to lock the room door, and take the key, as I did not want to go out till he returned; I expected him back about six o'clock; Pray had a key of the street door, and could go in and out when she liked.</p>
               <p>Q. When they got into your room did you not say"Don't be angry with me, my husband locked the door, and he is like a madman when drunk? A. I said nothing of the sort - we were both quite sober - I did not tell my son to open the window and let them in, or hear the watchman tell them to get in - I found them in the room when I awoke.</p>

            . Q. Had you no dispute with you wife that night? A. None at all; there had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220026"/>been a disturbance, about two o'clock, up in Pray's room- I went on the stairs and demanded peace - my wife was in bed, and had been so for three-quarters of an hour - the disturbance was dancing and singing on the second floor - I called for peace, but it still kept on - I did not go into the room, and cannot say who was there; I returned to bed after calling out to them, and did not put them out of the house; I said if there was not peace in the house I would send for an officer.</p>
               <p>WALKER's Defence. Mr. White had never been in bed at all; we went out, and the moment we got out he said"You will not go in again now, Mrs. Pray - I will lay a trap for you, and make you pay for all." I had slept there three weeks: he had been abusing his wife, and there was a cry of murder - he locked us out - Mrs. White opened the shutter - he insisted on it being shut again - the shutter was taken down by a witness for us to get in. Mrs. White asked us to treat her with something to drink - I said I did not mind, and we had no sooner got into the public-house than she came in, and said she was robbed. I insisted on an officer being sent for.</p>
               <p>PRAY's Defence. Mrs. White has known me twenty-four years. On this night I was distressed about my husband's watch, which I had pawned, and the time had expired; I had 6s. in my pocket; the needle-case belonged to my mother, who is dead; I have a witness who took it out of her pocket when she was a corpse: there was nothing in his house but fiddling and dancing till four and five o'clock in the morning. The prosecutrix has sent to me, several times in prison, to say she would hang me if possible, and if not would banish me; she sent to Sir Richard Taylor, who allowed me money, and got it stopped; she said it would be a charity to my husband to convict me.</p>

            . My husband is a carman, but does not live with me. I live in this court - my window fronts White's door. About half-past three or four o'clock on this morning I heard Pray wanting to go into her own apartment; she was in the court; Mr. White vowed she should never go into the house any more; he was in the court with her - he was dressed. She said while she paid her rent she had a right to go in, and kept knocking at the door till about a quarter past five o'clock; I was mangling at the time. At a quarter past five she had a bottle in her hand, and went to get some liquor; a tall man in the court said, "You shall not lay here any longer exposed," and he shut the shutter where White slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the window was open at half-past five o'clock? A. Yes; the man shut one shutter, and the other broke off in his hand; he went away. The prisoners were not in the court at that time; I did not see them at seven o'clock- I was mangling then with my door shut.</p>
               <p>JAMES WHITE. I went to bed at half-past one o'clock- I laid on the bed without undressing, as there was such a disturbance in the house; I called out about two o'clock for peace; I was not in the court till ten minutes past four, when I met the prisoner with a bottle of gin in her hand - she used a very bad word, and said she could not get in; I said, "You have got a key of the street door as well as me, and can let yourself in;" I went on, as I was going out; I was not awake when she went out myself, but met her when I went out; I left the shutters bolted inside, and quite secure; no part of them was broken. They broke two squares of glass in the sash to get in. When I returned the door was locked, as I had left it; Pray was in the house till nearly four o'clock, and was not shut out. The outer shutter was broken off when I returned.</p>

I am an officer of Hatton-garden. - On Saturday, the 27th of May, I went, in company with Edwards and Kerby, to a house in James-street, Golden-lane, in the parish of St. Luke, Old-street, at a quarter before eleven o'clock at night - I found the street door open - I and Edwards went up to the third floor, leaving Kerby below; there is only one room on a floor - we found the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220027"/>door on the latch, and opened it; there was a fire in the room: the prisoner was standing by the fire, with his coat off, and his shirt sleeves tucked up; we entered the room- I took him into custody, searched him, and found ten bad shillings in his waistcoat pocket, and 2s. 6d. good money in his other waistcoat pocket; four of the bad shillings were more fit for circulation than the other six; they had been rubbed down, and four of them have been heated with a hot iron; Kerby came up stairs. The prisoner said, "You have no occasion to take any further trouble - there are some on the bed - Kerby went and lifted up the bed-clothes, and took something like shillings out- the prisoner said there were some in a hole by the side of the bed, and Edwards found something there; there was a jug on the mantel-piece, with a liquid in it and two shillings - this piece of bent iron was in the fire, red hot(producing it.)

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin. The two shillings found in the jug are both counterfeit - they are milled, and struck with a die, and have been rubbed down with sand or glass paper, to take off the sharp edge of the die, and make them look as if they had been in circulation; they appear to have been silvered or coloured, not cased; those nine found in the bed are counterfeit, and appear to have been struck from the same die as the two; they have been rubbed down, coloured or silvered, greased and blacked, to appear as if they had been in circulation; candle grease will do that, but sometimes they use the marrow of an animal, then rub them with lamp-black or the snuff of a candle. The ten produced by Limbrick are all counterfeit - six of them have been rubbed down or prepared, but not coloured, and the other four have been rubbed down or silvered, but not greased - they are also of the same die. The four sixpences are counterfeit - they are rubbed, and completely prepared for circulation; here are three counterfeit shillings in the state in which they came from the original coiner, from the die; one powder will produce the colour of silver on copper or brass - the other is cream of tartar, which is used as a light acid wash afterwards, to give them a new appearance - the liquid is water with a slight portion of cream of tartar, and a small portion of the silver powder, which has come from the coin when washed in it; the shillings are all from one die, and the sixpences from one. In order to make them ring like silver they at times lay them on hot iron, which hardens the metal.</p>

I said, "No, I have had enough of you - you can go on" - he said, "D-n your eyes, lay there," and ran away. I got up in three or four minutes; I heard a noise a head of me, near Hampton-wick, while I was laying down - I ran as fast as I could to Hampton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220028"/>wick for a constable - he was not at home; I passed the prisoner and three or four more as I went over Kingston-bridge; I said nothing, but went and told Mr. Walter, the gaoler.</p>

I was working at Teddington; I left work at eight o'clock, then went to a public-house with some shopmates; I drank a pint or a pint and a half of beer; I was in and out there. I was perfectly sober. I walked about the fair part of the time. I said what I did to the prisoner because I knew he had been tried a few days before. When I overtook him on the bridge he was going towards Kingston - if I had attempted to take my money from him 4there he would have sworn a robbery against me; I am certain of his person. When I told the gaoler, he said I had better let it alone, and he should be taken to-morrow- I told him he was then coming over the bridge; he did not laugh at me.</p>

I was alarmed a little before two o'clock in the morning, by my wife saying there was somebody in our room; I said it could not be: she nudged me again, and said, "I tell you there is somebody" - I would not believe it, and in a quarter of an hour she got out of bed, and immediately a man spoke - I instantly got up, drew my curtain aside, and asked how he came there - it was the prisoner; he was laying on the floor, and appeared intoxicated; he said he thought it was his sister's house, and he had come there to lodge. I said, "Which way did you get in?" he said at the up-stair window, and had shut it down again; I found the up-stair window shut, and the curtains drawn - it was not broken at all. I threw up my room window, called my neighbours, and we secured him; I went down to let my neighbour in, leaving him in the room with my wife; I found the street door as I had left it. When I came up again I found these things had been taken out of the box, and laid on the floor; there were two spencers, half a yard of silk, a book, and four shifts - a basket of linen down stairs was rolled up in a blanket, and put to the ground floor window, ready to be carried away - that window was open, and the shutter also; it was fastened overnight. - The up-stairs window has a sliding sash - he could get to it by stepping on the cills of the places, as it is a low house, about fifteen feet from the ground; I never saw him before.</p>

I took him to the watch-house; I asked where the 2s. 6d. was - he said he was to have that when he had taken the horse to the Commercial-road; Goodwin saw the horse, and claimed it.</p>

I sat on the box - it filled the bottom of the cart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what time did you receive it? A About four o'clock; we got to the Wellington about eight - the trunk was found about eleven miles from the Wellington; they could undo the tail-board behind, and get it out; it was fastened by two iron pins. The things on the box were linen, which I also lost - it all belonged to Mr. Pepys.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say there were foot-marks upon the cart? A. Yes; the tail-board was dirty - it was a dirty night. I did not find the board down - they could put it up again; they might put their feet on the tail-board to get up, and take out the pin.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 8th of May I went to Hobdell's lodging, and he gave me a quantity of duplicates; here is one for the two table-cloths, pawned on the 28th of March; I found a child's cap at Walker's lodging, No. 6, Rose-court, Fore-street; he was in bed there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Did you know any thing of Walker before? A. No. There was a female and child in bed with him; the cap was in a drawer - he directed me to the drawer; there was other children's linen there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did Hobdell say how he got the duplicates? A. No. I said I was come to search his place; he went to the drawer, and pulled them out, saying he had been very poor and obliged to pawn the things - he did not say he had received them from any one else.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. How did you find his lodging? - A. From information; I knew his person before; only one duplicate relates to the prosecutor's property.</p>

               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Is there any thing now on the table-cloth which you can speak to, except the pattern? A. Nothing - it is rather an unusual pattern, something like a star - they are both alike.</p>

            . I am a musical instrument maker, and live in Golden-lane. On Saturday, the 25th of March, I went to a friend's house, Mr. Johnson, No. 23, Thomas-street, Hackney; I was there from five to eight o'clock, and Walker came in there; I left him there about eight; I did not know him before. A conversation took place about the purchase of a horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you a housekeeper or a lodger? A. A lodger. I had never seen Walker before or since; a friend of Johnson's was there; Johnson appeared to have been intimate with the prisoner some time; the other person appeared a stranger; Johnson is not here. Walker came in about six o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. How can you recollect that this was on Saturday, the 25th of March - it is a long time ago? A. It was Easter-eve. I have been backwards and forwards to Johnson since, and the conversation turned on Walker's situation; my attention was called to this six weeks or two months ago. I was at Johnson's about a week ago - I was subpoenaed here on Monday; I have seen Johnson since, and told him I was subpoenaed, and he said he supposed he should be also - he is a working-jeweller, and works for the shops. I only recollect Walker from his being there that night; Johnson introduced him as Mr. Walker - we had some spirits and water and some porter; I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they find you out to subpoena you? A. Johnson knew where I lived; I did not ask him if he had given them my address, but I suppose he did. I have lived in Golden-lane two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did nobody but the prisoner come in that night? - A. A person came in who was to buy the horse; I understood his name was Little - he came from Barking; I only recollect the night by its being Easter-eve and quarter-day; I have met strangers there at other times. I mentioned to several friends that I could speak to this day. I do not know Walker's friends.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Did you go to Johnson on business or pleasure? A. Business. I left Walker and Little there when I came away; I did not know he was in trouble for two months after; Johnson told me so, and asked if I remembered his being there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long ago is it that Johnson told you Walker was in trouble? A. I think it is about a month or five weeks; he asked if I remembered seeing him there - I immediately said it was on quarter day; I went to Johnson the next morning, after I was subpoenaed, and told him - it was last Tuesday or Wednesday; I did not ask if he was subpoenaed as I naturally supposed he was. I went to tell him I was subpoenaed, as much as any thing; he lives a mile and a half from me; I went on business - I had some violin bows to make for him - they were in hand, but not quite finished - I had only got the order a few days before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had no occasion to go to him about the bows? A. Not particularly; I did not go to Newgate to see if Walker was the same man.</p>

               <p>HELEN LEARY. I left my situation on Tuesday last, and went to lodge in the same room with the prisoner Kelly. I went out on Wednesday morning, at half-past ten o'clock, leaving these things in a band-box. Baxter also lodged in the same room; I desired Kelly to take care of my box while I went after a situation; Baxter was in the room - the box was tied round with a piece of tape. I returned about five, but did not examine my box - they were both in the room; I slept with Baxter that night, and next morning, about four o'clock, I looked into my box, and missed 4 yards of lace - the money was in my pocket - I had four shillings, and two sixpences - Kelly had come into the room at two o'clock in the morning. When I awoke my band-box was untied - I missed the lace - I saw the officer find it at the feet of a woman who was in the room.</p>

I do not know who she spoke to; she had no sooner spoken than the prisoner, who is a watchman, came up, calling twelve o'clock; she said "Watchman! take this vagabond out of the house;" and, in a minute, I saw the prisoner holding a man, and saying "Come out, come out here!" three or four followed after him, and Mrs. Dalton with them; the deceased was among them; they all got into one body, and fell down together; I think they were all in liquor except the prisoner; they appeared to be quarrelling from the effects of liquor; the prisoner fell with them - they all got up as well as they could; I then saw the prisoner take the but end of his stick and strike the man, as he laid down, with great force - I swear he struck him twice while on the ground; I ran to my door, called another watchman, and saw no more.</p>

I opened his body, and found a quantity of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220033"/>thin fluid in the intestines; I found a large intestine ruptured; his bowels were dreadfully inflamed; it must have been occasioned by a blow, a kick, or a fall, which I cannot decide - it certainly was the cause of his death.</p>

On Wednesday, the 26th of May, I directed him to go to Mr. Martin's, of St. Albans, and set a steam-kitchen to rights; I supplied him with the materials, and gave him 1l. on account; he came to me on the Saturday - I said, "Have you been down to Mr. Martin's, and set every thing right?" he said Yes, and produced an account, in his own hand-writing, charging 12s. more, for time, coach-hire, &amp;c.; I paid him that balance, as he said he had done the work.</p>

            . I am cook to Mr. George Robert Martin, of St. Albans. The work charged in this bill was not done in April at all; as nobody came from Mr. Slark we were obliged to get another person to do it. The prisoner came on the 11th of May, and asked if the work was done - I told him Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. SLARK. After I paid the prisoner this money I desired him to go to Leamington, in Hampshire, and he should have been there on the 11th of May; I gave him 5l. on account of that job.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Andrew, Holborn. On the 17th of June, about one o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and another at the door of Mr. Moon, a silversmith and tobacconist (I had observed suspicious persons about there for a week before); I watched, and heard wood crack; I saw the prisoner wrenching something back; I was in the court opposite: I came into Holborn, and they went into Middle-row when I crossed; I turned back, and they turned back again, and went to the door - they were at work at the door again; I watched them for three quarters of an hour. I then crossed over to secure them, and they crossed over to my side; I took no notice for a moment - they walked over to where I came from, and stopped opposite Mr. Beauchamp's door, and looked over to the house - I crossed, and took no notice, as if I had not observed them, and made a grasp at the prisoner - the other man directly ran up Brook-street: I said, "I have been watching you for some time;" he said, "What for - I am looking for my daughter; I have got a daughter in the street." I took him to the watch-house. I then went to Mr. Moon's door, and found the jam broken to pieces, but they had not made an entry; the lock was spoiled.</p>

            . Q. When he took money on your account where was he to put it? A. In a case, as we do not reside in the house - he should account for it the first thing the next morning; I asked what he had taken in the morning - he gave me half-a-crown for some goods he had sold that morning; I asked if he had taken any more - he said, "No, nothing else." The cards are worth 8s. 2 1/2d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I charged him 6s. 8 1/2d. for them- I then found I had made a mistake, and took it up stairs to make it right when my master came; I had put it into my pocket, and quite forgot it.</p>

I made inquiries, and found where he worked.</p>

            . I am a night officer. The prisoners were brought to the watch-house by Norris, and we took Willing to shew us where he found the lead - he pointed out a ditch in a field, and I desired him to go down and shew me exactly where it was - the moment he got down his shoes sunk in the mud, and it was evident there was no mark there before - it had been raining the day or two before, which had made the ground soft - there was no dirt upon the lead or the boys. I brought Willing back, and then went with Row to shew us where he had found it, and he shewed another place, about 400 yards from where the other had shewn; I desired him to go down, and he made similar marks - there had been none there before: I saw him look over his shoulder towards Mr. Allen's; I then went there to inquire, and found this lead had been taken from the gutter - it is cut in a very ragged manner, and stained very curiously - it exactly corresponded with what was left. I found a key in Willing's pocket which opened the padlock on the door of the house.</p>

On the day after Christmas-day I went to my brother's room to dinner, and Mr. Butterton said"Mr. Dexter, never want money while there is any thing that will fetch it, as I know I shall get it again." I was here before when Mr. Eady robbed my mother; I never heard of John Dexter being here before - it was in the other Court - he has been out of the country, but I think not quite seven years.</p>

On the 10th of November I let the prisoner a back parlour, furnished, for 5s. a week - he lodged there four days and left without notice; when he had been gone out about three hours I saw a large fire in the room; I went in and extinguished it - it appeared to have been done designedly - it was the cupboard which was burning, about two feet from the fire-place; there was no fire in the fire-place, but there had been a candle upon one corner of the mantel-shelf, which is connected with the cupboard; the paper of the wall had been pulled down, and there had been paper put under one of the cupboard shelves, which had been burning, but had gone out; I did not see it burning; I then missed the property - I believe the door was locked, but I broke it open as I did not get any answer. I never saw the prisoner or his wife till the 28th of May, when I was, by chance, walking along Park-lane, and saw him talking to another man - he ran down Park-lane and into a mews, where a gentleman stopped him, and he was taken to the watch-house. No person was in the room during the four days he occupied it but himself and his wife. I had lost the key out of my parlour door while he was there, which made me suspicious.</p>

I was awoke in the night by hearing him getting up; I asked where he was going - he said down stairs; I went to sleep, and did not awake till the morning, about six o'clock; I then missed the articles stated in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220039"/>the indictment, which had been in a drawer in the room - I had not seen them for some time, as they were keepsakes - the drawer was not locked.

On the 13th of May the prisoner came to look at some jackets, to which he objected; I then showed him a coat and some waistcoats, and in pulling off his coat to try them on he pulled out two watches and an eye-glass, and asked if we bought such things - I said No; he said he wished us to take his coat and the watches in exchange for the things he wanted; I said the coat was too large for him - he then said it was his father's coat; he left that and the watches, but took away the other articles.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Giles', and have known the prisoner some time. I saw him on the night in question in George-street, St. Giles', with a livery coat under his right arm; I pursued him, and he ran as fast as he could up George-street; a woman pushed me off the pavement, and said, "Go along Paddy" - the conductor picked up a coat similar to the one I had seen him with, in the direction in which he ran.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ROBERTS. Q. How long have you known him? A. Two years. He was walking fast; the coat had yellow across the cape; he was two or three yards from me - the gas was lighted; I sprang my rattle, and he ran away - it was hanging down under his right arm; I saw his face. I do not know where the coat was picked up.</p>

            . I had been to the Theatre with a friend of mine, and as I was coming up Hampshire-hog-yard I saw a short stout man with a black or a blue coat, knee breeches, and white stocking; he was running, and some others after him - when every one had passed by me I saw this coat laying on the ground; I saw two patrols on the other side of the way, and I called them and gave it to them - they said, "We will find an owner for it."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where had you been? A. To the Theatre, with a young man, who had left me before I saw the coat; I live at No. 17, Church-street, St. Giles'. I think I heard a cry of Stop thief! and a watchman was running after the man, about ten or twelve yards after him. I am a stay-maker, and work for a person in High-street, Mary-le-bone. I did not see the prisoner there - he lives three or four doors from me - I do not know his number - I think it is No. 13 or 14 - I had never spoken to him. - The coat was picked up in Church-street, opposite Hampshire-hog-yard - it was about twenty or thirty yards from his door, perhaps - I think it was Price I called, and gave him the coat. I did not go before the Magistrate.</p>

I was at work on board the ship Percy, on the 25th of May - I was the foreman on deck; I put my shoes in the cabin in the morning, and missed them at a quarter before four o'clock, when I was coming away - I found an old pair there, not so good as mine; the prisoner had been at work there, and left the ship a quarter before four; I went after him, and found the shoes on his feet - I had him brought back - he took my shoes off, and put on the others, which he said were his own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe your shoes fitted him very well? A. Yes; he was intoxicated - when I said "Have you got your own shoes on?" he looked down, and said "No; these are not mine;" I believe the mate had him in the cabin, and gave him some drink: he might have made a mistake.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police constable. I stopped the prisoner; he said he had been on board a vessel. and taken off his own shoes and left them on deck, but when he came up he could not find his own, and he was not going to walk away bare-foot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he not been drinking? A. He seemed as if he had been drinking strong grog - somebody might have removed his shoes and put them there again; he acknowledged these were not his.</p>

I pursued directly - I heard he had got on the top of one of the Maidstone coaches, which puts up at the Spur inn, in the Borough; I came there, and the book-keeper gave me information; I then went to a place in Clerkenwell, where I thought it likely he would go, because there are two clock factories there, of which he had been speaking to me, and said the persons there had collected some money for him. Mr. Moore, at one of those factories, wished me to go to a house of call, which I did - the prisoner came there, not knowing I was there; I asked him how he came to treat me in that manner; he denied it, and said he had not wronged me in any respect; I sent for a police officer, but before he arrived the prisoner threw the goods on the table before me. These are the articles - I can swear to the watch, and some other articles - the whole of them were thrown on the table, except this old silver one, which had been sold in the Borough; he said they were his own property, but when he came to me he pleaded distress.</p>

How did I get this watch - was I not going to church, and a man met me on the way and shewed me a silver watch that was out of repair, and he wanted to exchange it for another, and did not you go up stairs and fetch this watch and give it to me? A. Yes, but that was not this watch; he knew I wanted 50s. for this; I had asked that for it in his presence; he told me he knew of a customer for it, and I said "All that you can get above two guineas shall be yours:" he took it and came back, and said the man had not got the money - he had got tipsy, and had broken the glass and hands, and it was put on the board in my shop. I had paid him on the Sa<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220043"/>turday evening all the wages we had agreed for - I paid him in money - I never gave him a watch, or any goods whatever, instead of money.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I was in Leman-street, and met the prisoner with the chair in his hand, about nine doors from our house; I went home and found a chair was missing; I told my husband where he was gone. I am certain he is the man - he had no hat on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you stop him? A. Yes; with the watchman; he had put it down then, and was resting his elbow on it - he was sober - there was a man and woman with him, but no one sitting in the chair. He was alone when I met him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Alie-street on the night of the 14th of June, calling the hour of twelve o'clock, when I saw the prisoner with his arm on the chair, in Little Alie-street, and hearing of Mr. Sheen losing the chair, I stopped him; Mrs. Sheen came up, and said it was hers; I took him to the watch-house - there was a man and woman alongside of him - he said he took the chair from a tall man. Mrs. Sheen said "You are the man who took the chair under your arm."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take the other man? A. No; there was no charge against him; the prisoner complained, in going to the watch-house, that he had lost his hat - first he said in a row, and then he said he had lost it in Rupert-street - he then said he had left it at home - he did not seem at all tipsy.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ask him any questions the night before? A. No; I do not know what he meant by the expression.</p>

I took him into custody, and was conveying him to the lock-up house - he had got a bag under his arm with some apricots and peaches in it, and, as he went along he opened the bag, and was dropping them; I returned and picked them up- I went the next morning to Mr. Byng's gardener to inquire if the flowers came from there - he said he had not such plants in his possession; the next morning I found they belonged to Mr. Johnson.</p>
               <p>ADOLPHUS PUGH JOHNSON. I live at Hendon. I have a garden which is enclosed - I missed the flowers in the morning of the 24th of May - they were all safe the evening before, growing in the enclosed ground - they are American plants, but not of much value.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoner, about eleven o'clock in the evening of the robbery, go out of the Bell public-house, with a companion, as they would not let them stay there any longer: I was about to pursue them, to see what their intentions were, but I happened to meet a person who spoke to me on other business, which prevented me. I had seen them begging in the afternoon in the neighbourhood; the patrol called me up between twelve and one o'clock, to take the prisoner; he had this knife, which has still the marks of having cut the flowers. I put him into the cage; we found about a peck and a half of fruit in the morning - we made inquiries, and found it belonged to a Miss Waddy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming home through Hampstead and met a man who had worked for 'Squire Byng - he had a bunch of flowers, and gave me some - when I parted from him I saw a bit of a bag in the road - I took it up.</p>

About six o'clock in the evening I saw a coat lay on some bricks - I took it up, and saw two pieces of pewter under it; I went into the counting-house, and made a hole through the wainscot, that I might see what he did; the prisoner came several times, and took some bricks - he removed his coat each time, and removed the pewter with it; he then came and took the coat, and wrapped the pewter in it, put it under his arm, and went out; I followed, and said, "What have you got here?" he said, "A small piece of lead." I found the two pieces of pewter in it - it was wrapped inside the coat; he had got two doors from the house.</p>

I believe I gave it to him about twelve o'clock at noon - I am not positive as to the time. I never saw him again till he was apprehended; he was not at all under my control - he was under the Governor. I have never seen the money since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it in the course of his duty to deliver this money, or was he intrusted as a common stranger? - A. No; I intrusted him as being an officer of the establishment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. Had Mr. Dupleix written by him? A. No - I received the letter three or four days before. The prisoner did not apply to me for the money; he had been up the day before, and I told him I should send it down the next day by him; I gave it to him as a ready mode of conveying it to Mr. Dupleix - I told him it was for Mr. Dupleix, of the Narcissus; I did not mention for what purpose - he was aware it belonged to the establishment; I did not tell him it was for any particular purpose. He had nothing to do with the Narcissus - he was a guard officer on board the Dromedary. I have frequently sent money by officers before, but not by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. ROBERTS. Q. Was the money openly given? A. Yes - I counted it into his hand.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is this public money belonging to the establishment? A. Yes - it is granted by Act of Parliament.</p>

On the 10th of April, 1824, I went with him to the Penitentiary - it was a very wet day, and we went into a public-house to dry ourselves - I did not go with him to Mr. Rickford; I waited for him about half an hour - when he came out he said to me, "David, I have got 40l." - it was in his hand, in brown paper; I did not see the money, but I saw the paper; he said he had to take it to the steward of the Narcissus, for Mr. Rickford; we went on board the boat together between four and five o'clock, I believe, or it might be after five; when we arrived at the Dromedary we delivered up our baggage that we had in the boat, and went down into the ward-room - the prisoner said to me, "Now, David, I will wash and put on a clean shirt," which he did before me; it had been a very wet day; he then asked the steward's leave to go on shore, with his dog, for an hour, as he said there was a gentleman coming down from town to buy it; the boat went on shore at eight o'clock, to bring all hands on board, but they could not find him. I never saw him afterwards till now. I mentioned to the steward that he had received the money to take to Mr. Dupleix - I did not see him take it on shore.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What he did with the money you do not know? A. No. It is customary when persons go on shore to ask leave; he had a French dog with him.</p>

The prisoner has been in my employ two years and a half - he was employed to carry out meat. On the 17th of May my wife was at the books, and took in the orders; she told me she was satisfied the prisoner had taken a loin of mutton, and put it into his tray - we let him load his tray, and as he went out I called him back, and asked him to account for the meat he had in it; I called over two or three joints, and then we found a loin of mutton, which was not chopped, nor the fat cut off - there was one other loin of mutton, which was in his orders; he seemed much confused, and I said to him "This is the way you have been robbing me ever since you have been here - you shall go to Hatton-garden" - he said, "I hope you are not going to hurt me" - he went out backwards; I thought he might have got away, and went after him - I found him in the privy; he went down stairs - I called him, and he went very reluctantly with me to go to Hatton-garden; when we got to John-street he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220049"/>"I shall not go any further - I have to call on some one;" I said, "You can't go now;" he then set off, and ran as fast as he could - I had the mutton under my arm, but after a long time I collared him - he begged me to let him go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. How many men do you keep? A. Five or six; there might be two or three customers in the shop, but none of my men; I have two customers (a Mr. Good and a Mr. Thwaites), who do not have the fat cut off their meat, but they have it jointed. The prisoner did not go their way.</p>

            . I have been two years and a half in the prosecutor's employ. I do not know any customer who takes meat without being chopped; but I have one, Mr. Thwaites, who has it with the fat on; I did not put this meat into the prisoner's tray. No butcher would think of sending out a loin of mutton uncut.</p>
               <p>JURY to MRS. COLLINGWOOD. Q. Did you see him put it into the tray? A. Yes - I saw him put it in; I have his order-book here - here is one loin of mutton ordered for a Mr. Benbow, of Mecklenburgh-square - that was cut and jointed, and was on the top of the tray.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any suspicion of the prisoner? A. Yes. When he came in the took this mutton and put it into his tray, and then weighed the other meat, and put upon it; we never send out meat without being weighed and booked. They weigh their own trays - he weighed the other meat, but not this.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Hackney-wick. On the morning of the 10th of June I saw the two prisoners in the Marsh - one had a basket and the other two parcels - they went to the bottom of an old hay-stack - when they saw me within one or two hundred yards of them they put the property down, and loitered about for twenty minutes - they then took it up and went on towards London - I let them pass on - I found by the noise that the bags had poultry in them - I followed them till they got into Three Colt-lane - I went round the Marsh, got assistance, nd they were taken - one of them had the basket, but the bags were not there - we took them to Hackney watch-house, and then went in search of the bags which we found in a rye-field, about ten yards from where I last saw them; I asked Brewer what he had done with the bags - he said he knew nothing about them - he had them when I first saw him - I had lost sight of them, but I am certain they are the persons.</p>

            . I am a patrol. About twenty minutes before five o'clock, on the morning of the 10th of June, from what Henan said to me, I went to Cut Throat-lane, and saw the two prisoners there, near the Grove-road - Clark had the basket; I asked what he had got - he said goslings - he could not tell me how many - I asked if they were his own - he said Yes - I took him to Hackney watch-house, where we found four goslings in the basket; but in going along Brewer made off, and pretended that he knew nothing about it - I told the watchman to stop him, and we asked what he had done with the bags - he denied having had them, and said he knew nothing about them - I said "Your smock frock is wet with the bags" - he said it had been a wet night - we then went to the rye-field, and found the two bags - in one of them was the three goslings, and in the other the goose - we took them to the forest the next day - the goslings seemed to belong to the same brood - they went together directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner CLARK. The gentleman who owns the goslings, said he could not swear to them at the office. - Witness. I said I would not except the old mother owned them when she saw them.</p>
               <p>CLARK'S Defence. I was coming out of the country for work, and I found the basket with the goslings in it - I then met this man - we stood talking to some boys in the hay-field - I came on to a man who was shooting in the marshes, and met the patrol, who asked me what I had got - I said goslings, which I had found on Holly Bush hill, and said they were mine.</p>

On the 25th of May I received information that some iron plates had been taken from the rail-road on the premises; I went about eleven o'clock in the morning, and missed a pair of plates- I had information, and saw them that afternoon, when John Wyard brought them to the premises, about three o'clock; I know the prisoners by sight; Chamberlain and Thomas Earl were in our employ as brick-makers; I had seen them about seven o'clock that morning; that was before I had received any information; I went about twelve or one o'clock to Chamberlain, and told him he had taken some of the iron railing; he said "Earl is in it too;" he said he had taken one piece to Henry Hughes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you threaten him, or offer him any thing? A. No; he said it had just gone into his dinner bag, and he had received one penny for it; he then told me Mr. Hughes offered him so much a week to bring iron in; he said he had taken it to the deaf man, Henry Hughes; but he said nothing more about this particular piece of iron; I had been to Hughes once before; I spoke to him, but I have never seen this particular piece of iron there; I met Hughes before the Magistrate the next day at eleven o'clock; I got a warrant against him the same day about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Where did Wyard bring these plates? A. To the premises, from a lane at the back of Old Brentford; I had not seen them before that; they weigh about 1 1/2cwt.; I cannot say what they are worth as iron; they are worth 15 shillings as plates, for a rail-way; West has worked for us about a fortnight; Hughes did not come forward voluntarily; I never went to him to demand an explanation; there was a person there who called himself Hughes' father, and said some boys had been there the night before; he said too much for me to remember; he did not tell me that iron had been brought and refused, and that I might look over his premises; I did not look, because I had good reason to know that the iron was not there then; I went to see if there was any more.</p>

I went with the two Earls and young Chamberlain, and got some iron, about one o'clock in the day - it was about a week before we went to the Magistrate's; we took the piece of iron from Mr. Trimmer's, and went to Henry Hughes, who gave us about 2s. among us - all my share was 5 1/2d.; the men were at their dinner; we went through the field, and Thomas Earl took up some little pieces of iron, and put them into his pocket; after that Farn and I took a pair of plates; Chamberlain, the two Earls, and I took the rail roads about a month before we went to the Magistrate's.</p>

            . I am shopman to Richard Hodge and Henry Loman, of Regent-street. On the 19th of June the prisoner came and asked to look at some lace, and after she had left the shop I missed a piece; I followed her, and said she had a piece of lace that did not belong to her; she said immediately she had, and it was found in her basket; there is about twenty yards of it - she had laid out about 2s. 10d. for lace.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Where was this lace? A. It was laying by the box, on the counter; I did not observe that her basket was open - I think it was in her lap all the time; I am confident the lace could not fall into the basket; she opened the basket directly, and said she had it; I cannot say it did not get in by accident.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was the lace she bought found? - A. In the basket - there was a yard and a half of that.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The piece dropped into the basket, by his moving the boxes on the counter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

I lost some trusses of hay - in consequence of which I wrote my name on some little bits of paper, and tucked them into some trusses of the last I had purchased, which stood near the door, on Thursday, the 15th of June, and, on the Saturday following Morgan, my lad, told me he missed some hay. I went and counted the hay, and missed two trusses - I got an officer and a warrant - I went to their stable about five o'clock in the afternoon - I found the two prisoners there, and two trusses of hay with the papers inside; I said I thought it was my property - they said it was not; I showed the officer the papers in the trusses in my lost, and then he came down again, and found one paper in one truss in Jessop's stable, and the other was found at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe Jessop is the owner of the stable? A. Yes; the other acts as a kind of servant to him, and has slept there two years - they both said it was not my hay. Jessop does not sleep in the stable. There is an opening in the lost over the stable, and a piece of an axletree of Jessop's came through into my stable, which my man gave him again; I was there at the time, and told my man to pull it through, as it might be lost: I do not know of any sack coming through. Holding said he knew more about the hay than Jessop, as he did not sleep there.</p>

I searched one truss and found this paper in it.

            . I am an officer. On the 26th of May I saw the two prisoners going up Golden-lane; Tunbridge had a stove on his back - they went into an iron shop, and then same out; I took them to the watch-house, and asked where they got it; Tunbridge said "Kidman went into an empty house, and tied a string to it, and got it out" - I asked the man in the shop what they came for- he said they brought a stove to sell for 6d., and he sent them to fetch their father.</p>

I missed two hives on Sunday night, the 11th of June; I took Camp, the officer, the next evening, to Thomas Blythe's house, which is a about a mile off: I found him and his son at home; I asked the father to let me look at his bees; he said I might look and welcome; I found two of my hives on his premises; I knew them by the sticks I had put for them to swarm on. I told Blythe he had got two more hives than his own; he said No; I said there were two of mine, and I would stand to it. The Magistrate ordered me to take them away, and I took them the night following. I have seen Wilson about my premises.</p>

            . I live next door to Skinner. In consequence of information we got from Leonard Bailey, we went to Blythe's; Skinner went in, and, as soon as he had sorted the hives, he said he had two more than his own; Blythes both said they had not; Thomas Blythe said they would swarm in their own hives, and he had swarmed them himself, and he knew of none coming on his premises but what he hived himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. When you first arrived who did you see? A. Both the Blythes - they were within hearing; the hives were found in the bee-house, ten or twelve yards from the house; I do not know whether they belonged to the father or son. There were two bee-houses on the side of the house - they were concealed from the road.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with Skinner to Blythe's, and asked if he had any hives belonging to Mr. Skinner - he said No; I said "Mr. Skinner says there are two here, which he can swear to;" Blythe said"You may look and welcome?" Skinner then pointed out two - I took them into custody; as we were going to the cage John Blythe said he had bought them of two lads, named Taylor and Wilson; I do not think Thomas Blythe heard that; I went next morning and took Wilson - I asked if he knew any thing about it - he denied it, but in the afternoon he said "I shall tell all about this after I get to the Magistrate's;" he then said he was bathing in the river, with young Blythe, that they saw and took them.</p>

            . I live at Edmonton, and work on the barges. I was at play near the Angel one Wednesday, with Wilson and Taylor; John Blythe came up and Wilson said to him "Will you get us that?" John Blythe said Yes; and Taylor said "Where shall we go?" Wilson answered "There is some at Tottenham;" Blythe then said there were some at Hornsey, at Bury-street, some at Mr. Sand's, and some at Mr. Skinner's; Wilson said they would go to Hornsey after some - Taylor said very well; Taylor then said he was going up Tottenham - Wilson asked when he would be back - he said about eleven o'clock, and Wilson said that would be time enough - Taylor said they would be out all night.</p>

I went out on the 5th of June, and returned about eight o'clock, and there was a boy of the name of Smith talking to the prisoner - I asked what he wanted - he said he came to ask for work - I told the prisoner to lock up the place - I went home and got my supper, and dozed in my chair till about eleven o'clock - I wondered the prisoner was not come - I went down to my shop, and found the door was open - the watchman had fastened it with a nail - I went there the next morning, and missed the materials for two waistcoats.</p>

About six weeks ago the prisoner brought me a bushel of coals, but I cannot say what day it was - he could not give me change for half-a-crown - he said, "Never mind, let it be till next week;" I gave him a shilling, and left the remainder till next week, when I gave him 1s. 8d., which made all right.</p>

I had been out on the 8th of June, and had two or three pints of beer; I was going home a little before eleven o'clock at night, down Long-alley; I went into two public-houses to look for a cabinet-maker - first into the Admiral Vernon, and then into the White Swan, but I could not find him. The two prisoners followed me out of the White Swan, and as I was walking home four persons came and surrounded me, knocked me down with a stick, and cut my head; Sayer took the money from my pocket while the others surrounded me; I felt his hand in my pocket; I had five half-crowns of George III. and one of George IV., one shilling, one sixpence, and 2d.; they ran away. I pursued Sayer closely, and called Stop thief! he struck me several times, and knocked me down close at my own door; I was taken up for dead; he was taken by Cutbill. I have seen the money since; I believe King got away at that time, but he was at the office on another charge, and I knew him; I had not known either of the prisoners before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain of these men? A. Yes; Sayer is the man who took the money from me and beat me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. What are you? A. I am a journeyman upholsterer - I work for Mr. Cutbill; I had a sofa doing for him. I never had a brain fever, and have never been attended for any complaint in the head. I began to drink that day about four o'clock; I had been to several places. When I was before the Magistrate, the first time, I mentioned I had been robbed, and said I had six half-crowns and 1s. 8 1/2d.; I had a sovereign from my wife, and that was part of the change - it was all in my right-hand breeches pocket. The prisoners had been in the public-house, but I was not a minute in the house - I only went in to look for my friend, and came out; I was attacked in the street a few minutes after I left the house; I raised a cry of Stop thief! a great many people ran after them - there was a great crowd at last. There were a great many persons running after the people who were running away. I swear I was perfectly sober; I believe I had taken three or four pints of beer, or I might have had five - I had not drank any liquor; it was in Long-alley, Moorfields, which is a great thoroughfare.</p>

I heard the cry of Stop thief! while I was at supper - I got up, and saw some people running towards Finsbury-market; I saw Sayer running towards me; I opened my arms, and caught him - I gave him to the constable.

            . I am a headborough. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and came up while Cutbill had got Sayer on the ground; a stick and handkerchief were brought to me at the watch-house - I found on Sayer six half-crowns, a shilling, a sixpence, and 2 1/2d., which he brought out of his pocket. I found there were five half-crowns of one coin, and one of another.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prosecutor that night? A. Yes; he did not say what sort of money he had lost. I went to him the next morning, and asked what he had lost; I told him I had found some money, but I did not tell him what; when he described the money I told him it was just the money I had found.</p>

            . I am a journeyman baker. I knocked at Mr. Henman's door - the prisoner passed me with these two mattresses - I made room for him to pass; Mr. Henman came down and called to him to stop, two or three times, and then he was secured.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I tell you a gentleman desired me to carry them? A. No; you said it would be all one a hundred years hence.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A gentleman called to me, and said "Will you carry this bundle to No. 45, Old-street, and I will pay you?" I took it up to follow him, and then this gentleman called to me to stop, and I did - the gentleman had gone forward. I am a poor man in the work-house - if I was to die this very minute I came by it innocently.</p>
               <p>JOHN LORD re-examined. Q. Did you see any gentleman near the place? A. No; the prosecutor asked his reason for taking them, and he kneeled down and begged a thousand pardons for him to let him off.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ, and had the principal management of a place in Seymour-place, Bryanstone-square, Mary-le-bone; he left me on Monday, the 27th of May; three lamps had been taken from a customers - two of which were sold by my consent, and one was taken into the shop or store-room in Seymour-place; I afterwards missed it; Grady, my apprentice, gave me information, and the lamp was found at Drummond's, who is an occasional helper to my men; I cannot identify it, as I had not seen it before - it was bought of Edwards, in Crawford-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. You are a watch-case-maker? A. Yes, but I have lately undertaken some gas-works. I am ignorant of the manner in which this business is conducted, and employed the prisoner to conduct it for two or three years. Mr. Edwards, of Crawford-street, wanted some lights, and a job was done for him to the amount of between 8 and 9l.; the prisoner told me he took three lights in part payment for the work, and I was not pleased that he did so without consulting me - he did not say he would take them himself, and make me the same allowance; he did not say he would get the other cleaned and lacquered, and I should sustain no loss.</p>

            . I was in the prosecutor's employ, but not when Cope gave me the lamp to get cleaned and lacquered; he gave it to me from the side of the wall, and told me it was his; I do not know whether he was in the prosecutor's employ at that time - he was about to leave him, but he had the keys.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then this passed honestly and fairly? A. Yes - he did not enjoin me to keep it secret. I believe the prisoner has since set up in business for himself.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is a kind of jealously between me and Mr. Clarke; I understood the business, and he does not. When I ordered the lamp to be taken I told the young man it belonged to me; I had agreed to fit up three lamps for Mr. Edwards, for 7l., and the old lamps - Mr. Clarke said the lamps were of no use to him; I said I could get 12s. for them at the next door, and he was to make me an allowance for them.</p>

            . I am a weaver, and live in Moorfields. On the morning of the 9th of June the two prisoners passed me and Mr. Almond - one of them came back to the other, and pulled his hat over his eyes; I stooped down: there was a gas-light, so that I had a good view of their features; I had known them by sight before - this was about forty yards from Rose-lane; Hubbard then came, and asked if two men had passed that way; we listened for a moment, and heard them running across the way; Almond spoke to one of them, and he said he was going home, but he ran off in a different direction; we ran different ways, and Almond took them in Whitechapel-road; Gent said at the watch-house, "I only did it out of a lark - I hope you won't lock me up" - Scott said nothing.</p>

            . I was with Glayton in Wentworth-street, near Rose-lane, on the 9th of June, between one and two o'clock in the morning; I saw the two prisoners running - Gent was first; I asked if they were going to bed; the watchman called soon afterwards; I ran one way, and Clayton another: we secured them. When we got to the watch-house the watchman said they were the two men who had taken the blankets; they made no reply, but, when the prosecutrix looked at the things, Gent said they only did it for a lark.</p>
               <p>GENT'S Defence. I know a young body in the house, and happened to go into the prosecutrix's room; I took the things off the bed, and put them on the stairs - I said"She will find them now." I went away, but did not run.</p>
               <p>SCOTT'S Defence. I was coming from the Theatre, and met the other prisoner; we went to the night house, had something to drink, and then Mr. Almond came and took us.</p>
               <p>JURY to Mrs. ABBOTT. Q. Was the bed made ready for you to go to bed? A. Yes; and the things were found rolled up in the passage. The prisoners are not known at our house.</p>

On the 1st of May the prisoner came to me, and asked if I wanted any money - I Yes, said if he could give me any - on the 11th of May, he said he had been to see if he could sell a ream of paper, but the man would only give 12s., and he wanted 14s.; I told my master, who told me to go on with it; the prisoner then said he could not sell that card paper, but he wished we could get a ream of post, and he could sell it; my master marked one, and gave it to the warehouseman to put in a particular place in the yard - the prisoner then came and placed half of it in his waistcoat and trousers, and told me to do the same; as we were going out the officer stopped us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you thought you was doing right? - A. Yes; I had not agreed to any thing before I told my master - I have been there three years - all the time the prisoner was there he bore a good character - Walton, the warehouseman, is in good health.</p>

I let the prisoner Edwards part of my second and ground floor, furnished, at two guineas a week; she brought Jones with her as a Lady's maid. She represented herself as having a daughter about to be married, and she had come from Bristol to take a furnished house for her, and wanted apartments for herself, her cook, and Lady's maid; she agreed to bring her own plate and linen; she came on Friday, the 16th of June, and was very tipsy - I thought she was ill - she said she had been travelling a long way; I made her a glass of brandy and water, and then left her to her maid; I told my wife to be careful of her; they went to bed and, I believe, got up together and went out the next morning. - When I came home at night I heard something which excited my suspicion; I went out on Monday morning, and came home about seven o'clock in the evening, and sat up that night watching - I saw Edwards, her cook, and her servant, on the ground floor, packing up some things; I went up stairs about ten o'clock, and my servant called me down, when I saw Jones lighting the cook out with a bundle; I then looked through the window, and saw Jones and Edwards, with a bundle under each of their arms, with the door in their hands, ready to go out - I heard one of them say "Hush - they are coming!" I went in and stopped them; I found part of a pot of honey, and one of my silver spoons, in one basket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner EDWARDS. Q. Did you see me packing any thing up? A. Yes, and when Jones was going out with the basket you took it from her and put it down. You had this honey and spoon, a Stilton cheese, and many other things, in it; this spoon is mine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you leave this spoon in the room? A. No - they had got it somehow - it had not been lent to them.</p>
               <p>EDWARDS' Defence. This young lass brought up three spoons in the morning, with the breakfast, and afterwards she brought up but one - I said "Where are the other spoons?" she said they were down in the kitchen - I did not know the spoon was in the honey.</p>

I returned to his house, and found the articles, which I have here, in the back front room; I then went up stairs, and, in a room which was locked, I found some pistols - I was about to open a box - the prisoner said that was the worst job of all - I there found some musket and pistol locks.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. Does not Mr. Gold deal in malt very extensively? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Rush in your service still? A. No - he went away; he did not give any account of this till the others were in custody.</p>

            . I was in the service of Mr. Jones about six months; I became acquainted with Townsend, who is a harness-maker, about Christmas last; he asked me, more than once, to get things from my master for him - at last I agreed; he came and called me up in the morning, and I let him into the yard, to get some of Mr. Jones' oats - it was in January, but I do not know on what day; I got up, and was down in the stable between six and seven o'clock - he went up to the loft, and got three sacks of oats; he brought one sack with him - the other two sacks were in the loft, empty, and they were filled that morning; two of them had the name of William Gold, Brentford, on them; he threw them out of the loft, and carried them upon his back; I went with him with the last sack, to Seabrook's premises, and put them into a cart in the shed; they remained there till the evening, covered with hay; I met Townsend that evening, and went to Wighton's house; I did not go on Seabrook's premises - I stood in the road; this was before I went to Wighton's; Butler was with us - Wighton then came, and took two sacks away from Seabrook's premises, in a wheelbarrow - Seabrook was on the premises, I saw him take the third sack out of the cart, and shoot it into the stable; I went down to Wighton's - the two sacks were then taken out of the wheelbarrow by Wighton and Butler, and taken to the back premises; I staid in the road - one sack was brought back by Townsend, which he gave to me, and I carried it back; it had the mark of William Gold, Brentford; I went with Townsend on the Saturday following, to Wighton's house - he was not at home; we then returned to Seabrook's, and he was not at home; we then went to Wighton's, and he was at home - Cooper was in his shop; Townsend went in, and Butler said, "What are you come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220072"/>after?" he said, "Money for the corn;" Butler went to the back premises, and Wighton came out; they had some conversation, but I could not exactly hear what it was; Wighton said, "What do you want for the oats?" he said, "I do not know exactly;" Wighton said, "I will give you 8s. a sack - I have had some from the bargemen for that;" he paid down 16s. on the blocks, for the two sacks; Townsend took it up, and said it would do very well, and he threw back a shilling for Cooper and Butler to drink; Townsend and I then came up the street together - he paid me 4s., and said he would give me 4s. more. I ran away on Sunday night, the 22d of January, and was apprehended by the patrol on the 22d of May. I was going to tell him of it I had been taken up two hours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. Upon your oath, when you were before the Magistrate did you not say that you saw one of the sacks shot into the bin in Wighton's stable? A. Yes; and I persist in saying so now.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know that there is no bin in it? A. I did not say into the bin - I said I saw it shot; I do not know exactly whether there is a bin in it - there must be something to shoot it into. I cannot read.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Then how do you know the name of Gold was on it? A. Because there were some sacks came from him.</p>
               <p>JOHN EMERSON. I am an officer. I apprehended Wighton on the 24th of May - he said, "I know what you want - it is about the corn job."</p>

On the 16th of May, at half-past one o'clock, I was in the shop - a friend came to read the newspaper; I then-went to dinner, and at a quarter before two o'clock I opened my shop door, and saw the prisoner's hand within my window; I said, "Good God, I am robbed again;" I ran through the shop, and turned to my right; I collared him, and brought him back - I found nothing on him, but I had lost four gold watches, which cost me in manufacturing about 90l., and a movement, which cost twenty-five guineas; I found a runner dropped into my area, which is here; I have found nothing else since - I had seen the property about fifteen minutes before, laying on a tray; a piece of glass was cut out of the window, and the prisoner's little finger was cut, and bled profusely; I do not suppose it had been ten seconds from my first seeing it and taking him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me by the side of the window? A. I saw your hand in the window, and then ran to the door; I then saw you walking very leisurely down the street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know that the hand which you saw was the prisoner's hand? A. I cannot swear to that; I had not lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Looking through your window did you see anybody but him? A. I saw his hand - I ran out and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I running or walking? A. Walking.</p>
               <p>Q. You said at first, that I had been trying to cut your window? A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do you think I would lay in a prison if he came and offered me money to tell him where the property was? Witness. I did not - I have never seen him since he has been committed, nor any human being from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you bring an old woman with you, and she said, "That is him" - and you told me I should get acquitted if I told you? A. No.</p>
               <p>ANN HEDGES. I was passing Mr. Ham's door on the 16th of May - I was standing by the window for a moment, as I had a bad cough; the prisoner and two other young men were there - they said something about me; I went to turn back, and the window snapped; the two others then went down Holborn-hill, and the prisoner staid; when I heard the window crack I went away directly; I saw Mr. Ham come out and collar him; I was going to speak to the beadle, but he came and took him; the prisoner is the man who had his hand in the window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What did I say? A. You said you did not want any coughing old b-s there. I saw Mr. Ham coming, or I should have gone in and told him; he collared you, and your finger was bleeding.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HAZLEWOOD WORRAL. I am an officer, and took the prisoner into custody; the prosecutor accused him of having his finger cut, and taking some watches; there was nothing found on him - he said he lived with his mother, at No. 19, Union-street, and she kept a stay-shop - I went there, but there was no such person. Here is the runner which was found in the area.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a holyday on Monday and Tuesday, and went out to take a walk - I was passing that gentleman's window; I was twelve yards off when he came and said I had been trying to cut his window.</p>

I saw the handkerchief laying as I was going along. I sent for a constable - he asked me what I detained him for; I said he should go, but I would have my handkerchief first; a person in the crowd then asked if I would let him go if I got it; I said I would have it first, and then I would see. I took the prisoner into Crown-court, and a woman gave me the handkerchief through the crowd. The prisoner then got through some railing, and I tried to get him out, but could not; two gentlemen came up, and got him out, I am certain the prisoner was the person I saw running away.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you was in Crown-court did you observe me running? A. I did not see you till my handkerchief was stolen - you was then going from me; I observed no other person near me, but the gentleman who spoke to me. I was reading a paper; I believe he did say he saw a handkerchief laying down, and he would show me where it was. I did not ask the woman how she became possessed of it; the examination was put off to try to find her, but we could not.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Baylis, a pawnbroker, of Aldersgate-street. I have seen the prisoner at our shop - he pawned fifteen mahogany chairs, which I took in, and I believe some more, which I did not take in; they were pawned in the name of John Dexter; I showed them to Mr. Stacey, and have one of them here now. On the 13th of June the prisoner pawned two candlesticks, and two sets of ire-irons. I am certain he is the man.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 13th of June I was there rather sooner than usual; I got my work done, and then took home a box of linen which my wife had. On my return the house-keeper asked how many chairs there were - I said I did not know, I thought there were two dozens and a half; she said No, there were but two dozen. She said when she went to the baker's that he told her he saw a man in a dark blue coat, coming out of the house with two chairs, and he went up Jewin-street; I was then anxious the chairs should be counted, and there were but nineteen left, making seventeen deficient; a gentleman then called me up stairs, and I went and told him - he said he thought it better to take no notice, as probably the thief would come again. I sent for an officer, who said he had not a doubt it was a man named Collins, who was well-known about the Inns of Court. The pawnbroker swore on the first examination that he took in the chairs, but could not say of whom; on the second examination he said I took fifteen.</p>

I went, and found the prisoner in the passage; he took out of his pocket and eye-glass, and a pair of silver sleeve-buttons - he said they were all he had, and those he took off the drawers. - The constable took charge of him, and this key was found on him at the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Smithfield, about five minutes before one o'clock, on this morning; the prosecutor passed me, and said "Good night;" he had his watch chain hanging out of his pocket then; when he had got by, about ten yards, Griffith and Callaghan came by together; Callaghan said, "I think we shall have a good draw to-night;" Dow was just before them; I followed them, and when they got to the Rose-inn. Griffith went in front of the prosecutor - I did not see him take any thing; I saw the prosecutor take hold of him, and he said, "Watchman, this man has got my watch and chain;" I took hold of him, and saw the others holding their hands as if to take it - I called to Clark to take Dow, which he did as soon as he came out of the pens - Callaghan then came up; I told him to keep off, or else he would get into trouble - he went, and came up again with a short stick, about as thick as my wrist; I then said, "I will take you;" he put out his foot to try to throw me, but could not - he then struck me on the head - I had a silk hat on, which was cut, but it warded off the blows - he then ran off, and a gentleman tried to stop him; he struck at him, and knocked him down; I pursued him with the rattle, some other gentleman attempted to stop him; he nearly knocked him down, but he stopped him; I came up and took him; I found the chain and seals the next morning close by the spot; the prosecutor was not drunk; there were some girls there, but it is my opinion they were not with him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was about a hundred yards from Mr. Horton, and saw him pick up the handkerchief - I ran to him directly - I saw him take hold of the prisoner, and I took charge of him - this is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there any other people in the street? A. There might be about half-a-dozen - some of them were nearer than I was.</p>
               <p>COURT to Mr. HORTON. Q. Is that your handkerchief? A. I think it is, but am not certain - mine are not usually marked - it is like them I have - I had eight of them, which I brought fairly - I do not know what became of the others.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to my sister's - there were three boys - I never saw them till I got into Clements-lane - they took and threw the handkerchief by the side of the truck - the gentleman was walking on - they came behind me, and said "Have you seen any thing of my handkerchief?" and said it was me, or one of my companions.</p>
               <p>COURT to Mr. HORTON. Q. Did you mention to the prisoner about his companions? A. No - I said to the officer, afterwards, that he had another with him, who ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was he from you when you took him? A. Forty or fifty yards - the second person ran away. I had not observed him, so as to notice him.</p>

I was with him almost instantly - I lost sight of him as he turned the lane; I brought him back - the handkerchief was given to me; I am not certain whether it was by Coleman himself or not, but it was taken from his bosom. It is but justice to state, that Coleman appeared very penitent, and I have also heard so from two or three persons who have called on me about him.</p>

            . I saw the two prisoners in Cannon-street, about half-past two o'clock, on the 1st of June; I watched and saw them walk together near Mr. Cox - I saw Allen lift up the tail of his coat with one hand, and, with the other, take out the handkerchief and give it to Coleman, who put it into his bosom; Mr. Cox turned round and laid hold of Coleman - I went and took hold of him, while he ran after Allen; I asked Coleman to give me the handkerchief, which he pulled out of his bosom and gave me - he said, at the watch-house, that he was in great distress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then Mr. Cox brought back Allen? A. Yes - he had lifted up the pocket quite gently - the prosecutor did not run after Allen till he had taken Coleman; when he took Coleman Allen was walking, and nearly across the street - Allen saw him catch hold of Coleman, and then dart at him, and he ran.</p>

I opened the paper of brown hose - he said they were too coarse, and asked for some finer - I went for some others, and as I came back I looked at the same place, and saw the parcel was not there; I opened the paper very quietly, and showed them to him - he said, "I don't much like them - I will be contented with what I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220077"/>have selected - you will make a bill of them, and send them to Broad-street, and the money shall be sent;" I walked with him to the street door, and said, "Are you sure you have selected all you want?" he said, Yes. - When we got near the cuter door I took him by the collar, and said "You have something about you belonging to me;" he seemed surprised - I took off his hat, and in the bottom of it lay a dozen pairs of silk stockings. A gentleman came in, and I sent for a constable. They cost me 5l., and I should have sold them at a profit.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty on Sunday morning, the 28th of May, at half-past four o'clock, and saw a coach stop on Snow Hill, about one hundred yards from Mr. Clark's; I afterwards saw it was No. 324 - the coachman got off the box, and let a man out of the coach; I did not see any other person - the man and the coachman had some discourse for a short time; he was about Snow-hill and King-street for about half an hour; I was on the opposite side of the way - the coach moved on to Smithfield, and then down to Holborn-bridge - it remained there some minutes, and then came up again and went on to Smithfield - it then got on towards five o'clock - that enabled me to see the coachman, and I believe the prisoner to be the man - the man who got out of the coach joined him again at Holborn-bridge - the coach was empty as far as I could judge; I am sure it was the same man who got out; he was lame with one foot, and had one shoe down at heel; they conversed two or three minutes - the coach then went up Snow-hill and into Smithfield; I followed it - the man was walking along the pavement, and the coach driving leisurely; when they came to Smithfield they stopped at the corner of Hosier-lane - it was then five o'clock; I thought the coach was waiting to go into the Hospital; I went into the watch-house and mentioned it; two of our watchmen came out directly - the corner of Hosier-lane is about fifty yards from Mr. Clark's - my time was then up; I am on the Snow-hill beat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You had full opportunity of seeing the number? A. Yes; there was no concealment about the coachman; I saw him on the box - he staid there a short time and passed me again; he saw me; if I had thought he was about any thing wrong I should have gone and seized him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you able to say positively that it was the same coach that was driving up and down for above half an hour? A. Yes; I have no doubt it was the same coachman; I believe the prisoner is the man; I have no doubt of it; I will not swear positively to him; I read the number on the coach at a quarter before five o'clock, and put it down; I did not look at the number the first time it passed me, but I am sure it was the same coach; I should have known it without the number.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was coming out of the watch-house, and Rice gave me information - I went to the corner of Hosier-lane with a watchman, named Tilling, about a few minutes after five o'clock; I saw the coach at Mr. Clark's door; I saw a humper put into the coach by two men - it was such a hamper as shoes and boots are put in to come to town - there was one man in the coach, but I did not see him; I am sure the prisoner was the coachman on the box; the coach door was shut, and the two men went on and beckoned the coachman to follow them, which he did - they turned up King-street; the coach continued to follow, about twenty yards behind them, till they came to White Horse-court, Cow-Cross, and there they beckoned very strongly and disappeared; I saw no more of them - the coachman went down Cow-cross, along Ray-street and Back-hill into Gray's Inn-road; I there saw the coachman turning round, and talking to the man in the coach; I went on to just on this side Cromer-street, and saw it turn up, and there I left it, being tired, and went on; I did not know I had authority to stop it; I asked the other watchman if I should do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was broad day-light, and the coachman was sitting on his box at the door? A. Yes; he had as good an opportunity of seeing me as I him; if there had been any one up in the house they might have seen the coachman sitting on his box, if they had looked; he did not get off his box or go into the house.</p>

            . I am a constable. I found the owner of this coach; I found it returning, and the prisoner drove it; I took him into custody about half-past eight o'clock that morning; I asked about his being hired - he said he was, in the usual way; he told me he had certainly carried those goods away in his coach to a place in the Edgware-road, just on this side the Red Lion public house, where it was met by two persons, who took out the goods with the assistance of the man who was inside; I asked if he had any idea where they were conveyed - he said No, but he supposed they might be conveyed to some of the wharfs of the Paddington Canal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On your asking him "Do you recollect doing so and so," the man candidly answered Yes? A. Yes; and told me the spot he took them from in Hosier-lane, and where he took them to without the least prevarication; he told me he had been hired by some man to do it; I went to his lodgings, but I found nothing there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you went to watch his coming home, did you tell him what was suspected? A. Yes; I told him that in presence of his master - when I told him of the robbery he never denied it; I mentioned Hosier-lane first.</p>

               <p>Q. From the outer appearance of the house could the watchman have had any idea of its being broken open? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I go out about six or seven o'clock in the evening, and return about eight or nine in the morning; I was engaged that morning between four and five o'clock by a gentleman, to drive down Holborn-hill - he then asked what would be the fare to take him and three hampers to Paddington Canal from Hosier-lane - I said 3s. - he made some objection, but agreed to give it me - he turned down Hosier-lane, then turned back, and said he should not want me just yet, but if I would turn back to Snow-hill, and get something to drink, he would come to me - there was no house open, but he came to me in about ten minutes, and I went to Hosier-lane - he knocked at Mr. Clark's door, and two men brought out the hampers and put them in - he told me to drive on; I saw no man running before me to beckon me; I drove on to Gray's Inn-lane, down Cromer-street, and on to Paddington Canal, and by the Red Lion two men met me and took the hampers out.</p>

I gave her in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a private patrol at the Royal Exchange. On the 8th of June, between three and four o'clock, I was in St. Paul's-church-yard; the children were coming out of the cathedral - there were a great many persons at the North gate; I saw the prisoner go up to a gentleman, and pick his pocket of this handkerchief; he put it into his left-hand breeches pocket - I endeavoured to get near the gentleman, to speak to him, but could not; I followed the prisoner - he was never out of my sight; I took him to the Goose and Gridiron, and found the handkerchief in his left-hand breeches pocket - it appeared to be the very same he had taken from the gentleman. I found another handkerchief in his hat, and in his trousers I found a gown, wrapped round him. I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you ask a gentleman standing by, if he had lost a handkerchief? - A. Yes; but that was because he was endeavouring to pick another pocket, which made me ask the gentleman if he had done it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had bought the gown and handkerchief in a public-house of a woman; I had not been at St. Paul's, ten minutes, when the officer took me; this handkerchief was one my mother gave me.</p>
