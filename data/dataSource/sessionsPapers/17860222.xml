               <p>Was the prisoner a <rs id="t17860222-1-deflabel4" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>When was he discharged from your husband's service? - I think, to the best of my remembrance, it was a month the Thursday before the deed was done.</p>
               <p>What business was your husband? - A <rs id="t17860222-1-viclabel5" type="occupation">milk-man</rs>

               <p>What was the occasion of his being dismissed from his service? - It was that he did not do his work against his master came home.</p>
               <p>How old is this prisoner? - I think he is between eighteen and nineteen.</p>
               <p>Where did he come from? - Out of Bedfordshire: I understood he went to see his mother, in Bedfordshire, after he was dismissed.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay away, before he returned to your house at Kentish town? - I think about a week or ten days.</p>
               <p>Did he come to your house after he returned? - Yes, he did come to our house several times, and I gave him victuals several times.</p>
               <p>Did your husband know of that, Madam? - My husband knew that he had been to the house, but he did not know that I gave him victuals.</p>
               <p>How did he employ himself after he came back to Kentish Town? - He had very little work to do after he came out of the country.</p>
               <p>Then he hardly earned his living, did he? - No, my Lord, he did not, and that was the reason I gave him victuals.</p>
               <p>Did he lay at your house after he returned? - Not to my knowledge he never did.</p>
               <p>But do you know in fact that he did, though without your consent? - No, he never lay a night in the house that ever I heard of.</p>
               <p>When did this accident happen? - On Saturday morning, the 11th of February, I found it out.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning? - It was about ten minutes after two or rather better.</p>
               <p>Was you in bed? - I was.</p>
               <p>In what room? - In the room under where my husband slept.</p>
               <p>Was you called or how? - I have a little girl of four years old lay with my husband.</p>
               <p>A daughter of yours? - Yes, the child called me, that waked the other in the other room, and my little boy after called to me at the top of the stairs.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - I did not hear her call, it waked the other in the other room, my little boy, who lay in the other room, on the same floor, he lay along with Trotman, and he called me.</p>
               <p>How old is that boy? - Ten years old this September.</p>
               <p>What is that Trotman? - A lodger in the house.</p>
               <p>Is he a man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is his Christian name? - John.</p>
               <p>Did the room where Trotman and your little boy lay communicate with the room where your husband lay? - Only the stair parted them, my little boy came and knocked at my door, and told me his father wanted me, I went in directly, and by the light of the moon, he seemed to be quite black with blood from his face to his waist, the moon shone very bright, and there are two large windows in the room, he was sitting up in the bed, and as far as his waist appeared black and covered with blood.</p>
               <p>Did he speak to you, good woman? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220004"/> When I saw him, I said, Horseman, my dear creature, what is the matter with you? he said to me, Lord bless you! something has run over my face; I said, Lord bless you child! run over your face! why you are nothing but blood; he made me answer, have you got a candle? I said, no child, I did not wait for a candle: I went down immediately, and got a candle, and when I came up, I found him beat and cut all to pieces; his forehead, and his eyes and nose were cut all to pieces; I asked him to tell me how it came, and he said I do not know, do not ask me, I do not know how it came. I called Trotman up, to go and fetch his nephew to me, and likewise to order the doctor and surgeons to come, that live at Kentish Town, then I went and got the pillow case off the pillow to wrap round his head, to try to stop the blood, then I got him to lay down in the bed, then I turned myself round in the room, and I found a stick laying by the drawers between the fire-place and the drawers, I took the stick up in my hand, this is the stick, but there was no blood upon this.</p>
               <p>(Produces a hedge-stake.)</p>

               <p>Did you ever see this stick before? - I saw it at the time it was cut, which was the Sunday before this accident happened.</p>
               <p>You never saw it in your husband's room before? - No, it never was there before.</p>
               <p>Who cut it? - Trotman and the prisoner went out on Sunday to cut some sticks, and they brought in three.</p>
               <p>Who had that? - This was the prisoner's stick.</p>
               <p>Did he bring it in with him? - To say whether he brought the stick in his hand, or whether Trotman brought them all in, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Why did you say it was the prisoner's then? - Because it was a rough stick, cut off an elm tree, when it was brought in the prisoner cut it round the head as you see.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do that? - I saw him doing it on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>What did he do with this stick after he cut it round? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see it after he cut it round till this time? - I have seen him with this stick in his hand when he has been out of the door.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him with it more than once? - I cannot say whether once or twice, but I have seen him with it.</p>
               <p>Do let us look at that stick.</p>
               <p>(The stick handed to the Court: it appeared upon inspection to have lead poured into a hole in the top.)</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any thing done to this stick besides cutting it round? - No, I never did; then I took this iron bar standing between the fire-place and the drawers, the drawers are not a yard from the fire-place, it appeared to stand leaning one end of it against the fire-place, and the other against the drawers.</p>
               <p>Was there any appearance of blood upon it? - Yes, there were marks of blood upon it, and several hairs upon the end of the bar, but I believe by carrying it backwards and forwards they are off.</p>
               <p>Was the blood fresh? - Quite fresh, it was then.</p>
               <p>You could not have any account from your husband how it happened? - No, he never could give any account till the time he died; it was done on Saturday morning between one and two, I imagine it was, and he lived till the Sunday se'nnight following, till the 19th of February.</p>
               <p>Was he in his senses till he died? - Yes; he had not the least idea how it happened, he never could tell how it happened.</p>
               <p>Was his scull fractured? - Yes, it was, but I did not understand the nature of any thing of the kind; but it was cut and mangled in a desperate manner.</p>
               <p>What was the reason you did not lay with your husband that night? - My Lord, I did not lay with him for six or seven nights, I have a little child about fourteen months old, that was very bad, cutting his teeth, and to prevent disturbing my husband, as he worked so hard, I lay with a woman.</p>
               <p>Was your husband used to sleep sound? - Very sound in his first sleep, till he waked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220005"/> about four o'clock, and then he used to be very wakefull.</p>
               <p>Have you any thing to alledge against the prisoner at the bar for being guilty of this? - No other, but by finding the stick in the room, and likewise the stairs being so critical, I thought it was impossible for a stranger to have done it, without taking any thing.</p>
               <p>How could a person get into your house without being let in? - God Almighty knows, my Lord, I cannot tell how, unless he got in, in the evening, and concealed himself in the house.</p>
               <p>When you went to bed, did you fasten all your doors and windows? - I fastened all the doors, my Lord, the windows down stairs are not made to open.</p>
               <p>How are they above? - Above they slide up and down.</p>
               <p>Sashes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether these were fastened? - They were all down when I went up stairs, we never did screw them, only slipped them up and down at pleasure.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of them up in the morning? - No, never a one of them.</p>
               <p>Was there any little room of any kind in your husband's room, or within it? - No, there was none, there are three cupboards in Trotman's room, they are the length of the room, to put lumber in.</p>
               <p>Were these cupboards down to the floor? - No, not down to the floor, I imagine they are a yard from the floor.</p>
               <p>Then a person to get into one of these cupboards must have stepped upon something? - They might have stepped upon the bedstead, which is under the cupboards.</p>
               <p>Is there room for a man to stand up in it? - No, they must either lay down or sit in it.</p>
               <p>Is there a cupboard in your husband's room? - No, never a cupboard there.</p>
               <p>Your husband, I find, discharged this prisoner from his service, upon account of neglecting his duty, and not doing his business against the time of his coming home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was his reason? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any enmity between them? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>So you know of no grudge from the prisoner against your husband? - No, my Lord, I never heard anything of the kind.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether any thing was taken away this night from your husband? - I missed nothing but a few farthings, which were in a bason, in a closet where we kept our china, in the room where my husband lay.</p>
               <p>How many farthings were taken away? - I cannot say precisely to the quantity, but I imagine there might be about sixpenny-worth, there were a great man more that lay in rows, in sixpenny-worths, there might be half-a-crown's-worth for what I know.</p>
               <p>That was all you missed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is this all the evidence you can give? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Will the prisoner ask any question of Mrs. Horseman? - No.</p>

               <p>Could he tell how it happened? - No, he never said a word to me; Mrs. Horseman desired me to light a fire immediately.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of a stick? - Yes, I saw the prisoner at the bar send for a pipe, and melt lead in it.</p>
               <p>How long was that before this poor man was wounded in this way? - As nigh as I can recollect, it was either Tuesday or Wednesday before.</p>
               <p>How did he melt the lead? - He put lead in the bowl of a tobacco pipe, and put the pipe into the fire, and I saw him take and pour it into the hole of the stick.</p>
               <p>Look at the stick and shew us where it was? - Yes, I will take my oath to the stick, here is the place where it was poured in.</p>
               <p>Court. (Looks at it.) Gentlemen, you will look at it, but it seems to be of no consequence, it is only to fill up the hole.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner when he melted the lead? - At Mr. Horseman's house, he stood directly by the fire, nobody was in the house but me, and the child in my lap.</p>
               <p>How long before Mr. Horseman died, did you see the prisoner at his house? - As nigh as I can recollect it was four or five days.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him at the house any time after he melted the lead, till the time Mr. Horseman died? - He has come into the house after Tuesday, but he has not stopped.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he ever lay in the house, after he was turned away? - Never, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you lay there every night? - Mrs. Horseman, and me, and the two children, lay together every night.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Mr. Horseman ever saw him in the house, after he was turned away? - Not to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Court to the Headborough. Was it his voluntary offer to go back or was he persuaded by the people to go back? - We were all gone away over the way, and while we were there, there came in news that there was a confession.</p>

[Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and then added,] Gentlemen, this evidence is only circumstantial, yet it produces a very strong suspicion certainly in one's mind against the prisoner, but to say there is any direct testimony against him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220013"/> nobody can assert, but they lay a very strong foundation to introduce the confession he has made: I should not for one, though he is very near the state of manhood, chuse to rest singly and merely on his confession, as he is not at full age, though he is above that age of discretion, which the law assigns to be at the age of fourteen years, and certainly it is near the time that human reason is supposed to be mature, therefore, I thought, and my learned brother, and Mr. Recorder agree with me, that it was extremely proper to have the whole circumstances of this case laid before you by evidence; these circumstances, Gentlemen, you have heard, and I cannot but say they operate very strongly on my mind to introduce this confession: Now, the headborough, who seems to be a very sensible man and master of his business, has given a very full account, I think, to authorise and warrant the Court to permit this confession to be read; the Justice of the peace is, I find, an old gentleman, or else he should have attended the Court, but the prisoner having absolutely persisted in his innocence, until they were carrying him off with the commitment, he, in the presence of the headborough, voluntarily, as he swears, begged and intreated to be carried back again to tell the truth of the case before the Justice of the peace; the Justices were all gone except Mr. Machin, he tells you that all sort of time was given to him, that he made this confession with all sort of deliberation, and that it was read to him: I think it unnecessary to read it over to you a second time, it cannot have escaped your memory, it is a full express confession of the fact, and he takes the murder entirely upon himself, and declares that no one else was concerned in it; there is an expression in it, whether true or not, that he did hear Mrs. Horseman express a wish that her husband was dead, whether that was the motive or spring of this horrid action I cannot say: Now he says he is innocent, and that with respect to this confession, some people after he was gone out suggested to him that it was better he would tell the truth, and that would clear him; that is not very consistent, I think, to suppose a man who confesses he is guilty of a wilful murder, and so barbarous a murder as this is, that he should be cleared, that his life should be saved by making an ample confession of the crime, but the headborough being asked again, does expressly tell you it was the voluntary wish and confession of the prisoner: If you are satisfied, Gentlemen, upon the whole, that he is guilty, you will find him so; if you see any reasonable doubt, you will acquit him.</p>

               <p>(Proclamation made.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Prisoner, you have been convicted, upon evidence which excludes all possibility of doubt, of a crime in itself the most heinous of any that human nature can commit; we are told from sacred authority that the blood of the innocent cries to Heaven for vengeance and atonement, and the voice of God and man agree, that whoso shedeth man's blood, by man also shall his blood be shed: If such is the nature of murder considered in itself, how deeply aggravated is your guilt, when we consider the peculiar circumstances of your case, you have had no palliation from provocation or the influence of ungovernable and fatal passions, but actuated by the most deliberate and diabolical malice, the unhappy victim of your crime was the master whom you had served, who had never injured you, and to whom you owed nothing but reverence and duty; inflamed with the thirst of blood, yet deliberate enough to form an artful plan, for effectuating your internal purpose, you laid in wait for your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220014"/> master's life, and in the dead hour of night when all the innocent part of the family were lulled in rest and seeming security, you crept forth from your lurking place, and in the defenceless and harmless state of sleep, with more than savage ferocity you butchered and mangled your master in the most brutal and inhuman manner; for guilt so aggravated as this, all mercy from the laws of your country must be excluded; far be it, however, from man to set bounds to the mercy of the Most High; happy will it be for you if the attonement of your guilty blood, joined with the deepest remorse and repentance during the short time that remains for you to live, should prove sufficient to obtain that mercy from him hereafter, which justice must deny you here: In the fervent prayer, that his mercy may so work upon your sinful soul as to produce that change which is necessary to your salvation, it remains only for me to pronounce upon you the awful sentence of the law, which must inevitably be carried into execution, which is, that you be carried from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execution, there to be hanged by the neck till you are dead; and that your body be delivered to be dissected and anatomised, according to the statute, and the Lord have mercy on you sinful soul.</p>
               <p>Mr. Akerman. My Lord, the prisoner now says the accusation against the woman is false.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix to the Jury. Gentlemen, I beg you will ask him whether what he has said is true concerning me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix to Prisoner. Am I innocent of what you have said?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes: (the prisoner was taking away, but brought back again) She is innocent of every thing I have accused her with.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the motive that urged you to the commission of this horrid crime?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. It is thought proper by the Court that the sentence should be executed as near as conveniently may be where the murder was committed, make out the order accordingly.</p>

               <p>What did you find in the back room? - After searching that, I asked what rooms they had, and he told me there was a back kitchen, and I think a one pair of stairs; I sent Macmanus up for the key of the kitchen, and I stood by while he took this and a dark lanthorn out of the back kitchen; these three men were in the back parlour, there was no property there.</p>
               <p>What were these three men about? - They were standing upright round the table, I made no other observation, there was a paper laying before them, which contained some account, that paper, I believe, is in the hands of Mr. Jealous, this was on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. White. Look at the several articles that are produced? - I do, I have measured them since the robbery; and they all agree with the number book, and as for the waistcoat piece, some of the pieces were cut off for my children, and I have them also, and they all correspond.</p>
               <p>This piece corresponded with the number opposite to this in your number book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you swear that you had such things in your house on the 31st of October? - I can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you any doubt that they are yours? - None in the world.</p>

               <p>I went into the back parlour, I saw Tatham sitting by the fire, and M'Donald and Francis sitting round a little mahogany table, then Macmanus secured Francis and M'Donald, and I searched Tatham; on Tatham I found twenty guineas, and upon the table lay a piece of paper with some writing upon it; I then left Macmanus in the parlour, and came into the shop where I was present when the silks were found, but not when the silk damask was found; this is the paper that was on the table.</p>
               <p>Did you find anything else there? - I found a glove there.</p>
               <p>Can you explain what it means? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. According to the position of the prisoners sitting round the table, there appeared to be a kind of settlement of money, here is 514 which comes near the sum of the goods which were missing (The paper contained two articles 310 and 204 and another class of figures of pounds and shillings, 19 l. 14 s.) the 514 yards comes near the goods that are now missing, there was a yard that seemed not to have been long made use off, lay by the place where they were; Mr. Clarke said to the people, what I see you have been measuring, there lay the yards, and we absolutely thought this was the money that was found on Tatham, and that the other was the goods which they had sold which was deficient; there are seven hundred and nine yards missing, and there are two hundred recovered, now here is five hundred and fourteen.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220016"/>Court. Was any answer given by either of the prisoners when Clark said, I see you have been measuring? - No, I did not take any notice, but they all denied knowing any thing of the paper, though it lay before them on the table, nobody knew any thing of the hand writing or any thing.</p>
               <p>That was all the observation you made on the paper? - It was.</p>
               <p>(The paper handed to the Court and Jury.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan to Mr. White. M'Donald and Francis were searched, I believe, before you, were they not? - They were searched, and there was some money.</p>
               <p>Who took the money? - One of the officers.</p>
               <p>Which of them? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court to Clarke. Do either of you know whether any money was found on either of the prisoners besides Tatham? - Yes, Macmanus has it.</p>
               <p>Court to Clarke. In what condition were these goods? - They were rather in a rough state, they lay simply just as they do now, any body that is used to silk would not let them lay so.</p>

               <p>I went to Francis's lodging, on the same day that Mr. Clarke went to Tatham's, I was at Tatham's also; at Francis's I found this in a drawer in his lodgings, which was in Newtoner's-street, this is a piece of crimson damask silk which Mr. White owns; the other which Mr. White says is the same, was found in the back kitchen at Tatham's.</p>
               <p>Mr. White. This is part of the same damask, and corresponds with what we have at home, what we found in Tatham's back kitchen, and this corresponds with the admeasurement, when we took stock in October last, with the addition of this that was found at Francis's, it makes up the quantity exactly, and it is the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Macmanus. In Tatham's back kitchen, where this silk and damask was in a trunk, there was a board looked like an ironing-board stood out, and there was a piece of brown paper, and under the piece of brown paper, this dark lanthorn lay concealed; this damask was not with the rest of the silks, it was in a trunk that was locked, we had the key from Tatham; I went to Francis's afterwards, and found this striped piece in the corner upon a little shelf.</p>
               <p>Mr. White. I called directly to Clarke, and said, here is some of my property, I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan to Macmanus. You searched the two prisoners, M'Donald and Francis? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You found some money upon them? - Yes, I found two guineas and a half on Francis and on the other, there might be a guinea difference, I returned the money again.</p>
               <p>You found this piece of silk at Francis's lodgings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There are several lodgers in the house, I suppose? - I do not know, it is a neighbourhood I seldom go to.</p>
               <p>You do not know what parties reside in that house? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding, Prisoner Tatham's Counsel. I want to know whether the goods were not found in different places, they were not all in one spot jumbled together? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan to White. This is not an uncommon pattern, I suppose? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>You was not the only person that bought all that was made of this silk? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Then, Sir, is this not a common pattern for a chair cover? - We look upon it as such.</p>
               <p>There or thereabouts? - Yes, I bought them at a sale, a number of them, some I have made use of myself, and some I have sold.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the kitchen up stairs or down stairs? - Down stairs, a back kitchen.</p>
               <p>Clarke. The damasks were in a back kitchen, in a trunk.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to the last witness; on the 1st day of December, I saw the prisoner M'Donald in my master's shop, it was between eight and nine in the morning, when he came in, he asked for a pair of stockings, I shewed him several parcels, he went out without buying any, the stockings were laying on the counter, twelve pair and an odd one, when he came in; and about half an hour after, we missed them, and between the time we missed them and the time of his coming in, there was nobody there.</p>
               <p>Did you see him take any stockings while he was in the shop? - No, I had no suspicion of him; then Mr. Archer went and gave information at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan, Prisoner M'Donald's Counsel. When was this? - The 1st of December.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you missed the stockings, that the prisoner was taken up? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you was at Bow-street? - A fortnight to day.</p>
               <p>When you came there, you was desired to look round the room, and point the prisoner out, was not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had never seen him from the first of December to that time? - Never.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before? - No.</p>
               <p>I ask you upon your oath, if you could at first discover the prisoner or point him out? - I knew him directly as I saw him, I recollected in my mind, he was the man.</p>
               <p>What, without the officer looking at you or giving you a single hint, or speaking to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is this a pretty public street? - Not very public.</p>
               <p>Had you breakfasted when the man that took the stockings came into the shop? - No.</p>
               <p>How long after did you breakfast? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Where did you breakfast? - In the parlour.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220023"/>Can you now, at the distance of three months, swear that you breakfasted in the parlour, and that no person could come in and take the stockings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did your master go into the shop? - Yes, but no strangers nor customers.</p>
               <p>Had you a fire in the parlour where you breakfasted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How does the fire stand with respect to the window? - In a corner.</p>
               <p>Did you sit with your face to the fire at your breakfast? - No, Sir, I sat on one side looking at the shop.</p>
               <p>What had you for breakfast? - Tea.</p>
               <p>What else? - Rolls and butter.</p>
               <p>Did you butter them yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Who buttered them for you? - The maid, she came without coming through the shop, there are two doors into the parlour, one into the shop, and one into the passage, I am very sure the girl did not come through the shop.</p>

               <p>Was there any odd stocking with them? - No, here are nine pair which the prosecutor has looked at, and two were delivered to the prisoner's wife back, that were not owned; I carried the stockings I found to the office, they were advertized, and the prosecutor come and searched them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. What were the two pair of stockings that were returned? - Two pair of French ones, I returned them to Tatham's wife.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I hope you will do me the kindness to inspect into this matter; I have been very unfortunate, and am but young in business, and inexperienced; but I really had purchased these things in my shop, not knowing them to be stolen by different people.</p>
               <p>Court to Archer. Did you describe these things? - Yes, on Wednesday the 8th of February, the stocking trimmer, whose name is Thompson, gave me information, and I went with him, there were eleven pair produced, nine of which were my property, I knew them by the welt, and two letters, and a figure which distinguishes the quality; I am perfectly clear that they are mine, I am sure these stockings were in my shop on the night before the robbery when they were missed, they were there ready to be sent to the trimmers.</p>
               <p>Court. Describe the marks? - B. A. and 6. worked in the welt, the meaning of the mark is, when my father was in partnership, his name was Beckett.</p>

               <p>I was very ill with a sprained ancle, five weeks before Christmas, ever since the 28th of November; I had a letter from Counseller Pile in Essex, on the same day that the boy came up, when I was taken up, and he said he believed I was the man, and the man said, are not you sure he is the man, and he looked at him with a stern countenance, and he said, he was.</p>
               <p>Court to boy. You have heard what the prisoner now says? - I said, I was not very positive, but I believed it was the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said it several times.</p>
               <p>Macmanus. My Lord, the prisoner says I looked at the boy, and said, he must say it was him; when the boy went in the prisoner M'Donald was walking towards him, he went to the fire, and took the poker and stirred the fire.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was no poker.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was a poker, I saw him stir the fire.</p>
               <p>Court to boy. Have you any doubt now, whether he was the man or not? - No, Sir, I have not any doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. I refer to the former trial for the character of the prisoner M'Donald.</p>
               <p>Court. What are the value of the stockings? - About eight shillings a pair, that is not the extent of them.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Robinson. Did you send the boy with this bundle? - Yes, he was going into Brook-street, he was to carry these bundles into Castle-street where I live; this is one of the bundles I gave him to carry, I am quite sure of it.</p>

               <p>On the 10th of this month, in the evening, I was going along Sackville-street, about seven, and I saw two men lurking about the prosecutor's shop window, when I had passed the prisoner I suspected them, I clapped my back at the corner of Sackville-street, and watched them five or six minutes, and I saw the prisoner put his left-hand in his right hand-pocket, and pull out a rag or handkerchief, and he lapped it round his left hand, and with his left hand I saw him break the window, I am sure of that, but what he took I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you see him take any thing? - I did not, I saw him break the window, and I saw him take his hand out of the window, and as soon as he took out his hand, he ran away to Sackville-street, and I knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Did you see him put his right hand into that hole that he broke with his left hand? - No, I did not, I then took him into a public-house, the corner of Sackville-street, he was searched, and nothing was found upon him.</p>
               <p>After he took away his hand from the window that you saw him break, did you see him hand over anything to the man that you saw lurking? - No, I did not, I knocked him down once, and picked him up, and he fell down again, then I picked him up again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not I walking along with my hands in my pocket, and did not you come up to me, and strike me over the face, and did not I say, do you want to rob me; my Lord, he knocked me over the nose, and I put my hand into my pocket, and said, do you want to rob me, I had a few shillings in my pocket, they stripped me, and searched me, says I, gentlemen, this is not proper usage, and one struck me, and another struck me.</p>
               <p>Lowe. His clothes were not pulled off at the public-house, they were at the Rotation-office, he did not say that I wanted to rob him.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You did not see this man break the window, or catch hold of him immediately on your coming out? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>What kind of man was that which put you upon a wrong scent? - He was much such a kind of man as the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. In such a business as this, it seems to me to be very improper to put a watch of this value in a window.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have wires for that purpose, but they were not up that night, I am so fearful of being robbed, I generally shut my shop up at night, and leave my door open.</p>

               <p>The door of the shop was not broke at all? - No, they got in at the parlour door, we found the door open, the scutcheon was broke off the door, but whether that was broke before I do not know, and the lock was picked, and I saw some marks of tallow on the counter.</p>

               <p>I am a gardener and one of the patrol of St. John's parish, I came along Bowling-street, this house of Mr. Barnard's is a corner house, one window looks into Little Peter-street and one into Bowling-street, the two prisoners passed by that window.</p>
               <p>Did you know the persons of the prisoners? - I had had information of them before, I knew the tallest, Langford, before, I watched them for a quarter of an hour, I saw them both, during the time I saw Petrie passing the window, I could see them perfectly, I was but a little distance, Petrie fixed his back against the window in Little Peter-street, and I saw him fumbling along, while at this wooden pannel that he broke in, they both then went up Bowling-street eying the window.</p>
               <p>Did you see him break it in? - No, I saw him a fumbling, which made me have a strong suspicion that they meant to rob the shop; there is a court in Bowling-street, called Oliver's-court, and they both of them went in there; I saw them return and pass this shop, I went to carry my tools home, and I went for my cutlass, and I returned immediately, and when I returned the robbery was committed; the men were gone away, I went in pursuit of them; I took them before Justice Abingdon, and saw no more of them that night.</p>
               <p>Are you positive those are the two men? - Yes, I viewed them near a quarter of an hour or better, and they were not further from me much than you are, I am positive they are the two men, I passed them several times.</p>

               <p>Did you see the prisoners do any thing? - We saw them walk backwards and forwards looking in at the window, then they both joined together about the part where this pannel was broke, the pannel was pushed in with a knife, we did not see them brea n the pannel, they were in the dark<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220031"/> part of the window, but we saw them there, and saw them go by with nothing, and then Langford came away with a bundle, it had the appearance of cloaths, it came from the direct spot where that pannel was broke, the prisoners ran one one way and one the other, and we tried to overtake them but could not, and in about a quarter of an hour we took them, we met with them in Duck lane both together and took them, they had nothing with them, then we searched them, and found on

               <p>Jury. Was it the top of the pannel or the bottom that was wrenched? - It was the whole pannel, it appeared to have been done with a knife, and the knife we found on Petrie matched exactly with the impression of the wood.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Langford. Why did he not detect us when he first saw us? - We should have detected them if we could have got out soon enough, we thought that he meant to go in at the door, by peeping in at the door and the windows.</p>

               <p>I am constable of St. John's.</p>
               <p>Is the account that Persival has given a true account? - I can explain it a little better in some respects if you please; first I was called by Watson, he told me there were some thieves, I went with him, and we called on Persival on our way, when we got into Bowling-Alley, almost facing the house on the opposite side of the way, we met the prisoner Langford, and I believe Petrie, but I am not quite so clear to him as the other; says Watson, there they are; then we went into an area the corner of Tuffton-street and concealed ourselves, and presently they came back round into Little Peter-street to this place where the pannel was broke out; the low part of the sash they fill up with pannels instead of glass, and painted dark, which made it rather dark that we could not see what they were about; when they came back to Bowling-street to us to that particular place; immediately I saw the cloaths slide off the rail, and them two men at that identical place, I could see into the shop by the light that was in the shop, I saw very plain the cloaths slide off the rail, but I could not perceive their arms so plain as if the other pannels had been glass, one of the prisoners passed us and out-run us, we tried to pursue them, but we knew them so well we were in no doubt of finding them again: I do not speak so clear to Petrie as I do to Langford: We took them soon after in Duck-lane.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the dress of the other prisoner? - Not so well my Lord, we found these two knives upon them, and one of them matched with the impressions that were made on the wood, and it much about fits these things, they are rabbitted on the inside, and bradded in with bradds.</p>
               <p>Jury. What distance was the area you was concealed in? - About thirteen or fourteen yards.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Barnard. Had you had any occasion to take notice of this pannel before this evening? - They were all secure for what I know.</p>
               <p>Do you know that they were secure? - I am pretty clear they were, they were all safe between three and four.</p>
               <p>Jury. How high was the rail from the ground where the cloaths hung? - I cannot justly say, it was breast high.</p>
               <p>How low down was the pannel? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowles Prisoner's Counsel. Whereabouts is this cellar window of yours? - It opens into Court-street.</p>
               <p>How many months before this matter happened had you observed these boards? - No months nor days, I never saw it before the night of this robbery.</p>
               <p>Do you and your husband live alone in this house, or have you any servant? - I have a servant.</p>
               <p>How many lodgers have you? - A man and his wife.</p>
               <p>No more? - I have some people worked up stairs, but they do not lodge in my house.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure they could get their hand in where this bolt was unbolted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that other people have tried since this matter happened, and could not do it? - No.</p>
               <p>Have they not told you that they tried, and that it could not be so? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that all your lodgers were in bed at this time? - They were all up stairs at that time, I always see the doors fastened befo re I go to bed.</p>
               <p>Did you see all your lodgers come in that night? - I cannot say I did, but it is a thing impossible that my lodgers should come into this house that way, my lodgers were all in the house before I went to bed, I was the last person that was within the cellar.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to try the cellar window? - I saw it bolted safe the same night, my husband and me were both in the cellar, and we went to bed immediately.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure that this breaking of the boards was a fresh breaking? - I never saw it broke before, if it had been broke before I must have seen it; you cannot go in and out of the parlour without seeing it.</p>
               <p>Court. But however, whether it was broke or not, you are sure that window was bolted just before you went to bed? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Then if the door was broke before, if any man put in his hand and put back the bolt, it is a burglary.</p>

               <p>Are you any relation to the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What relation? - I am his brother, I have ever known him honest and industrious, but very credulous and unthinking; and it seems in my opinion, he has been tricked into this business, by the artifice of a fellow who has escaped with impunity; I therefore trust, that the Gentlemen of the Jury will consider the case of the prisoner at the bar, with that candour and deliberation, which will ever distinguish their sense, feelings, and virtues, and that their opinion will go with mine, that it was not an act of the prisoner's to defraud, but merely an action of stupidity; I have ever known him honest and industrious, he was left very young, he is a year older than me, I am twenty-five last October; but he is very easy of belief, he has not the discerning sense which should protect him from the artifice and deception of others, he has not that sense which would keep him from the artifice of the world; and, my Lord, on the examination in Litchfield-street, Houseman and his hostler were both there, and his hostler who is the man that delivered the horse to the person that hired him, was told he was to appear upon the trial, I have tried to subpoena him, but that man is kept out of the way; it seems to me to be a combination on the part of the prosecutor to a degree of malignance, and to obtain a reward: I hope therefore, Gentlemen, you will pity my feelings, and consider that it is my unfortunate brother's case I plead.</p>
               <p>Houseman. I saddled the horse myself, and my man took him out to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Where is that man? - He is with me now, he has never been out of the way.</p>
               <p>Has any body been enquiring after him? - I have never heard any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the Judges have determined upon a similar case to this, the case of Pares, that if the Jury are satisfied upon the circumstances, that at the time the prisoner obtained the horse, he then meant and intended not to go to Barnet, but to go and sell the horse, that that was a felonious taking, that was the determination in the case of Pares, there is a nice distinction, which as it runs so near, like splitting a hair, it is my duty to mention it, that is this; if on the circumstances, you think that the man really did intend at the time he came to hire or borrow the horse, to borrow it or hire it for the purpose of going to Barnet, as he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220038"/> and that he proceeded on the way, and then afterwards returned, in that case it would not be a felonious taking; but it must be his intention at the very moment of obtaining the delivery to behave in that fraudulent manner; if you conceive the intention to have arisen afterwards, that will not amount to a felonious taking: another thing I take to be perfectly clear, that is, that suppose upon this evidence, you should be satisfied that the prisoner did go to Barnet with this horse, and returned with the horse, and after he returned, instead of delivering it to the owner, sold it; there I take it to be clear law, independant of Pares's case, that he was guilty of felony, because you see the end and purpose of hiring a horse would be then over; now with regard to that you recollect, this horse quite fresh bled at his knees, he was cut, and the flesh hanging over his knees, and with all the appearance of being hard rode, now if you should be of opinion that the man rode this horse to Barnet, and came back again, the difference is from eleven to four, or half after four in the afternoon, then most clearly he will be guilty without any doubt; on the other hand, suppose you should not be satisfied that he did take it to Barnet, then you will consider whether on this evidence, you are satisfied that he did obtain the horse at that moment, with the purpose of disposing of it.</p>

             to Jury. Gentlemen, the Jury declared the very same thing in the case of the King and Pares, in 1779, Mr. Justice Ashurst tried that, and he stated it as my brother Gould has done, and left it; he reserved it for the opinion or all the Judges, and they were of opinion it was felony, and I believe the man was afterwards executed; and the Jury aid they were of opinion that the horse was obtained by Pares with intention originally to steal it, and that the pretence of going to Surry was a mere pretence and colour, and that at the time he had an intention to steal it: this is the case of the prisoner in my opinion, for this man comes in the name of one Edy, and instead of going to Edy's stables, he rides away with it.</p>
               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice GOULD.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman belonging to Wapping, I was setting in my watch-box about half past two in the morning, and I heard somebody coming along very nimble, and I saw two men run down Black-horse-yard, I immediately unbolted the door, I ran down after them, and caught the prisoner Clarke by the collar, and asked him what he had got there, and the other man called out Tom; I asked him what it was, he said it was only a bit of tallow; I brought him back to the watch-house with me, I took him to the watch-house, and the next day to Mr. Justice Smith's, and the prosecutor claimed it; I asked him where he got it, he said from on board a ship down at Black-wall, I told him he must be detained till the morning, I know nothing further.</p>

               <p>Did you see her take it off the counter? - No, I did not, I never saw her take it till I saw it stick out behind.</p>
               <p>What value is it? - It is valued at thirteen shillings, but it is worth more money than that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were two other people in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that so? - Yes, there were some people at some distance.</p>
               <p>Did any of these persons observe her take the petticoat, and put it under her cloak? - No, my Lord, they did not.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen this woman in the shop before? - Yes, she had been a customer many times.</p>
               <p>Did you know where she lived? - She told me she kept a shop in Monmouth-street, but I found she had left that ever since Christmas, she did keep a shop in the ready made line.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is that the coat upon the child she has with her? - I believe it may, it is the same colour.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went into Mr. Steel's shop to buy this little coat, I did not say I lived in Monmouth-street then, but he knew I had lived there; he asked me six shillings and sixpence for the coat, I gave him five shillings and sixpence for it, he lifted it up, and put it under my arm, and I told him, that I wanted one of a dark colour; he went up stairs and fetched one, and asked me to try it on, I told him, I did not like the colour nor the buttons, he offered to change the buttons, I took off my cloak, and he fitted on the great coat, I told him it was too tight, he wished me to have it, and he went behind me, and said, it fitted me very well, and he picked up a petticoat, the young man had been there wrapping up some petticoats, and he said, I dare say you have had this petticoat under your cloak.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the account she gives true? - Some part of it is; about fitting on the coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the petticoat drop down when she first pulled off her cloak? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. It is very extraordinary if you thought she had been guilty of a felony in stealing this, that you did not proceed to charge her? - I hesitated with myself, whether I should let her go off quietly, as she had been a customer before; and then I thought to let her go, when I had got her, as we had lost so many things, was not right.</p>
               <p>Court. Might not it have been brushed off the counter? - No, it could not.</p>
               <p>Could not she have taken it up by mistake? - I am confident it was a petticoat she had under her arm by the feel.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was she willing to pull off her cloak, or did she hesitate? - No, she hesitated; she said, she would bring a lady to suit herself, but when I went past her, I felt through her cloak, and it felt like a stuff petticoat, it was not half a moment before I charged her with the petticoat.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you charge her with the petticoat, before you tried the great coat, or afterwards? - Afterwards.</p>

               <p>On the 24th of January last, in the evening, coming home past the prosecutor's house, I heard a glass give a smash, and I saw the two prisoners at the window, there was no one else near it, I was about six yards from them when they dropped the property; there were handkerchiefs, and some aprons, one or two, I picked them up in a hurry, the handkerchiefs were either sewed together or pinned together, but the apron was separate from the others; these are part of the things that I picked up, but whether they are the whole I cannot tell, I am sure they are the same that I picked up, I delivered them to the prosecutor directly; stooping to pick the things up, I lost sight of the prisoners, and in the course of ten minutes or less, I saw them again, a woman apprehended them.</p>
               <p>Had you any knowledge of the prisoners before this time? - No; I did not cry stop thief! there was a woman before them, she clapped hold of the youngest of them, and called out for the prosecutor, the prisoners never offered to stir, they said, they were going to the White Raven, to get a pint of beer; I will venture to swear they are both the people that broke the window; there was light from the window and the lamp, and they were under it.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 24, Tottenham-street, I saw the shutters nailed about a week before the robbery was committed, on Monday the 13th of February; I ordered the workmen to lay a quantity of rubbish against the shutters, and when I left the building, which was about five, the shutters were quite secure; and when I came in the morning, the rubbish was removed, and the windows open, and the lead gone.</p>
               <p>Was it necessary to remove the rubbish in order to open the shutters? - We could not get the shutter open before, that room<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220050"/> had been locked up for a week, but not the rest of the house.</p>

               <p>Do you ever sell goods with that mark upon them, Sir? - I always send them with the marks on, and with particular tickets.</p>
               <p>If you had seen them three pieces of gauze, in any shop twenty or thirty miles out of town, a day or two after, should you have known them from your shop mark to be the gauze you lost that particular day? - I should have known it to be my own mark, I should have known it to have been gauze that was in my shop at that time.</p>
               <p>There are other gauzes of that sort? - I do not know that I should have known it unless the tickets were on.</p>
               <p>Now from the probability of knowing these figures, can you take upon you to swear they are yours? - I think I could, I can swear to the hand writing of my young man who made these figures.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you safely to swear that you would know the figures of your clerk in distinction to others? - I could be pretty sure, I do not know I could swear to it.</p>

               <p>Is the mark the same as your shop mark? - The figures are the same, here is one of my own figures, I could not be sure it was my gauze, unconnected with this story.</p>
               <p>Or that it was gauze that was in your shop, at that particular moment that you describe? - No, I could not.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>What did you do? - He pulled me up from the bolster, and in the mean time my breeches were gone from under my head; and soon as I arose from the bed, I went to feel for my breeches and they were gone, I had my watch in my pocket, and a couple of shillings; it was a silver watch, I am sure I had that when I came into the room, I put it into my waistcoat pocket, I found all the rest of my clothes, but not my breeches, I went down stairs, and when I came up stairs again, this prisoner and the other woman were in the room, and I could not find my breeches, and I begged of them to get a light that I might find them: I had searched about, but when the light came I found them, and put them on. and was going down stairs to leave the place, I gave them very good words, and the prisoner pulled hold of me by the arm, and called the two men up stairs to come and search me, because I had said before, I had lost my watch and my money, thinking it was in my breeches pocket, and forgetting I had put it into my waistcoat pocket; when she had hold of me, she called in the other two men, and one of them came in, and swore a great oath, and said he would pull my bloody life out, if I did not produce the watch; the prisoner had hold of me by the right arm at that time, so that I could not have the liberty of my arm, and he snatched my watch from me, that was the man that had hold of my throat, the short one that took my watch, and the other went away; the two girls had hold of me, I tried to get after the men, and I believe I broke the hinge of the door, I went to call the watch, and the women came down, and before the watch came, they both run away.</p>

               <p>That was gone at the time I lost my breeches from under my head; I found the patrols, and they came with me to the same house, by the description I gave, and we found the prisoner wrapped up in the bedclothes, with all her clothes on in the same room, I am sure it was the same woman! I never got my watch again, the woman was taken by the patrols to the watch-house and lodged there all night, and the next day carried before a Justice of Peace.</p>

               <p>That gentleman went home with me, we had two pots of beer, and two quarterns of gin; when we had been in bed about an hour, I was awaked out of my sleep, and the door was burst open, and two men and a woman came into the room, I could not tell who they were, and a light was produced in the room, then I saw who they were, and he had got his clothes on, and charged me with having his watch; he said he had lost two shillings; I insisted on his searching his pockets, and laid hold of his arm that he should search, and he took his watch out of his waistcoat pocket, and gave it to one of the young men to see what it was o'clock, and the man went off with it.</p>
               <p>Jury to the Patrol. She gave you names that you were to make a search after? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you on your enquiry find that there were people of that name? - Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. After in your fright you had declared, you had lost your watch, who gave notice then? - As soon as ever I said, I had found my watch, the prisoner said, here, here, come and help and search this man, he says, I have stole his watch; no, says I, I have it; then when the man threatened me so, I took it out of my waistcoat pocket, and he laid hold of me by the throat, and with the other hand snatched it away.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you now in place? - I lost my place on that account.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Was you quite sober when they picked you up in the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any gin? - There was one quartern of gin, and two pots of porter.</p>
               <p>And you felt yourself quite sober? - Quite so, I went to the watch-house, and gave a description of the room, and the bed.</p>
               <p>Jury to Officer. You saw the prosecutor at the watch-house, did he appear to be perfectly sober? - He seemed to be rather flurried, but by no means in liquor, he gave us a particular description of the room, a hole in the window, and the bed on the right hand.</p>

               <p>Did you see any other person running in the street? - My Lord it is so clear, and I believe Red-lion-street is well known in this court, I saw no man in the street, I could see from the top to the bottom, I had not been I suppose half a minute while I was struggling with him, before the boy and the other people came up, and the boy said give me my watch cases, give me my watch cases; the prisoner said nothing to my recollection, only said he had not got them, several people came round and wanted to search him, and one of the persons that came first up, that laid hold of him with me was accused of picking a gentleman's pocket, or his hand in his pocket, or something of that sort, I therefore thought I was in a situation I did not much like, and I desired they would send for a constable, and that somebody would assist me, and nobody would, I then said to the prisoner, friend as the boy says you have taken his watch cases, I will take you to the magistrate myself, I then rather exerted myself, and took him to Justice Blackborough's; when we were there they proposed to go back to the place to look for the watch cases, and while we were there a message came that they were found in Dr. Haines's entry.</p>

               <p>Was the deceased in the inside of the house at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he come to the door also? - No, he was withinside the house, and when we stood at the door, Mrs. Angus, and her sister, Mr. Davis presented the piece and pulled the trigger, he presented it strait across.</p>
               <p>Court. Then if it had been fired at that time, it must have taken a direction over your heads? - I do not think it would have touched us.</p>
               <p>Did the gun go off when he pulled the trigger? - It did not, he pulled the trigger twice, then he dropped the gun down on the floor by the side of him.</p>
               <p>You being on the ground floor, and he in the one pair of stairs room, can you say what he did? - I saw him very plain, he then went to the other side of the room, and picked up another gun.</p>

               <p>Then that gun was presented in a different direction than the first? - I cannot say it was pointed the same as the first, it was pointed straight, but it came so quick, that I could not tell whether it was a pistol or a gun.</p>
               <p>What did you observe next? - While we stood at the door, the gentlewoman of the house was frightened, and at the same time, Mr. Thomas came up to us, and spoke to us, he is the beadle of the night, and Mrs. Angus said to him, there is nobody here but this young man, and my lodgers.</p>
               <p>What did the beadle say? - He spoke to Mrs. Angus, and she said there is nobody here but those that belong to the house, as soon as Mr. Thomas went away, Mr. Davis fetched up the piece that he had had in his hand before, and that did not go off, and then I said to Mrs. Angus, Mr. Davis has got another piece in his hand, and before I could speak the words out of my mouth, he presented the piece, and point-it to the persons at the door.</p>
               <p>Was that piece presented the same as the former? - It was presented in a line to me, when he presented the piece to me, it was not cocked, and while he was cocking the piece, I took one motion, a platoon exercise, to my left hand, then the gun went off, and this

               <p>Did he live sometime afterwards? - He lived till a quarter past six in the morning.</p>

               <p>What was his behaviour when he came over? - When he came over into the house, he looked at the man that was shot, and he says, the poor innocent man who never did me any harm in my life time, let nothing be wanting, but says he to me, I thought it was you.</p>
               <p>Court. Let me take those words correctly; he said, I thought the accident had happened to you? - Yes, he thought the accident had happened to me, he said, I thought it had been you, three or four times.</p>

               <p>What do you mean? - We had a few words about a pot of beer.</p>

               <p>Then it was some trifling quarrel about a pot of beer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner when he came into the house and saw the unfortunate man in the situation that you have described, desired that all possible assistance might be given him? - Yes, he did, and desired that nothing might be wanted for him.</p>
               <p>Was any body sent for, any surgeon, or any person? - Yes, there was a surgeon sent for before he came over.</p>
               <p>That was immediately? - Immediately as it was done.</p>
               <p>Did you see the shot? - I saw the shot in the surgeon's hand taken out of the man's heart, five shot.</p>
               <p>What kind of shot were they? - I cannot say exactly, but I think they were No. 2.</p>
               <p>That is a large shot? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner at this time say any thing that he did not apprehend the gun was charged, or any thing by way of excuse? - No, I heard nothing of that sort, I saw no more; I staid there till a quarter past six, and I saw the man die.</p>
               <p>What were your apprehensions of his death, that it was that shot? - There was a shot went in through his eye, and his nose, I saw a great many shot down his arm and his body.</p>
               <p>You have been in company with the deceased before this accident happened? - He had been backwards and forwards to my house before, then he was in perfect health.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot have any doubt in your mind, but this shot was the cause of his death? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>I live in Ratcliff-highway, near Old Gravel-lane, I was the surgeon that attended this man, these are the shot, they have never been out of my possession.</p>
               <p>You are not sportsman enough to know what number they are? - No, I am not.</p>
               <p>(The shot shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>You attended the deceased? - I did; when I went to see him, it was about a quarter before twelve, he was then laying on the floor about a yard from the door, I desired them to raise him up, and I examined the body; the prisoner Mr. Davis stood at my left hand, and observed to me, that there was no charge in the gun, to which I remarked, there appeared to have been some, for on removing his cloaths there were nothing but shot holes about his breast, the body was perfectly cold at that time, there was no pulsation in his heart, I ordered my assistant to endeavour to draw some blood from him, but he would not bleed; I had not the least idea of his bleeding, but merely for form sake more than from any expectation of his bleeding; I endeavoured to put some brandy down his threat, in order to stimulate the constitution, but there was no swallowing, there was not the least sensibility remaining, he was dead to all intents and purposes, he barely breathed and continued so to do, till six in the morning, I staid with him an hour; upon removing the breast bone, I observed the shot had penetrated the heart in several places, in diagonal lines, a great quantity of blood having extravasated the cavity of the breast, in short they passed right through the heart, and lodged somewhere in the back, the shot I have produced in Court, were the shot I took from about the heart and lungs, and there is not a doubt, I believe, remaining, but they were the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Upon the prisoner's telling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220068"/> you there was no charge in the gun, I do not know whether you went over to his room and found that the charge had been drawn? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Had any number of robberies been committed in that neighbourhood, that required guns to be charged and kept in readiness in case of attacks? - On the Saturday morning before the murder on the 28th, the house was robbed where this murder was done.</p>
               <p>So that the keeping a number of guns charged for preservation against thieves, was a necessary precaution? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Had you made any observations about the prisoner or his house before that accident? - I had seen him at the window, I saw him with either a gun or a pistol, I really am not sure which.</p>
               <p>When you stood at the door, who was in your company? - The deceased was on the left side of me, and Clifton was there, he had bid me a good night.</p>
               <p>Was your sister with you? - I cannot say, she says she was, but there was another woman on the other side, that I have not seen since the next day, she went away, her name is

            ; I was in the middle, and this woman was on the off side, and the deceased was on the left side.</p>
               <p>Was it before the report of that gun, that the man was killed, or the former? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the time, that the man received the wound? - I did not see him fall, I was close alongside of him, I might as well have been killed, and the woman and the gentleman that is at the door now.</p>
               <p>Was there any quarrel or enmity subsisting between you and the prisoner? - No, Sir, none.</p>
               <p>You lived in harmony and friendship? - Always, Sir, I immediately called out, and said, O dear! what have you done, you have killed a man, and he immediately came over to my house.</p>
               <p>When he came there what was his behaviour? - He took up the man's head, and said O dear! what have I done! I have killed a man that never gave me any offence; O what would I give, a hundred pounds, two hundred pounds, nay a thousand pounds; O dear, fetch a doctor, spare no expences; Mr. Thomas, the beadle of the parish, he came and fetched the doctor, it was not altogether above a minute and an half from the beginning of the accident, then they put me into my own back room, and the deceased was put on a chair, he lived many hours after, I went to lay down being satigued, the prisoner attended the deceased all night, and was very melancholy, and was sorry for what he had done, and said, he could not give that back which he had taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The prisoner did not seem to be a man that had an intention to take away the life of this man? - No, Sir, I saw him in the morning about eleven, at a house that he uses, and I believe, he was not out of his shop all day, besides I never saw him ill treat any person, I did not know of any ill will between him and Clifton.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted you was so taken up with the accident that you did not go over to Davis's house, to see if he had drawn out the shot of the piece? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived opposite to Davis? - I have been in the house nine years, I am a tenant to him, he is a most harmless inoffensive man, bore no enmity to any body, very ready to serve, and very backward to do unkindness; my house had been lately robbed, that called me to the door, to talk to Mr. Thomas, my house had been broke open, and they had stripped me of all they could find, the neighbours have kept firing every night since Mr. Davis has been in trouble, for we are not safe in our beds.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether this poor man had his shoes on when he came, or was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220069"/> a state preparing to go to bed? - I did not observe, he came over directly when he was called.</p>

               <p>About half after eleven, I heard the report of a gun, I saw the flash, I and the officer of the night were going by, I saw Mrs. Angus at the door, and some other persons with her, I cannot tell who, I spoke to her, I said it is almost time for you to go in doors and shut up your house, and she replied directly that she had been robbed the Saturday before, I asked her of what, and she said some brass candlesticks, and different things what they could catch off the mantle piece, and I told her I was sorry for it, and then I wished her a good night; a little time after, when I got about twelve or fifteen yards from the house, I heard the report of a gun or a pistol, I did not return immediately upon hearing the report, I went a few steps further, and then I heard a cry out Thomas, Thomas, murder, murder! that brought me back to the house, and there I saw the deceased laying on the floor; in the interim of time, Mr. Davis came in, and he exclaimed and lifted up his hands and said, what have I done? and he desired somebody to go for a doctor; and I asked him if I should go, and he said yes, and I said where shall I go, and he said go to Dr. Glouster, and there were two women knocked at the door, and I knocked, and he looked out of the window, and I told him to come directly, for there was a murder done in the lane, and he said he would not come; I then went to Mr. Horsefall, and he came directly, I came back with Mr. Horsefall, and he looked at the man and told us to lift him up on a chair, and I stood alongside of the man and he tried to draw blood, the prisoner was walking about the room all the time and wringing his hands, and expressed great concern.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing further? - Only the doctor gave him what relief he thought proper, he poured some brandy down his throat, then I carried him to bed, after I had put the man to bed, I said Davis, how came you to do such a thing, says he, God knows Thomas, I thought I had drawn the charge, the charge lays over the way now, if you will come and see it; and I spoke to the officer of the night, and I said is it not better to take Davis into custody, and he said gentlemen I am here do any thing with me you please, I will go with you any where; and he offered to surrender himself directly, so we went our rounds and returned again, and he said he would surrender in the morning, and I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You had no idea he would run away? - No, I had not, if I had thought so I would have taken him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220070"/>Do you know whether he had his shoes on? - I did not go over about the charge, Elby was not there, Stratford was there, he is in a dying state, and his wife and child; there are plenty of thieves and whores too in Gravel Lane, there had lately been a robbery in the prisoner's own house, he told me they had taken some lead, he told me that night he was going to have a private watch; I have been a beadle for three years, I never knew any harm of the prisoner in my life.</p>

               <p>I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, I beg leave to quote a case as similar to this, which Mr. Justice Foster recites, fol. 263, and is reported by Keeling,</p>
               <p>"which, (he says) I</p>
               <p>"think an extreme hard case and of very</p>
               <p>"extensive influence; a man found a pistol</p>
               <p>"in the street, which he had reason to believe</p>
               <p>"was not loaded, having tried it with</p>
               <p>"the rammer; he carried it home, and</p>
               <p>"shewed it to his wife, and she sitting by</p>
               <p>"him, he pulled up the cock, and touched</p>
               <p>"the trigger, the pistol went off, and killed</p>
               <p>"the woman; this was ruled manslaughter.</p>
               <p>"It appeared that the learned editor was</p>
               <p>"not satisfied with the judgment; it is one</p>
               <p>"of the points he in the preface to the report</p>
               <p>"recommends to further consideration;</p>
               <p>"admitting that the judgment was strictly</p>
               <p>"legal, it was to say no better of it summum</p>
               <p>"jus. I cannot help saying, that the rule</p>
               <p>"of law I have been considering in this</p>
               <p>"place touching the consequences of taking</p>
               <p>"or not taking due precaution, does not</p>
               <p>"seem to be sufficiently tempered with</p>
               <p>"mercy; manslaughter was formerly a capital</p>
               <p>"offence, as I shall hereafter shew,</p>
               <p>"and even the forseiture of goods and chattels</p>
               <p>"upon the foot of the present law is a</p>
               <p>"heavy stroke upon a man, guilty 'tis true</p>
               <p>"of heedless incautious conduct, but in</p>
               <p>"other respects perfectly innocent; therefore</p>
               <p>"where the rigor of law bordereth</p>
               <p>"upon injustice, mercy should, if possible,</p>
               <p>"interpose in the administration. It is</p>
               <p>"not the part of Judges to be perpetually</p>
               <p>"hunting after forfeitures, where the heart</p>
               <p>"is free from guilt; they are ministers appointed</p>
               <p>"by the Crown for the ends of</p>
               <p>"public justice, and should have written</p>
               <p>"upon their hearts that solemn engagement</p>
               <p>"his Majesty is under, to cause law and</p>
               <p>"justice in mercy to be executed in all his</p>
               <p>"judgments. This I have said upon a</p>
               <p>"supposition that the judgment reported</p>
               <p>"by Keeling was strictly legal; I think it</p>
               <p>"was not, for the law in these cases does</p>
               <p>"not require the utmost caution that can</p>
               <p>"be used; it is sufficient that a reasonable</p>
               <p>"precaution, what is usual and ordinary in</p>
               <p>"the like cases, be taken: the man in the</p>
               <p>"case under consideration examined the</p>
               <p>"pistol in the common way, perhaps the</p>
               <p>"rammer which he had before tried was</p>
               <p>"too short, and deceived him, but having</p>
               <p>"used the ordinary caution found to have</p>
               <p>"been effectual in the like cases, he ought</p>
               <p>"to have been excused. I have been the</p>
               <p>"longer on this case, because accidents of</p>
               <p>"the most lamentable kind may be the case</p>
               <p>"of the wisest and the best of mankind,</p>
               <p>"and most commonly fall amongst the</p>
               <p>"nearest friends and relations; and in such</p>
               <p>"a case, the forfeiture of goods rigorously</p>
               <p>"exacted, would be heaping affliction upon</p>
               <p>"the head of the afflicted, and galling a</p>
               <p>"heart already wounded past cure; it would</p>
               <p>"even aggravate the loss of a brother, a</p>
               <p>"parent, a child, or wife, if such a loss under</p>
               <p>"such circumstances is capable of aggravation.</p>
               <p>"I once upon the circuit tried</p>
               <p>"a man for the death of his wife by the</p>
               <p>"like accident: Upon Sunday morning,</p>
               <p>"the man and his wife went a mile or two</p>
               <p>"from home with some neighbours to take</p>
               <p>"a dinner at the house of their common</p>
               <p>"friend; he carried his gun with him,</p>
               <p>"hoping to meet with some diversion by</p>
               <p>"the way, but before he went to dinner,</p>
               <p>"he discharged it, and set it up in a private</p>
               <p>"place in his friend's house; after</p>
               <p>"dinner he went to church, and in the</p>
               <p>"evening returned home with his wife and</p>
               <p>"neighbours, bringing his gun with him.</p>
               <p>"which was carried into the room where</p>
               <p>"his wife was, she having brought it part<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220071"/> " of the way; he taking it up, touched</p>
               <p>"the trigger, and the gun went off and</p>
               <p>"killed his wife, whom he dearly loved.</p>
               <p>"It came out in evidence, that whilst the</p>
               <p>"man was at church, a person belonging</p>
               <p>"to the family privately took the gun,</p>
               <p>"charged it, and went after some game,</p>
               <p>"but before the service at church was ended,</p>
               <p>"returned it loaded to the place from</p>

               <p>"who was ignorant of all that</p>
               <p>"passed, found it to all appearance as he</p>
               <p>"left it. I did not enquire whether the</p>
               <p>"poor man had examined the gun before</p>
               <p>"he carried it home, but being of opinion</p>
               <p>"upon the whole evidence, that he had</p>
               <p>"reasonable grounds to believe that it was</p>
               <p>"not loaded, I directed the jury that if</p>
               <p>"they were of the same opinion, they should</p>
               <p>"acquit him, and he was acquitted."</p>
               <p>Court. If the jury are of opinion upon this evidence that the prisoner had an enmity to Clifton, and meant to kill Clifton, whereas he killed the other, I have no doubt but it is murder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. If you observe, he tries the gun twice, and then lays the gun down, and fetches the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. This was the gun that would not go off the first time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I am on the same side with my learned friend Mr. Silvester, and I hope you will forgive my saying a few words in addition to what he has said: I do not conceive that my duty necessarily calls upon me to say a word, because I am sure I should do injury to the impression which the discourse of the learned judge which he has just read must necessarily make on the minds of the jury. I conceive the argument goes the full length of asking the Court for an acquittal; I had not the smallest conception that there was any thing in this case that could in any view of it in which it could be put, put the prisoner into the peril of being convicted of murder. I know if there was a strong and conscientious doubt whether the prisoner, intending to commit one illegal act, committed another, which was not in his contemplation, that that in the eye of the law would be murder; but is that at all like this, or rather is not this exactly like the case stated in Keeling: it is manifest that the prisoner's object was not to attack the peaceful subjects of the kingdom, but to give notice to those that had already assaulted his peaceful dwelling, and it is in evidence by the beadle of the parish, that he had been driven to the necessity of appointing a private watch, and in the interim this man becomes his own watchman, which he had authority to do, in the doing of which he was committing no crime, he was committing no offence against the peace of the kingdom, and he discharges his firelock, either to try it, or to give notice to those that were lurking thereabouts; this it appears was the prisoner's intention; and that his first piece was discharged without any thing that could do mischief is manifest on the face of the evidence; for Clifton has told you, that the piece was fired off from a window of Davis's against the window opposite, and no accident happened; but then it may be said, he afterwards tried another. My Lord, if it is lawful to have one instrument, God knows the miserable state of society would very well justify him in having another to Mr. Davis discharged one piece, which he found sit for his purpose, and he attempts to discharge another; it does not go off; he then tries a second piece which had once missed fire, he discharged it in the same situation, then this melancholy accident happened; and what is the conduct of Mr. Davis as soon as it did happen? is it the conduct of a guilty man? Is it the conduct of a man that meant to shoot Mr. Clifton? Is it like the conduct of a man that meant to commit an offence against any moral duty? Why, he goes over with as much anxiety as any of your Lordships would have felt to rescue a man, who by accident in the sport of the field you had been the occasion of killing; he stays at the house all night; he offers to surrender himself to public justice; those to whom he surrendered, did not refuse to take his word, they were the jurors on the occasion; they came to him in the distance of three hours, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220072"/> they again refuse his solicitation to be taken into custody; he continues there still till all the world are awake, and then he goes and surrenders himself into the hands of public justice. My Lord, take it upon the evidence of Clifton himself, this man had had a little quarrel with him; why, he is the best judge whether it was almalice of such an extent as might provoke the very worst man in society to follow it up with a murder; Clifton says it was a trifling quarrel about half a pot of beer: your Lordship asked him,</p>
               <p>"Whether the quarrel was of</p>
               <p>"such a nature, or had proceeded to such</p>
               <p>"a heighth, that you had any reason to apprehend</p>
               <p>"that he sought your life?" - He says,</p>
               <p>"No, I cannot say I had."</p>
               <p>"Had</p>
               <p>"he made use of any expressions indicating</p>
               <p>"malice towards you?" your Lordship also asked, to which he replied,</p>
               <p>"No, not in</p>
               <p>"the least." Then, my Lord, let us see whether this is not precisely in point with the case in Keeling; in that case an accident happened, not with small sparrow shot like this, which pierces the heart and breaks some of the blood vessels, otherwise there is not another part of the human body in which it could possibly have produced death; this man draws the charge, he shakes out the shot in order to discharge his piece to give the alarm; some few shot still continue in the piece, without his knowledge. You may say, by his neglect death has ensued; I lament it, and so does the prisoner: All I ask is, that neither his life nor liberty shall be in jeopardy. I know that English Judges and juries do feel the force of the maxim, that judgment should be tempered with mercy; I know that juries rather prefer to find a man innocent than guilty, then I am sure they will very gladly coincide with Mr. Justice Foster, that it is a very hard law, because a man has not examined his piece with that scrupulousness which he ought, that therefore he is to be put in peril of being convicted of murder, and that at least he must be convicted of manslaughter. Your Lordships may have heard of a case at the proof of cannon at Woolwich; a man was found dead, he was at a great distance from the proof, upon examination of the body a pin's head was found to have entered into the heart of the man, a pin's head which had been in the cartridge; now would any body say, that if by accident a pin's head had found its way into this piece, which he had charged only with gunpowder, and that pin had found its way into the heart of the deceased, and therefore because he had not examined that charge, with that scrupulous nicety, that he should be put in peril of his life, or that any Jury should convict him even of manslaughter? My Lords, for these reasons which I have had the honour of submitting to your Lordships; I take the liberty with great deference to your Lordships, but with great confidence in the case, to submit that he ought not to be put in peril, but if there is any doubt on the case, thank God, we are prepared with that sort of proof, that will amply convince the Jury of the innocence of the prisoner at the bar!</p>
               <p>Court. Then I desire you will enter into that proof, for I am sure there is no proof of it yet: let either Clifton or Mrs. Angus stand up.</p>
               <p>Court to Clifton. What is the distance between the prisoner's one pair of stairs window, and the door of the house where you stood? - Twelve yards.</p>

               <p>I live almost opposite to this house.</p>
               <p>Is it usual to fire off their pieces in the evening? - It is, I have been robbed myself, in July last, and I discharge my piece twice or three times frequently in the course of a week: in the evening of the day after this accident, there was a mob collected round the door in the evening, and nobody there but a young person in the shop, a woman, I went over to desire the shop might be shut up to keep the mob out, then one of the officers from Shadwell came in, I went up with him, and took the candle, and a little girl went up with me, and I desired her to pick up the shot, which she did, and it is here; she picked up as much, I believe, as half the bowl of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220073"/> a tobacco pipe would contain, and there were two black marks which appeared to be circular, as if by the muzzle of the piece against the floor in order as I thought to knock out the shot.</p>

               <p>What sort of shot were they? - Four, I believe,</p>
               <p>They were not twos, were they? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation about any thing else? - No, when my house was broke open and robbed, I sent to Davis, I was without fire arms, and desired him to lend me one of those pieces, which he did, I charged it to defend my property, when I came to draw it, there was no screw to the ram rod, I got a screw made to it, and afterwards when Mr. Davis wanted a gun I sent it home with the new ram rod to it, and the new ram rod was much shorter than the old one.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Mr. Davis? - These four years.</p>
               <p>What is his character for humanity and temper? - I look upon him to be a jocose sociable man, I have rather seen him put up with insults rather than return them.</p>
               <p>Jury to Allen. How many guns were fired that night did it appear? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. How many guns did you see in the room of the prisoner, at the time you went up? - No more than one, and that gun the officer took away from Mr. Davis's room that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. The surgeon says, he saw a good many shot holes, and he says he reckons there might be about thirty, now you see across this street the shot cannot spread much, now supposing these thirty might remain: I suppose the whole charge of such small shot as that would contain at least two hundred.</p>
               <p>Foreman of the Jury. Aye, four or five hundred of this shot, I am sure there must be in a moderate charge.</p>

               <p>Are you sure the half-guinea he pulled out, and put down on the bar, was your half-guinea? - I cannot swear that was the half-guinea I gave to him, for he might have other half-guineas in his pocket, and give me one of them.</p>

               <p>Did you search the pockets of the man that we have called King to-night? - I do not wish to search any pockets.</p>
               <p>Did you? - No.</p>
               <p>You do not know then whether he had any other half-guineas? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>How long before you asked for your half-guinea had he put his guinea into his pocket? - I cannot say to minutes, I cannot pretend to say to a minute.</p>
               <p>You shall pretend to say; how long was it after he put his guinea into his pocket before he gave you the half-guinea? - The whole time they were at the bar till they were in the custody of the officer, was not more than fifteen minutes.</p>
               <p>I am not answered, and I will be answered; I shall ask you, till the Judge commits you, I will repeat it to you, and I will warn you, that I will ask you, till the Judge commits you unless you answer it; how long was it after he put his guinea into his pocket before he gave you the half-guinea? - I think I called my servant five times, and I do not know how long that would take me up; but as soon as he was coming down stairs to the bottom of the stairs, I imagine it might be three minutes.</p>
               <p>Did he put the guinea into the same pocket from which he afterwards took the half-guinea? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Did you give him the guinea, or did he take it up? - He took it up.</p>
               <p>Was not the half-guinea and the silver in the same hand of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you seen the prisoners since they were committed? - I saw one of them.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him? - In the out-room at Newgate.</p>
               <p>You went there to see him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To drink with him? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you drink with him? - I did not drink with him; I drank in the same room.</p>
               <p>You did go to the gaol? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you did drink in the same room; what liquor was it, wine? - It may be wine.</p>
               <p>Then, peradventure, you drank out of the same bottle? - I cannot say I did, or I did not.</p>
               <p>Will you swear now that you believe you did not? - I will not swear either way.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear now positively that you do not know whether you drank out of the same bottle of wine or not? - I do.</p>
               <p>Who paid for the wine he drank? - I paid for mine, I paid for some wine, and there was another person there that paid for the other.</p>
               <p>You immediately got your half-guinea? - How do you mean; I asked him for it the first time, and he said he had it not; then when my servant came down, I got between him and the door, and he gave it me.</p>
               <p>Have you got the guinea? - I never received a guinea from the prisoner; there was a guinea put down upon the bar.</p>
               <p>Did he take it back? - He did.</p>

               <p>I am waiter to Mr. Bowen. On the 20th of February, my master called me down stairs, and he bid me detain the two prisoners; and my master said to King, now<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220077"/> give me the half-guinea, you scoundrel, and he pulled out half a guinea from his pocket, and put it on the bar.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say any thing at all? - I did not; then my master sent for a constable, and detained him.</p>
               <p>Did you hear your master ask him for it? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say any thing upon that? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any conversation between your master and him before you came down? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Now recollect yourself whether King said any thing upon this occasion at all? - I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>Did he make no reply to that you scoundrel give me my half-guinea? - I cannot say that he did.</p>
               <p>If he had said any thing, should you have heard it? - I cannot say whether he might not deny it.</p>
               <p>Can you say he did? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any conversation between these two men, King and the other? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Not at all? - No; he was very much confounded.</p>
               <p>Did you examine either of them? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My guinea lay on the bar a moment after the prosecutor had my half-guinea; he says he never had my guinea in his hand, but he took it in his hand, and what made me give him the change, he said he could not conveniently spare the change, or else I should have taken it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow submitted that there was no case against Mathews to go to the jury: The Court over-ruled his objection.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You went to Newgate? - I did.</p>
               <p>How came you to go to Newgate, to speak to either of the prisoners? - The reason was this, an old woman of seventy years of age, with another woman, and three or four children, came to my house.</p>
               <p>Was it in consequence of any other application from any other person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You swear that positively? - Yes.</p>

               <p>About eight on Tuesday the 14th instant, there was a noise in the street, my man was in the shop, there was a cry of stop the rascal; my man laid hold of the prisoner, and he fell into the kennel; I laid hold of the prisoner then, I said you must be a rascal for you are the first that has come down this lane, I held him about a minute, he had nothing in his possession, the bag was right opposite my house at a neighbour's, I did not see him throw it; I saw the prisoner afterwards, and I knew he was the same man that I stopped.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came into the shop to buy a yard of linen, on Monday the 6th of February, and some lace lay on the counter, and at the same time I looked out the ribbon, I perceived her draw towards the lace box, I paid attention to her; in a little time I saw her draw a piece of lace out of the box, and convey it under her cloak, I then immediately charged her with it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220079"/> and after that charge, I heard the lace drop down on the ground, it was rolled on a card, there were about a yard and an half, I went on the other side of the counter, and picked it up immediately, she asked me how I could think of taxing her with any such thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You are shopman to Mr. Earle? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>What sort of a shop is yours? - I do not not know, it is like most other haberdashers shops.</p>
               <p>You take that to be the answer I was seeking for? - I cannot say what you was seeking for.</p>
               <p>What sort of a shop is yours? - I cannot describe the particulars of the shop, it is a common size shop.</p>
               <p>How many men may be employed in it? - That is rather uncertain, according to the time of the year.</p>
               <p>Lightish, I suppose, like other shops? - There is plenty of light in it; I am sure there was never a piece of lace on the counter when the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>Are you sure there was not one on the floor? - I did not go on the other side to see.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure of what you told me at first, that you saw the prisoner take it out of the box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You sent for a constable? - Yes, I do not recollect what he said, I told him we had detected a woman taking a piece of lace.</p>
               <p>Did not the constable tell you, that from your story, you could not hurt a hair of her head? - He possibly might.</p>
               <p>Did he or not? - I will not swear he did not, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect giving this answer to it, that whether you could or not, you would bring her here, because you had lost so many things in the course of the year? - I do not recollect.</p>

               <p>What did you say? - I gave an answer to this import, that as she had been detected of stealing it from me, I certainly would have her to Guildhall, and pursue her as far as the law would allow.</p>

               <p>So you do not like to take charge of a person, and do your duty, unless you approve of the evidence? - I asked Mr. Earle, if he saw her take the property, he said, his young man did.</p>
               <p>Court. Learn your duty another time; your business is to execute the law, and to take charges.</p>

               <p>Had it any mark upon it? - No, it appeared to be the same size to it, I have had an assay since of it, and it appears to be the same quality of that within three pence an ounce, the other piece I have not been able to get; it is only from my carrying it in my eye.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner at all? - He lived with me at that time as a <rs id="t17860222-30-deflabel178" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>On Thursday afternoon the 9th of February, about five, the prisoner brought this piece of gold to me to sell, I asked him how he came by it, he said he had it of one Mr. Turner; I sent to Bow-street for an officer, he told me he met a man coming into town, who got him to sell it; but however, I heard the prisoner acknowledge before the Magistrate that it was his master's property.</p>
               <p>Was there any promise made to him to induce him to confess the truth? - Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was present when he was examined, I heard him acknowledge taking the gold.</p>
               <p>Were there any promises made to him? - No, Sir; so far I told him, if he would give up the other part of it, I would shew him all the favour that lay in my power, but that was after he had made the confession, I am very clear of it.</p>
               <p>How large was the whole piece? - Three ounces one penny weight, the whole value is better than ten pounds.</p>

               <p>On the 6th of February, between one and three, I saw the prisoner take one loin of mutton, and part of another loin, two breasts of mutton, two joints of beef, and one pound of suet from the shop, and tied them up in his apron, to the slaughter-house, and laid them upon the tallow-board, and covered over with a cloth, I could not see into the slaughter-house; I sent for a constable; he said he only removed them for scouring the shop; that was not a proper time for scouring<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220085"/> the shop, as there was a large quantity of meat in the shop at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott, Prisoner's Counsel. How long has the prisoner lived with you? - About three months.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner assist in scouring the shop? - Yes; the meat was tied up as tight as it was possible for a man's apron to be tied up.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you he carried it there because it was dirtied, that it might be washed? - He did not say a single word; I saw him take it, in the room of hanging it up, he took it to the slaughter-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did this meat either want washing or scraping? - By no means.</p>
               <p>- HOW sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I found this meat tied up in a blue apron almost at the parlour-door; he said he did not mean to take it, he put it there to keep it clean; it was tied very tight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now the trial is over, I may say that I have a man here to prove that the prisoner has received thirty pounds at a time for sat.</p>

He asked me where I was going to, I said I was going to Broad-street; he had a knot on his shoulder, and had the appearance of a porter; I said, I have only a penny, and that I will give you for a glass of gin, to give me a lift; he said, No, I do not mind your penny, I do not mind giving a brother porter a lift; then he asked me if I could give it a shove on his head, and a lusty man lifted it off my head on his head; and going between Foster-lane and Gutter-lane, on that side <placeName id="t17860222-43-crimeloc238">Cheapside</placeName>

               <p>Who was hallooing out? - I suppose eight or ten gentlemen on the off side of the way; he came up soon afterwards, and said, what, are not you got any further? No, says I, and he asked me where I brought it from? I told him out of Leadenhall-street, and was going into Saint John's-street, and I took it down Giltspur-street, and this same gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220087"/> met us, and slipped down again, and he offered me threepence-halfpenny, and wiped his hands again; I told him I must not stop to take the money, and I followed the prisoner; he turned short into the hospital; the gentleman told me he was gone on straight forwards; I turned short, and when I came to turn to speak to him, says I, you are going, my cock, the wrong way; yes, says he, I forgot myself, I should have gone straight across Smithfield; then he brought it, and pitched it by Hosier-lane, and said; you take it a little way; I took it up, and he was off in a minute. I am sure the prisoner is the person. I went out again on the 26th with Mr. Lucy and young Mr. Cowland, and I saw the prisoner passing by St. Sepulchre's church, and I told the constable to meet me at Fleet-market, and we took him in Fleet-market; and before the magistrate he said his name was

               <p>What sort of goods? - Chiefly linens; I used to send linen abroad ready made, and she did the needle-work; I employed her for several foreign gentlemen, to make up great quantities of linen, and she was remarkably honest in bringing every little remnant, which is more than usual.</p>
               <p>So that you took her to be exemplary honest? - I did.</p>

I was a little alarmed; I sat in the kitchen to see who came in; I could not hear nor see any body come in for the course of a minute; then this man the prisoner Burdett came in, with his face half covered with a handkerchief; he presented a pistol to me, and said, if I resisted he would blow my brains out; I told him I would not resist, if he would spare my life; he then came round me, and put his hands over my eyes, and tied his handkerchief, or something, I cannot say what, over my eyes; then he took my hands, and tied them down behind me; then he got a blanket I had been ironing upon, and threw that over my head, and took my apron, and tied that round me with the string. I was in that situation while they robbed the house; they were in the house near a quarter of an hour, as near as I can recollect: while they were there,

I answered, and bid him told his tongue; he then came round to me, and he put down his head, and I asked him if they were all gone, and he said yes, they were all gone.

               <p>Had he a round hat? - I cannot tell whether he had a round hat or a cocked one; I know his face, but I do not know his hat.</p>
               <p>Consider that the lives of three men depend on what you say; and you was a good deal frightened? - Very much.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say upon your oath that you are able to swear to the upper part of a man's face, whom you never saw before, and whom you do not know what sort of hat he had? - I can; but I do not know what sort of hat he had.</p>
               <p>Had he any hat? - I do not know, I judge from the size.</p>
               <p>There may be more of the same size; how long had you lived with the prosecutor? - I had been in my master's service one month the 13th of February.</p>
               <p>I believe you was taken into custody? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect that four other persons, not the prisoners at the bar, were first taken into custody on suspicion of this burglary? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that other persons, besid es the prisoners, were taken into custody on this charge? - I do not know that they were.</p>
               <p>Do you remember being at the magistrate's with your master, when he told you, you should see the persons that were accused? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Did not your master, while you was in custody, and before you had seen either of these persons, tell you that there were persons that he meant to shew to you? - They were not shewn to me, I was called on one side by the gentlewoman at Mr. Wilmot's house, and she asked me if I knew any person in the room; I looked through the glass over the door, and saw Burdett there.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen Burdett before in your life? - Never to my knowledge, I had a light on the table when they came in.</p>
               <p>How much of a minute, or the third part of a minute, was it, before you was blindfolded? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>May be he waited a quarter of an hour looking at you, and contemplating? - It was done as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect your master's telling you that he had four persons to shew you, and that you told him it was quite unnecessary, for you should not know none of them? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that nobody said so to you? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>What situation was Armstrong in, do you happen to know that a handkerchief was thrust into his mouth, and that his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220091"/> hands and legs were tied? - I do not know; I heard him speak, and desire them to spare that watch which lay on the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>May be it was for you to cook the dinner by? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any thing about Rapson when these people came to the door? - No.</p>
               <p>Has you master a man of the name of Rapson? - Yes; I heard the men say, I have brought some work, is your master at home.</p>
               <p>Did not the man say that Rapson had sent some work for your master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was you doing? - We were going to tea, I was making a toast.</p>
               <p>Are you still a servant in Mr. Chancellor's service? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You have not lived a month in the service? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How long had Armstrong lived in the house? - I believe he had been there about a fortnight, he came after me, he was a workman, not a house servant, he did not lay in the house.</p>
               <p>They asked you where your master's plate and money was, you told them very readily, that you did not know; did you in fact, know where the plate and money was kept? - I did not know where the plate was kept, I knew there were three dozen of spoons that were sent from Dublin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Was this your own watch? - It was not.</p>

               <p>I am one of the officers; on Thursday, the 9th of February; about half after seven, Mr. Harper, Onslow, and I, and Mr. Bamford were at the office, and there came a young man, and said there had been a robbery at a house in the Mint, it is not above five minutes walk; he said the house had been robbed, I went to the door, and there were the maid and Armstrong, I made what enquiry I thought proper, I waited till Mr. Chancellor came home, he saw his house was ransacked, and I told him I saw plainly this robbery happened by somebody that knew the house, and I advised him to give charge of the servants, he did so, the next day they were fully examined, the girl was discharged, at dinner time; the prisoner Armstrong says to me; I will make you a compliment, if you can set me at liberty, that was the next day after the robbery, Mr. Chancellor came at night to see how the business had gone on, I said to Armstrong, have you got any thing to say to the magistrate, before you go to gaol.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This was after dinner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not Armstrong very drunk? - He was as sober as I am now; I told him what he had to say, he might say before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Was not that so communicated to him, and so understood by him, to your knowledge, that any thing he said might possibly be to his advantage, was not it under that impression; had not you previously prepared his mind by those sort of suggestions? - I did not know but what the magistrate would commit him.</p>
               <p>My question is a very plain one, capable of a very plain answer? - I told him with a view that he might be an evidence.</p>
               <p>But do not you believe that what he said was under an impression that it would be better for him? - He might say it with that view.</p>
               <p>Was not it under such an impression? - I cannot tell but what it might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I object to this confession being received.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot receive his confession under that impression.</p>
               <p>- TRIQUET, Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the magistrate before whom this young man was brought, he was brought to my house near nine at night, he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220092"/> perfectly sober, as much as I could discover, I could not perceive him to be at all disguised in liquor, he was referred for a further examination, he came with two or three officers, I was informed that he wished to say something to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Now before he told you what it was he wished to tell you, did you say any thing to him? - I told him I would go to my office, the clerk being there, it would be more convenient, besides there was a number of people; I went to the office, and when I came there, he wished to open his mind to me, he asked me if he could be admitted an evidence, upon telling me what he knew of the matter; I was a little cautious respecting what he might tell me, that perhaps it might not amount to sufficient evidence, and therefore told him, that unless he could produce sufficient evidence, with some of the property sufficient to convict two of the offenders or more, I could not promise any such thing; he then wished to speak to Mr. Chancellor; they went into another room, and had some conversation together; when they came in again, I asked them both what had passed, Mr. Chancellor told me that the prisoner had wanted to extort from him a promise not to appear against him, if his evidence should not amount to what we expected, and to bear him harmless.</p>
               <p>Was that in the prisoner's presence? - Yes; I understood that something had been intimated by him on that score, upon which I was rather angry with Mr. Chancellor for having held a discourse of that nature, without acquainting me, for I thought he had no right or power to make any such promise, nor would I consent to undertake any thing for the prisoner, till he had absolutely recanted that before me, and declared that he would make no such promise; upon which Mr. Chancellor declared that he recanted what had passed, and that he would be under no kind of promise whatever.</p>
               <p>Court. With the supposition you have stated, he had reason to expect he should be admitted? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Silvester. It seems to me that this confession cannot be received, though Mr. Triquet proceeded with proper caution; as to the fact of admitting him an evidence, he is guilty of no breach of promise in suffering this prisoner to be brought to his trial; for he is not a judge of what evidence will be given, and he makes a discretional promise; I cannot receive that confession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Triquet. I meant to say, that when he was brought up again, he denied the truth of all that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Tell us any thing else you know, but the confession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You understand that you are to tell us nothing that he said to you of any sort, but you may tell us any facts? - I have a watch here which the prosecutor swore to; this watch was produced by one

               <p>Which of the prisoners do you know? - Burdett.</p>
               <p>When did you see him? - On the 9th of February, between ten and eleven; he gave me a watch, he told me to save it till my master came home; I delivered it to the officer; I told him my master was gone to a cock-fighting in Portpool-lane.</p>

               <p>Did you see Burdett after that? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know any of the other prisoners? - I know Burdett and Brown by coming to my master's house; I know nothing of the prisoner Armstrong, having never seen him before.</p>

               <p>I see you know what the word fence is? - I do not.</p>
               <p>No! why then how happened it, was it by intuition, or a strange illumination, you should know what I meant: how long have you been with this pious family of the Knotely's? - Off and on these two years.</p>
               <p>Whenever Mr. Akerman did not find them servants, you attended them; how often has he been in trouble within these two years? - But once.</p>
               <p>Only once! Was that for the assault with intent to rob, or for the burglary, or the murder? - Murder!</p>
               <p>Oh, that you deny with both your hands; did you live with him when he was ordered for transportation for fourteen years? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you live with him when he was ordered to the ballast lighter? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any conversation with Mr. Knotely about this watch? - When my master came home, he was very much in liquor, and he told me to save it till the morning.</p>
               <p>The whole Friday intervened; now upon your oath, did not he desire you to keep it, in order that it might be evidence against some other person on a prosecution? - I offered it to Mr. Knotely; he told me to save it till he asked me for it; I never gave it to him afterwards. I kept it in my pocket, and directly as my master was taken, I put it under the stairs; my master sent for it.</p>
               <p>So when your master got into the hands of the traps, then he sent for the tick; you understand that, it is no Hebrew to you; your master got into the hands of the traps? - Yes he did.</p>
               <p>So you know what traps are then; upon your oath, did not he tell you that he should not be believed by a jury of Englishmen, unless you should confirm it? - He was going to make a present of it to somebody in the country.</p>
               <p>You swear that? - Yes; I do not know the name of the person; I carried it to Mr. Wilmot's.</p>
               <p>And there I suppose by a strange accident you was laid hold of; what way of business is your master in? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>Who supped with him? - I was backwards and forwards in the room with him and my wife; his wife supped with him, and nobody else, but me and my wife; I did not see Mr. Webber; there were several in the tap-room; I am sure as to the day, because I received some money that day upon a bill that was owing me from a customer of mine.</p>
               <p>Is that any thing particular? - I am sure that was the day.</p>
               <p>Are you sure as to the time of night that he was there? - From nine till about half after nine, and then he went out, and then he came back, and staid till twelve.</p>
               <p>What time did he come back to supper? - It might be ten, or a few minutes after or before; he was about half an hour absent from my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You live in Golden-lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you got your books here? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What had he for supper? - Some mutton stakes; my maid went to call him when the stakes were ready.</p>

               <p>The circumstances of the robbery have been misrepresented: I went down to tea, the maid was toasting a toast at the fire, and there was a knock at the door, it was a gentle rap; the maid desired me to go, I asked her to make me some toast; she said, will you go to the door, I said yes, without any hesitation: when I went to the door, I asked who was there, I was immediately asked if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220095"/> Mr. Chancellor was at home; I said no; somebody said it is Rapson; I opened the door, and one man rushed in, and put his handkerchief over my face, and immediately Knotely rushed in; they swore bitterly; then they bundled me into the kitchen, and then I saw the tail of the maid's apron over her face; they staid about ten minutes up stairs, and came down; they wished one another a good night: there was a watch on the mantlepiece, one of them, the man that stood over me, said this watch was his; I said, do not touch it, it is my property; they went out, and shut the door, I got one arm untied. What I wish to speak is through humanity; when the maid was brought to swear to four men, she said it was all in vain, she could not swear to any of them.</p>

               <p>How came you to remember it was that particular night? - Because I lodge in the house, I remember the day of the month very well, because I saw it put down in the book before Justice Staples; I told it to the Justice the day after, the 10th.</p>
               <p>What did you hear them say, or see them do, after they came in? - They called for a pot of beer, they drank once, and they called me by my name, and said Denmore, will you have any beer; I saw them do nothing, but I could perceive them have some papers, but what they were I could not tell, I saw no more.</p>
               <p>What sort of papers were they? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Had they any book? - No, I did not see any book.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay? - About six or seven minutes, they only drank once a piece out of the pot.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any conversation about these papers? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did they all go out together? - Yes, they did, they came in together, and they went out together.</p>
               <p>You did not observe what papers they were, nor you did not see any books, I think you say? - No, I could not perceive any books, but in the morning when I came down stairs, the boy shewed me a clasp of a pocket book, and he asked me what it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that boy here? - No, he was bound over, and he is gone out of the way; he picked up a clasp, and asked me what it was, I shewed Bowers the clasp of the pocket book.</p>
               <p>Did you see the boy pick up the clasp? - No, I did not, he shewed it me, at eight o'clock in the morning, when I came down stairs, he said, he picked it up in sweeping out the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Do you know what is become of that boy? - He is gone into the country where he came from; he got too saucy, and the landlord discharged him.</p>
               <p>How long ago was this that he went away? - I dare say it may be a month or better than a month.</p>
               <p>How came the landlord to send him away? - Because he found he would not do any thing that he bid him.</p>
               <p>What part of the country did he belong to? - Some part of Essex.</p>
               <p>The landlord knows, does not he? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Nash. I went by order of the Justice, to enquire about him, and the landlord said, he did not know any thing about him, he was gone away.</p>

               <p>What do you mean by that? - That there should be no cheating, that I should share the same as they did; with that I went to the front of the house, and staid about five or six minutes, as nigh as I can guess, and when I came back, they were all come out, and Thomas says to me, I have got a pan with some halfpence, and Lyons says to me, I have got the pocket-books, and under Thomas's jacket I saw something bulky, and I asked him what he had there, and he said it was a new pair of shoes; then we went to the Black Boy, and had a pot of beer, and was overhauling the pocket-books; I saw nothing in the books, only two Insurance policies, and some leases of houses; and Lyons said, I will go out and ding these things; we said, do so; he went out, and he might be out about three or four minutes, then he came, and said, I have dinged them over the wall into the Deal-yard; then we left the Black Boy, and left Thomas to sell the shoes; Thomas came to the Shovel in East Smithfield, and he sold the shoes for three shillings; and the halfpence were two shillings, and we shared fifteen-pence a man; then we came up to Blakeney's Head, and had two pots of half-and-half; and so after that we parted.</p>
               <p>How did you know there had been any bank note in the book, and that Lyons had cheated you? - I did not know that there had been any bank note, before Mr. Bowers swore it at the Magistrate's; but as to the guinea, Lyons confessed to me in the watch-house, that Hopkins saw him fumbling; says he, I have got some lour here, we can have them for this, that meant, he could cheat us; with that, he pulled out twelve shillings, and gave Hopkins six shillings, and amongst that six there was one guinea in gold, that Lyons confessed to me in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>You do not know whether Hopkins knew any thing of the bank note? - No, I do not.</p>

               <p>When I was taken up, this man took me to the alehouse to the other side of the water in Tooley-street, and he called for hot, and some gin, and some beer, and when we came in the coach, now, says he, I do not care, I want I new coat, I shall have a great coat this winter; says I, do you want my coat, for you have torn it very much; then he up with his stick, and hit me over the head.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say you were in liquor? Yes, I was.</p>

               <p>How can you tell which is the spoon; was the spoon that was stolen marked?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dixon. The spoon I sent by my servant has a dent in the bowl, which he has, and the spoon stolen, which was given to the officer, had no dent in it.</p>

               <p>I had swept several chimnies that morning; as soon as we have done work, we sift the foot, among which I found this spoon, and not knowing whose it was, I pawned it in my own name; I never was before an Alderman in my life.</p>

               <p>On Monday I went to go to work at my master's at Islington, and he had nothing to do that day, and in my landlord's house we were playing at cards, and there came in a disorderly woman and a man, I took them, my Lord, to be nothing but whore and rogue, for his breeches-knees were all over dirt; and we played at cards for three pots of beer, and I played with him, and in the mean time my landlord winked at me, and I winked at him, and he says I should not grudge that woman sixpence to go up stairs with me; the woman went out first, and he followed her, and we drank our beer; they were gone about half an hour, and I said, where have you been? and he said, what is that to you, and then the woman came in again, and they went up stairs together; the next morning I got up, in order to go to work; my master was gone to London, then I thought as I could not go to work, I would go and fetch me a clean shirt; and going along I found this spoon honestly, and will be bound for it, it had been hauled out by somebody that had stolen it.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you lived at Mr. Constable's? - Seven days.</p>
               <p>What made you run away from the pawnbroker? - Because they said, they would keep the spoon, I have not a friend in the world but you my Lord, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, notwithstanding that the prosecutor keeps a very bad house, and is never in bed till one or two in the morning, and last Sunday morning, he came to bed at two o'clock very drunk.</p>

               <p>I was with the cart, I saw the man take a piece out of the cart, and put it on his shoulder, and walk off with it, I was told by the carman, that he was taken directly after by the patrol; I took up the goods, I saw them drop off his shoulder, and I picked them up, I was close by him when he dropped them.</p>
               <p>Did you see him stopped? - No, I did not, the carman saw him stopped.</p>
               <p>What were the goods? - They are here, it was one piece of baize, and I directly put the goods in the cart, and took them home and delivered them to the warehouse-man, his name is Sexton.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Then you saw some man take some goods, and then you took them, and put them in the cart? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Ward at Great Ealing, I am his apprentice, he is a carpenter, his shop does not join to his house, but it is in a court-yard surrounded by a wall intirely; on the 27th of January last, I shut up his shop, it was locked and fast about five o'clock, I kept the key of my master's chest, that was locked; one of the doors of the shop was fastened with a bolt, the door I went out at was locked and fast, the third door was fastened with a staple; I went to the shop in the morning about seven, I took the key out of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>In what state did you find the shop? - I got in at the window, and opened the two doors, there was a pane of glass to the window broken, and a board nailed up, and that board was pushed down, that hole was large enough to get the prisoner's body in, when that board was torn down; these two doors were both fast; when I shut up shop I locked the door next the kitchen: my master's chest and Margisson's chest were both open, the hinges were off Margisson's chest, and some of the tools were taken away; I had put my master's into the chest the night before, and the things belonging to him mentioned in the indictment were missing, I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I have a brother gone to the East Indies, carpenter's-mate, and these tools belonged to him, and he gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Have you any witnesses to call to prove this? - No, Sir, I cannot say I have, I am an entire stranger indeed, only my landlord.</p>
               <p>Court to Young. How came you to search the lodgings of the prisoner? - Because he told me where he lived, he was stopped with three oil stones, and a hand saw which are not claimed at all, some carpenters who had lost their tools, were going after their tools to different shops, and he run out of one of the shops as they came in.</p>
               <p>Jury to Young. You say nobody owned this stock, and bit, and plough.</p>

               <p>What did she say for herself? - She said nothing for herself; on coming home, I asked her if any body was concerned with her, and if she would let me know who was concerned with her, I would be easy with her, and she said no; when she came back, I brought her back in the chaise, she took out her own things, and left the remainder, which Mrs. Shetley will speak to.

I immediately turned back, and the pistol was within six inches of my ear; he said, I am a gentleman in distress, please to deliver your watch and your money instantly; I looked at him, and I saw he was the same person I had passed before, which surprized me a good deal, and I was getting off my glove, but I did not pull it off fast enough, and he began to use bad language; I took off my glove as quick as I could, and gave him my gold watch and seal, and a guinea and eighteen pence; he said, this is not all the money; I told him it was all that I had; he then rode off a few yards, and I saw him, when he was five or six yards from me, look at the watch, and put it into his coat pocket; then he began to flog his horse very much, and rode up the hill; I immediately lost sight of him, but I ran up the hill as fast as I could, and I met a gentleman, whose name is North, and some other people, in a minute or two; I asked him if he had been disturbed by a fellow that rode up that minute upon a grey horse; I told them I had been robbed, and he and a lady, and a gentleman that was with him, immediately turned and went with me to the Spaniards, and there they met with a person who lives in the neighbourhood, and he went to town as fast as he could, and went to the office, and gave information.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of the person of the man that stopped you? - Yes, I am sure of his person, perfectly sure of him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that that is the man that robbed you? - Yes, that was the man; but he is not in the dress now he was then; he had an olive-green great coat on; my watch has never been found, the seal has and the string, the seal was found that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. The person that robbed you had an olive-green great coat on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation on the number of capes that coat had? - I knew it when it was shewn to me; I was not particular whether it had two or three when I gave the description at Bow-street, where I have heard that I might say there were three capes.</p>
               <p>I am told you did? - It certainly has three capes, there are two that laid down, and one that is the cellar, that stands up.</p>
               <p>That is a very distinct thing; what sort of hat? - A round hat, down on the face, and down all round. </p>
               <p>The person that robbed you, told you he was a gentleman in distress, and therefore asked for your money? - Yes.</p>

               <p>On Friday the 17th of February, I saw Mr. Grey at a public house in Bow-street; I heard him saying he had been robbed by a highwayman near Lord Mansfield's house; as some of our people had been out that day, they had heard of it before me, but I heard from Mr. Grey that some of our people were waiting at the Catherine-wheel-yard, in Windmill-street; I believe it was about half after three when I went up, and I waited there in company with Atkins and Sayre, and Shallard, I believe till about half past eight, and at about half past eight, Sayre, who was standing at the window, tapped at the window; there came in a grey horse, the prisoner came on it, and turned into the yard; I was then in the road just as he came in, and he says to me, halloo, hostler; I said, halloo, Atkins and Snallard, and at the moment he got off the horse, from his left-hand great coat pocket I pulled out this pistol, and called them to assist me; we searched him further, and in his right-side breeches pocket I pulled out a guinea, eighteen pence, and a half guinea, and this seal that was in his breeches pocket; he said, what do you want with me? I hope you will use me well; and we said we meant to take him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have been now a good number of years in apprehending offenders? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had you the smallest complaint against him? - Never in custody clearly.</p>
               <p>He is not an old offender? - Certainly not; if he had, I must have known him.</p>

               <p>Before you went home with her, was you quite sober? - I think so, I was sober enough to take care of myself, and every thing I had about me; I went out about three or four o'clock, I came home from the first house to my own house, and staid there sometime, then I went out again, desiring the man to put up the shutters, and said, I would be in instantly; I will swear I was so sober as to know what I was about when I came home, when I went to bed, I put my watch in a chair by my bedside; I had six guineas in my waistcoat pocket, four guineas and a half in gold, and a dollar, and twenty-seven shillings in money; I am sure I had this money in my pocket when I picked up this girl; I pulled off my clothes, and laid them on the bed, when I awoke in the morning, I felt with my hand about the bed, and I was surprised there was nobody there; I got up and came down stairs, I believe in my shirt, if I do not mistake; I found the door open, and the young woman gone; I lost nothing out of my shop, thank God! then I called my man who slept in the house, Tom, get up, I am ruined! and I went to Buckle-street, where she said she lived, but I could not find her; I found her afterwards, she had bought a parcel of clothes with the money that was missing.</p>

               <p>I took the prisoner between eight and nine in the morning, she was putting on this new petticoat, I put my hand in her pocket, the first thing I found was this watch (Deposed to.) then I took out this little box, with two guineas and a half in it, and two half crowns, and sixpence, and a dollar.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The guineas have no mark, the dollar is marked in two or three places, black as if it was burnt, I have had it a long time, I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Dormer. I found this new gown and stays, and a cloak, and a new shift, she had the fellow to it on, and the prosecutor's handkerchief, and a new apron and two new caps; when I took her into custody, she desired me to try, and settle it with the prosecutor, and she would return the things, she said, it was the first fault, and she would never do the like again; I did not promise her nor threaten, she said, she had laid the rest of the money out.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The money was my own, I was on board a ship with a young man six weeks, and when he got his impress money and wages, he gave me some money to buy me some clothes, and he told me to bring him some things which he wanted, and the same night I came from on board of ship, I met the prosecutor, he asked me to drink, and went to the public house, and he gave me this dollar, and he promised me half a guinea; I went home with him, and he said he had no money, and he gave me his watch, I told him where I lived, and he was to come for his watch.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What did you give that girl? - No money at all.</p>
               <p>Did you ever give her your watch in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220115"/> pledge? - No; I never told her I had no money, I had plenty of money.</p>
               <p>Dormer. We took her in Plow-street, not a hundred yards from Buckle-street.</p>

               <p>Was what passed there taken down in writing by Sir Sampson? - No; Sir Sampson said, as the man does not deny it, there is no occasion for any thing further; he acknowledged that he had been transported, and he had left the ship; he said he stood by the captain, while the others arose; Sir Sampson asked him how he came there, he said he came to see his children and grand-children; I know he was tried here.</p>

               <p>In what employment did you then engage him? - To keep a turnpike at Sutton, near Biggleswade; I think he kept it one year and three months, his goods are now in my house; he conducted himself like an honest, careful, industrious man; I would entrust him now if he was at large, he had a wife and two children there with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, according to my idea, there is a defect in the evidence here; for it is not proved that he was the same person that was convicted of the specific offence mentioned in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Watson. I went and told the mate I had goods for the ship; he said he could not take out the goods that day; the name of the ship was the Generous Planter; I had two small parcels, which I thought were moveable, I locked them up; there was no one single article which any one man, or even two, could move; I told my master what I had done; I left this case and another on board the lighter; my master asked me if it was necessary to watch the lighter; I told him I thought not, and I left it without any body to watch it during the course of the night, for I could not move it myself; the next morning I went down to get the things out; the first thing I missed was these two cases; I asked the mate, he said he hoisted out one, and no more; to be satisfied of it, I went on board the ship, and enquired, and there I found the master, and I described the case at the Custom-house before I saw it, and it was the same I missed from the lighter.</p>
               <p>Court to Walker. When you saw these three men in that boat with the case, and they put it into your boat, what became of the men? - They gave me no account of themselves, and they had but one paddle in the boat, which I knew was not fit to smuggle with, and I took them as disorderly people; I called for help, and they were taken to Gun-dock, Wapping; I am sure these are the three men.</p>

(Produced and deposed to.) I was with the prisoner Gibson while the officer was searching Lyon; she went down on her knees, and begged for mercy, and said she would pay for the lace, or any expence, if I would but let her go; she was taken to the Justice, and was committed. I know the lace by the pattern and the private mark. I believe it was Lyon that purchased the thread and things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lyon. Whether he did not say he could take his oath that he saw me take a piece of broad lace? - I thought so then, I did not miss two pieces, I only thought there was one piece of broad lace.</p>

               <p>I belong to Mr. Walker's office; I searched the prisoners; I found this lace in the right-hand pocket-hole of Lyon, half in and half out, when he pulled off her apron, and began unpinning her gown, then I saw it; she opened her cloak, I told her to undo her apron; it has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Did it come there by accident, or was it put there by design? - She had no pocket, it was in the pocket-hole, it was half in and half out; it was when she was stripping herself, I perceived the lace, and she said, Oh, Lord! how came it here, I cannot think how it came here; I searched Gibson, and found nothing upon her; the money for the tape and things was furnished by Gibson.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. Gibson had the child.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lyon. I came into this gentleman's shop to buy a bit of edging for a child's cap, I bought the lace for my own cap; he shewed me some, I said I did not want to go to above four shillings and sixpence; the child sat on the middle of the counter, the child got hold of the lace in the box, and pulled two or three pieces out of the box; I desired him to take care of the lace; I bought some ribbon, and went out of the shop, and they came after me; they kept me an hour and a half in his parlour, while he sent for a constable; the constable came in, and searched me, and this piece of lace hung at the bottom of my petticoat.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did the child meddle with the lace in the box, and pull them about? - The child did not touch a piece of lace.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am sure of that; it touched the box, and I moved the box a little further; I took great care the child should not touch the lace.</p>

               <p>I was in bed, and this lad came into the room, and pulled down all my candlesticks and flat irons; it had just struck seven; most of the things I saw the day before, and when I got up, several things in the room in which I slept were tumbled about; I know the prisoner, I have seen him many times, his father and mother live in our street; there was a little horse, and he moved that, and that waked me; half the window curtains were drawn, there were no shutters; I had the things to wash; the prisoner did not live with his mother, he was a boy that lived abroad; he ran away the minute I turned round; I looked at him, and said, oh, you tramping dog! do you come to rob me? The apron and things were laid ready; I am very sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What time was it in the morning? - Seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have a witness, if he is here, to prove that I was in bed at seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Taylor. I went and called my husband directly, and said to him, come home directly, for young Tramp has robbed me of my things.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you know the nature of an oath? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>What is it? - To speak the truth between man and man.</p>
               <p>What will be the consequence, if you do not speak the truth? - It is a very bad thing to take a false oath.</p>
               <p>Do you know what becomes of bad people? - They come into bad places, and bad company.</p>
               <p>No, but after they die, do you know where they go? - I hope to go to Heaven.</p>
               <p>If you tell the truth, you will; but if you do not tell the truth, where shall you go? - If I do not tell the truth, I look upon it I shall go to hell. I am a shoemaker, I keep a kitchen in Monmouth-street, No. 10, sent nine pounds a year; I work for myself, I have no father or mother; I mend shoes, and hang them up at the door, I have lived there about three months.</p>
               <p>Who else lives in the house? - I do not know the landlady's name, she sells gowns<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220126"/> and things; I pay my money every Monday.</p>

               <p>Who does the rest of the house belong to? - The gentlewoman lives up stairs, I do not know her name, I have not lived there long.</p>
               <p>Why, you have lived there three months? - No, I never trouble myself about the names of the people, I mind my work.</p>
               <p>Who lives in the next house? - I do not know, I never lived in the street before.</p>
               <p>What kind of shop is it next door? - A shoemaker's shop next door, one Mr. Foster keeps it; this lad was in bed along with me that morning.</p>
               <p>What morning are you talking of? - That morning when they said he got these things.</p>
               <p>Where were the things taken away? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who brought you here? - I came along with the boy's mother.</p>
               <p>When did she first speak to you? - The day that the lad was first taken up.</p>
               <p>How long was it before he was taken up? - I do not know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it? - Thursday, I think, but I cannot say rightly, to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Did this boy constantly sleep with you? - Yes, Sir; he has slept with me about three weeks; the prisoner lives with me, and minds my place when I am out, and runs of errands, and I learn him what I can of my business.</p>
               <p>What time do you get up in a morning? - I get up at seven, and this morning he was up after me, he was not up till past eight o'clock; generally speaking, I get up first, I always d o, I open the door, and hang out my shoes; he never slept from me for three weeks together.</p>
               <p>How long is this ago that he was with you? - Five weeks.</p>
               <p>How long has he left you? - A fortnight to-day; but I cannot tell the day with certainty, I cannot read or write.</p>
               <p>Was he never absent one night? - No; he slept with me the night before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes I am sure of it; during this three weeks he never was out before seven in the morning; I have no clock, but I can hear the town clock go, St. Giles's church; he never was out before me in a morning, and I have pounds worth of goods in my place; I never lost any thing.</p>
               <p>Court to Taylor. When was it that this boy was taken up? - This day fortnight.</p>
               <p>Was he taken the same day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Boy. Will you swear that you heard the clock strike seven? - No, Sir, I will not swear that I heard the clock strike, but I will swear that he did not go out that morning till between eight and nine, he went for some bread and cheese to the chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Taylor. Did you hear the clock strike seven? - I did not hear it; but when I was waked, and pulled my curtain back, it was between seven and eight.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Old North-street, Red-lion-square, I am now a servant to Mrs. Palmer. My mistress's house was broke open the 1st of February, I cannot say the hour, between going to bed and rising; I was last up in the house the evening before, I went to bed between eleven and twelve; I fastened the door and windows up stairs, the parlour, the nail, and the store-room; the cook fastens below, but I saw it was all fast.</p>
               <p>Who was first up in the morning? - The maid; she is not here; the public-house-man alarmed us about seven in the morning, seeing the kitchen window open; they came and called me, and I got up directly; the cook-maid came down first on the alarm, and let in the public-house-man; she called me up, and when I came down, I found the lower part open entirely, one of the kitchen windows broke open; it was fastened with two bars and an inside shutter, one side of the shutter was broken off entirely, one of the bars broke, and the other taken away entirely.</p>
               <p>What things were missing? - Two small silver castor spoons, one a pepper, and the other a mustard spoon; an old sattin cloak, that hung in the hall; a gentleman's great coat, a hat, and the key of the door. The officer came to let us know that the prisoners were taken; it was one morning after, but I cannot tell how long.</p>

               <p>About how long did you understand that it was that some persons were taken up? - I really cannot say, nor I will not pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Was it yesterday? - No.</p>
               <p>Was is it the day before? - It is about a week ago, or very nigh ten days; a coat only was found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner Fawcett's Counsel. You was not at the finding of the coat? - No; I have seen it since it was found.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know the great coat, whose was it? - It was one Mr. Hinchley's, who was on a visit at the house at the same time. I have a crow that was left behind; there was one inner door broke open, and the crow was close to the door.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I produce a coat and hat; I found the coat in the prisoner Burdett's house, up stairs in the bed-room, on the 20th of February, Monday was a week; I went by order of the Magistrates to fetch them up, and in the morning I saw Fawcett with a great coat on; then I went to fetch the great coat by order of the Magistrates, and I said to the prisoner Fawcett, Harry, I am come for the great coat; he had no great coat on then; says Fawcett, I was aware of that, I knew that Nodely was a rogue, and I have sent it to hell by this time; I then went to the house of Burdett, and there I found the great coat hanging up in his room; I carried it to the house in Red-lion-square; I saw a great coat on Fawcett that morning, but I cannot swear it was the same I found at Burdett's, it was a coat like it; this is the coat I found in Burdett's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What are you? - I am an officer belonging to St. Leonard, Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>What office do you generally belong to? - Mr. Wilmot's.</p>
               <p>How much will the reward for the conviction of these three men amount to? - If convicted, the reward will be paid by the county.</p>
               <p>What will it amount to? - It will amount to a hundred and twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in the habit of receiving these rewards? - I have been an officer these three years; but I neither took Fawcett nor Brown.</p>
               <p>Fawcett and you may not have agreed lately? - I never saw any misbehaviour in the prisoner Fawcett in my life; I have had him in custody, but he always behaved extremely well.</p>
               <p>Look at Fawcett now; do you think the great coat he has on now, is not pretty much like that he had on that day? - I will not undertake to swear, that the great coat he had on that morning, is not the great coat he has on now.</p>
               <p>He knew you was an officer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220128"/>He said this to you alone? - Shakeshaft was with me; he is gone to Hertford.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was that hat got? - It was delivered to me by the evidence, Nodely.</p>
               <p>Who was at Burdett's house when the coat was found? - His servant, a little girl, and a woman that was ironing.</p>
               <p>Now confine yourself to the question I am going to ask you; did you receive any information, but do not tell me what information, how the great coat came to Burdett's house? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>From whom? - From the servant of Burdett, a girl about fourteen.</p>
               <p>There is nobody from Burdett's house to account how the coat came there? - No.</p>
               <p>- HINCHCLIFFE sworn.</p>
               <p>Look at that great coat? - To the best of my knowledge, this is my great coat; here is a particular mark on it, a piece was fine-drawn in my coat, just by this button, it was so in this great coat. I was at this house upon a visit; I heard a great deal of noise, I was extremely unwell; I got out of bed, and whether that alarmed them, I cannot say; it was a very windy night, and that made it uncertain where the noise came from.</p>

               <p>It was proposed to go to this house in Red-lion-square, we saw it was easy to get in.</p>
               <p>Court. Give a full disclosure of all you know? - It was not me that fixed upon it.</p>
               <p>You know the reason for fixing upon it? - They said it was a good-looking house, it was easy to get in.</p>
               <p>What observations had been made on the house, to induce you to fix on that particular house? come, Mr. Nodeley, if your life has been spared, that you may give information, the Court will expect that you give full information; it is never too late to prosecute an evidence that holds back, you must disclose the whole truth; what was the inducement to single out this house? - Only the case of getting in.</p>
               <p>What was observed with respect to the fastenings of that house, and the ease of getting in? - There being nothing but inside shutters, and them we put our feet against, and shoved them in.</p>
               <p>How long time had these people and you been connected? - Seven months; we used to take it in turns to go round, and see how we could get in, in the night; we fixed to go to this house at three in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did you go? - Yes, three of us, Burdett, and Brown, and me; we went, and shoved the window up, and I put my feet against the shutter, and shoved them open, and Burdett and me went in.</p>
               <p>Did you make use of any crow, or any instrument, to force open the shutters? - We made use of no instrument.</p>
               <p>What means did you make use of, not to alarm the family? - It all tumbled down together; there was noise enough, but nobody heard it.</p>
               <p>What did you do upon its tumbling down and making a noise? - We came out again, and staid some time to see whether any body was alarmed, before we went in.</p>
               <p>How long did you wait? - About half an hour.</p>
               <p>What became of the watchman all that time? - He was in his box, about fifty or sixty yards distance.</p>
               <p>Was this window in the square, or in the street? - In the square. The watchman came round, just as we were coming out of the house; we came out before that, to see if any body heard us, and he never came out of his watch-box; we were at the door coming out when he was coming by, while he was feeling the shutters, we let him go away.</p>
               <p>Was not it very easy for him to have seen this window open if he had looked down the area? - Yes; that was what we came out for; for we were afraid that he would come round there, and see that window open.</p>
               <p>Did not he go round that side to look? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>How long after he had left the shutters of the hall, did you come out? - That minute, after he got into the square.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220129"/>Had any body spoke to the watchman that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which of the watchmen was it? - At the right-hand corner of the square.</p>
               <p>Was it the corner going towards Bloomsbury? - I do not know which is Bloomsbury.</p>
               <p>Will you tell me that? - I do not, indeed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Burdett. He knows Bloomsbury well; for he was one of those that broke into the Lord Chancellor's house, and had the grand seal, and the Speaker's gown he had.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to swear that you do not know the way from Red-lion-square to Bloomsbury-square? - If I was there, I could know the way, I never lived up that way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hinchcliffe. It is the house nearest Bloomsbury-square.</p>
               <p>Court to Nodeley. Was it the watchman the same side of the way that the house is? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is the corner of Orange-street? - It is the west corner of the square.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Hinchcliffe. This examination has been directed for the security of the neighbourhood; have any steps been taken with the watchman? - The watchman said he had been eight years employed, and I told the person who regulated the watch, that I thought the watchman did not do his duty.</p>
               <p>Court. You may inform them, that if they do not dismiss this watchman, I shall direct a prosecution against them for gross neglect of their duty; for it appears, that this house was broke open in a manner that any passer-by might see, and though they were half an hour in the house, he came by in the mean time, and took no notice.</p>
               <p>Nodeley. We broke open the kitchen-door with a crow, and went up stairs into the hall and parlour; we found two little tea-spoons, I do not know whether they were in the parlour or no; we took some new linen, and a hat and a coat.</p>
               <p>You did not get so good a booty as you expected? - No.</p>
               <p>Who watched, while Burdett and you went withinside? - Brown.</p>
               <p>Without? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did Brown join you when you came out again? - He and Fawcett were at the top of the street; he was to have come at three o'clock, but he failed in his appointment; Brown was obliged to walk away, when the watchman came round; there was an argument held between us, what we should do with the things, so it was agreed that Brown should have the linen; we tossed up for the linen, and he won it; Burdett won the spoons, and I had the coat, and Fawcett he put a crown against it, and tossed up who should have both, and he won the coat; Fawcett was in the prison with me, he had got a coat on like that, which we took out of the house, but I cannot swear it was the coat, he had two or three of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You come here to-day by the name of Nodeley? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have answered to that name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did you come from? - From Hertfordshire.</p>
               <p>That will not do for me; where was you last night? - At Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>What part of Clerkenwell? - In the prison.</p>
               <p>How many names may you have gone by in your life-time? - By no other.</p>
               <p>Have you never gone by the name of Country Dick? - Yes, they have called me so.</p>
               <p>Were you never convicted by any other name than that of Nodeley? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Do you not recollect your standing at that bar, and being convicted under the name of Nathan? - I dare say it has been so reported to you, but it is very false; I never was convicted, but as a vagrant.</p>
               <p>How long ago was that? - About two years.</p>
               <p>Never convicted of picking pockets? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You have said that his hands were dirty? - Yes, they were dirty, all his fingers grease and oil.</p>
               <p>Had Pilkington his hat on when you took him? - Yes, I think he had.</p>
               <p>And his coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you been much accustomed to the apprehending of coiners? - Yes, I have been at the places where they are.</p>
               <p>You then know that they do not usually work with their hats on? - They work at different parts, some tie up the papers, there are generally two, one to turn the fly and the other to feed the press.</p>
               <p>The man that got away had not his hat on? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor his coat? - No, I think the coining was carried on at No. 18.</p>
               <p>Are you sure? - It was the middle house of the three.</p>
               <p>Who lived in that house? - There was a woman that was big with child, and another in her arms; the prisoner Charlton when he was brought to me, was worse than a chimney-sweeper.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that Pilkington lived at No. 19? - Yes, he did, when I saw Pilkington's wife, I knew her, and was not surprised.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the breach in the wall was not secured and nailed up with boards,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220132"/> so as no person could pass through it? - No, it was not, the communication was open by Pilkington's fire place, there are three that work at the stamping press, two at the fly, and one to feed it.</p>

               <p>Was this hole concealed at all? - No, we found a quantity of halfpence in hand-baskets, some were made up in five shilling papers, and one large paper parcel containing six five shilling papers, all tied up in strings; we then took the evidence, and brought the things away in a cart, the next day we went to Carolina-court, Saffron-hill, I went up stairs and opened the door which went with a spring lock, and the prisoner was in bed at nine o'clock; I told him he must get up, he said, he could not, I told him he must, says he, if I get up I cannot walk or stand, says I, then we will have a coach, for you must go with me; says he, what should I go with you for, I was not in the house; in his waistcoat pocket I found these halfpence.</p>
               <p>There was no appearance of any body having been at work that day? - None at all.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner three months; I went to live at Haggerston, about three weeks before I was taken up, there was Bridges, Heron, a little girl, and my wife.</p>
               <p>What did you amuse yourselves at? - I am a painter, I used to go and see for work, and go of errands.</p>
               <p>What was done in doors? - Coining, your honor.</p>
               <p>How was this business carried on in this house? - A little girl put in the money, Bridges and myself pulled, and Heron worked the edges.</p>
               <p>How long had you carried on this business? - About three weeks, I believe.</p>
               <p>Who was in the house when the officers came? - Mr. Bridges, Mr. Heron, the little girl and my wife.</p>
               <p>What became of Mr. Bridges, and Heron? - They went out your honor, Heron went out into the yard, my wife and little girl went out at the street door.</p>
               <p>Which way did Bridges go out? - I think he went backwards apparently to me to go to the cellar.</p>
               <p>Do you know his handy works again, when you see them, were those the grand things you used to make, look at them? (Shews him the halfpence.) - They appear to me to be like them, there was about half a rush basket full, and some that were old out, I received no money only a bit of victuals, I was to receive nothing, only what my wife gave me, I could not work at the business to get money, I have lost one of my arms.</p>
               <p>Then you never worked at it? - No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Who pulled the fly? - Mr. Bridges, and a little girl put in.</p>

               <p>You swore just now, that Bridges and you pulled the fly, did you never pull the fly with Bridges? - About half an hour, he asked me to try to pull, to lend him a hand, but I never earned any thing at it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever lend him a hand? - Once, your honor.</p>
               <p>Who used to do it in common? - Bridges, and Heron assisted him</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Parsons, you was the only one of the covey that did not escape? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They frightened thee pretty much, did not they, they talked of transporting thee, did not they, do not I speak loud enough for you? - Yes, your honor.</p>
               <p>Did not they threaten you, they would transport thee? - I was affraid, your honor.</p>
               <p>Did not they tell you they would transport you, if you did not tell? - No, your honor, not that.</p>
               <p>What made you squeak then? - Because I did not know the consequences of it; they told me to speak every thing that I knew.</p>
               <p>You was a good deal frightened, cockey? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They have kept you in limbo ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had not been used to these sort of things? - No.</p>
               <p>Who may you have been formerly? - I have been a glazier and painter; I fell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220135"/> out of a window, and cut my arm to pieces, and they cut it off in the hospital; me and my wife lived in this house constantly; Bridges was to come at Lady-day.</p>
               <p>How is your eye-sight? - Very indifferent.</p>
               <p>What light did you use to have when you was at work in the cellar? - I am rather deaf.</p>
               <p>What light had you to work by in the cellar? - Candle-light.</p>
               <p>How many candles? - One at the press, one at the smoothing-engine, and one for the putting-in girl.</p>
               <p>Did you never see Mr. Williams there? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never call Williams by the name of Bridges, and your wife has mentioned it to you? - Yes.</p>

(The box produced, and the contents enumerated.) I put them in my box between eleven and twelve, before I left my place, and I examined it after it was found, and every thing was right, nothing was missing; as soon as the prisoner was brought in, and knew me, he begged for mercy.</p>

               <p>I look after the stages, as they come in; the coachman says, do not leave my coach, for I have got a box; I was asked by somebody, where the Camberwell coach was? I said it was the third coach off; I turned about, and saw the prisoner with two others; and I saw the prisoner take the box out of the boot of the Croydon coach, and him and another were carrying it away; I cried out, stop thief!</p>
               <p>Was he out of your sight? - Yes, my Lord, but I am sure he is the man; I saw his face by the light of the Apothecary's shop.</p>

I said I did not know; I went along with them to see, and I missed my grate; I swore to it when it was found on the Monday morning; I am sure the prisoner is one of the two men I saw.</p>

               <p>On the 24th day of July last, I went into the Park, to know what time the King went to the House; I was looking for the King, and I was accosted by a person who looked like a gentleman, extremely well dressed, who asked me what time I thought the King would come past; I said I imagined he would be coming soon; he said he should be very glad to see him, for he was but lately come from the country, not above a week, from Nottingham, and must return the week after; says he, I think by your language you are North country; yes, says I; what part? says he; near to Berwick-upon-Tweed, says I; says he, I came from the next parish; and several circumstances he mentioned, made me believe that he came from that country; he said he came from Nottingham, and had married an heiress, and was now in possession of an independent fortune of four hundred a year.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Councel. You are speaking now of the man you call Jones? - He said his name was Scott; and when the King came past, he said, we must drink together, and I said, with all my heart; and he took me to a house in <placeName id="t17860222-102-crimeloc525">Hedge-lane</placeName>

I said, no; he said, I will go out and get some pork chops; he went out, and returned, and said he could not get any, but he brought some sausages; then came in that gentleman, the prisoner Lycett, and he said to the prisoner Jones, I have got a part of your money, and he threw down a fifteen-pound bank note, and told out fifteen-guineas, and the rest you are to have next week; then, says Jones, that is one of the cleverest fellows in England, I should never have got this money, if I had not been recommended to him, he is Sir

            's out-door clerk; says I, I have kinsman in a banking house, a teller at Mr. Castle's; oh, yes, says he, I know him very well; from that I looked very earnestly at them, to take very particular<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220143"/> notice of them; and this Mr. Jenkins he came in, and said he wanted the way to the Park, where the officers walk; why, says he, I came up from Worcester, and one of the officers that wears red clothes has run away with my lass, and I will give all my money to find him; then he took out a pocket-book, containing a parcel of bank notes, as I thought, and threw down a quantity of gold; he said we were all a parcel of poor taylors and barbers, and he had an aunt that belonged to the work-house at Worcester, and he had more money than any one, and if he could meet with his girl, he would give it her all; he said he would give a shilling if we could produce five guineas; he threw down a shilling; says Jones to me, have not you got five guineas? No, says I, I have but two guineas and a half; then, says Jones, I will make up the rest, and he took up my half-guinea, and put down three guineas, and I believe he took up all the rest afterwards, for I did not think to ask for it; then he slung down a shilling, as he had done to the other man; says I, I will have none of your shilling, it shall not go into my pocket; but then, says they, them two shillings shall go for the reckoning; then, says he, I will lay you five guineas that you cannot shew one hundred pounds a piece; Mr. Jones says to him you are an impudent fellow, I can produce two or three, and also Mr. Lycett said he could, and then they applied to me, could not I find it; I said I had no such thing; after a great many intreaties of them two, I said, to be sure I could do such a thing if I was to go for it; they pressed me very hard to go, they said I might as well have the five guineas as not, and Jones would go along with me; I was foolish enough to go; I went to Lombard-street, I had a twenty-pound and a thirty-pound note at Castle's and Powell's, and the fifty-pound note I had at Mr. Bland's, that was Mr. Grey and Freeman's, but they went and got it for me, while I staid there; then we came back to Hedge-lane, Jones and me; we had not been in one ute, Lycett and Jenkins were sitting, and Lycett said that Jenkins had lost seventy guineas at a coffee-house with some officers; they said he was a foolish country booby, and did not know his letters; he said he thought he did as well as they; with that they got a bit of chalk, and marked A. B. C. D. then Mr. Jones made a letter, and Jenkins he turned about, and did not win it; they were to make a letter, and put a bottle over it, there was some guineas on the table, but how many I do not know; Jones won that bet, and I believe there was another bet, I believe Lycett won the next, but they insisted upon my making a letter, they solicited me to make a letter, I did make a letter C, so says Jones, put down one of the bank notes; I was foolish enough to put down one of the bank notes, a twenty pound; I made a C, and covered it with a bottle, I believe the bet was four or five guineas, but which I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How came you to put down a bank note? - I had no cash, and they solicited me very hard to do it, and I had absolutely forgot he had taken up the two guineas and a half of mine; I made the letter C, and put the bottle over it, and then Jenkins turned round, and Jones says, once, twice, thrice, and off; so Jenkins pointed to C, and this Mr. Lycett says, it is all your's, it is all your's, and he pushed my bank note and money to him; and Jenkins whipped up the note, and out he runs out of the room; I was thunderstruck; then up the rest got, and away the other two run after him; my pocket-book was laying at my left hand, and as soon as ever they were gone, I looked into my pocket-book, and the thirty and fifty-pound bank notes were gone too.</p>
               <p>Look at those men, are you sure that those a re the men? - I am very sure of it, I took a great deal of time to look at them.</p>
               <p>How long was you in their company? - I was in their company above an hour, it is impossible for any man to see these men an hour, and be in their company, and not know them again; I took particular notice of Mr. Lycett, when he said he was Sir James Eldaile's clerk, so particular that he had a pair of corderoy breeches, and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220144"/> looked very shabby, it is a face that no man can be deceived in, and his voice, I am sure of them, that they are the two men.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I recommend it to you not to conclude too soon that no man can be mistaken, perhaps you will hear twelve men upon their oaths say, you are mistaken? - Perhaps not.</p>
               <p>I rather think you will, do you know the number of the notes at all? - This is my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Taken from the banker's since you lost your notes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you may put it in your pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. The notes you had, who had you them from, the banker? - I had the fifty pounds note from Mr. Gray's clerk.</p>
               <p>Is that clerk here? - Yes, and the other clerk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, Mr. Hastings, what countryman are you? - I told you I came from the neighbourhood of Berwick.</p>
               <p>Had you been long in town before this King went to the House? - Thirty-eight years.</p>
               <p>That is marvelous! did you know Hedge-lane? - I know Hedge-lane, for I lived in the neighbourhood of Hedge-lane many years, I have connections with Mr. Roberts in Oxendon-street, a lawyer there.</p>
               <p>May you be of any trade Mr. Hastings? - No, I am in no trade, I have an employ in the customs.</p>
               <p>That is more marvelous still? - I am not ashamed.</p>
               <p>There is nothing to be ashamed of, not even your folly; you like the rest of the loyal subjects, were gaping for the King? - I had not much to do that day.</p>
               <p>So I should suppose; the man you picked up was a perfect stranger? - I knew Jones before, I had seen him walking upon the change then, and I saw him twice since.</p>
               <p>Did you lay hold of him? - He is a very tall man, and he had a great stick in his hand, I went to get a constable first.</p>
               <p>I think one came in that was the clerk to Sir

            , and afterwards there came in the booby, a sort of lout, a thing that had not much brains, you thought? - He had too much for me.</p>
               <p>He had too much for you! you took him to be a sort of lout, you took him to be a fool of a fellow, that was squandering his money? - I did, and these people plied me so very hard.</p>
               <p>In short, to make very short of the story, you thought there would be no harm in having some of the fool's money? - I had a very great scruple.</p>
               <p>However, you put yourself to the trouble of going to Lombard-street, to get more money, to win some of the fool's money; why the biter was bit, north countryman as you are, you do not come far enough north yet? - No answer.</p>
               <p>Ha! not a word, perfectly dumb, thunder-struck; why Mr. Hastings, I shall not get forward at this rate at all, we shall sit here till this day month, we are likely to sit long enough without it; what bet did you win? - I received none.</p>
               <p>That is well, then you never said, you won five pounds? - I never said so.</p>
               <p>Did not you win five pounds by producing the hundred pounds, you know the first heat? - I did not receive it.</p>
               <p>I know that very well, you produced the hundred pounds? - I swear it never was produced, the hundred pounds upon the table.</p>
               <p>Now, I ask you, and attend a little, upon your oath, was it not so produced, as that the wager was declared to be won by you? - No, it was never mentioned after we came into the room, for they began, Lycett and he upon the A. B. C. and it was never mentioned.</p>

               <p>You saw that somebody had won at the A. B. C. very easy, you saw they beat the fool at it? - They beat him.</p>
               <p>You thought you could beat him too, so you made your letters? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that you did not deposit the whole hundred as a bet against your hundred? - I will swear that, if I was to meet my God this moment.</p>
               <p>You muttered something, that you was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220145"/> bewitched, we know that love bewitches men; I take it, it was the love of gain that bewitched you; you thought you could get a cool hundred out of the fool, it was better than that he should spend it at that house; did not you mean to win the hundred from the fool, you was in love with the fool's fortune, and you got it at last; now do you mean to swear positively that you took the hundred pounds to Hedge-lane? - Yes, I saw the the bank-notes after I came there, when I took them out to lay the twenty pounds down.</p>
               <p>You put up your pocket book again? - No, I did not, it was not a minute, I was standing, and my pocket book was there, and the letter was before me, in a minute's time it was gone.</p>
               <p>When you had put your letters under the bottle, the next thing was to make the deposit? - Indeed the deposit was down before the letter was made, the deposit was down, for Mr. Jones insisted upon my making it.</p>
               <p>The twenty pounds was the stake? - Undoubtedly the twenty pounds was put down as the stake.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you carried the thirty pounds and fifty pounds with you? - I swear that I carried the thirty, and fifty, and the twenty pounds to Hedge-lane.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that you did not pledge the whole upon that stake? - No, I am very sure I did not.</p>
               <p>Before these persons went, did they tell you for what purpose they were going? - No.</p>
               <p>How long did you continue in the house? - I do not know, I was surprized, I saw what company I had been in, I was not in the house half a minute.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that you did not continue in the room waiting for these people ten minutes? - I will swear that I did not continue there five minutes, I am sure it was not two minutes; after I recovered myself, I said, to the man of the house, do you know these men; says he, I do not know them; says I, surely you must have seen them, he said, he had seen the little one somewhere in Holborn, well says I, they have robbed me.</p>
               <p>You said so cooly, just as a man would talk of being cheated at play? - I staid but a very little, I dare say, I did not stay there above ten minutes, and the man asked me where I lived, in case he should hear of any of them; it was a fortnight before I divulged it to any person upon earth.</p>
               <p>How soon after the fortnight was it before you went to the house of Lycett? - I cannot positively say the day.</p>
               <p>Was it a week, or three weeks? - It was not above three or four days.</p>
               <p>Now you have told us you was directed to the house of Lycett? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You went in disguise, and you found him in the business, and it struck you directly as soon as you saw him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who gave you the information? - I do not know the person that gave it me.</p>
               <p>Was it not one of the thief-takers that told you? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Can you tell who it was? - I do not chuse to tell you.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that that person did not tell you, that at the house you went to, you would find the persons who had defrauded you? - No, he did not say I should see the men in Lycett's house, there were more houses that he directed me to.</p>
               <p>Did you go to these other houses first? - I had been in several houses.</p>
               <p>Did not you go there to find the men that defrauded you? - I have been looking for them ever since I lost it.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you go to Lycett's house to find the men that defrauded you? - I went into many houses.</p>

               <p>How soon might Jenkins come in? - I cannot positively say whether it was before Lycett or after, but I think Lycett was the first, because he asked for the parcels, and they asked what parcels, and he said there were three parcels; then Jenkins came in after, I think it was after, it was not many minutes.</p>
               <p>About what time was it when you went to the banker's? - It was about five o'clock.</p>

               <p>How soon after this did you hear that Mr. Lycett was accused of this affair? - A party came to me, and asked me if I could remember the day when I brought a part of a goose? I said I could tell the day by my day-book, because that day Mr. Burrows gave me an order for some cheese and butter; I was there between half after eleven and two; I do not believe he was able to go out of his house, he had been making an alteration in his house.</p>

               <p>I live in Ray-street, Clerkenwell, at No. 29, I am a carpenter, I know Lycett, I remember being in his house the 24th of January, from twelve to twenty minutes past one; I went to dine there, I had beefsteaks and onions; he was very lame, he could scarcely walk across the tap-room, I cannot say what sort of shoes he had on, he had a stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Could he have walked far? - Not as he appeared to me; I remember Northover the carpenter being there; I worked in Lincoln's Inn, when we quitted work, we went to Lycett's house to have some beer.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to have his lameness still? - Yes, he was lame for two or three days together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How do you recollect this 24th of January? - Because we were talking about going to see the King, and I said no, because we were too much in a hurry.</p>
               <p>How soon after this was it that you heard that Lycett was accused of any offence? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Why cannot you recollect so remarkable a thing as hearing that your friend was accused of an offence? - I recollect dining there, and the King's going to the House, and talking about it, but there was very little said to me; when he was accused of the crime I cannot say to the day, it might be a fortnight, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Then you have no recollection before that particular day, nor no recollection of any thing that happened since? - I cannot recollect; the people said that such a night there was such a man came in disguise, and I recollected being there.</p>
               <p>What coat had Lycett on? - A black coat.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. He could not have danced to your music? - No, Sir, he was very lame, his shoe was a fort of slipper; to the best of my knowledge he was not absent half an hour together, I am perfectly convinced of it, he could scarcely walk along the place, his leg was rested on a chair the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220151"/> best part of the day; he had on that day a black coat, I believe he does generally wear a black coat; I called on Mr. Lycett on the Monday, my benefit was on the 16th of January last at the Royal Circus, and we had not settled, and he was very lame; he said, I am so lame, I cannot look for the tickets that were not taken, and he wished me to call again in a day or two; I called on the 24th, and dined there, and we settled; I have the tickets he returned me, I am sure it was the day the King went to the House.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. After dinner, what became of Mr. Lycett? - Him and me, I suppose, sat smoaking our pipes.</p>

               <p>Did you eat a bit of supper there? - No, Sir, I went home to supper; I staid till past nine, I believe the carpenter stopped till he had done his labour.</p>
               <p>Did not he take a pipe with you? - I will not say particularly; there was a man, or two or three at work there, but whether they were carpenters or not, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Were there more carpenters than North-over that day? - I cannot answer for that; the last day that I dined at Lycett's was the day that the King went to the house, some people came in, and spent the evening.</p>

               <p>If he had gone from home, must he have limped so that every body must observe it? - Yes; he could not walk ten yards without a stick; I believe he had on a blackish coat that day; Northover the carpenter was there several days before making a new bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How long have you lodged there? - Between eight and nine years; this lameness was in his foot, it was got by a strain; I was sent with no messages to Lincoln's Inn.</p>

               <p>Had you ever seen Jenkins and Lycett together, except when you lost your money? - Never, till I saw them at Lycett's house about two or three days before they were taken up; I went in there, and he was playing with a turn-about thing with a man that sells gingerbread; when he was taken up, the landlord of the Queen's Head wanted to personate Jenkins; I am equally clear to the persons of both the prisoners.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I live at the house where the prisoner lodges; on the 21st of February, the prisoner slept out all night, and on the 22d, between seven and eight he came home, and he brought home a flat of butter with him, and set it on the table, he asked me for a knife, I lent it him, he then cut the parcel open, he carried the parcel up stairs and went to bed; I went up stairs, and in the parcel I saw a note, the 19th of February, sent to Mr. Davis, three dozen and eight pounds of butter; and in the evening I heard a basket rattle, it was taken out of the back part of the house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I heard no more of my butter, the next evening the prisoner sent to me, and asked if I would mitigate matters if he paid for it, he said, to be sure it was a very foolish thing.</p>
               <p>Had any thing been said to lead him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220155"/> any expectations of favour? - Not one syllable, he said that another man had desired him to carry the butter home; and he took the butter up at my door, and they took it to my house, and went to bed together, he said the other man had the property and not him, he acknowledged the taking of it, and offered to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether I did not say the basket was in the room where I lay, which is a common lodging room.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I swear that he told me he took it.</p>

               <p>I am door keeper to the Rotation-office, in Litchfield-street; I had this man in custody, he was brought to the Rotation-office and examined, and stood committed; he asked me to look to see whether Mr. Davis was gone, I did, I asked him what he wanted with him, he said I should be glad to see him to try if we could settle matters, for although I took the butter as the man desired me, I did not know whose butter it was; I went to Mr. Davis, no promises were made to him.</p>
               <p>Court to Downe. When he came home that morning, was any body with him? - Yes, there was the other man had a pint of beer in the tap room, the other man did not go up stairs at first, but he went up afterwards.</p>

               <p>I had got out, and was coming to my lodgings, a man called out, that I had been drinking with at the Coach and Horses in Welbeck-street, he had a basket on his head, he asked me where I was going; I told him I lodged at that house, he called for a pint of beer, he staid, I was sleepy and went to bed; he slept in the bed the boy slept in, with another man, there were three men in the room, the man got up and brought up the basket, they had been playing at Justice Jarvis or shove-halfpenny, he played for some hours, and lost several pots of beer, he had no money to pay for it, he went out and brought in some money, where he got it I do not know, he went away, I never appeared before a Court of Justice before; I leave it to the Court and Gentlemen of the Jury, for upon my honor I am innocent of the affair.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character, who said, he was a stay-maker, but could not work on account of his eyes, and that he maintained himself by writing letters and petitions.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. His own account that he gave of himself at the Magistrates, was that he played the Clown at the pantomime at Mr. Astley's, and was articled to Mr. Astley for three years.</p>

               <p>On the 17th of February, I was at New Crane, and I heard of a boat being stolen from there, that was loaded with cotton; I took Falconer, who was a-bed at Mr. Chaffey's, and when I came down stairs, there were two women in bed, and I found these tools up one pair of stairs in a cupboard on the landing place, and this dark lanthorn, and some gimblets, and some rules.</p>
               <p>I think you told us, on a former indictment, that this house of Mr. Chaffey's was a lodging-house? - There is only one bed in the house; the two girls lay in another chamber; Falconer said he knew nothing about the things; it is a disorderly house, I am informed, and from the company I saw in it, I know it to be so; here is a coat which was up in the one pair of stairs at Chaffey's, in the room where the girls were.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Turner and Abrahams were in a garret there, and there I found this great coat, in the room where they were, it is all over cotton; Turner and Abrahams were in the room together; there was a girl of the town put a handkerchief round the Jew's neck, and they denied any knowledge of the great coat, but the Jew lad said this was his bag; they did not say how the great coat came there; the girl of the town said that two sailors had brought it a day or two before.</p>

               <p>What do you know it by? - I have had it eight years, there is no sleeve-lining, and it is moth-eaten on the right side, and several of the buttons shelled; I cannot swear to the bag.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Turner and Abrahams. There are witnesses on the outside of the door, about the great coat.</p>
               <p>COLLET MOORE sworn.</p>
               <p>What do you come here about? - It is enough to shock one to speak among all you gentlemen, but if you will give me time, I will speak.</p>
               <p>Let me caution you to speak the truth? - Very well gentlemen, I will speak as far as I do know; I live at No. 8, and this coat was brought by two men into my sister's house, where I live, Sir.</p>
               <p>What coat was it? - A light colour dirty coat, it was before these two men were taken up.</p>
               <p>Who were the two men? - I cannot say they came to their lodging, and went away the next morning, and they left their great coats behind them.</p>
               <p>Did they leave it to pay their lodging or what? - They paid for their lodging, and they asked leave to leave it.</p>
               <p>What sort of a great coat was it? - A lightish dirty sort of a drab colour, just like this man's coat, but only it may be dirtier, I will not say.</p>
               <p>What became of the coat afterwards? - Mr. Forrester came on the Friday morning, and took it out of my sister's house, it was the very same coat that the men left, which Forrester took out on the Friday morning, I am quite sure it was the same.</p>
               <p>You were in the room with these two men when they were taken? - Sir, I was not in the room, when these men first came up, I went up after.</p>
               <p>Do you think you should know the coat if you was to see it? - I never took it up in my hands.</p>
               <p>Court to Elbey. Shew her the coat you produced? - That is not the coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Shew her the other? - Yes, I will swear to the coat, it was much such another as this.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220160"/>Can you swear the coat that Forrester took on Friday morning was the same coat the man left? - No, only it was the same colour.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Abrahams called four witnesses to his character.</p>

I had a very high opinion of that man, but since he has been taken up, I find there has been very bad connections; he lived with another man's wife, and that very man is brought into Newgate.</p>

               <p>I was coming along Baker's-row with my wife and child, I saw a man standing at the door with a candle in his hand; I heard some persons say the woman had got a cull, and I heard murder from the house where the prisoner was, and I saw a woman that lives in the lower part of the house, run out, I went in with a man, and there came in a woman, who said, is there ever a man that has got a heart, then I got a weapon, and when I found so many people to back me, I went up one pair of stairs into the entry, and the door was shut, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220165"/> pushed it open, and saw the prosecutor laying on the ground, he said, he was robbed, I helped him up, the people laughed, and Mr. Croker came up, and they could not make the prisoner speak, only hem, and she took out a shilling and some halfpence, Mr. Croker picked up some more, the man appeared to be drunk, and the woman very much in liquor, I saw nobody run away; after I went in, the prosecutor said, his half-crown had a black dent.</p>

               <p>I saw this man and woman in the passage below stairs, he asked her if she had got some tea ready for him, and she said yes, she said, Mr. Croker was there, and the prosecutor went up, and she came down again to light a candle, and as soon as she returned up stairs, the prosecutor cried out murder! and watch! he was robbed, and I called for assistance; nobody was up stairs then, but she and him to my knowledge, nobody came down stairs after the cry; if there had been two men up stairs, they could not have made their escape without my seeing them, I do not believe there were any men concealed up stairs, when I went up they lay about six feet asunder, he with his breeches loose, and she in a most woful situation.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What became of these two men? - One man held me so that I could not cry out; the robbery was committed before the candle was brought up.</p>

               <p>I have been married these eighteen years, we had two pints of beer, the prosecutor was gaming with five or six men, I told him I was a married woman, and he would follow me up stairs, and he threw me down on the floor, and wanted to use me ill; and when he found he could not gain his ends, he said, I robbed him, and called the people up stairs; they stripped me naked in the room, I never had any of the money, so help me God! this man offered twenty guineas to a woman to come to Hicks's-hall, to hang me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to her character.</p>

I told him I had no money, he put a razor to my throat, and said, he must have my money or my life; I told him I had no money, he might search me if he pleased; he did not search me, then he said, he must have my bundle, then he took my bundle, and he dropped the bundle after he took it away from me, and dropped some of the things out, and in dropping the bundle, and picking some of the things up, he dropped the razor, which he held up to my throat, I am sure it was the prisoner, I saw nobody else nigh at that time, I saw him when the patrols took him, and carried him to the George, at Pancrass.</p>

               <p>Was there any disguise on his face? - No, he was in the same apparel as when he was taken.</p>
               <p>I suppose you was very much frightened and alarmed at his behaviour? - Yes, my Lord, I was at first, but being so long, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220167"/> took particular notice of him, the time I was with him.</p>
               <p>You will consider upon your testimony the man's life depends; will you venture to swear he was the person that stopped you and took your bundle? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I live in Eagle-court; on the 11th of January I was present when the boy came into the court, I saw the prisoner run past as I was in conversation with Mrs. Chapman; he had a bundle, I saw the little boy come up, he was running after the prisoner, and he said he had been robbed by that man; I have frequently seen the prisoner about the neighbourhood, and I am sure that was the man; I said to Mrs. Chapman, cry out, stop thief! but she said not, and we followed the boy into Swan-yard, and Mrs. Chapman informed him where he lived.</p>

               <p>I know nothing further than apprehending the prisoner in Short's Rents, on the 17th of January.</p>
               <p>Court to Boy. When the prisoner snatched away the bundle from you, did he strike you, or use any violence? - No; he only snatched it away, and I was knocked down afterwards by another person that I think had a wooden leg.</p>
               <p>Then it was that you received a blow which made your mouth bleed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before he snatched the bundle from you, did he use any words? - No.</p>
               <p>He only came up and snatched the bundle away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. What time of night was it? - Between six and seven, it was dark, I followed the prisoner till I got past these two women, I saw his face afterwards, I know him to be the person that took the bundle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have not a word to say, only that I am innocent, I have not a soul in the world; he said before the Justice that the man had either a white coat, a brown, or a black one, he could not tell which, and that he could not swear to his face.</p>
               <p>Young. He said either brown or black.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of these things? - Five shillings.</p>

On Monday morning I went to Sir Sampson's; these men were unknown to me before, but Sir Sampson thought proper to commit them to Newgate. Previous to my going to the play-house, I took out my purse; I had a friend or two with me, I took twelve guineas out of my pocket, and delivered them to my friend, telling him I was going to the play-house; then I looked at two guineas and a half, two shillings, and a bad sixpence, which I know as well as I do myself, and a rupee, and a pair of sleeve-buttons.</p>
               <p>Was the rupee in the purse? - No.</p>
               <p>Were the sleeve-buttons? - No, nor my purse; the purse that was found on the prisoner, was not my purse.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing found on the other prisoner? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>One of the half guineas and the sixpence you know? - Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Counsel. It was at half price you were going to the play? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Many other people were there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There are three doors going into the gallery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many of those doors did you attempt to go in at? - Only one.</p>
               <p>When you came out, you was opposed by persons going in? - They were in the gallery as well as myself.</p>
               <p>Was you further in than they? - I was on the inside of them.</p>
               <p>They stood between you and the door? - John laid his hand on my shoulder; I thought that rather rude behaviour.</p>
               <p>By the box-keeper you mention, you mean the gallery-keeper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your direction was to take the two men behind the door? - Yes; I told them they had picked my pocket of money.</p>
               <p>How much money? - I cannot recollect whether I said the quantity of money.</p>

               <p>You did not say five guineas? - I had not five guineas in my pocket.</p>
               <p>That may be; a man says he has money in his pocket, when he has not; did you say so? - I will not say that I did.</p>
               <p>These men were taken to one of the beer houses, and there they were examined? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of a purse was your's? - A mouse-colour purse, and the buttons were at one end, and the money and rupee at the other.</p>
               <p>None of these were found, but in this man's purse were found some guineas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many guineas? - Seven, eight, or nine.</p>
               <p>You did not know the guineas again? - Some of them may be mine.</p>
               <p>Now as to the half-guinea, was there any mark upon that? - There was a sufficient mark upon it that I know it, it has a cast upon it.</p>
               <p>What do you mean, did it squint? - A bend it has got; it is a very fresh half-guinea.</p>
               <p>What year was it coined in? - That I will not pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Do you know what King? - It was King George.</p>
               <p>Was it George the Second? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was it George the First? - I believe not; I know it when I see it, and I swear to it.</p>
               <p>That is right. Did you ever see a bent half-guinea before in your life? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, as for your bad sixpence, what is the mark upon that? - Mark upon it! I cannot say the mark; there is a scratch, it is an extreme bad one, an old traveller of mine, I know him perfectly well.</p>
               <p>You must know all its faults, because you know it as well as you know yourself; is there any particular mark, besides it's being bad? - I cannot tell; there is no mark upon it in particular, but I know it when I see it, it travelled with me all the way from York, I had it in town too.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220172"/>How long had you been out of the gallery before you took this man up? - I never went out of the gallery at all; I took them instantly, I considered a little.</p>
               <p>Court. On the Saturday evening, when this purse was taken, and the gold was produced, did you, when the money was turned out of it, express to the officer your knowledge of these pieces? - I said immediately to the constable, I will swear to the half-guinea; says I, take charge of him this moment, then I said about the sixpence.</p>
               <p>When the prisoners were brought out of the gallery, had you a recollection of their persons as the men you saw before? - I cannot possibly swear that.</p>
               <p>For instance, if you had not seen them again for a day or two after, should you have known them? - I cannot say that.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you ever observed in what part of the coin your half-guinea was bent? - I do not so far recollect it.</p>
               <p>Suppose any gentleman here had a new half-guinea that was bent, by what means could you distinguish them? - The sixpence and half-guinea are so strong in my mind, that they have made a very great impression.</p>

               <p>Did that warehouse communicate with your house? - It joins to the house, there is a partition wall between the warehouse and the house, there is a door opens from thence into the yard; they opened that door, and from the yard they went to the kitchen window, and broke a pane of glass, and the upper bar was taken down, they went through the kitchen into the cellar.</p>

               <p>What was the value of that tobacco that you suppose was taken away? - It might be two hundred pounds weight, or five hundred pounds weight, I cannot be sure, there was more than two hundred pounds, it was worth thirty pounds I think, it was fine tobacco; three or four days after, I heard the prisoner at the bar was taken up for a watch, and my wife went and knew her watch, it was at the watch-maker's to be mended, the watch-maker has the watch; I never got the tea-spoons, nor any part of the tobacco.</p>

               <p>Did you in fact lose a watch? - Yes, I have seen it since, I knew my watch, it was at Mr. Allen's, the watch-maker's.</p>
               <p>Was it in the same state as when you lost it? - No, the spring was broke, but the outside fish-skin was there, but the woman's chain was taken off, and the paper taken out.</p>

               <p>Allen. On the 11th of January, the prisoner brought this watch to my shop, to get it repaired; I looked at it, and told him the main spring of the watch was broke, he stood motionless, and almost speechless, he made no reply to that, I asked him when he wanted it done, he told me to suit myself, he was in no hurry; I made him for answer, he should have it the latter end of the week, he went out of the shop, I saw him no more till I saw him at the Justice's; one of Justice Green's men came to me on Thursday and enquired about the watch, his name is

               <p>Whose wire was that? - I believe it to be mine.</p>
               <p>What quantity of it, do you know? - Rather better than two ounces, but I found one piece in a cupboard, which he said belonged to the other, and it was put to the other, which made four pieces in the whole: the cuttings are off the buckles, little bits about half as big as a pin's head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. It is not wire? - No, I did not go after wire.</p>
               <p>Are you a wire drawer? - I draw for my own use.</p>
               <p>Are you at all able to identify this wire, to say that it is yours? - I cannot say I have any knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know whether his brother was at the house at this time? - No, Sir, I do not believe he was.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether in fact there was an execution, either against the person, or the effects of that person in that house? - Not that I know of, I have not heard any such thing.</p>
               <p>I believe before the Magistrate, you only charged this man with suspicion of this? - Yes, Sir, but my man swore to this property.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I will not be positive of it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he was committed on suspicion, and has been out upon bail, and has surrendered himself to day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not that because no creature could venture to identify this wire? - I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know now that nobody could? - I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>You heard your porter examined? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at this instrument, is it an instrument for wire drawing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220176"/>Is it possible for any man to swear to wire of any size; would not a like wire be produced by an instrument of that sort in any one's hands? - It may be possible to produce the same, and I have a drawing plate of the same kind as this.</p>
               <p>How is it possible for any man to distinguish a wire, which is drawn through a drawing plate of the same size? - The purity of the silver is much the same.</p>
               <p>I fancy it must; had not your house been robbed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you make some application to the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What application did you make to him or what offer did you make to him? - I told him, if he would tell me, an act the honest part, that I would help him, and do him all the service I could; on finding the wire upon him, he told me he would give me an account how he came by the wire.</p>
               <p>Did not you offer him thirty pounds, if he would give you some information that you wanted? - No, Sir, no such word, none at all, not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Tell us what you did say to him? - The words I repeated before.</p>
               <p>Let us hear them again? - I told him I was informed he knew something of my robbery, he said, he did not, I told him if he knew any body that would tell me, I would be his friend, I believe that was what I said, I am sure it was.</p>
               <p>How many men were left there, when the prisoner went away that evening? - All my men but four.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Mr. Yardley you delivered out your silver to your men, and received it back by weight from them? - I never said any such word to him.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him about the weight? - None at all.</p>
               <p>I believe you had some reason to know that the prisoner was not the man that committed that robbery? - I believe the people are taken.</p>
               <p>It is a very near relation of yours that committed that robbery? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court. There is not the smallest suspicion on the prisoner about that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then I am content.</p>

               <p>If this piece of wire had not been rough, could you have distinguished it from any of these that I shew you as to size? (shews him several.) - No Sir, I cannot say I could.</p>

               <p>Who was at the expence of this prosecution? - I hope the Court will be at the expence, or else I shall be wrong.</p>
               <p>Who pays counsel and attorney, now, Mr. Smith, upon your oath? - I have not paid them at present, but I may do.</p>
               <p>Does not Mr. Thorne lend the money? - I suppose it is not material, I have not paid it; I suppose Mr. Thorne will pay it.</p>
               <p>Did not Mr. Thorne write to you to come up about it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not he write to you that he would be at the expence of your coming up? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you got his letter? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did not Mr. Thorne advance the money to prosecute this man? - I understood that he would pay, he knew that I was not capable.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220178"/>Will you answer the question? - I have been at part of my expences.</p>
               <p>You understand the question perfectly well; is not Thorne at the whole expences of this prosecution? - I have been at some expences myself.</p>
               <p>Has not he paid both counsel and attorney? - Yes, I suppose he has.</p>
               <p>Do not you know, is not there a dispute between Thorne and this man? - I do not know of any dispute, except that he found out this coat.</p>

               <p>And that he would hang him if he could? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>How came you not to come up before? - I could not come before I heard any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Then the first news was a letter from Thorne? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he wrote you word, that if you would come up, he would pay the expences? - Yes, he did, or it would have been badly worth fetching, though it cost me eighteen shillings; I had not worn it a great deal, perhaps six or eight days, or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You came to do your duty to the public to prosecute? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had you seen such a thing at any time? - I went into the stable on the 18th of August, on the Sunday morning, and I saw a great coat rolled up in the stable, it was a brown great coat; I asked the prisoner if he knew whose it was, and his answer was, it belonged to himself.</p>
               <p>Have you seen such a great coat? - I have seen that many times since; I have seen the coat which Smith says is his, I believe that to be the coat that I found under the manger; this was the stable that the prisoner had business in, but not the same stable that the countryman's horses were in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you take out the great coat? - No, I did not meddle with it, it was rolled up.</p>

               <p>Has not that great coat been worn by every servant in the inn? - Only by the prisoner; he wore it publicly of cold mornings and evenings.</p>
               <p>I believe he laid an information against your master? - Yes.</p>

This is my coat, any man might swear to this bit, and the buttons were great part of them off when I lost it, here is a remarkable button in a remarkable place, it is different from the others, I observed that before I lost it; I knew if that button was upon it, I could safely know it was my own coat, it was very near off when I lost it; I am sure it is my coat that I lost.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was a servant of mine; I remember Smith the waggoner coming to my house the 27th of August, I remember his enquiring about a great coat, I know Smith asked the prisoner in my presence, and I likewise asked him, and he said he had not seen it.</p>
               <p>You went down to Worksop about this business? - I did about three weeks ago, I cannot speak exactly to the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220180"/>What induced you to go down? - I will give you my reason for it; the yard I lived in has been repeatedly robbed, and other yards had been robbed; these two men, Carter and the prisoner, had quarrelled about a robbery before, and I thought it my duty to take them into custody; I did not think about going, but the Justice said the waggoner must be produced; I went down after the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner given some information against you for penalties? - There was a report so.</p>
               <p>Did you encourage this prosecution out of spite and malice towards him? - Upon my oath, I have no kind of malice against him, neither do I know he is the man that did lay these informations; I should rather have dropped the prosecution.</p>
               <p>When you went down, did you give any particular description of this coat to the man? - I never saw it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Your love of public justice induced you to take a rice down there? - Nothing more than that, and wishing to be secure.</p>
               <p>Your love of public justice induced you to lay down the money for this prosecution? - I am not at the expence of this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Who has paid the counsel and attorney? - The money came out of my pocket; this man is a man that does not carry a great sum of money about him, and he is a stranger to law. I would lend the man money.</p>
               <p>You advanced the money, did not you? - I did, Sir; I advanced it upon the credit of Mr. Smith, I offered to pay his carriage to town, because he was not willing to lay out the money, I advanced it upon this credit, and this only, it was from the Justice's telling him when the man was committed, he was very loth to be bound over to prosecute, and the Justice informed him, and his clerk likewise, that if he prosecuted, the Court would pay his expences.</p>
               <p>The Justice could not tell you that, before you paid the carriage? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Have not there been a few informations against you for running your chaises? - No.</p>
               <p>What was it for, then? - For filling up a ticket for twelve miles instead of thirteen.</p>
               <p>You have declared, upon your oath, that you would be revenged of this man? - Never before this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Did you ever declare you would be revenged of him? - Never, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself? - I do.</p>
               <p>Have not you declared you would sell your best chaise and horses to be revenged of this man? - Never, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you never did? - I will swear I never did.</p>
               <p>Do you know a woman of the name of Curl? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Did you never declare, in her presence, that rather than not be revenged on that man, you would sell your best chaise and horses? - Never, that I know of; she is beneath my notice.</p>
               <p>Did you never declare you would be revenged of him? - Never before the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Did you ever declare so at all? - I never made use of the expression, nor a word to that purpose.</p>
               <p>What could induce you to go to Worksop, if not out of revenge? - It was not; I did not know Smith the prosecutor till he came up that day.</p>
               <p>Who has supported that man since he came to town? - He lived at our house all the time, except when he has been out any where.</p>

P.

               <p>He lived with you twice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who had you a character of him from? He lived with Mr. Burton, who kept the house when I took it of him; he then was out of place, and went and lived with Mr. Parker, at the Angel and Crown in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Do you know how he came to leave Mr. Parker? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not you know he was seduced from that place? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you never hear that? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you will presently; he left your house with credit that time? - He used to get drunk sometimes.</p>
               <p>I ask you the question, did you, knowing him to be a drunken lad, give him a good character? - I gave him a character of being obliging and civil.</p>
               <p>Was he a servant at Ratcliff-cross at Dr. Horsefall's, when this robbery, as you call it, was committed? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was not he seduced from that place by any part of your family? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Pray, before any talk or any pretence of the robbery or burglary, had you any quarrel with your wife? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Had you no jealousy concerning this young man? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Nor have had none since? - No.</p>
               <p>I ask you whether or no you have had jealousy of him? - I never expressed any jealousy, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>You must know whether you have, or have not? - I have not.</p>
               <p>You have had no jealousy or suspicion? - No, Sir; because I never had any proof.</p>
               <p>Pray, did you never visit him in the Poultry Compter? - I went there once, by the desire of Mrs. Davis; she sent for me.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not, in the Poultry Compter, tell him, if he would confess whether he had ever been great with your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220184"/> wife, you would maintain him, and get him out of his troubles? - Never in my life, so help me, God!</p>
               <p>That you swear positively? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Did you or not turn your wife away? - I say that, and insist upon it.</p>
               <p>You know Mrs. Davis? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She was there, and her two daughters? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And no such conversation passed? - I never was jealous of my wife.</p>
               <p>You think the parlour windows were down? - I am sure they were shut.</p>
               <p>Your servants might have lifted them up, for what you know; was there any appearance of force to the windows? - Not to my knowledge; he could not come into any other part of my house.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I have no other reason to think he got in any other way, my servants were all locked up that night.</p>
               <p>Who sent for the box? - I did not; I asked the prisoner, I said, John, how came you to rob me? says he, I do not know; says I, how did you get in? says he, at the parlour window; I had no reason to quarrel with him about it; the halfpence were taken out of the box by the constable.</p>
               <p>Do not you know how he came by them? - Upon my oath I do not.</p>
               <p>Might they not have been given him? - A great many things happen that we do not know of.</p>
               <p>Did not your wife leave you that day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>For what? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it not for quarrelling with the black? - I did not quarrel with him, we had no words at all.</p>
               <p>What did your wife leave you for? - For fear I should ill treat her; I cannot tell her reasons for it.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, cannot you assign any reason for it, why she should be afraid of your ill using her? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Cannot you guess? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>You have treated her roughly before? - Yes; it is too hard a question for me to answer.</p>
               <p>You must give the Court an answer; what was the reason why your wife should think you would ill treat her that morning? - Because I had ill treated her before; I cannot answer that question, I cannot do it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever ill treat your wife, on account of this boy? - Never on his occasion, in my life.</p>
               <p>You swear that? - I have sworn it before.</p>
               <p>You dropped a word of his being let in the over-night? - I know nothing of it; I have received information from my wife that he was let in; I heard of his coming in over-night, I heard from my wife that he had been asking her to give him lodging; he had no place nor money, and she gave him permission to sleep there.</p>
               <p>Did not your wife tell you, that he was distressed for a lodging? - Not in the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>She had given him leave to come upon the premises? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not your wife tell you that she had ordered him to be let into the house, because of his distress? - She told me that she had given him leave to sleep in an out-house, she mentioned that at my Lord Mayor's the morning she was examined.</p>
               <p>Was it denied by your wife; was there not mentioned that th e halfpence were made a present, because he was out of bread? - No, Sir, my wife never gave him a farthing.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the maid say that this man was let in, by order of her mistress, into the house, or into the out-house? - Into the out-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Did not it come out before the Lord Mayor, that your wife had sent him money very frequently while he was at Mr. Parker's? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was it not in evidence, that she had seduced him from that place? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did not you not, promise the young man to pay his expences, and get him safe out, if he would inform you how often he had familiarities with your wife? - No, Sir, so help me God!</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220185"/>There were a good many people there? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Did not you say no harm should happen? - No, Sir, I never mentioned it.</p>
               <p>Jury. You talk of a back house? - Our house is a narrow house in front, and we have a way to come in through a neighbour's house; it was a place where he had an indulgence to sleep.</p>
               <p>Is it customary for your wife to go into the bar when she comes down stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say the bar-door appeared to be wrenched open? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not she give you notice of it? - She said so when I came down.</p>
               <p>Court. I understood by you, that it appeared to be wrenched open? - The bottom part of the door has a single lock, and the top part was forced from the bottom; there is a wrench in the bar-door now.</p>

               <p>I am wife to the last witness; I ordered the prisoner to be let in to sleep in one of the out houses, on the night the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Did your husband know that at the time? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see the condition of this house before you went to-bed on the Sunday night? - No, I cannot say I did; my husband ordered us to go to-bed, and he would see that every thing was fast; we all went before him.</p>
               <p>Did you come down first in the morning? - When I came down, the servants had been into the bar, and had served; it was open when I came down.</p>
               <p>Did you see them at the bar when you came down to the bar? - No, Sir; I knew they had been serving, by the money they gave me; I did not think there had been any robbery committed, as I had no occasion to go to the till; the bar-window which looks into the passage was bolted; I did not take notice whether all the windows were shut, I did not go into the parlour; the maid had cleaned the parlour before I went in; I did not see the till wrenched at all.</p>
               <p>Did no person in the bar shew you the bar, and tell you it was wrenched? - No.</p>
               <p>Did your husband tell you that the money had been taken out of the till? - No, not till he was sent for out; then he said he had been robbed.</p>
               <p>When had you last any communication with the till? - An hour before I went to-bed; my husband had the key of me to lock the door; I went to the till for what I wanted, but I cannot tell what money was in it, there were halfpence in it.</p>
               <p>How much do you think there were? - Two or three pounds worth there might be, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Were they loose, or in papers? - Loose.</p>
               <p>Had any body that day the key, but you or your husband? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing besides money in the till? - No, without it was bits of ginger or chalk.</p>
               <p>Was there no screw there? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Did you never see a screw there? - There were screws and nails there; there was ginger and chalk.</p>
               <p>Did you see a button, or button stone there? - No, I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. When you came down in the morning, you found your servants had been serving in the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was no more than usual? - No.</p>
               <p>Who had the key in the morning? - They came into the room for the key; they had it from my husband.</p>

               <p>Do you swear that? - Before he was up.</p>
               <p>As for the window of the bar, that you found bolted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And as for the opening of the door, can you account for that? - I did not say the key of the bar, but the key of the cross door my husband gave to the servants.</p>
               <p>How did they open the bar-door? - By taking down the shutter.</p>
               <p>Then it opens of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was no breaking or wrenching shewn to you? - No.</p>

               <p>Was Till near her? - He was fast asleep when I first went in, to appearance; then he got up some time after, I cannot be accountable for the time, then he went to the corner of the tap-room and sat down, and in she came, and said she had been robbed, she was very near Till at that time; I did not hear her make any charge against him.</p>
               <p>Should you have heard her make any charge against him if she had? - I certainly must, but I heard her make no charge against him, I came in about six; Till was in when I came there, and I did not miss him out of the house while I staid, which was till a quarter past ten or more; Till was there all the time to the best of my knowledge, I certainly must have missed the man if he had been absent at any time.</p>

               <p>Court. You swear to the best of your knowledge, which is very different to the swearing to the fact; now Sir, I wish to know of you, whether you can swear positively that he did not go out; answer me, yes or no? - To the best of my knowledge he did not; I will swear that he did not go out no further than where I sat on the seat; I never went out, and believe he did not, if he had gone out I must have observed him, I left him in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. He was awake when Mrs. Handland called out a robbery? - He was sitting in the corner, he might be asleep, he was a yard or two from Mrs. Handland, I remember her very well saying she had been robbed, but I do not remember the words, she looked round the tap-room when she said so, I believe, but I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>Court. If she said she had been robbed by a friend, and not by an enemy, must you have heard it? - I think I should, but I do not recollect it particularly, I was in a box with a different company.</p>

               <p>Then during all the time you were looking at Meredith, Till might have gone out of the tap-room? - I think if he had gone out, I must have seen it, he was under the jack; he was by me all the time.</p>
               <p>Might not he go out, and you not have seen him? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Now you have sworn, and you are to speak to the utmost of your knowledge, do you think he could have gone out without your observing him? - No, Sir, upon my soul I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. Then if that is the case, you can swear positively he did not go out? - I am sure he could not well go out, because he was facing of me.</p>
               <p>You may swear you never saw him go out, and will you swear he did not go out? - I cannot go to say that.</p>
               <p>You did not observe that he did not go out, but you will not positively swear that he did not? - No.</p>

               <p>Did she say who had robbed her at that time? - No, I cannot say she did, she only said a man asked for half a crown, and he would go with her, she would not give it him, but she told him, she was a woman of great spirit, and if he did her business, she would pay him well, he said he wanted nothing but half a crown, I have known Mr. Till twelve months, I have known her sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see this man carry a bundle, as she wanted you to swear? - I did not, I told her it was false, and I would be hanged before I would do it, she told me she had lost a yellow gown at that time, and that if I would be good to her, I should never want bread.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. My Lord, I submit this evidence is not relative to the present charge, it is not specified in the indictment, was this to be the case, any sort of evidence might be produced, as it may subject the the prisoner to another indictment, that of subornation of perjury, I never remember any such evidence admitted, the case is, whether she swore falsly before the Court, when she swore she saw this man with the bundle.</p>
               <p>Court. The question here is, not whether this woman has sworn false, but whether she has sworn corruptly, and this is certainly evidence to be received to shew the intention of the party, and it is a circumstance to be left to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. Pray madam, who are you? - I am a Jewess.</p>
               <p>That I know, where do you live? - No. 6, Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>What do you deal in? - Old clothes.</p>
               <p>How many times have you been an evidence in this Court? - Never but once, about some shoes I bought of a neighbour.</p>
               <p>You was suspected of buying them knowing them to have been stolen? - No, Sir, I came up as an evidence.</p>
               <p>When was it you say you told Till of this? - The very day I knew of it.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was that? - It was the Friday after the Wednesday that she told me she had been robbed.</p>
               <p>How came you not been here, upon Till's trial? - He never sent for me or else I should have come.</p>
               <p>Who was present at that time? - There were a good many people at once.</p>
               <p>Who was present?</p>
               <p>Russell. I was present for one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask that witness Cohan, how long it is since her husband was hanged? - I am a married woman, my husband is alive now, he has not lived with me these seven years.</p>
               <p>Was ever any man hanged that passed as your husband? - I never lived with no man but my husband, I know better than that.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. What was the name of that man that was hanged? - She had two children by him at the birth.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of that? - I know of no man in the world that was hanged, belonging to me.</p>
               <p>Do you know any man that was hanged for stealing a hat? - No, my Lord, I do not, I never knew a man that was charged with stealing of hats in my life.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear of any such charge of any man of your acquaintance? - No.</p>
               <p>- BLACKETER sworn.</p>
               <p>I took a man from Litchfield-street office; he was tried and convicted; I have seen this woman come to Newgate to see him, but I do not know there was any connection.</p>
               <p>Cohan. My Lord, I knew a man that was taken up for robbing a baker's shop in Rupert-street, and this was the man I came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220199"/> to see, but I never knew a man about a hat.</p>
               <p>Was that man convicted? - Yes, he was convicted, and died for it.</p>
               <p>Now, I asked you if you knew any man that was tried and convicted here, and you said, no? - That was about a hat; you would not have me say anything that is not right; this was for a suit of clothes; he was no more my husband than any other man that is here; I knew that man's mother, she nursed me; I have been parted from my husband these seven years, I defy the world to say anything against me.</p>

               <p>I believe you have been tried for something? - I have been tried, but not for any thing out of the way; I was tried for my wages.</p>
               <p>Was not you tried for a fraud? - They made a fraud of it.</p>
               <p>I believe you was acquitted through defect of evidence? - I do not know how it was, but I know very well I did not mean to make it a defraud, I meant for the gentleman to have the money, if I had thought on it.</p>

             was set to the Bar, whose Case was reserved for the Opinion of the Twelve Judges, which Opinion was delivered by Mr. Justice Gould, as follows:</p>
               <p>This prisoner was indicted at the Sessions at this place, the 14th of September, 1785: the indictment set forth that at the quarter Sessions, 
               <persName id="o17860222-1-person1317">

             the 31st, in the 23d of his present Majesty; the prisoner who had been committed by a Justice of Peace, had been charged upon oath with being a rogue and vagabond, being found in an inclosed yard belonging to Mr. 
               <persName id="o17860222-1-person1318">
                  William

            's dwelling-house, and the Sessions having upon examination adjudged him to be a rogue and vagabond, ordered him to be detained in the House of Correction for the space of six months: then the indictment stated that at the Sessions of the Peace, holden by adjournment, on the 12th of December in the same year, the same prisoner was brought before that Court, committed by a warrant of two Justices as an incorrigible rogue, having escaped from the House of Correction before the expiration of six months, for which he had been committed; and these two Justices on his examination adjuged him to be an incorrigible rogue, and to be detained in the same House of Correction for two years; then the indictment further charges, that the prisoner, on the 14th of May did offend again in like manner, as a rogue and vagabond; having upon him a certain implement called an iron crow, with an intent feloniously to break and enter a coach-house and stable; and also having upon him a certain offensive weapon called a pistol, with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220190"/> intent feloniously to assault some persons. Upon these charges in the indictment at the Old Bailey Sessions, in September, 1785, he was tried and found guilty, but two objections were taken by his Counsel, first that the offence described being created by the statute of the twenty-third of his present Majesty, cannot support an indictment under the act of Parliament, made in the 17th of King 
               <persName id="o17860222-1-person1319">
                  George
               <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1319" type="given" value="George"/>
                     <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1319" type="gender" value="male"/>
                  </persName>
             the Second: the next objection was, that the words in like manner, in the act of the 17th of King 
               <persName id="o17860222-1-person1320">
                  George
               <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1320" type="given" value="George"/>
                     <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1320" type="gender" value="male"/>
                  </persName>
             the Second, referred to offences committed as an incorrigible rogue, whereas this prisoner offending on this indictment is stated to be offending in like manner as a rogue and vagabond not saying as an incorrigible rogue. These two objections were by the Recorder laid before the Judges for their consideration, and as to the first objection, which is, that the offence described being created by the 23d of his present Majesty, cannot support an indictment under the 27th of 
               <persName id="o17860222-1-person1321">
                  George
               <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1321" type="given" value="George"/>
                     <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1321" type="gender" value="male"/>
                  </persName>
             the Second; all the Judges are of opinion that there is no ground for this objection: the statute of the 23d of the present King, enacts that a person under the circumstances therein described (among which the case of the prisoner as stated in the indictment expresly falls) shall be deemed a rogue and vagabond within the intent and meaning of the statute made in the 17th year of King 
               <persName id="o17860222-1-person1322">
                  George
               <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1322" type="given" value="George"/>
                     <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1322" type="gender" value="male"/>
                  </persName>
             the second; the Judges think this provision has the same operation, as if the descriptions in this act of the 23d of his present Majesty, had been originally inserted in the first statute in addition to what is therein specified to constitute the offence: The title of the act, though not regarded as a part of an act of Parliament, yet may serve in some degree, to point out the intent of the legislature, and in the present case, the title is</p>
               <p>"An Act to extend the</p>
               <p>"provisions (or an act describing the 17th</p>
               <p>"of King 
               <persName id="o17860222-1-person1323">
                  George
               <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1323" type="given" value="George"/>
                     <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1323" type="gender" value="male"/>
                  </persName>
             the Second) to contain</p>
               <p>"cases not therein mentioned." Upon this objection therefore, all the Judges concur in opinion, that the statute of the 23d of 
               <persName id="o17860222-1-person1324">
                  George
               <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1324" type="given" value="George"/>

                  </persName>
             the Third, is to be considered as incorporated into, and making a part of the 17th of his late Majesty: as to the second objection, which is that the words in like manner of the 17th of 
               <persName id="o17860222-1-person1325">
                  George
               <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1325" type="given" value="George"/>
                     <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1325" type="gender" value="male"/>
                  </persName>
             the Second, refer to offences committed as an incorigible rogue, whereas the indictment states the prisoner to have offended in like manner, as a rogue and vagabond, and it therefore does not follow in the words or intention of the act of parliament; the Judges are unanimous in opinion, upon weighing the several provisions in the act of the 17th of 
               <persName id="o17860222-1-person1326">
                  George
               <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1326" type="given" value="George"/>
                     <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1326" type="gender" value="male"/>
                  </persName>
             the Second, applicable to the case of the prisoner, that this indictment is sufficient. - The act of the 17th of 
               <persName id="o17860222-1-person1327">
                  George
               <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1327" type="given" value="George"/>

                  </persName>
             the Second divides the offences into three classes; first, idle and disorderly persons, these are to be punished by one or two Justices with one, or more, months imprisonment; the second are rogues and vagabonds, punishable by one or more Justices, by whipping, or to be committed to the next general or quarter sessions; the next are incorrigible rogues, who it seems are to be committed till the sessions, and not punishable before. At the first commitment of the prisoner, the quarter sessions adjudged him to be a rogue and vagabond, which is one of the offences mentioned in the act of the 17th of King 
               <persName id="o17860222-1-person1328">
                  George

                     <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1328" type="gender" value="male"/>

             the Second, and detained him in the House of Correction for six months; after this, he is brought before the Sessions again, having escaped before the end of the six months, and on his examination, is adjudged by the Sessions to be an incorrigible rogue, and ordered to be detained in the House of Correction for two years; then it appears by the indictment, that before the expiration of the two years, he was guilty of another offence specified in the act of the 23d of his present Majesty; for by that act, it is declared, such person should be deemed a rogue and vagabond, within the intent and meaning of the 17th of 
               <persName id="o17860222-1-person1329">
                  George
               <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1329" type="given" value="George"/>
                     <interp inst="o17860222-1-person1329" type="gender" value="male"/>
                  </persName>
             the Second; the provision of that act, in the 8th section, is, that if an incorrigible rogue, so ordered by the Sessions to be detained, shall, before the expiration of the time, break, or make his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220191"/> escape, from the House of Correction, or shall offend again in like manner, he shall be deemed guilty of felony. The context, which adopts the words in like manner, refers to breaking, or escaping, from the House of Correction; therefore, recourse must be had to another part of the statute for the meaning of those words: now, the third section provides, that all rogues and vagabonds, who shall so break or escape, and all who, after having been punished as rogues and vagabonds, and discharged, shall again commit any of the said offences, shall be deemed incorrigible rogues; to which provision in section the 3d, the words in like manner in the 8th section, must, in my opinion, necessarily refer; then the situation of the prisoner is, that having been adjudged an incorrigible rogue, and having been committed for two years, he escapes, and is at large before the expiration of the time, and commits a new act of vagrancy, he thereby becomes an incorrigible rogue the second time, and so incurs the guilt of felony: these facts being disclosed in the indictment, and no technical terms or words of art being necessary for the description of the offence, the law must draw the inference from the words, and that is, that by what the prisoner has so done, he becomes an incorrigible rogue a second time, and consequently has offended in like manner, and has so been guilty of the felony; he is therefore in such a case as the act declares his person shall be deemed and taken to be guilty of felony. It is the opinion, therefore, of all the Judges, that this prisoner is liable to the sentence imposed by the act of parliament for such a felon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Prisoner, the Judges having unanimously declared their opinion that your conviction was legal, the <rs id="o17860222-1-punish651" type="punishmentDescription">
