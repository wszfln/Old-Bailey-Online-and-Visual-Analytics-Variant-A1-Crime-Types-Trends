I received a warrant to apprehend the prisoner on the 22nd of October—I went to li<lb/>verpool, and saw him on Monday, the 29th, at Westderby, about three miles from Liverpool—I did not know him before—I said, "How do you do, I believe your name is Goodbody?"—he said, "Yes, it is"—I said, "I believe there has been something between you and Mr. Moseley"—he said, "Yes, there has; I sold six beasts for him, and I have got the money to pay him"—I told him I had a warrant, to apprehend him, and he must go back to Huntingdon with me—on the road to Liverpool he said, "I am d—d glad you are come for me"—I said, "Do you mean so?"—he said, "Yes, for I have been miserable ever since I have been away; very likely this is for the best"—when we got to Liverpool I offered him time, in cus<lb/>tody of a Liverpool officer, to get himself ready while I got myself ready to go to London—he said, "Don't do that, I don't want every body to know about it; I will give you my money, there is more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is more than sufficient to pay Mr. Moseley"—I said, "I must not take his money, J must take him"—I brought him to London—Liverpool is about two hundred miles from Huntingdon.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 32, James-street, Manchester-square, and am a harness-maker—I have known the prisoner about five years—she called on me last Sunday fortnight, about seven o'clock in the evening, and asked me if I would get her a bill of exchange discounted, bearing the acceptance of Lady Wood, of No. 4, Bedford-square—I said I could, if the acceptance would bear investigation—I asked her if she had got the acceptance—she said not, but she had just left Lady Wood, and was to return to her about nine o'clock—she told me previous to that, that her ladyship had promised her her acceptance for 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked her how her ladyship came to promise her acceptance for so large an amount—she stated</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183812170027"/>
               <p>that the had laid before her ladyship all her papers and documents relative to her business in the country, that her ladyship pitied her case very much, and said she was sorry she had not got so much cash by her, but if her accept<lb/>ance was of any use she should have it for two months—I asked her if she had a stamp—she said she had not, but that Lady Wood had given her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to purchase it—that would be the correct stamp—she asked me what my friend would charge for discounting the bill—I told her, 5 per cent, or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, making 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she then went away—she came next morning about nine o'clock and brought this bill—I went to a banking-house, and on the same Monday I went to Lady Wood myself—I had not cashed the bill—in consequence of what passed between Lady Wood and myself I directly returned to my own house, accompanied by Mr. Overton—it was about one o'clock when I got back—the prisoner was there, and I asked her where she got the bill—she stated from Lady Wood—I said, "Well, that must be wrong, for Mr. Overton has been down to Hoare's bank, and they have detained the bill"—she said she certainly obtained the bill from Lady Wood, and that it was a genuine bill—I told her Hoare's had declared they did not believe the acceptance to be Lady Wood's hand-writing—she said it was the hand-writing of Lady Wood—I said it was useless to utter falsehoods, for I had been to Lady Wood myself, and she had declared that she never accepted a bill in her life, and that she had not seen the prisoner for three or four months—she said, "Well, if Lady Wood will deny her hand-writing I suppose I must bear the <hi rend="italic">brunt</hi> of it"—(I had not told her it would be better for her to confess, or worse if she did not, nor had Mr. Overton)—Mr. Overton went away a short time—the prisoner went into an adjoining room, which is a bed-room, and I afterwards found she had swallowed laudanum—I sent for a doctor, and she recovered—I told her she had done a very wrong deed, and observed to her at the same time that she had put me and Mr. Overton in a very awkward predicament—she said she could not help it—that it was all brought on by a man named Pankridge—she wanted me to write to him in the country, but I did not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stable-keeper, and live in Pond-street, Hampstead. I have a house there, there is a stable in the yard opposite the house—there are three rooms over the stable, leading from one to the other—the first room is called the hay-loft, the second the kitchen, and the third the bed-room, in which I usually sleep, but I sometimes sleep at the other house—on the 6th of December, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I went to the Flask public-house, and found Walsh there, (who works for me, and lodges and sleeps in the hay-loft,) with Banks and Hor<lb/>gan, in the tap-room, drinking—I called for three-halfpenny-worth of gin and a pot of beer—I do not think I drank any of the beer—I had the gin standing at the bar—I had taken a glass or two, and do not mean to say I was perfectly sober—I knew what I was about—I left the Flask about twenty minutes after six o'clock, with Walsh, Horgan, and Banks, and we all came down to my stable—I went up stairs into the bed-room to strike a light—Horgan and Banks both followed me into the bed-room—I had the light—we all came out of the room, and brought some provision for the pigs out of the kitchen—I locked the door of the bed-room and my chest, and all was locked then—I put the key into my pocket—I came out of the bed-room into the kitchen, locked that door, and put that key into my pocket—I should have had two keys in my pocket, but I could only find one afterwards—I am quite sure I put the first key in my pocket, although I found it next morning on the floor—I am not sure about the other key—I went to feed the pigs, and found Horgan and Banks in the yard—directly after they all three went with me to a <hi rend="italic">Tom and Jerry</hi> shop—we had a pot of beer there, but I do not know whether I drank any of it—I went and fetched three pints of beer out of my own kitchen, as the woman said she had none—I unlocked the door to get it, bat I locked it again—I am not sure whether I drank any of that—we left the <hi rend="italic">Tom and Jerry</hi> shop about eleven o'clock—Walsh saw us come up to the gate, and then went away—I went in, and went to bed—the prisoners followed me—they were both in the room when I went to bed—after I was in bed I saw Banks take up my trowsers, but thought he was putting them on the chair—I did not think he was taking any thing—I found them there in the morning—Banks took the candle and candlestick, and both left the room, wishing me good night—I told them to put the light out, and I fell asleep—I slept in the other house that night, which I had the care of, not over the stables—it is an empty house I have the care of, for Mr. Ledden of Carey-street—I have the use of it, but it is not my dwelling-house—I never take my meals there—I got up in the morning a few minutes before six o'clock, and went to the room over the stable—I found the kitchen-door, which is the first door, undone—the door leading into the bed-room was broken open—I felt on the top of a chest, where I knew I had left my silver, and found that gone—Walsh was in bed at this time, in the hay-loft—I went to the chest that was locked the night before, and found it broken open—I then called Walsh to strike a light, and told him I was robbed—I</p>

               <p>and cannot tell when they were taken—I teat for the prisoner to where he worked, and he came—I told him I had lost some of my clothes, and many other things, more than I knew of the night before—he said he could not account for it—I asked if he had been to see after the woman—he said he had not—I asked whether he had done work for the day—he said no, he had got about half-an-hour's work to do—I told him he had better go and do it, and in the interim I got a policeman—we then went in search, of the woman at her cousin's, where she used to frequent, but did not find her—I asked him whether she was his wife or not, and he said no, but they always passed as man and wife in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. The prisoner and the woman came to lodge with us in October—I let the lodgings to the woman—the prisoner was not present when she took them—she passed as his wife—she said he had sent for her out of the country—on Tuesday, the 20th of November, the prisoner went into the country with his master's horse—on the Monday night before, I missed a blanket and great coat off my lodger's bed, which is in the next room to the prisoner's—I mentioned it to the prisoner when he came home on Thursday—he said he thought he had slept a night or two very cold, and he had asked his wife to put his great coat on his bed, as the clothes seemed very thin—I went into his room, and missed two blankets, a pair of sheets, a bolster, two pillow-cases, and a pillow—there had been two pairs of sheets in the room when it was let to them, but the woman gave me one pair dirty, while the prisoner was away—she was often out three or four hours in the middle of the day, while he was at work, but she always locked the door, so that I could never get into their room, after they took it—next morning I went up into his room with him—it was in a very bad state, and he said, "Would any one believe there was such a woman, to leave a room in this state?"—I said, "Mr. Robinson, don't you know the woman?"—he said no, he knew nothing of her no more than I did—I said, "You know her cousins, and frequently see them, and they come here, you must know her?"—he made no answer to that, but said he would go after her—he did not tell me whether she was his wife or not—the trowsers, punch-ladle, and other things were taken from our room, which is the story below theirs—I cannot say when they were taken—I had seen them all safe, after they came there—I missed them on Friday and Saturday, when I looked over the things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the afternoon of the 6th of December I saw the prisoner passing backwards and for<lb/>wards seven or eight times, looking in at the door—at last I saw him unbutton the coat, which was on a block inside the shop door, and take it off—I ran out and caught hold of him with it in his possession—he was in the act of giving it to another person, who, when he saw me, ran away and threw it on the ground.</p>

I had scalded wet at the time, and could not run—I never had the coat—when he took me I told him that was the man who ran along there. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I am confident the prisoner is the man who took it off the block—I was watching him all the time going backwards and forwards—he walked quite expertly—he did not appear to me to he lame—the coat was about fourteen inches from the sill of the door—I was about two yards inside myself, and saw his face several times—I got ready to run out the moment he snatched it—I don't think he saw me—he was not two yards from the door when I took him.</p>

On the 12th of December I had a person of the name of Griffiths in custody—he was drunk in Holborn—I took him to the Bow-street station—I stopped at the corner of Great Wild-street—the prisoner noticed me as we were going along—be said, "I know that man, I will lend you a hand"—in going across Drury-lane he said, "Which way are you going?"—I said, "Down Broad-court"—he then took hold of Griffiths's left arm with his right hand and put it behind him, and then I saw him take the pieces out of Griffiths's waistcoat pocket with his left hand—Griffiths said, "I know what you are about, you want to rob me"—the prisoner said, "Oh, he has not so much <hi rend="italic">blunt</hi> now as he had about an hour ago"—he lifted up his great coat and put the pieces into his pocket—I heard the sound of them—he did it quite openly, so that I could notice it—I heard three distinct pieces, one by one, drop into his pocket—I took Griffiths to the station—I did not give the prisoner in charge—I walked my to my beat with the prisoner—as we got to Lincoln's Inn-fields he said, "What do you think of that d—d wretch?—I should like to <hi rend="italic">fleece</hi> him because he wanted to charge us with robbery"—at the station-house Grif<lb/>fiths had pointed to me, and said, "I give that man in charge, and likewise that (pointing to the prisoner) for robbing me"—after leaving the prisoner I met Knight and told him of all the circumstances—I searched Griffiths at the station, and found on him one shilling, three sixpences, and 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 12th of December, about half-past two o'clock, I met the prisoner in Hanover-square—I lost sight of him for a few minutes, and then met him coming up Little Brook-street—he there met another man—they went down Brook-street to Bond-street, and up and down several streets for about two hours, till half-past four o'clock—when I first met the prisoner he had a basket, which appeared to me to be empty, and at half-past four o'clock I saw the man who had been in company with him put a pot into the basket—I went up and laid hold of them both—they went very quietly with me for some distance—I asked what they had got—they made me no answer—when they had got twenty or thirty yards the prisoner threw the basket over an area, and they both began to struggle very much—the other man made his escape, and left the collar of his coat in my hand—the prisoner made an attempt to throw me down, which he could not do—I secured him against the railing, during which time I received a wound in my arm and another in my leg he then made another attempt to throw me—I called a man, and we got the prisoner to the station-house—I desired the man to take up the pots and bring them to the station-house, which he did—these two pots were in the prisoner's basket.</p>

On the 15th of December, the prisoner came to the shop about twenty minutes after twelve o'clock—she took these nine yards of printed cotton off the fstool, put it under her cloak and walked away—I ran to the door, and called a young man from the shop, who ran and stopped her—I saw him take it from her—this is it—it is my master's—the officer took her into custody.</p>

On this Sunday evening I went to get some water, be<lb/>tween eight and nine o'clock, from the water-butt which is opposite the stairs, and saw the three prisoners and Burroughs, two in the water-closet, and two outside—when they saw me, the two outside rushed into the in<lb/>side—I knew them before, and am sure of them—I communicated to Mr. Emanuel what I had seen that night—Burgin asked me, when he was taken, if I had not seen him about the place, and I said yes, I had seen them all.</p>

I have been employed by Mr. Emanuel in watching at his door, and going of errands for him—on the Friday evening before this Sunday, I was playing about Gee's-court, and Henrietta-street, and saw Burgin and Keefe walking down—they were talking about going to Mr. Emanuel's shop to get some things, and asked me whether I would be</p>

                  </hi>. I am a minister of the Church of England, and am curate of Trinity Church, Borough; I reside in Trinity-square. I came to reside in London about Whitsuntide, 1831, and knew the prisoner four or live months afterwards—he is a tailor, and I employed him to make clothes—that was the way I first knew him—he has not been in the habit of applying to me to lend him money until recently—he used to ap<lb/>ply to me for orders, but not very frequently—he first applied to me to lend him money about last Easter—he pleaded great poverty—I rejected him several times, at last, seeing him in distress, I gave him a trifle—about three weeks before her Majesty's coronation, I was coming out of my church, and under the portico, the prisoner came up to me and asked if I could not give him a job, and if I could not, to lend him, or let him have money—I had lent him once before, perhaps, five or six shillings—I refused on this occasion, and he said, "I have something very important to communicate to you, and wish you to meet me at some place, as it is something which affects your character"—that was the first time he ever made any commu<lb/>nication of that sort to me—I said, "There is nothing between us which calls for such a meeting, and I shall not come"—he then said, "You had better come; if you do not, you will rue the day as long as you live,"or words to that effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did that have the effect on your mind to induce you to meet him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It had, and I met him, either that, or the following evening, (I forget which,) near the Eagle-tavern, City-road—when I saw him, he said, "Walk this way"—I followed him, and after we got into rather a lonely place, he said, "Can you not lend me some money, or give me some money"—I said, "You have no claim on me, I cannot do so; you can have no money from me"—he then said, "I am now going to say something of very great importance to you, and it is no use your calling out for help, or giving me into the hands of the police, for if you do, remember I am armed—and if you do, by G—d I will have my revenge; and if you do not assist me, I will say you took indecent liberties with me some time ago"—he was exceedingly excited while saying this—he threw his arms about, and used violent ges<lb/>ticulation—I thought he was going to attack me—it was a lonely spot—I was so completely paralysed and overcome, I scarcely knew what I was about—I was induced, in consequence of that threat, to give him some money on the spot—I am not certain how much I gave him, it was per<lb/>haps from ten to fifteen shillings.</p>

On Friday, the 30th of November, after I took my money, I was with a man named Tilliard, and Trundell at Gammon's public-house—Tilliard asked me, in Trundell's presence, what was in my master's barn, which is called Spencer's Barn—I told him some wheat—Tilliard said he wanted to make a sovereign for rent between this and Christmas, and he must have some of it—I told him to mind he was not <hi rend="italic">cathed</hi> at it—I went to work about six o'clock on the Monday morning, and saw Neele about eight o'clock in the barn—I went with him round the rick-yard, and saw some foot-maiks—I did not tell him whose I thought they were—I followed them in the direction they went—they led towards Gammon's premises, which are about 200 or 300 yards from Spencer's Barn—they were both from and to the barn—I afterwards saw the patrol compare Trundell's shoes with those foot-marks, and they appeared like then—I continued to work for Mr. Sherborn a week after this—I then staid away for two days, and when I came back Mr. Sherborn would have nothing more to do with me.</p>

               <p>the 3rd of December, I received information and went to the bam, and ex<lb/>amined about the rick-yard—I saw the patrol compare some shoes with the foot-marks there, and in my judgment those shoes made the foot-marks—they were in the rick-yard where the barn stands, and also in the way to Mr. Gammon's premises from the rick-yard—Withall afterwards showed me some sacks of wheat, three of which had Mr. Sherborn's name on them—I com<lb/>pared the grain in them with the bulk in the barn, and in my judgment it had formed part of the bulk that was there on the Saturday, and which came from the thirty-two acre field—it had a quantity of wild oats among it—the wheat in the sacks was not cleaned, nor was the wheat in the barn—in my judgment they had formed part of the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the horse patrol at Bedfont to pro<lb/>duce samples of the wheat found in the loft, and that in the barn. On Mon<lb/>day morning, the 3rd of December, about half-past eleven o'clock, I went to Mr. Sherborn's, and in consequence of information I accompanied him to Gammon's stable—I found the loft door fastened inside—you have to go up a ladder from the stable into the loft—the stable-door was unfastened—I found some hay at the far end of the loft, which I removed, and under it found five sacks of wheat, three of which were marked with Mr. Sherborn's name—I took the prisoner Bavin into custody directly—he was down in the yard at the time—I then went and took Trundell at the Black Dog tap, about 150 yards from Gammon's—I took of his shoes, and compared them with some foot-marks in the rick-yard—they exactly corresponded—I tried them to six or seven impressions—two in the rick-yard, and others across the meadows, in a direction to Gammon's yard—it was not along the high road, but over fences and gates—there was a faint impression in Gammon's stable-yard, but I could not identify that—there was a little wheat scattered about in the yard leading up to the stable door, and some at the stable door also—I compared both Trundell's shoes—the right shoe was particularly remark<lb/>able, having a half-tip on the heel, four nails on the other half of the heel, and seven rows of nails on the sole—one nail was missing from near the toe, and that was also missing in the impression—the tip and four nails at the heel were also in the impression—I have not been able to find Tilliard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you the shoes here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he had but that one pair to wear—they were laced shoes—it had rained in the night, which made the impression in Gammon's stable-yard faint, as it was gravel—it did not affect the others—as the soil was soft—I did not compare Til<lb/>liard's or Withall's shoes—Withall was there in the morning, and of course he left foot-marks there—I knew Withall before—I have only had him in charge once—I took him on suspicion of the murder—there was a half-tip on both Trundell's shoes—they were not old, about two or three months old—they were very good.</p>

               <p>next day he was taken before Sir John Gibbon, and committed for three months for deserting his family—there has never been any pretence since, for charging him with the murder—he has always been in the neighbour<lb/>hood, and I knew where to find him—Mr. Sherborn and Mr. Copas were with me when I applied the shoes—Trundell gave them to me himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the owner of this farm at Bedfont. I was with the officer when Trundell's shoes were compared with the foot-marks in the rick-yard and meadow—they corresponded in every particular—a nail was wanting in one of the shoes, and I observed the wanting mark in the impression distinctly—I also observed the four nails, and the half tip—they corresponded in every particular—I saw some corn and chaff lying about between my premises and Gammon's—I went with the officer to Gammon's stable, and saw the corn found in the loft, it was part of mine—I swear positively to it—I have samples of each, and they perfectly correspond—my own name was on the sack in full. Withall was in my service—I knew his character was indifferent, but thought it right to em<lb/>ploy him, to keep him out of the poor-house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the samples taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but I desired them to be taken—I compared the two bulks also—I took a hand<lb/>ful from one of the sacks found in the loft, and went and compared it with the remainder of the bulk lying in the barn, and they are precisely the same—I swear they are the same sort—there cannot be a difference of opinion about it—I have been a farmer all my life—there are clivers and crow-needles amongst this wheat—mine are not fuller of weeds than others—I never yet saw any perfectly clean when it was first thrashed, before it is winnowed—I dare say there are many wild oats at Bedfont—I fortu<lb/>nitely have but little, indeed I do not know that I have another spot on the farm except this thirty-two acre field with them, but one acre, and that was owing to the severe frost last winter—this wild oat is not the common kind, but a long oat with a beard—I have known wild oats be in the ground for several years, and then come up in great quantities.</p>

I found the wheel on the 8th of December, at the prisoner's house, on another barrow—I asked him bow he came by it—he said he bought the wheel of a man who came round gathering old iron and bones, and he had made the barrow himself—I have examined it—the barrow is not mine, but the wheel is—it was annexed to another barrow when I lost it.</p>

I live at No. 11, Fleur-de-lis-street, in the liberty of Norton Falgate, and am the wife of James Chamberlain—he occupies the house—the back of the house looks into Mr. Cave's yard. On Wednesday, the 28th of November, I was at home washing at the back of the house until between six and seven o'clock, and then I was eugaged with my family in the back parlour—about seven o'clock I found the win<lb/>dow broken looking towards Mr. Cave's yard, and both the drawers open—the window was broken from the outside—a man might put his hand through and unfasten the window—the sash was opened from the outside—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of information I received on the evening of the 13th I went to No. 7, Lascelles-court, Broad-street, St. Giles's, and found Inman going to bed there in the first floor room—I took him to the station-house, told him what it was for, and asked what he had done with the writing-desk—he said he had stolen it, but had not sold it—I asked who was in company with him—he said there were two, one named Church, and told me where Church lived—I went back, and found Church in bed in the lower room of the same house—Matthews who was with me told him we were officers of Bow-street, and he must come with us for stealing a writing-desk—he denied all knowledge of it—we took him to the station-house—I asked Inman what became of the desk—he said Church and a man not in custody had sold it—I asked whether he could tell me where—he said he thought he could show me—he afterwards took me to the prisoner Jones's house, No. 20, Little White's-alley, and told me it was there—it was nearly one o'clock in the morning—the street door was open—I went into the passage and knocked at the parlour door—Jones opened it—I asked if he had bought a desk—he paused for a time, and then took me to the cupboard where it was deposited in a bag on one of the shelves—Matthews asked him if there was not some more articles—Matthews opened a bottom drawer where the cloak was, and another where the petticoat was—Jones's wife pointed to the drawers where they were—she was in bed at the time—I took Jones into custody to Bow-street, and next day before the Magistrate, while we were waiting at the office door I heard Church say to Inman, who was crying, "You fool, what are you crying about? if you had repented you ought to have thought of this be<lb/>fore-hand—if you had stuck to me I would have stuck to you."</p>

On Saturday, the 1st of December, the female prisoner came into my shop, about a quarter-past three o'clock, to pay their last week's account, and to order some other goods—she paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—shortly after Mrs. Mitchell followed her into the shop, and accused her of picking up her purse—Mrs. Higgins said, "My good woman, I have not seen your purse, if I had I would give it you, but I am willing to be searched"—I am sure about that—I asked Mrs. Mitchell what there was in the purse—she said, "8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—she then said to Mrs. Higgins, "If you will not give it up by fair means we will make you do it by foul"—Mrs. Higgins then went to join her husband next door—Mrs. Higgins gave me a sovereign, and I gave her change—she came back very shortly and said they would not search her there, they were going to take her to the station-house—I went with them—Mrs. Mitchell then gave a different account of the contents of her purse—she mentioned three sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoners are highly respectable.</p>

I became acquainted with the prisoner at the latter end of July or the beginning of August—became to the shop and bought a cigar at first—he repeated his visits for two or three days—I have a daughter who is seventeen years old on the 3rd of this month—finding he made rather free with her, I asked him what he came so often for—he said he wanted my daughter—I asked who he was—he said he was in the Custom-house, and had an income of from 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—I asked where his parents lived—he said in Canterbury-place, near me—I said I should like to see his father—he brought his father, and he informed us that he was in the Custom-house, and had a situation of from 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, that he was in the Comptroller's office, and very soon would have a situation of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—I believe the person is his father, but he is living with Mrs. Bundock, the prisoner's mother, and he has a wife living—I have since found be never was in the Custom-house—(the day he took my child away he told me he was going to receive 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his salary)—I thought him respectable, and allowed him to visit my daughter—on the 18th of August he was at the house—I and my husband were at home—(Myers does not lodge at our house, but keeps his clothes there in a box behind the counter)—the prisoner asked me if I would take a letter down to his father's that day, and I did—he also asked my husband to go to Mr. Wayland the watchmaker, stating that he wanted to see him—he went out, and I went with the letter, leaving the prisoner and my daughter there—I returned in about half-an-hour or three-quarters of an hour, after talking to his father—when I returned I found the prisoner and my daughter sitting in the parlour reading a book—the father came up, and in the evening they asked me if they might take a walk—I told them not to be long, as it was the first day of Camberwell fair, and I migbt be busy—the prisoner and my daughter went out together and did not return—I never saw any more of them for five days—I did not give the prisoner permission to take Myers's clothes out of the box—he knew the things were there, as he had seen Myers put the things on and wear them.</p>
