                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Essex Street, Strand—I know Mr. Hatton, a solicitor of position, in whom I have perfect confi<lb/>doence—he made a communication to me respecting the prisoner, and on Wednesday, 18th May, the prisoner called at my office—I cannot give the exact words he used—he said he required from 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. this week; the security he offered was a charge on a building estate at Low 8t., Tilbury—he told me he was an architect and surveyor; that he had recently pur<lb/>chased a property for 4,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a Mr. Charles Gideon Jefferies, of Croydon—he said he had paid 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the purchase money, but about 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. remained due, for which the vendor had a lien on the deeds—he said he had cut up the estate for building purposes, laid out roads, and expended, I think he said, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that the money was required by Friday or Saturday to repay an amount advanced for wages or expenses for working—this scarcely left me any time to make inquiries—I inquired if there were any incumbrances beyond the lien—he said "No," there were no incumbrances beyond the lien to the vendors—I did not see him again—I afterwards became aware that there was a further incumbrance of 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I required him to make a statutory declaration; that was the condition under which I made the loan—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is signed by the prisoner—it was brought to me before I advanced the money—I advanced it believing that statement to be true—if I had known that in addition to the 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there had been a further advance of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I would not have lent a halfpenny—in addition to this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188710240002"/>
               <p>declaration I had a bill of exchange for the amount; that was dishonoured—I did not make any inquiries; some one came to me, and I went and looked at the property; it was an old gravel pit—there was something that perhaps might be called a road—a great part of the gravel and sand had been taken out to a depth of, I should think, 20 inches at the upper end—I should think it could not be used for building purposes without great expense—I walked several miles round the neighbourhood—about a mile beyond there were a great number of houses to let—in the imme<lb/>diate neighbourhood there was an old farmhouse and a few cottages; nothing else—the property was said to consist of about 10 acres—I hare been engaged for many years in the sale and purchase of land—I would not give 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is not the first occasion on which I have advanced money on the security of land—this was my own money—153<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the actual amount, with interest and charges—on other occasions I satis<lb/>fied myself of the value of the land before advancing money, either by sending a surveyor or going myself—I have been a solicitor ten years or rather more—I say this property consisted of a gravel pit, but the greater part had been exhausted—the whole property was 10 acres—I should call the gravel pit about three quarters of the total area—the nearest part to the property is called Mucking or Muckingford; that would be about a mile off—I went to Low Street Station; that is about a mile from the pits—this property is about three miles from Tilbury Docks by the look of it; I did not walk it;. it is within sight of the docks—if I had known there was a loan of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the property I would not have advanced the money, no matter what the value of the property might be—if there had been ample security I might have made the advance—I think the property is about eight minutes' walk from the station; not quite a mile—I should say it was a good three miles from the docks—I have seen the defendant's handwriting once; I believe I know it—I don't believe that the two or three corrections in the declaration are his—they are not in his handwriting—the alterations are against his interest—one is about the charge of 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the others are clerical errors; mistakes in the copying of the figures—I have for a long time thought that Jefferies and the prisoner were acting in collusion—I have suggested it to my Counsel—I was represented by Counsel or Solicitor at the police-court—I don't remember whether that view was put before the Magistrate; I don't think it was—I had not seen the property then—I saw it some time before last Session—I did not apply for a warrant or summons Against Jefferies; I thought I would prefer to see the end of this matter first—I may prosecute them for conspiracy—I issued a writ directly I found out the fraud; I did not serve it—I found out the fraud about two or three days before the hearing at Bow Street—Mr. Lash, the surveyor, went with me, and I saw the property—I put myself in communication with Mr. Meynell—I am the sole prosecutor—my loan was 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less expenses—the other loans are 961<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I would not give 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the property—I don't think it would sell at all—I think it is worth nothing—the houses I saw to let were about Tilbury and Muckingford—I did not walk to Tilbury; I went through by train.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The declaration is in the handwriting of one of the clerks of Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a mechanic employed in the telegraph instrument office at the General Post Office—on 15th September, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was on my way home from the Post Office with a young man named Buchanan, also employed in the Post Office—in Angel Street I saw the two prisoners—I never saw them before—Sumner tapped me on the shoulder and asked me for a party named Wilkins or Wilcox; he said they were working in the telegraph instrument workshop—I said there was no one of that name there—he said "He must work there, as he promised to meet us here to-night to get some platinum for us"—while Sumner was speaking to me Beckett was standing about a yard a half off—I asked Sumner to describe the man—he described him as a little taller than Beckett, and of a fair complexion—he said he was a married man with three children, living in Holloway, and he used the Eaglet public-house—I asked him if they wanted him very particularly—he repeated that he had promised to meet them with some platinum; that they had had four pennyweights, and he was to bring some more; that they paid at the rate of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—I said "Good night," and walked away—as I turned to go Sumner said "Do you think you could get me any of the stuff?"—I said "No"—he said "Do try and see what you can do for us"—I then saw their motive—he said he would meet us to-morrow night at the same place—I then went away—in the morning I communicated what had taken place to my superior officer in the Post</p>

               <p>Office, and in consequence I saw the two prisoners on Friday evening they were together—the next evening, Friday, they came up outside the Post Office about 10 minutes past 6—I said to Suniner "You are late"—he said "Yes, we have had to go to get a clock. Have you anything for us?"—I said "No, I have not been able to get it, but I have a shop, mate who will get it for me"—I arranged to meet them again on the Monday—Beckett was not very close to Sumner, but I believe he could hear what was said—I proposed when I got the stuff we should go to a room in the General Post Office—Sumner proposed going to a public-house—I said I would not go to a public-house; it would not be safe, as there were so many Post Office people about—I said I would take them into a room at the Post Office, where the price should be arranged—I met the two prisoners at 6 o'clock on the Monday—we were about to enter the building when Beckett handed money to Sumner—we went through the north-west door into 52 A room—I then produced the platinum, undid it, and showed it to then—Sumner said "I am afraid you have got too much for us; we shall only be able to take part"—I said I had 3 3/4 ounces; I find since it was 31/4 ounces—Sumner said they had only 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with them—I asked Sumner to leave me his watch—Beckett replied sharply "No, it would look funny; I could not do that"—I asked Beckett to leave me his ring which he had on his finder—he said "All right," and took it off his finger—Sumner said "I will leave it for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said "That is no use, make it 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—Beckett said "All right"—Sumner said "To-morrow night we will come and bring you the money for the ring; try and have some more stuff for us"—Sumner said "Can you get some covered wire for us about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound?" and he said "Try and get some silver wire also"—Sumner gave me the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the ring; I handed them the platinum—I came out into the corridor; Constable Hawkes was there; he took the prisoners into custody—this it the ring and the platinum.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Sumner.</hi> They use platinum in the shop in which I work—I did not say the detective had to go out and buy platinum before I could give it to you—I told you the platinum did not belong to me; I told you it was got from a party working in the Post Office service—you said to me the way Wilcox got stuff for you was that the stuff was dealt out; that so much was put into so many instruments, but that instead of putting the stuff in as it ought to have been, they cut it fine—you were not buying the platinum at the rate of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—I don't know about the value of it—I mentioned no price per ounce for it.</p>

I am a police constable attached to the General Post Office—on 19th September, from what was stated to me, I handed the parcel of platinum to Pusey—about 6 o'clock p.m. I was on the lookout and saw the two prisoners go into the post-office and into room 52A—I waited a few minutes, then I saw them coming out of the room and stopped them—I said "What are you doing here?" addressing both of them—Pusey said "They have bought some platinum from me"—I said to the prisoners "Is that true?"—Sumner said "Yes," and he produced this platinum from his trousers pocket—I took them to room 80, where Pusey repeated his statement and said "I have sold them this platinum for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a gold ring; the money I got from Sumner, and the ring from Beckett"—I said to the prisoners "You hear what this man says. What have you to say?"—Sumner answered "I did not know that it was stolen"—Beckett made no reply—I searched the prisoners, and on Sumner found a bottle of acid—I said "What is this?"—he said "It is some acid I brought to test the stuff with, I did not want to be done"—on Beckett I found a pawnbroker's duplicate relating to a gold ring pawned on the same day for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I am about 9 years old, and live at Hobson's Place, Limehouse, with my parents—on the evening of 30th October I was in the street near Hobson's Place, when the prisoner said to me "Tommy, will you go and get me a pound of black pudding? I will give you a penny when you come back"—he gave me half-a-crown to pay for the pudding—I went to Mr. Buck's shop, asked for the pudding, and put the coin on the counter—the <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi> put it in the till, took it out again, and took it into another room—she came out and spoke to me—a constable was sent for, and I and the constable went out together—we looked in I public-house and went up the street, and then I saw the prisoner going along—I was alone—I went to the police station—I saw the prisoner taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Newling, a grocer, of 233, Harrow Road—on 22nd September the prisoner came in at half-past six or 20 minutes to 7 for half a pound of sugar—I saw the shopman Browning serve him—I take the cash—the prisoner put down half-a-crown on the counter—Browning asked him to pay at my desk—he came and put the coin down—I took it up and put it on one side, because I was not certain</p>

I am a shopman to Mr. Newling, a grocer, in Harrow Road—on 22nd September the last witness handed me this half-crown; as soon as she did so, I could tell by the feel it was bad—the prisoner came back to the shop—I asked him his name and address; he gave the address Fern head Road, Harrow Road—I followed, and saw him join another man about 50 yards from the shop round a corner—a little way down the street they parted, and then joined again, and then parted again—I went up to the prisoner and told him I should give him in charge—I went back to the shop with him—he said if he had done anything wrong he did not know it—I gave him in charge—I gave the coin that I had received from Miss Horn to the constable who took him.</p>

I am a constable attached to the Post-office—I showed these two postal orders to the prisoner Kedgley in August—he said that he had received them from a man at the Three Brewers, New North Road—I did not arrest him then, but there were further complaints from Messrs. Webster—Kedgley was arrested on 19th September, and I arrested Watts on 20th September at 6 a.m., at Killen, in Perthshire—I had followed him there—I read the warrant to him—he said "I did not steal the orders"—I searched Angus, who was with him, and found five postal orders payable to Messrs.

I am a single woman, and live at 20, Acacia Road, St. John's Wood—I have known the prisoner since May last; hare seen him about St. John's Wood, but I have only spoken to him on one evening when I was out; he said "Good evening," and asked me if I lived in St. John's Wood, and what number I lived at, and I told him; he then said he used to know a girl who lived at 20, Acacia Road—on 6th September, about 3 in the afternoon, the prisoner rang the area bell, and told me my mistress's sister was in High street in her car<lb/>riage ordering some things at the greengrocer's, and wanted to see me, and I was to bring a bag, as they had not one at the shop—I gave the prisoner the bag, and he said I was to take one—I told him I had not another one large enough—he then said I had better put on my hat and jacket and go quickly—I put my hat and jacket on—he then said "You had better bring the bag yourself"—I pointed to a small one hanging on the wall, and told him that was the only one I had, and that would be no use if a lot of things were being ordered—he looked round and said, "Are you sure you have not got one inside?"—I said "No, that is the only one I have," and was pointing to the bag on the wall when he put his left arm round me and with his right hand he cut my throat—when I felt the blood on my hands I took hold of his oat sleeve and pulled it down and the razor then fell from his hand—I then fell on the floor over the razor, and he knelt down on one knee and still had his left arm round me, and put his right hand over my mouth to stop my screaming—I twisted myself away from him and kept screaming, and he then got up off his knee and locked the area door from the inside, took the key out and ran upstairs to the area door, and I saw no more of him—I then got up and picked the razor up and got on the kitchen table, opened the window and threw the razor out—I called for assistance, and some one burst the door open and took me to the hospital—the prisoner was smiling all the time—he had thin whiskers on the side of his face, but I am not sure whether he had any on his chin.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector B</hi>). On 12th September at 8.15 I went with two constables to 39, George Street, Pimlico—I knocked at the front kitchen door; the prisoner opened it—I said "You will be taken into custody on a charge of four cases of uttering counterfeit coin"—he made no reply—that room was the only one he occupied—there was a bed in it—he was undressed—I saw a box standing against the wall; I asked him fur the key—he gave me a bunch of keys—I could not unlock it—he unlocked it with the same key, and in it I found this battery not wrapped up; also this pocket book in which was a copper die, the obverse side of a florin—I put the battery on the table, and said "Halloa! what is this?"—he said, "Oh, it is a photographic apparatus; it was left here by a photographer"—on the table I found this solution of silver in a basin with a spoon inside the basin—there was a bag of plaster-of-Paris also in the box—one of the documents in the pocket-book shows it belongs to the prisoner—he was taken to the station and charged with uttering and having these implements in his possession—on the same evening at 8 o'clock I returned with Sergeant Kenna to 39, George Street—the house is let out in lodgings, there is nearly a family in each room—I made further search, and in a disused cupboard under the stairs I found two moulds—the door of the cupboard was about three feet from the door of Kindon's room which is on the ground floor—the stairs lead from the front door to his room—all the lodgers have access to the cupboard—it was unlocked, and the door open; there were no signs of its having been used lately—the two moulds in the cupboard were moulds of shillings lying wrapped in the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Dispatch</hi> of September 11th, in the small recess at the bottom of the cupboard—I had to go on my hands and knees to look</p>

                  </hi>. I have examined all the articles produced—these two coins are counterfeit and from the same mould—these are two double moulds for making shillings—they have not been used—this copper-plate is an electrotype of the obverse side of a mould for casting florins—there is no corresponding copper-plate for the reverse side—this plaster-of-Paris mould was made at my instance to show the idea—there is every sign of the copper electrotype having been used; there is a deposit of base metal on it; my opinion is that it has been embedded in plaster to give it solidity as a copper-plate would be hardly solid enough to be used alone—this electrotype is a deviation from the usual mode of <hi rend="italic">smashing</hi>—it is the first case that has come under my eyes and I may say my father never heard of a case of an electrotype—the effect of using a metal mould would be to give a sharper impression and more the appearance of a struck coin—about 100 or 200 coins could be turned out of a metal mould like this, whereas with a plaster mould I have not seen more than 15 or 20 made, and that depends on the ability of the maker—here are a large Daniel's battery complete; 5 clamps for holding moulds while metal is being poured in; copper wire, silver sand (all being used in <hi rend="italic">smashing</hi>), a bottle of gilding solution for the battery (that would be used for making sovereigns), files, ladles with metal (a mixture of pewter and bismuth) used for making coins; four <hi rend="italic">gets</hi>, the pieces of metal cut off when the coin is taken out of the mould; plaster-of-Paris in powder, used for making the moulds; these strips of tin, probably used to fence round the plaster-of-Paris mould; paper cut in strips, in readiness probably to wrap the coins up in, it is about the width; all these articles can be used in in the manufacture of counterfeit coin—I don't know about the curling-tongs.</p>

And 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had a long contention, and I got very angry with him and ordered him out of the place, and as he was going away I said, "You will have no more money from me," and he said, "I will have hundreds from you, perhaps thousands"—the same day a note was brought to me in the prisoner's handwriting, and I tore it up and threw the pieces under the grate—I afterwards searched for it; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a piece of the letter—the same day a man, purporting to come from the prisoner, came and asked me for money, but I did not give him any—on 21st September I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the ordinary course of post; this is the envelope. (<hi rend="italic">This bare the London postmark of 21st September, and was addressed to R. Strong, Esq., Finchley, and contained this Utter in pencil.

I trade as Markovitz and Co., cigarette makers, 11, Air Street, Regent Street—the prisoner has been for some time my manager; his salary was 312<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and a house rent free—in 1885 in conse<lb/>quence of some irregularities I gave him orders to pay cheques and p.o.o. which came by post into the bank every day; cash taken over the counter was to be kept in the safe, entered day by day, and paid in on the 1st of every month—I gave him a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for petty cash, and when he exceeded that he came to me for a fresh cheque—I went there mostly every Saturday, and examined the cash book, the sales book, and the day book, but not the banker's pass book: I asked him many times for the pass book, and he always said that it was at the bank—I took it for granted that the money had been paid in—on August 5th I went there to draw a cheque for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there ought to have been 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to my credit at the bank—I said to the prisoner "Give me the cheque book;" he Raid "Do you want to draw any money?"—I said "Yes;" he said "We have got no money in the bank;" I was staggered, and said "What do you mean?"—he said "Well, we have got no money there; "I said "What do you mean?"—he said "Well, I have not paid the money in, I am very sorry"—I immediately went to my solicitor, and we sent for the pass book, which showed a balance to my credit on 5th August of only 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the cash book showed 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave the prisoner in custody the same afternoon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I carry on several businesses—I used to own the Pavilion Music Hall, and received compensation when it was taken for the Metropolitan Board of Works; I also carry on Long's Hotel, Bond Street; and I am a dealer in curiosities in the name of Edwards and Roberts, Wardour Street—the name of Markovitz has become a trade name for cigarettes—the prisoner was not to put himself forward as the owner of the business; he had power to endorse cheques as Markovitz and Co., but not to draw cheques—the account was in the name of Marko<lb/>vitz and Co.—he ordered small parcels of goods, and practically carried on the business—the only lot of goods he bought without my knowledge was this year—early in this year I entered into this agreement with him (<hi rend="italic">Agreement to sell the business, stock, and fixtures to the prisoner for 1,000 l., 250 l. to be deposited on signing the agreement, and the residue on 24th June</hi>)—he paid the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to my solicitor, which was to be forfeited if the agree<lb/>ment was not completed on 24th June, but on 28th June I agreed to allow him one month further for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. further payment, which he paid, and on 25th July some gentleman connected with him appealed to me for a further extension of time, to which I asked him to state the terms—I knew before that that he had entered into negotiations to bring out the business as a limited company, and I understood that he was negotiating with Brett and Cramer; I do not know what they are—if it had been properly brought out, I have no doubt that I should have taken shares, but I did not say that I would put 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into it—Mr. Scrivener, an accountant, drew up the annual balance sheet and audited the books up to 1st January, 1887—we</p>

               <p>had a traveller, but the prisoner travelled now and then—if he thought he could in the interests of the business make a round he could go, but he had to tell me—his expenses would be taken out of the petty cash—he had a right to collect money—I left the conduct of the business to him, but I drew the cheques—if I said at the police-court "I remember telling the prisoner that I would extend the time for the purchase up to January next" that was true—he had actually, by my permission, up to January, 1888 to complete the agreement—I never knew him use a cheque which he had collected, to pay a debt due to my business, but I never looked into the books to see—he was justified in collecting all the money due from January 1st, 1887, and he had to pay all debts—if he had completed his purchase on July 25th, all the money he collected this year would have been his own, but he was 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficient last year—he was acting as my servant till the money was paid, and had to pay all money into my bank—I was not going to draw this 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a test; I bad no suspicion—I have not paid him back his 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I lay claim to that because he has for<lb/>feited his bargain; practically he has got nothing for his 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor do I mean him to have anything for it—I did not agree to extend the time of purchase up to January 1st, 1888.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The cash in the till was entered the same night—the shutters were up and the shop shut, and everybody gone away but the prisoner and me—the prisoner was sometimes not there when the count<lb/>ing took place—I then put the money in the till and locked it up, leaving the key in—the prisoner would take out the day's takings in the evening or the morning and put them into another cash box which was kept in the safe—he had access to the cash book—the amount was posted into another cash book—they were all kept in the iron safe, and were in his possession as well as the cash, and the books set out the actual takings day by day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chartered accountant of 9, Fleet Street—Mr. Loibl employed me to audit the accounts of the business to a certain extent—I made an audit up to the close of last year—I examined the banker's books; they showed a balance in the bank at the end of the year of 713<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the bank's pass book was not before me to see whether that amount was there, but I have seen it since and found that at that time their account was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. overdrawn—the cash sales were 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. during the month in postal orders and small cheques, and 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. should have been paid in during the month which was not—in December 1886 the books showed takings 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and small payments and post office orders 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., leaving a balance of 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which ought to have been paid in and was not—no sum was paid in in November or December on account of cash sales—I have examined the books from January to the prisoner's arrest in August, and find on 17th January cash sales 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of which 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is in small cheques and post office orders, and the balance which should have been paid in in February was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but it was not, nor any portion of it—the cash balance for July was 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., of which 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was for small postal orders and so on, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash, that was not paid in or any portion of it—no cash at all was paid in by the prisoner during the whole of that year, and there ought to have been a balance on 5th August of about 1,650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as shown by the cash book, but the balance that day as shown by the pass book was only 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the cheque of Mowden's did not pass through the prosecutor's bank but through the Imperial Bank; it is dated 11th January, and entered in the books on 9th February.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I assume the whole of the books to be correct, and that all the cash or cheques received ought to have been paid into the bank—there are a number of receipts showing that the prisoner paid a considerable sum, by cash or cheques, outgoings in the business which are not entered, and in respect of which, however irregular, the defendant is entitled to take credit, and I have given him the benefit of it—I do not find that cheques had been paid away, I assume it is cash—there are only one or two cheques which have not gone through the bank; I have traced them; they are customers' cheques—as a rule all customers' cheques have gone through the bank—receipts for sums paid by the prisoner for 290<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were handed to me, which I cannot trace through the books; they were on bill heads and were principally for advertisements—I</p>

I live at 14, Parkfield Street, Islington—on Sunday morning, 2nd October, at a quarter to I, I was walking from the corner of Tottenham Court Road along the Hampstead Road—I met five men, one of whom is the prisoner I am quite sure—four of them caught hold of me, one on each arm and leg, and the prisoner rifled my pockets, in which I had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and a few coppers—as soon as they got it they ran away—I got hold of the prisoner as soon as they let go of me, and we rolled on the ground together—he called his friends to come and rescue him—they came back and kicked me while I was on the ground struggling with the prisoner—I had a slight graze on the forehead—I had opportunity of seeing his face well while I was struggling with him—as soon as I got away I followed the prisoner through a good many turnings calling "Stop thief," till he ran down a mews—he was the only</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have given the conversation as nearly as possible in my words and his—I have no previous knowledge of Frost, and Sampson has none; neither of us belong to the neighbourhood—I know Frost has lived in that neighbourhood for 13 years—it is a sailors' boarding-house—I examined the place—it is a coffee-house, and is registered as a common lodging-house; sailors lodge there—he does not sell spirits or liquor—going over the place I recognised such articles as are in this list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—very few were marked as to the names of sailors who had left them—I recollect one handkerchief, with a watch tied in one corner and a couple of rings in the other, which looked as though it might belong to a sailor; I did not take them away—we did not tell Frost at the time that we were informed he had received the pro<lb/>ceeds of several housebreakings; he did not tell us that on the previous Sun<lb/>day he had been induced to lend money on this very property by a man who wanted money, the pawnbrokers' shops not being open—he did not say with reference to the other property that the owners were coming to take it away—the owner of the pewter pots has been to me; there is no charge about them—one pair of opera glasses looks as if it had been used—I should value the set of brooch and earrings at at least 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was at 4 o'clock on Monday afternoon I went—it was one of his daughters Frost called—they did not explain that he had left it as part of the property on the shelf, and that they, hearing we were detectives, had foolishly put it away and concealed it—Sampson afterwards said that, on going to the tub he said to Frost "That is where I found the case containing the brooch and earrings," and that Frost said "I thought she had put it on the shelf," pointing to the shelf by the side of the water-tank in</p>

The man came each time on Sunday morning; he was coming to fetch this lot; I don't know who he is, but I think I should know him again if I saw him"—I told him he would be charged with feloniously receiving the property in the handkerchief, and also the other property, which was part proceeds of two cases of housebreaking—I don't remember that he said anything in reply.</p>

On Saturday night, 10th September, I was called to 2, Kemble Street, Drury Lane, by a little boy; the prisoner opened the door to me and said "Come upstairs, I have stabbed my wife"—I followed him upstairs and found his wife lying on the floor at the side of the bed with her head under the window—she was lying in a pool of blood, and had a wound in her neck—the prisoner was there and he said "She drove me to it, I am very sorry for it"—she was unconscious—I found the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the table, it might be a bootmaker's knife, or a bookbinder's—I took the woman to King's College Hospital—there were two beds in the room; I examined one and found blood dripping through the mattress on to the floor, and it appeared as if some one had lain on the bed.</p>

I am house surgeon at King's College Hospital—on the night of 10th September I was called into the surgery and found the prosecutrix lying on the table—I examined her and found a penetrating wound on the left side of the neck, about two inches below the left angle of the jaw; it was about an inch in length and a little over an inch in depth—there was a steady issuing of the blood, as one of the large veins of the neck was divided—a knife, such as the one produced, might have caused such a wound by a thrust—it was a wound decidedly dangerous to life, but she is out of danger now—she was in danger I thought for about four or five days—I think she was intoxicated when she was stabbed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was nothing in the character of the wound to show from what direction the hand was wielded, but it was probably directed a little downwards—the wound did not show that it was indicted by a direct blow; it might have been inflicted if a struggle had ensued and he had got the knife in his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. In January I was living at Rathgar, near Dablin—I now live at 14, Bromley Road, Stockwell—in January I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>, about a situation at 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be deposited—in consequence I wrote to the address, given, 13, Cross Lane, St. Mary-at-Hill, E.C.—I received a reply, and in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188710240068"/>
               <p>consequence came to London and called at the address and saw the prisoner—I had a conversation with him about the advertisement; he told me his business, that of a wholesale and colonial merchant, had been established between 11 and 12 years, that his mother had 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it, and that his two sisters had an interest of 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a piece—in consequence of what he said I instructed my solicitors to prepare this agreement—I know the prisoner's writing—this is his signature—he signed the agree<lb/>ment on 11th February. (<hi rend="italic">The memorandum of agreement was read. By it Haswell agreed to take Butler into his service as managing clerk from</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st February, at a commencing salary of</hi> 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per annum, payable monthly; the engagement to terminate at the option of either party by three month notice in writing; Butler agreeing to deposit with Haswell</hi> 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">cash, solely as security for his good conduct and behaviour, which sum, Haswell agreed to return within three months, on condition that Butler had fulfilled his duties properly.</hi>)—Mr. Ram, managing clerk to Messrs. Bannister and King, solicitors, prepared that agreement—they are the London agents of Messrs Tandy and Go., solicitors, of Dublin—after the agreement was drawn up, Mr. Ram gave this cheque to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This was a cheque on the Bank of Ireland for</hi> 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">payable to Messrs. Bannister and King, or order, signed S.N. Tandy.</hi>)—I expect Mr. Ram endorsed it—I saw the cheque handed to the prisoner; it was mine—Mr. Tandy is nay solicitor, and I having got money in the funds, Mr. Tandy advanced me this cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that security—when the cheque was given to the prisoner be told me it would remain untouched, and it was to be returned to me at the expiration of a quarter, and if I fulfilled the business satisfactorily he would very likely return it in a fortnight—I entered on the business at 13, Cross Lane about 7th March—I was not overburdened with work—I saw no signs of business—there was not much correspondence—I saw no goods at all—I know the prisoner under the name of Bruce Haswell—almost each day that I was there persons called for De Barnveldt, and a few asked for Haswell—at the end of June or a little later, a gentleman, who said he was from Holland, asked for De Goot—I told the prisoner about those persons calling—he told me Mr. De Barnveldt was a clerk he had engaged before, and that he had absconded with some clerks that he had and 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40,000 Mrs. in cash—I asked him who De Goot was; he said he was a person he was doing or going to do business with in Holland—I received about 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. salary from March to June—in the beginning of August this year I entered an action in the Mayor's Court against the prisoner for arrears of salary—I recovered judgment (the amount was 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.), and tried to get the proceeds from his house, 32, Kings wood Road, near Wandsworth, but I received notice of other prior claims and had to withdraw my execution, and I have not had a farthing—I spoke to him about the end of June for the return of the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque; he told me it was intact in his solicitor's hands—he did not tell me who his solicitor was, but I understood his name was Cook—I have asked him for the cheque scores of times; he told me it was always there to be had and I could have it, but he did not tell me where it was—I have never received it—it has been cashed—I have never received a farthing of this 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—since I put in the execution I have had two sums of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each on account of the salary the prisoner owes me—I did not get it by means of the judgment summons.</p>

               <p>in answer to the advertisement—I knew nothing of him nor he of me—he asked me what kind of property I had—I have mortgages on land in Ireland—I read the agreement over and carefully considered it—I under<lb/>stood it without asking Mr. Ram—the end of the second paragraph says "the said sum of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being deposited as security"—I handed him a cheque which was intended to represent cash—I should have been satisfied if I had received back 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash instead of the cheque—about the middle of August, after I contemplated these proceedings, I left Messrs. Bannister and employed Mr. Ruddell as my solicitor—all Mr. Ruddell did was with my knowledge and approval—the summons was issued at the police-court about the end of August—during the adjournment of the summons I received two sums of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I was present with Mr. Ram when the prisoner called on 6th July, and said "I will call at your office and pay the money"—I don't remember if I said at that time, "It is not the money I want, but the cheque"—he told me I should receive back my cheque, he had it uncashed—I cannot say if that was the only time on which he said, "I will pay the money."</p>

                  </hi>. I am second clerk at Great Marlborough Street Police-court—on 29th June last I was present when Miss Cass was charged before the presiding Magistrate, Mr. Newton, and I took down in a book called the "Notes of Evidence" the evidence given on oath by Police-constable Endacott; I have no doubt he was sworn, but I cannot say I actually saw it because some one was asking me a question at the time—this note is abbreviated. <hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Bowen Endacott, 42 DR.—At 9.30 last night in Regent Street prisoner (<hi rend="italic">meaning Miss Cass</hi>) and another got hold of a gent who got away; prisoner caught hold of two more gents; one said in her hearing It's very hard I should be stopped; it's the third time I have been stopped in this street.' Have seen her there three times in the last six weeks; from her manner I believe her to be a prostitute; the other woman was with her."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been over four years at Marlborough Street—I was not actually aware that Endacott had been put on special patrol duty, but I concluded he was—in that part of London there are more charges with regard to annoyances in the street from women, than any other part of London—I have known as many as 20 or 30 in a day, in a great many Endacott has given evidence, and as far as I know his truthfulness was never challenged up to this time—the Guildhall illuminations were a week before this—it is usual for a Magistrate to dis<lb/>charge a woman upon being first charged, unless it is a specially bad case—this was quite an ordinary case—I understood the statement "Have seen her there three times in the last six weeks" to include the night</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188710240075"/>
               <p>before—it is usual for the accused person to be asked "Do you wish to ask any question," and I have no doubt it was asked on this occasion—from first to last no question was put by Miss Cass upon the evidence of Endacott—there was never any statement made by Eadacott that there was any annoyance or soliciting except in Regent Street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have given the whole of the statement which Endacott made, and in the words in which he made it—Endacott would sometimes give evidence in two or three cases of this kind of a morning, and some<lb/>times there would not be any—I have known him ever since I have been at the Court, bringing such charges as these, that is four years—I pre<lb/>sumed he was on special duty, from the frequency of these charges being brought by him; sometimes we might not have such a charge for days, and then sometimes he would have two or three in a morning—it is usual when a defendant has been discharged to fill up the charge sheet in this way; the letters "dis" put on here are in the writing of the assistant-gaoler; I also put the word "dis" in the margin of my note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By a Juror.</hi> When there were 20 or 30 of these prostitutes brought in in a day they would not all be brought in by special constables; some would be brought in by ordinary constables.</p>

                  </hi>. My name is now Elizabeth Langley—I have been married since the commencement of these proceedings—my maiden name was Cass—I am 24 years of age—until the 27th of April last I had spent my life mostly at Stockton-on-Tees—my occupation was that of a dress<lb/>maker, and I resided with my father and mother—before April 27th I had never been to London—on that day I came to London, and went to stay with Mrs. Tompkins, at Manor Park, Forest Gate—she was a friend of mine, and the wife of a person in whose employment I had been at Stockton—while I was at Mrs. Tompkins's I did work for her, and on two or three occasions I visited her mother-in-law at Romford—I was em<lb/>ployed to do work for her—when I went there some one accompanied me to the station, and met me coming back, and on each occasion I went straight there and back—while residing with Mrs. Tompkins I also went twice to Mrs. Robertson's at Trinity Square, Borough, and stayed there on two occasions, once three days, and once five or six days—I was employed there dressmaking for Mrs. Robertson—I used to work till about 9 o'clock in the evening—while I was staying with Mrs. Tompkins I came to town with her on two occasions to look for a situation—on one occasion I went to the City with her, to the wholesale houses, and on one occasion to the West End—I could not tell you at all the date of that, but we were in Regent Street at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I had never been in Regent Street before 28th June, except on that occasion—we walked in Regent Street, but I don't remember whether we walked up Oxford Street or away from Oxford Street—I don't remember what part of Regent Street we were in on that occasion—about the end of May I saw an advertisement of Madame Bowman's; it was on Whit Tuesday, May 31st—that was while I was staying at Mrs. Robertson's—I then went to Southampton Bow by Mrs. Robertson's leave to answer that advertisement, and I arranged to go to Madame Bowman's, and on June 7th I went to Madame Bowman's and coin<lb/>menced</p>

               <p>my duties as forewoman there—I lived in the house and occupied the same room and the same bed as Jane Scott—our time for leaving off work in the evening was 8 o'clock, and we all had supper together between 8.30 and 9 o'clock—Mr. Bowman lived in the house, and Mr. and Mrs. Banks, relatives of theirs, were staying there—on two occassions, between the 7th and 28th of June, I spent from Saturday till Monday with Mrs. Tompkins at Forest Gate, leaving off work at 4 o'clock on the Satur<lb/>day afternoon, and returning to work at 9 o'clock on the Monday morning, having left Mrs. Tompkins at a quarter to 8—once or twice I went, to the post, which is at the bottom of the street, but came back immediately—on the Sunday before the Jubilee I went to the City with Jane Scott after church in the evening, but we came back to supper—with those exceptions I had not been out at all during the time I was with Madame Bowman—on the evening of 28th June I left off work as usual about 8 o'clock, and I asked Madame Bowman's leave to go out, and, getting it, I went out between 8.30 and a quarter to 9—I was then dressed as I am now, and I was alone—on leaving the house I turned to the left, and went through Bloomsbury Square and past the British Museum into Tottenham Court Road and then I turned to the right and went as far as Baker's, which is a large shop, and then I turned round and came down Tottenham Court Road again—I knew at that time that it was Tottenham Court Road—when I got to the bottom of Tottenham Court Road, I noticed a jeweller's shop which was built out from the other shops—I then turned to the right and knew I was in Oxford Street—I then went along as far as Peter Robinson's, keeping the same side all the way—at Regent Circus I turned to the right and went as far as the church (All Souls', Langham Place)—I did not know the name of the church, but there were steps all round it—I then turned and came back to Regent Circus, and then turned to the left along the same side of Oxford Street I had been before—during all that time I had been alone—I had spoken to no one, and no one had spoken to me—after I turned to the left in Oxford Street there was a little crowd at the corner, and when I had got through it, Endacott came up, took hold of my arm, and said, "I want you"—I said "What for?"—he replied "I have been watching you for some time"—I said "You have made a mistake"—he said "Oh no, I have not," and said "Who is that girl you were with?"—I said "I was not with any girl" he said "Oh yes you were, but she has slipped behind some<lb/>where"—I replied "You have made a mistake, I was not with any girl" he said "Yes you were; don't tell lies; I wish I could have put my hand on her, as she is worse than you"—I said "You have made a mistake"—he replied "Oh no I haven't"—I then, asked where he was taking me to—he said to Tottenham Court Road Police-station—I asked him to go to Madame Bowman's with me, and he said he could not—by that time we had got out of Oxford Street and turned into Great Portland Street—it was before Madame Bowman's name was mentioned that something was said about three weeks—he said "I have known you some time"—I replied "You could not have done; I have only been in London six weeks"—I then asked him not to take hold of ray arm—he replied that he must or else I should tell them at the police-station that he let me walk quietly—he then asked whether Madame Bowman would bail me out—I said "Bail me out?" and he did not answer—I knew what bail meant, but I did not know that I should need it—no gentleman ever said in my hearing that he had been stopped several times—at no</p>

               <p>time during that evening had I accosted or spoken to any gentleman—when I arrived at the police-station Endacott spoke to another police<lb/>man, whose name I did not know, but I did not hear what he said—before the charge was taken Endacott said to me "You don't know me, do you?"—I said "No"—he said "Oh, but I know you, and have done so for some time"—at that time he was near me and looking at me, and the place was light—Endacott said he had known me for some time, about six weeks—I said he could not have done, as I had only lived in London three weeks—he said "You said six weeks just now"—I replied "I have been in London three weeks, but I have been staying at Manor Park"—I next remember feeling giddy and I fell, and someone brought me some water, and a chair was also brought fur me—another policeman said to me" Don't put yourself about, it will be all right"—I did not say any more to Endacott then, or he to me, before Sergeant Coomber came in—when Sergeant Coomber came in Endacott spoke to him, but I did not hear what was said—Sergeant Coomber took down what he said—Sergeant Coomber then asked me my name, and I said "Elizabeth Cass"—he then asked whether I could read and write, and I said I could—a policeman standing by me then led me into a cell, and Sergeant Coomber followed behind, and I asked him if he would send for Madame Bowman, and he laid he would—the policeman Endacott had spoken to had asked me where I lived, and I had given him my address before Sergeant Coomber came in—I was then locked in the cell, and remained there for about an hour, and Madame Bowman then came—I did not see Endacott when I came out of the cell—Madame Bowman bailed me out, and next morning I went with her to the police-court, and Endacott was there called as a witness against me and was sworn, and then Madame Bowman made a statement and I was allowed to leave.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I arrived at King's Cross Station about 8 p.m. on Wednesday, 27th April—Mrs. Tompkins met me there, and we went straight to her residence at Manor Park—I went to Mrs. Robertson, at Trinity Square, twice in May, the first time staying three days—it was about a fortnight after I came from King's Cross that I first went from Manor Park to Mrs. Robertson; that would be about the 10th May—it was either Monday or Tuesday I went there, and I stayed until Friday—it was said that, although I might do work for Mrs. Robertson, it would also be nearer for me to look out for a situation—Mrs. Robertson keeps a lodging-house—I did her private work for her—I did not go outside the door the first three days I was there—when I went there I took an omni<lb/>bus from Liverpool Street to Southwark, and I took an omnibus back—it was nearly a fortnight before I went to Mrs. Robertson again—I went back to her on the Saturday before Whit Sunday, and I again took an omnibus from Liverpool Street, and I went back from Mrs. Robertson's in an omnibus—I then stayed until the following Saturday—the week after the 28th May I stayed at Forest Gate; I first went to Mrs. Robertson's about 10th May, and came back on the 13th, the Friday—I then went back to Mrs. Tompkins, at Manor Park, and on the following Tuesday I went to Mrs. Tompkins, at Averley Hall, and stayed with her two days, and then went back on the Friday to Mrs. Tompkins, at Manor Park, and stayed with her till Tues<lb/>day, the 24th, and then on the 24th I went to Mrs. Robertson's—I went back from Mrs. Robertson's to Manor Park on Friday, 13th May, and then on Tuesday the 17th I went from Manor Park to Rom<lb/>ford,</p>

I took an omnibus to the Bank, and then walked from there to Southampton Row, arriving there between 4 and 5 p.m.—I remained there perhaps half an hour, and then I walked back to Trinity Square—I did not go back to the Bank; I went over Westminster Bridge, and got back to Mrs. Robertson's between 8 and 9 p.m.—I only went into one shop to buy some ribbon, but that did not take me long—that was the only time, during the six days' visit to Mrs. Robertson, that I went out—I was also out one night for about 10 minutes, and that is all the time I have spent in the streets of London—the day when I walked from Trinity Square, and over Westminster Bridge, is a different occasion to when I came to town with Mrs. Tompkins and was in Regent Street about 3 o'clock—I know a young man named Arthur Settle; he is an assistant at Shool<lb/>bred's; that is where I went to buy the ribbon—I was being served by another young man, and I asked for Mr. Settle—that was after 5 in the afternoon; it was not as early as 4 o'clock—I went to Shoolbred's after I had been to Southampton Row; I am quite sure of that—Mr. Settle was called to speak to me, at my request, and I told him I was at Trinity Square for a few days—I did not say I was lodging at Mrs. Robertson's, and could get about—I told him I was at Mrs. Robertson's, and I was going about to see if I could get a situation—he told me that he could not leave business till 7.30, and I told him I would come back at that time—there was no one else in the shop near enough to hear what we said—this was as I was leaving, after I had been served with the ribbon—Settle was going to walk back with me to Trinity Square; that was the arrangement—I went back punctually at 7.30, and it was nearly 8 o'clock before he appeared—I waited in the street for him, and walked up and down Tottenham Court Road—I was not waiting in Tottenham Court Road all the time from half-past 7 till 8; I went in a street by the side of Tottenham Court Road—I did not go into any house—from the time I made the appointment till after 8 I was looking about in shops, but I did not enter any shops—I did not go out of Tottenham Court Road—I did not go into Oxford Street and look at the bonnet shops—the walk with Mrs. Tompkins in Regent Street was before I had been to Rom<lb/>ford, and before I had been to Mrs. Robertson's—it was not quite 8 when Mr. Settle came out—I then walked with him. over Westminster Bridge to Mrs. Robertson's house in Trinity Square, and we arrived there about 9—I don't remember if it was half-past 9; I don't think it had gone 9—I don't recollect the streets we went through from Tottenham Court Road to Westminster Bridge—with the exception of the evening I went out for about 10 minutes, that is the only time I went out whilst on my second visit to Mrs. Robertson—it was after Mr. Settle had seen me home that I went out for 10 minutes—I could not say how many nights I slept at Romford during the whole three visits; about seven—I did not go to Trinity Square a second time after I had been to Mrs. Tompkins at Romford—once I walked from Romford Station to Mrs. Tompkins, and once I walked back—I don't know how many minutes it takes to travel</p>

Baker's, at the corner of Euston Road, and then turned back and walked through Tottenham Court Road—most of the shops were closed—I did not see any drapers' shops open; I gave up the buying gloves after I left Tottenham Court Road—I had not given up seeing the illuminations; that was what I went up Oxford Street for—I did not notice that all the omnibuses and foot passengers were going to the City—I walked slowly down till I turned to the right—tha pavements were not crowded—I saw Jay's—I did not know that I was passing Peter Robinson's—I did not notice the police directing the omnibuses, or people scrambling for places to go to the City—I had just got round the corner in front of Peter Robinson's door, when Endacott said he wanted me; it was in Oxford Street, the door facing Oxford Street—that was the first place he spoke to me, and I was there taken into custody—there was a little crowd at the corner—I had just got through the crowd—I did not observe any policeman standing near me—I was just emerging from the crowd when Endacott stopped me, close to the crowd; about a yard—the conversation at the station about the mistake was before Coomber came in—I did not hear Coomber say to Endacott "What is this?"—I did not hear any words he said—the water was brought before he came in—I did not refuse to take the water; I took it out of the man's hand—I did not say "If I want water I can ask for it,"</p>

I am a solicitor of 102, Fenchurch Street—I am solicitor for Mr. Munster—I have known the defendant some years, and on several occasions have put printing into his hands for Mr. Munster, and he talked of turning his business into a company, and asked if I thought Mr. Munster would assist him by joining the company, and said he had got some very influential names, Colonel Makins and others—I told him I could not make any promise for Mr. Munster—this was not at election time; to the best of my memory it was about June, but he may have mentioned it before—I never authorised him to publish Mr. Minister's name as a director, or to put it on the prospectus; I had no authority—a gentleman called on me to ask if Mr. Munster was a director of the company; I told him it was absurd; I think the de<lb/>feudant called about the same time, and I taxed him with it, and he denied mentioning Mr. Minister's name in connection with the company—after that I received this letter—(<hi rend="italic">Dated 20th August, from the prisoner, stating that he had taken the witness's advice, and put in hand the voluntary winding-up of the company, and referring to the witness having taxed him with using Mr. Munster's name</hi>)—I did not authorise the prisoner to put my name in the prospectus as solicitor to the company—I should not have done so unless I had seen its contents.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant of 39, Wassey Road, Leyton<lb/>stone—I am one of the liquidators of the Essex Printing and Publishing Company, which was being voluntarily wound up; it was registered in October, 1886—since January I have been employed as registrar; it was my duty to attend the meetings, take the minutes, and keep the books—there was no banking-account and no cheques were drawn to my knowledge—I first saw a prospectus like this with the names of Mr. Munster, Mr. Dawson, and Mr. Gentry about 20th June, 1887, when I went into the shop and stood on the outside of the counter——Mr. Stockdale was engaged writing, and whether he handed me the prospectus or whether I took it up I do not know—I asked him if he had secured Mr. Munster as a director; he said "No, I am going to write to Mr. Brewer," or "I have written to Mr. Brewer to get his assent"—I said "You must be a fool to print a man's name as a director without his authority"—there were several conversations and I cautioned him—among the papers which came into my possession as liqui<lb/>dator was a similar prospectus and a letter in the defendant's writing, dated June 1887, addressed to a gentleman, asking him for his support—it had never been sent, but the envelope was sealed—I opened it; another prospectus was printed, dated March, 1887, similar to the one of June, except that it does not contain the names of Messrs. Munster and Dorton as directors, or Mr. Brewer as solicitor—the company is not solvent, nor was it solvent on 12th July; it stood 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the bad on 12th July, which some one had paid on behalf of the company, and beyond that there was an overdue bill of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unpaid—the company had no money to my know<lb/>ledge, but they had stock and plant—the prisoner had charge of the books.</p>

               <p>stables are at the back of that public-house—my father lets out stalls to different people, and the prisoner has two stalls opposite each other, at the farther end from the door—he has rented those stalls for four or five years, at half-a-crown a week, and has kept horses there—one Saturday afternoon I saw the police take one of his horses away; there was another horse left, and when I went round on Sunday afternoon I missed that—everybody who hired stalls could get into the stables; they had keys—on Sunday night, the 18th, I saw a little pony in the prisoner's stall, called "Jenny Kickey."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I go to the stable nearly every day—sometimes the stalls are empty, sometimes not—the prisoner used a cart, in his business, and used to go with it to market to fetch his fish home, and he used to drive this bay filly about regularly in his business for a month or two, quite openly and regularly—the prisoner paid my father his rent regularly every Sunday morning, and I have always found him an honest, straightforward, and fair-dealing young fellow—he bears a very good character—my father has a light-chestnut gelding, which is in the stable now—sometimes these stalls are not all full, and there was nothing to prevent the tenant of one stall putting his horse into the stall of another for convenience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My father bought the chestnut gelding four or five years ago—I last saw the prisoner driving a cart four or five months ago; he has sent his cart home now; he used to hire it—I missed the horse from the prisoner's stall on Saturday afternoon, and on Sunday afternoon I saw it in the stable—I have never seen a chestnut gelding in the prisoner's stall—I did not see the chestnut gelding there on Friday morning or on Saturday, but I saw it there on Sunday afternoon.</p>

I live at 8, Portland Place, and am a footman in the employ of Colonel William Arbuthnot—about 1 a.m. on 28th September last I was awoke by a noise at my windows, which look out into the area of 8, Portland Place—I saw the prisoner outside—he opened both the windows—he was at the window nearest the area-door when I was first awoke, and the blind had been taken down—he put his hand inside the window nearest the area-door and struck a match—I did not see his face then, but I did both before and after—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man—he went from that window and I quietly got out of bed and called the butler, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards the prisoner was brought back to the house by a policeman.</p>

I am butler to Colonel Arbutbnot, of 8, Portland Place—about 1 a.m. on 28th September Lake came and spoke to me as I was sleeping in my pantry—I at once slipped an Ulster and some slippers on, crept quietly to the area door, listened and heard some one in the area, and as I was undoing the door, which was bolted and chained, I heard something drop on the pavement like a bottle or tools—I crept out and went down the side-path and saw the prisoner coming out of the shrubs—I swung round, shut the gates, and then said "Halloa, what are you doing here?"—he said "Just for convenience"—I said "That tale won't do for, me," and shouted "Police! burglars!" and ran to the carriage-gate, and the prisoner rushed through the shrubbery towards No. 6 garden—he was wearing a hat—I heard him in the trees and heard him drop on to the stones in Portland Place and saw the porter at the Langham Hotel take hold of him—the porter knew my voice and he told something to a cabman who had just set down a tare—I heard the porter say to the prisoner "Halloa, what are you doing in those premises at this time of the morning?" but I did not hear his answer—the porter also said "Where is your hat?" and he said "What hat?"—the prisoner had no hat then—I afterwards saw a constable find a had on a tree in the garden of No. 6, just by where a small branch had been broken off—I saw the windows of Lake's room—the roller-blind had been taken off and put on the ledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of John Maple and Co., of Tottenham Court Road—small pieces which are cut off carpets in laying them down are called cuttings—these small pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) might fairly be termed cuttings, but not these others—it is frequently necessary to cut carpets which have been planned while laying them down, but with stair-carpets we send a long roll, cut off what we want, and the rest is sent back and put into stock—the carpets are made at the warehouse, and the large pieces which are cut off are selected and tied in a bundle, and weighed, with the customer's name attached to them, and sent to him a week or so after the delivery of the carpet—the smaller pieces are collected and thrown into a box, and sold periodically, at 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt.—those pieces are called rags—none of our porters have any right to dispose of anything, not even the rags; they Lave no per<lb/>quisites at all—on 7th October I went with detective Morgan to Busy's shop in Castle Street, Oxford Street; his name is on the facia, and there was a red ticket in the window, "Cuttings bought"—we went into the back parlour, and saw a pile of carpet-cuttings about 6 feet long and 4 feet high, all perfectly flat—I said "This is what I want"—Busy was there—alter turning over a few I met with seven or eight pieces of one pattern, which I laid aside—I went through the whole pile, and laid aside all these pieces, which were in clusters of seven, eight, or ten, to which Morgan called Busy's attention—we then went into the warehouse, and Morgan asked if he had others—he pointed to a quantity which was all secondhand—I pointed to several bales of carpet, and asked what they were—he said that they were new—I suggested leaving them that night and coming back to-morrow—before we left Busy said, "I buy carpet-cuttings in the regular way over the counter, and ask no ques<lb/>tions"—I went there again on the 8th, with Morgan—Busy was not there—we opened the other bales and found the same kind of pieces, and invariably from seven to ten layers together—these have been sewn together since (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—whatever we stitched together had been cut from the same piece—these have all come off one carpet, and these pieces of stair-carpet, 14 to 16 inches each, were one continuous roll—the first</p>

               <p>150 lbs. taken away was about one-seventh of the pile I described; they are our property, and are all new; some of them have our name on them—manufacturers have made for us and had some over in consequence of some defect, but they have offered them to us, and we have never refused them—we found other carpets in the same position as our own, and which, if pieced together, would be like these—here are 2 1/2 yards of carpet which has not been cut at all—stair-carpet is never cut so as to make cuttings—I found over the doorway a number of cans of linoleum solution for sticking linoleum to floors; some of them have labels, or portions of labels—they are all our property; 24 of them have had the labels taken off—no one had authority to sell them—I found two sheets of brown paper among the carpet pieces, with our name on them—Busy said "Old carpets and remnants I only buy of principals, and I have invoices for them"—the name and address of the customer is put on the tin, and, if it is not wanted, the man does not bring it back; we send for it—these men have been in our employ four years or more.</p>

We are the largest dealers in carpets in London; we furnished the Hotel Metropole and other large hotels in London and the country, but we do not sell carpet to the trade except to, America—in planning a room pieces taken out for the hearth and other odd pieces would be cuttings—we do not cell cuttings so often as twice a month unless we are very busy—we fix the price for them on January 1st—Busy did not mention lies as a person he bought of—I did not see the words "rag merchant" up—the pieces are sold to persons who make carpet slippers and carpet Dags and other articles, and I suppose that is the way Mr. lies makes his living—I have never seen Busy at our place, and did not know him by name—there was an immense quantity of old stuff on his premises—the Brussels pieces taken away next day weighed 5 cwt. 3 qrs. 23 lbs., and the remnants 2 cwt. 19 qrs. 24 lbs.—I left to Morgan the calling on dealers and upholsterers—Hampton's man and Harvey and Nicholls' man were at Busy's on the 9th—we took away 150 lbs. on the 7th and some more on the 8th—a man named Morrell makes the linoleum solution—the selling price of it is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; every one who sells linoleum uses it—many persons do not require the cuttings to be returned—this piece with our name on it came from Busy, the mark is quite indelible—it is contrary to our arrangements to sell a piece to an upholsterer.</p>

               <p>clerk wrote that letter, and it was copied in a book—the prisoner did attend on the 2nd August—as far as I can recollect I said to him "You are a nice fellow." or something of that kind, "robbing us like this"—he Said "Well, it is not much," something like that—he simply asked us to let him have time and he would pay everything; he would make restitution of everything; he would pay everything if we would let him have a little more time—we said that we could not compromise a felony; it would be all the same to us whether it was the 16th of August or 2nd August; however, we let him go out of the place—we refused to take any money from him—I only know of one other thing myself; that is a small account of Harrison's, about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I forget exactly—I did not know of any more—he said he had only taken the two items that he confesses to in his letter of 9th August, 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have not received the 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he was a very good fellow, but he went too fast in business, or something of that kind; he was very incoherent—his salary was paid regularly and his commission—we had written to him several times as to his non-remittance of moneys at the time he received them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I signed an information for a summons against the prisoner for embezzlement—the Magistrate committed him for forgery—we charged him with embezzlement and indirectly with forgery—we were represented by Messrs. Law is and Lewis at the police-court—they were there and examined me as a witness—at the time we took out the sum<lb/>mons our bank was the London and County, Shoreditch—we had banked with the Central Bank of London, but not since November, 1886—I be lieve the prisoner banked with the National Provincial Bank, Peterboro Branch, I don't know it, I think he had an account there; I think he must have done, because we had cheques from him—I know there was an arrangement between the London and County and the National Provincial—at the time I took out the summons I did not know that the prisoner had paid the 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into our account—after he said he had paid us that money† went more carefully into the matter—he did not pay the cheque in to our account, he used the proceeds for his own purposes, to cover other defal<lb/>cations—at the time he was before the Magistrate I did not know that he had paid the 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in to our credit—I made inquiries of the customer, not of the bank, why should I?—I heard about the cheque on 27th July—proceedings were taken at the police-court on 27th September first of all—the proceedings at the police-court were delayed on account of Mr. Lickfold not knowing something about the arrangement at the Court; he made a slight mistake—I do not know the date of our application for the summons; I waited till my father came home from his holiday, I did not care to take such proceedings without his knowledge—I do not know that the information was dated 12th September, it may have been—on the receipt of money or cheques the prisoner was to forward at once; cheques should be forwarded by post at once, and money when he could get paper to send through to us—he was either to pay loose cash into a bank, or get notes or a draft for it—he has once or twice sent us his own cheque for money, but we protested in a number of cases against his doing so—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at a number of cheques handed in</hi> by <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>) all these cheques are endorsed by our firm—we protested several times against his sending us his cheques—I think all these cheques are drawn by the prisoner on his own account in favour of our firm—the date of the first is 13th July, 1886, and the last is 24th December, 1886—there are fifteen altogether—it is possible</p>

               <p>that eight more cheques were drawn by him in favour of our firm—it might not have been noticed at first, and perhaps we did not suspect what sort of a man he was—we are tobacco manufacturer, we do not deal in fancy goods—the prisoner was not travelling for another firm until 27th June this year; we permitted him to do so—that was not a firm in the tobacco trade, I believe it had no connection with tobacco—I do not properly know the name of the firm—I believe it was Wade of Leeds—from 27th June there was a new agreement with the prisoner—in one or two letters he asked for his commission—I do not produce any book showing his commission account settled up, we could do it—there is not between 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing him for commission; I think about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not more—I do not produce any letters written by him to us stating the amount of his commission; he always had his commission before it was due—I don't know whether we have paid any commission account to him since April, I should say so—it seems that as late as July 8th he had been sending up his own cheques on account of money received for us; he would not do what we wanted—I allege that on the 1st or 2nd of August he con<lb/>fessed that he was robbing us—I was examined before the Magistrate on 20th September—we showed that letter—I answered the questions which the solicitor asked me—I daresay I have been in business twenty years—I understood the prisoner to plead guilty before the Magistrate—he raid that the 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid in to our account—I don't know why I did not tell the Magistrate that he had confessed that he had robbed us—I thought it was sufficient, you cannot think of every thing at once; there was no use in our suppressing it—I did not know that I had a right to mention it; I did not know that I ought to do it—I did not know where the prisoner was at the time I applied for the summons, he was not in communication with our firm—under the new arrangement he was to have no travelling expenses after 27th June—he said he was getting 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week from the house in Leeds; consequently he had his travel<lb/>ling expenses, not from us—he was travelling mostly for that house, picking up an order for us now and then—he bad very good reasons for not wishing to leave us; he was with us since March, 1886—during that time he had not greatly increased our business, he had not been a good traveller, I mean that his work for us had not been remunerative—he certainly had not increased our business to the extent of 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had increased it a little, because we had no traveller on that ground before; he had not broken up new ground, I broke it myself—he got very few customers for us, I only know of one decent one, that was not Mr. Postal, I got him myself; it is not the case that he was not to pay over every day what he received, but to wait till he had sufficient—paper was to be sent at once; as to money, he was to wait till he could conveniently send it by paper.</p>

                  </hi> I am a housemaid in the employment of Mr. McKinnon, of Homewood, Fort is Green, Finchley—on the evening of 6th September I went to bed at 10 o'clock, leaving everything in the house safe, the doors locked, and the front parlour window shut and hasped; the glass was not broken—in the drawing-room were two clocks, a cruet-stand, and a wooden case—at about 8 o'clock next morning I went down, and noticed the front door tied up by a rope from the knob in the centre of the door to the pillar of the porch outside—that was not there the night before—on going into the drawing—room I found the window broken near the fastening, and open at the top part to allow a hand to get in and undo the catch—the bottom part was open—I missed these two clocks (which were in the drawing-room the night before), this biscuit-box, cruet-stand, and wooden stationery cabinet; they are my master's property, and were safe the night before—this top belongs to a pepper-box in the cruet-stand, and in my master's.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Y</hi>). On 5th October I received instructions and went to Ferntower Road—after going to No. 53 I went into No. 55—I found there that screws had been taken out of the lock of the area-door, and upstairs I found the lock of the wardrobe smashed and a large quantity of property in the front hall, all tied up in tablecloths, sheets, and blankets—I left the house that night at 11 and went back next morning with Constables Leightowler and Hatchett about a quarter—past five—Leightowler stopped upstairs in the drawing—room and Hatchett and I went into the breakfast—parlour and got behind the door and waited there—about ten minutes past 7 I heard someone pushing violently at the area-door three times—the third time the door gave way and I heard someone come in and close the door again and bolt it at the top and walk upstairs—I followed quietly and Hatchett followed me—when I got to the top of the stairs I saw Edward Vine with his hand on a bundle which stood on the top of another bundle in the front hall—he turned and caught hold of my throat, we struggled for a moment, and then Hatchett and Leigh<lb/>towler came to my assistance and we overpowered him—we stayed for about 10 minutes to see if anyone else came, and then Leightowler and I took Edward Vine to the station—on the way, outside the Clarendon public-house in Mildmay Road, between 200 and 300 yards away from the house, I saw a horse and empty van in charge of Daughters, who was sitting on the seat—I looked in the public-house but could see no man there—there was mud over the name of Stevens which was on the van, and the cover of the van was turned inside out; it had a different name on it because the place has recently changed hands—I said to Daughters "What are you doing here?"—I believe she said "Mind your own business;" I was in plain clothes—I took the name of the van—I conveyed Edward Vine to the station, leaving the woman sitting in the van—there was a very large quantity of articles in the hall.</p>

I said 'Ted, be careful, you will get into trouble.' We then wont out and had a drink, and Harry went away. This morning about 6 a.m. Ted woke me up (he had gone outside) and said Harry has given me the slip, you must come with me and do the job. We went in the van and he left me outside a public—house and told me to wait till he came back. The next I saw of him he was in the custody of two policemen passing by; one of them asked me what I was doing there, and I said 'Mind your own business.' They then took him away and I took the van back."—I then placed her in the dock with Edward Vine and read that statement over to him; he replied "It is true"—on the same day I went to 18, Huntingdon Street, Hoxton, and in a box in a back room occupied by Edward Vine and Daughters, with female apparel I found this silk neck—handkerchief, lady's satchel, silver bracelet and a number of other articles were also found by Detective Sergeant Brook well—I also found a certificate of the marriage of Robert Daughters to Emma Teesdale; I showed that to Daughters and she said "That is mine, it is the certificate of my late husband"—she is not the wife of Edward Vine, she is a widow—I showed her the handkerchief and the property we had found; she said "I know nothing at all about them"—I then showed them to Edward Vine and Daughters together—Vine said "They belong to my old woman." pointing to Daughters—"they were bought off the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. she received on her husband's death from the insurance"—they have all since been identified by the Helds as a portion of the stolen property—from the 7th to the 11th continuous observation was kept on Mrs. Medley, the mother of the Vines, in consequence of Daughter's statement, and on the night of the 11th I arrested her at Dalston Station on the eve of sailing for America—from what she said Henry Vine was subsequently arrested at Southgate—on the 9th I received from Mr. Held this chopper and knife—I afterwards examined the premises and found an entry had been effected by forcing back the catch of the back drawing-room window—the marks on the woodwork and felt would be such as would be caused by a knife of this description—the bottom screw of the front area door had been withdrawn and on the mat underneath I saw this knife picked up by Knott—on the 13th I received from Mrs. Held this handkerchief, which on the 14th I showed to Harry Vine—he said "That is mine"—he told me where he Rot it from—Harry Vine was apprehended in consequence of a telegram I dispatched to the local police at Southgate—I went over and took him from their custody on the 12th—I told him what he was charged with; he made this statement which I took down and signed: "On the Wed<lb/>nesday evening Ted came round to our lodgings in Kingsland Road and asked me to come out; I went—he said 'I have got into a place and I am going to hire a van to take away the stuff. I fell through a glass-house first, but afterwards got in all right.' We went to Fillon Street to</p>

I hereby acknowledge having received the below mentioned sums, and have pur<lb/>posely neglected to apply the same to my employer's benefit" (<hi rend="italic">Then followed a list of names with the amounts, making a total of</hi> 211<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and then it stated:</hi> "These embezzlements have been going on over a period of three years")—at that time he said nothing as to how he had devoted some of the money, but a day or two afterwards in speaking of this matter he said he had spent some of the money for stationery accounts, and I told him he had no business to do such a thing—the two matters were entirely distinct, and his business was to come to me if he wanted any stationery—in November, 1884, I opened a stationery shop at Canning Town, and the prisoner was put there as my servant to manage it for me, but he was to still remain in the firm's employment—it was my own venture entirely apart from my father; he disapproved of it—during 1885 and 1886 the prisoner was paid his 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a—week just the same—when the stationery business was first opened an arrangement was made that he should conduct it, and also act as our book-keeper, and we took the books round to the shop for him to keep—at that time his wages were, I believe, 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the stationery business, and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as our book-keeper—later on Messrs. Worland's business kept him out of the stationery business, and a lad was then got to keep the shop, and he was paid then 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the stationery business, and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by Messrs. Worland and Son—he was to apply to me for all the expenses of that business—I fitted the shop up and stocked it, and paid the accounts—if he required, money to carry on the business he would apply to me for it, and he did apply to me, and if there were any profits they were to be brought to me—in consequence of what he said to me with regard to this business I went through the account book to which he has access and in which there is his writing, and I find that I paid, in 1885 and 1886, upon this stationery business, 221<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in excess of the sum I received—it has been conducted at a loss to myself.</p>

On the night of 22nd September I was on duty in a boat at the Garden Stairs, Greenwich, with Hayes—I went with him to Fubb's Yacht to arrest Carter—I saw him inside the public-house, and he was taken into custody—I also saw the prisoner in the public-house playing a whistle; I had not known him before—as we were removing Carter from the public-house the prisoner pulled him by the legs and arms and tried to rescue him—by those means Carter got away—I myself had hold of Carter at the same time as the prisoner had—I have no doubt that the prisoner is the man who tried to rescue Carter—a mob of people was round—I saw Haddon and Austin come up—as we were taking Carter away the prisoner threw a stone which struck Haddon on the cheek—Haddon fell to the ground; I saw no more of him—I did not see the stone come, but I saw the prisoner's arm up, and not a minute afterwards the constable fell.</p>

I am a timber dealer, of 22, Briscoe Road, Merton—on Thursday night, September 29th, I went to the Castle public-house, Tooting Broadway, at 10 o'clock—I left between 11.30 and 12, having had some drink there—I had had a little drink before—I saw the two prisoners there and several others; I left them there—when I had got half a mile from the Castle, Cowley caught hold of my hand and Dowsett of</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I only went into one public-house that evening at Kensington, and I only had two half-pints at the Castle—I gave some men who were out of work 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for beer, and I drank some of it—roughly speaking I imbibed nearly a quart—if anybody says I was hopelessly drunk that is quite untrue—I had no spirits—I do not know that Cowley had been a neighbour of mine for some years—I know his brother in the village—I have had no quarrel with them—I paid for six pots of ale in the public-house—they threw me over two barred fences from 4 to 6 feet high—they took me by my shoulders and legs and chucked me over.</p>

I am senior clerk in the Savings Bank department, General Post Office—I was instructed to inquire into the account of Sarah Philtrip—I produce from the Savings Bank depart<lb/>ment four notices of withdrawal and an authority to withdraw money—on Sunday night, 3rd September, I saw the prisoner Turner at Hackney Police-station and said "Where is your mother's deposit book?"—he said "I know nothing about it, it is at home in the box under my mother's bed"—I said "The book was produced at Homerton High Street Post-office on September 1st by the woman who you sent there, and who you represented to be your wife"—he said "She is my wife, but I know nothing about the book, if it is not in my mother's box it ought to be."</p>

I took the form and wrote my mother's name on it in the office. He said 'Now you must get the doctor to sign it.' Dr. Pindar is our doctor. I took the form from the post<lb/>master and signed the doctor's name." I said "You mean to say you did all that in the office?"—he said "Yes; I cannot say whether the postmaster saw me do it, but I never left the office with the form"—he also said that his mother gave him the deposit-book to show his agent to go and get a house—I found the deposit-book at Hackney, at the place he told me.</p>
