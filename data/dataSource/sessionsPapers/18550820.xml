                  </hi>. I am the agent of William M'Kenzie, of Glasgow, and carry on business as a publisher at No. 22, Paternoster-row. On 27th June the prisoner called on me; he stated that he had been with our Liver<lb/>pool agent, travelling for him in Birmingham, last year, for about, two months; that he had been very successful during that time, he had been drawing 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week as commission, and that he merely gave up our agency then to take to a permanent agency; and he relinquished that as business was rather slack at the time—he anted me if I would give him a specimen of the same work for which he canvassed in Birmingham—I did so—it was the "Imperial Journal of Arts, Sciences, Mechanics, and Engineering"—he then went away, taking it with him, and next day, returned with the same list which I had given him, with six names and addresses on it—he said that they were subscribers who he had got to the work, and that they were the signatures of the parties, with the exception of one, Gunning and Quarrell—he asked me if I would advance him a sove<lb/>reign upon them, and believing his representation that the signatures were genuine, I did so—on the 29th he called on me, and said that he had got seven more signatures—I made inquiries, and in consequence of what I learned, I gave him in custody on 14th July—I found that the names were all fictitious.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I am the son of an innkeeper, and have held an inn myself for three years, in Essex; having on 1st Aug. received instructions respecting an inn at Uxbridge, I went to witness on 2nd Aug. to engage a horse and gig; he asked if the chaise would do; I said, "Yes;" I engaged it for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; when I arrived at the White Hart, Uxbridge, I was standing in the stable; a gentleman passed a remark on the weather, and he said, "You have a thorough bred horse there?" I said, "Yes, I think he is;" he asked the price; he said, "Is it 100 guineas for him and the chaise?" I laughed and said, "I don't think the owner would mind receiving such an offer;" a short time after a dealer came in the yard, it being market day, and some of them sent the young man whom I took with me, into the house for me; I went out, and the dealer called me into the stable, and said, "Are you in<lb/>clined to sell the horse and chaise?" I said, "Certainly not, it is not mine to sell;" he said, "Excuse me;" I laughed, and said, "It is granted;" I was about to order the horse to be put in the chaise, and the dealer came a second time, followed by the inspector; he said, "Let us see the horse walk up the yard," and to gratify his curiosity, as I thought, I led it across the yard; he said, "I have just sold my two horses, if you like to take twenty guineas, here is the money;" I repeatedly refused it, and told him that we could not deal; I might have said I would take twenty-five, thinking he was still joking; the inspector then came forward, and I believe I gave him some very indirect answers to his inquiries, believing him to be one amongst them, not knowing he was an inspector, which caused him at once to detain me, and before I could be allowed to tell him all about it, the superintendent was sent off to London to inquire where the horse came from; this is the first offence I was ever charged with in my life.</p>

On the morning of 22nd June, Mrs. Stevenson came to our station and said she missed more than there was there—I had the prisoner brought up again, and two sovereigns were found in Williams's left shoe—when I had read the charge to the prisoners, Redwood said he knew nothing about it; he had been at Highgate to see his aunt—the next morning when I brought them from the cells, he said he had been to Highgate—I examined the prosecutrix's premises, No, 17, Star-street, and found an entrance had been made by wrenching open the shutter box—this screw driver fitted the marks exactly, and there were marks of white paint on the screw driver, the same as there was on the shutter box.</p>

About 20 minutes past 12 o'clock, on Monday night, 2nd July, I was at the Eagle Tavern, in front of the bar—I had an umbrella under my arm—while putting my hand into my pocket to pay for something, I observed the prisoner Jones taking my watch; he put his hand into my left waistcoat pocket, and took it—it was fastened with the Albert chain, which I have on now—I felt the chain hanging down without the watch—I said to Jones, "I think you have got my watch;" he said, "I have got nothing of the kind"—I seized him by the arm—he struggled to get away, went on the opposite side of the bar, out at the door, and ran across the road—I went after him, shouting, "Stop thief!" and he was stopped by a waterman and a policeman—it was an old fashioned silver hunting watch, double cased. I have never seen it since—I did not see Jones with it; he had his hand clenched, and there was a crowd of people in front of the bar.</p>

I was in Mr. Edroff's company, at the bar of the Eagle Tavern, in conversation with him—the moment we got in, Jones rushed up to Mr. Edroff, took his watch out of his pocket, and then rushed past me towards the prisoner Roberts—he passed something to him, and he turned round to some females who were there—I did not see him take the watch—I rushed up to Roberts, who was standing at the end of the bar, about three yards from Mr. Edroff—I thought I saw something like a silver watch pass from the shorter prisoner to the taller one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, of No. 1, Huggin-lane, Bread-street, Cheapside. On Monday, 26th March, about 11 o'clock in the morning, I had been to King's-cross on business, and was going home—I went to a public house in Southampton-street, Pentonville, and called for a pint of stout—the prisoner was playing at skittles there with another man, not in custody—he is very much altered now—he was dressed like an ostler with kerseymere trowsers, a cap, and lace-up boots—I took my porter at</p>

               <p>the bar, but went to the back of the house, for a necessary purpose, close to the skittle ground—the door was open, and the prisoner, who was in the skittle saloon, said that I was a, d——d shabby humbug, and was afraid to play for a pot of beer—I said that I was not, so long as they played fair—I went in, and played with him for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and won it—I went on playing with the prisoner for twenty or twenty-five minutes, and lost 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I attempted to go out for a necessary purpose, went to the door by which I had entered the ground, and found it locked and bolted, and the key taken away—before I could ask for an explanation, Jones came and kicked me on the lower part of my person behind, lifted me off my feet, and I fell on my back, and be and the other man rifled my pockets of ten sovereigns, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, which were quite safe when I went into the house—I had no com<lb/>munication with any other person, and spoke to no one but the landlord—I felt my money safe when I was in the skittle ground—it was loose in my waistcoat pocket; the gold in one pocket, and the silver in the other—my head was cut open—I was rendered insensible, and knew no more till I found myself at home—the name of the house, I believe, is the Robin Hood—I did not touch the ten guineas in the skittle ground; what money I lost 1 took out of my trowsers pocket—I next saw the prisoner on 3rd July, when he came in front of the Eagle Tavern bar, on the night of the occur<lb/>rence in the last case—I recognized him immediately, and meant to have secured him, but did not want to lose sight of him by going for a policeman; but I charged him that night, when Mr. Edroff charged him—Pointer was there then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live at Iver, Bucks. On Monday night, 13th Aug., about 9 o'clock, I called at the Bull beer shop, for orders—I had a cart with me—I left the cart outside, leaving my coat in the cart—I came out in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, from information, and went in pursuit of a man—about half a mile from the beer shop I came up with the prisoner, on the road to Colham-green—I went in my cart, and took Smith and Merring, two militia meu, with me—the prisoner was carrying the coat under his arm—Smith got out of the cart, stopped him, and took the coat from him, and gave it to me—I then asked the prisoner his name—he said his name was Thomas West, but when I got back I found his name was George Watts—he was known there—he said he had picked up the coat in the road—I am certain I left the coat in the cart when I went into the public house.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a draper, of No. 16, Ludgate-hill. On a Thurs<lb/>day in July, I think it was the 12th, the prisoner came and asked to see some mantles; I referred him to one of my assistants, Edward Stober, and in consequence of what he said I went down the street to see if I could gee a policeman; I returned with one, but the prisoner had then left—this mantle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was shown to me about five minutes afterwards by a policeman, five minutes after the prisoner left; it has our private mark on it—we did not miss anything, but we saw the lace of the mantle hang<lb/>ing from the prisoner's coat, and it has our private mark on it—mantles which we sell never go out with the private mark on them.</p>

I am a widow, and the mother of the last wit<lb/>ness; I live in Chicksand-street, On Thursday, 12th July, I saw the prisoner served by my daughter, with a knuckle of pork, and she gave her a shilling; I looked and found it was bad, and my daughter put it at the back of the till—on the next evening the prisoner came to me about half past 11 or a quarter before 12 o'clock; she wanted a sheep's cheek—it came to 3(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I served her, and she gave me a shilling—I bad my doubts about it, and I gave it to my daughter to get change; she took it out, broke it, and came back and said, "Here is your shilling in two pieces"—the prisoner wanted it back; my daughter would not give it her, but sent for a policeman—I said to the prisoner, "You are a pretty hand; this is two that I have had of you"—a policeman came, and my daughter gave him the shilling from the till, and the two pieces—the prisoner said she had passed a six<lb/>pence the night before, but I am positive it was a shilling—no one had been attending to the shop but me and my daughter.</p>

I gave the policeman the half crown that my daughter-in-law put on the shelf; that was soon after they took it—I came home between 12 and 1 o'clock, and she showed me what she had taken—I saw the police in the evening of the day that this was given to me—I stayed at home all the rest of the day—I had not been at home many minutes when it was shown to me—I took it off the shelf to show to a friend, that he should not be taken in.</p>

                  </hi>, I am barman at the Railway Hotel, Bedford-street.

On 29th July, I saw the prisoner about 20 minutes before 2 o'clock—there were two men sitting by the side of her—I was not aware whether they were together—the prisoner had a quartern of gin, and tendered a sixpence to the barmaid—I heard her say, "This is a bad six<lb/>pence," and she showed it to the elder barmaid—the prisoner laid down another which was equally bad—they were both on the counter together—I went to the bar, and began to question her—the two men came up, and one of them put down a sixpence out of his pocket and said, "Is this good?"—I said, "Yes"—the barmaid then asked the prisoner if she would have the gin—she said, "No"—I asked the prisoner if she had got any other money, she said, "No"—she said she got the money in Holborn—she took the two sixpences away with her when I turned them out of the house.</p>

I am landlord of the house, No. 1, Richard-street, St. Leonard's-road, Bromley; the prisoner and her husband, the deceased, lived in the upper portion of the house, they occupied two rooms; there are only four rooms in the house besides a kitchen and a small room. On the night of 24th April, I let the deceased in I think somewhere about 9 or 10 o'clock, but it is a good while ago and I almost forget the time—I think he must have had a little to drink, but I cannot say, I was not in the habit of seeing much of him—he went up stairs and then went out again, and remained out about twenty minutes—I did not let him in again, he had the key and he walked in and went up stairs—the prisoner came in about an hour after I had let him in—I was sitting in the kitchen when she came in, I only saw her come by the passage—a little after that I went to bed—about 1 o'clock the prisoner came down stairs, and asked for the key of the front door—I told her where it was, and she went out—in about three quarters of an hour she returned with a girl, unlocked the street door and went up stairs—1 heard a talking up stairs, and the girl told me that Mr. Turton was dead—I immediately told her to go for a medical man or the police—the prisoner was up stairs at this time—she was not making any noise; it appeared as if she was cutting up some wood to make a fire—I came out of my bed room, and the prisoner went out after a policeman—I met her with two policemen—I had called in one of those policemen the night before—the prisoner had come down stairs between 12 and 1 o'clock, and told me that her husband had taken arsenic, and I went and fetched the policeman and he went up stairs, I did not—after the policeman came on the night in question, he went up stairs, and then called me up—I went up and found Mr. Turton lying dead on the floor, with a pillow under his head—I had not heard any quarrelling between them, only on one night; that was nothing violent, only just a rough word—I never heard any com<lb/>plaints on the part of the man, but the woman was very noisy by herself, and disturbed every body in the neighbourhood—I heard her tell him a few days before, that he had been a whoring—on the night this occurred, I heard no noise at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at Poplar. I was called in by the police to examine the deceased—he had been dead for two or three hours—there was a broad livid mark round the neck, particularly under the left ear—the skin was abraded, as if a knot had been tied—all the external appearances were consistent with death by strangulation—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, which led me to the same conclusion—I noticed a mark under the left ear—I compared that with the buckle of a brace, shown to me by the policeman, and, in my judgment, it might have caused it.</p>

Q.</hi> Supposing a person in a state of drunkenness to have laid down with his neckcloth on, might that have occasioned the appearances you saw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they were so distinct, it is impossible—I think it is impos<lb/>sible it could have occurred by accident—there was no congestion of the brain—I examined the brain—it was congested to a very slight extent—strangulation always causes a certain amount of congestion of the brain, but not sufficient to cause death; strangulation causes death by impeding the air passing into the lungs; that congests the brain, and that sometimes occasions death—I do not think the appearances would have been so marked if it had happened from his lying down in his neckcloth; it is a question of degree—if it was done by another person, the man might have struggled, or he might not; if he was sound asleep at the time he would not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">KENNEDY</hi>. I am a surgeon, at Bromley-terrace. I saw the deceased on the Saturday morning, about 2 o'clock, lying in his clothes on the floor of the sitting room—the body was warm, but the extremities were quite cold—I do not think he had been dead more than an hour, or an hour and a half—his posture did not indicate any struggle; he seemed as if he was placed there—I observed a black circle round the neck—I have heard Mr. Robert<lb/>son's evidence, and concur in his opinion—I saw the same symptoms exter<lb/>nally and internally—in my opinion, death was caused by strangulation—I saw the buckle compared with the mark on the throat—it might have been caused by that, but I could not say decidedly—one part of the circle was larger than the remainder—the knot of a handkerchief, if it came on that part, might have done it, or pressure with the hand; it is quite possible—it is impossible for me to say whether, in that case, the handkerchief would be drawn by the deceased himself, or by some other person—I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—my decided opinion was that death was caused by strangulation—there was no appearance of any other cause of death—all the other organs appeared healthy—there were some slight scratches on the face—he had the appearance of a man who had been drinking.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> On what part of the neck was the mark of the knot? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between the carotid artery and the trachea, just over the carotid artery; the pressure would be on the carotid artery—I cannot say that did not cause the death—that would keep the blood in the lungs, and present the external appearances I saw—there was slight congestion of the brain—if the man had laid down in a state of drunkenness with the knot of the handkerchief pressing upon the carotid artery, I do not think that would have caused all the appearances I discovered; I should expect to find the brain more congested from the stupor of drunkenness—I cannot say whether, if the man had gone to bed with a handkerchief tightly tied round his neck, and the knot of the handkerchief pressing upon the carotid artery, that would have caused death by strangulation—I should not like to go to bed in that way.</p>

On the morning of 4th July, I received a parcel from Smith, from Mr. Martin, of Whitechapel—I have the particulars of the credit, which I have extracted from the books—the amount of it was 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it consisted of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note No. 59,608, dated 11th Jan.—there was no other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, the rest was a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and gold and silver—this note pre<lb/>cisely corresponds with the entry I made, it is No. 59,608—I feel quite sure it is the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Dennis, grocers, in Church-street, Hackney. About 8 o'clock on Wednesday evening, 4th July last, Williams came to the shop—he first asked for a pound of tea, I served him with it—he then asked for a pound of coffee, and afterwards for four pounds of loaf sugar, the goods amounted to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he offered me a supposed to be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—he took it out of a pocket book, I did not notice where he took the pocket book from—during the time I was serving him, there being nobody else in the shop, I had a little con<lb/>versation with him—he described himself as an Australian gold digger, and was telling me about his being rather fortunate in one place, and unfortunate in another—I dare say he kept me serving him pretty well a quarter of an hour—he did not talk much about Australia—he said he did not like the country much, there was a very rough lot about—he said, "I made a good deal of money, but not so much as I might have done"—this was while I was serving him, and then he produced the note—I examined it by the feel of the paper, and did not like it—I then examined it. and found the signature of H. Back to it—there had been a letter in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> a few days before about notes with that signature, and I tried to recollect myself, and went up stairs to Mr. William Dennis—I asked him what the name was that had been advertised—I did not show him the note,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200037"/>
               <p>I had it in my hand, but he did not look at it—I merely said, "Here is one of the forged notes"—I then returned into the shop, and found Wells stand<lb/>ing by the side of Williams—he had come into the shop just at the time I was going in doors to speak to Mr. Dennis, and just as he entered the door he called out for a pound of <hi rend="italic">pic nics</hi>. and said, "I am in a hurry"—we have some biscuits called <hi rend="italic">pic nics</hi>—when I returned into the shop I found him standing by the side of Williams—I walked in front of the counter, and asked Williams if he knew what he had given me—Wells was close enough to near what I said—Williams replied, "Yes, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—I said it is not a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; in fact, it is not a note at all"—I then walked behind the counter, and laid the note flat on the counter, thinking him to be an innocent look<lb/>ing man by his face, to show him the signature of H. Back, and I said, "This is not the signature of the note, because it is J. Ferraby"—Williams looked at the signature, and just at the time Wells looked over his shoulder at the note—I was not holding the note very firmly, and he put his hand over, took hold of it, and held it up to the light—he said, "Oh, this is right enough; this is one of the last issue; I have got plenty of them, I will change it!" and he put his hand into his pocket, and drew out a handful of gold and silver—he took five sovereigns out, and laid them on the counter—he had the note in his hand—he scrambled it up very carelessly, and put it into his trowsers pocket—I pushed four of the sovereigns towards Williams, and took one my<lb/>self, examined it, and put it in the detector, and then into the till—I gave Wil<lb/>liams the change, keeping the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the goods he had had—Williams tied up the goods in a silk pocket handkerchief, and walked out—as soon as he went out I took a bag and weighed Wells his pound of <hi rend="italic">pic nice</hi>—he gave me a half crown, and I took 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—as I was weighing them, I called out to the lad Steed to get ready to go out immediately, as I suspected they were regular <hi rend="italic">smashers</hi>—just as Wells went outside the door, I went to the lad, pulled off his apron, pointed out Wells to him, and sent him oat to watch him until I could go myself—just as I was going outside the door, the lad returned—in consequence of what he told me, I went to the corner of Well-street and Mare-street, Hackney, and in a nasty little turning there I dropped upon Wells, Williams, and two others, standing talking to each other—Wells had a parcel of goods in his hand, tied up in a pocket hand<lb/>kerchief—it was about the bulk and appearance of the parcel I had sold to Williams—I believe Williams saw me; he had his face towards me; they immediately parted—Williams came towards me, and Wells went the other way, and the other two parted—I lost sight of them in a moment, there being a lot of labouring men about there, and they appeared as working men themselves—I followed Williams on account of his tendering me the note—I think he observed me to be following him; he walked down Well-street, and passed me—I walked into a grocer's shop to conceal myself, and asked them to allow me to wait there a minute or two—I saw Wells drop the parcel of goods he was carrying, and they were all scattered in the street—that was after I had followed Williams, after Williams had gone down Well-street—I had to run to keep sight of him afterwards, and I saw him turning back, and he saw me turn into the same shop where I first went in—I afterwards saw Wells and Williams together again; that was after I had seen the parcel dropped by Wells; after I came out of the shop again, and was walking after Williams again—Williams was on one side of the road, and Wells was just across the road, where he had dropped his parcel of goods—he picked them up, and went into an unfinished house, I suppose to put his goods to rights again; and by that time Steed, our lad, overtook</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200038"/>
               <p>me—the goods had the appearance of those I had sold to Williams—I could not say whether the <hi rend="italic">pic nics</hi> were with them—I told the lad to keep an eye upon Wells, and I went on after Williams—Wells again overtook me, and passed me, and passed Williams also, and then he commenced walking slowly, and Williams passed him—they might have spoken to each other then, but I was about 200 yards behind, and could not hear—before we came to Cambridge Heath Bridge, both of them went together; they could not see me then; there were a few persons coming home from the City, and I got among them—they joined together—Wells still carried the parcel of goods, and walked on to the bridge, where I met a constable; he and I followed them till we met another constable, a few yards past the Hackney-road-gate, and I gave them in charge.</p>

In consequence of an order given to me by James, I followed Wells—James pointed him out to me before he left—I saw him meet Williams as he was passing under the Hack<lb/>ney railway arch, and against St. Thomas's-square, I saw Wells pass some-thing over into Williams's hand—I was not near enough to see what it was—they then separated; they were only together two or three minutes—I came back and told Mr. James—I went out again afterwards, and saw them both at the corner of Well-street, and another one with them—I followed them till we met a constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at No. 15, Nicol-square, Hackney-road—the prisoner lodged there. On Saturday night, 30th June, I came home a little before 10 o'clock—the prisoner lodged in the back room first floor—I went up to him and asked him if he knew whether his time was up, as I had previously given him a week's notice—he said, "Mr. Wayman, don't turn me out to night; allow me to stop, I don't feel very well"—I said, "I cannot allow you to enter into another week; your conduct is such, coming home at all hours of the night, I cannot allow you to remain in the house"—after a while 1 consented to let him remain in the house, and I then left his room—we retired to bed about a quarter to 12 o'clock—I had not been in bed above five minutes, before I heard the prisoner making a great noise, swearing to himself, as I frequently heard him do before, and making a most awful groaning noise, and pulling things backwards and forwards, which annoyed me, and I could not go to sleep—I went up to ask him whether he would be quiet—I knocked at his door</p>

               <p>first, but got no reply—his door not being fast, I opened it and just looked in—I saw him standing upright on his bed; he had only his night shirt on—the moment I opened the door and put it back to step my foot in, he flew at me with something—I did not know that he had anything in his hand—he struck me very violently—I held up my arm to defend my face from the blow, and received a very severe wound in my arm from some sharp instrument—I bled very much indeed—my arm was cut in three places, and my hand was very severely cut in one place—a constable was sent for, and he was given into custody—Mr. Wallis came and dressed my wounds.</p>

I am foreman to Elizabeth and Jane Collinson, at No. 35, Lombard-street—they are tin plate workers and ironmongers—the prisoners were in their employ under me—they worked in the warehouse under the shop—I left the shop about 6 o'clock that evening—the proper time for the men to leave was 7 o'clock—that is the usual time for shutting up—Neale has been upwards of twenty years in the employ, and McAllister about twelve months—I left the shop at 6 o'clock that night under the guidance of the nephew of the ladies, Edward Fancourt—his duty was to see the prisoners out, as I have always done—he is twenty-four or twenty<lb/>five yean old—there was one gentleman above me, Mr. John Watson, he is dead—he was the late foreman—I am foreman now, and have been so six or seven weeks—I have been in the employ seventeen year—we had such spoong as these in stock to the best of my belief, especially the tea spoons, they are the property of my employers—these pieces of copper would not be considered scrapings, decidedly not, nor bits that a man would be allowed to take away—the men would not be allowed to take anything without the permission of the foreman—since I have been there I got them to clean out the workshop, which was in a very dirty state, and under the benches were some pieces of old iron, which I allowed them to take away instead of giving them beer—but these things produced would not be allowed to be taken by anybody—no one would be allowed to take this solder, being costly metal—this piece is worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

About a quarter past 9 o'clock on the evening of 18th July I was collecting the goods for the night—I turned round, and saw the prisoner take two coats, a pair of trowsers, and a waistcoat—I ran after him, and caught him by the collar in Church-row—he dropped the goods, and wanted to know what I wanted with him—I took him back to the shop, and told him that he had taken the goods, and he should either pay for them or be locked up—he said that he could not pay for them, but would leave a deposit on them—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a grocer's shop at Billingford, in Norfolk. On 3rd March, 1854, the prisoner came, saying that he came from Burrell and Co., for orders for tea papers and paper bags; I said that I did not want any; he said that he bad got orders from the neighbours round—my neigh<lb/>bours' names were on the paper, and that induced me to give him an order by word of mouth for 28 lbs. of tea paper at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound—14 lbs. was to be cut for half ounces, 10 lbs. for ounces, and the remainder for two ounces—he asked me if I would have them printed on; I said no, that printed papers were of no use to me; he said that I might as well have them printed as not, as there was no difference in price, but I said that I would have them plain—he wrote the order down with a pencil—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is part of the paper on which he wrote, but it was larger than this—I saw the order after he wrote it, and wrote my name at the bottom—this is like my name on this paper, but the paper was a good deal larger, and was double—I wrote nothing but my name—the paper was ruled with pencil at the top—there was pencil writing at the top, and I wrote my name at the bottom, almost the length of the paper from the pencil writing at the top—there was then no pen and ink writing on it—the prisoner said, "Perhaps you will write your name yourself," pointing to the bottom of the paper, and I did so—I believe this to be my writing, unless it is copied very closely from it—I did not write it in pencil, but with pen and ink—my wife was present and another woman—about three weeks afterwards I received my papers, printed, and afterwards an invoice was sent down, but I would not pay it—I had an action brought against me in the Sheriff's Court, London, where the prisoner said that I owed him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the order I had given him only amounted to 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner show you a paper containing samples of printing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had a paper, but I did not look at it; I said that it was of no use; it was a card—he wanted me to have a specimen printed on my papers, but I objected, as they would have been of no use in my small shop—I first spoke to Mr. Miller on this matter, and he advised me to speak to Mr. Drake—I made my statement to the Judge in London, then before a Magistrate in London, then at Norwich before the Judge, and then I came up here—I did not wish to have printing on my papers; it was not that I did not want to pay for the printing, because he said that it was all the same price; the reason was because I had nothing in my shop—my returns are not 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I thought he was telling me the truth when he said that there would be no extra charge for printing—he said that there was no extra charge, but that he printed them for the sale of them—this is like my writing—I wrote with my own pen and ink—if Mr. Ballantine has said, in his opening, that I had no pen and ink, he is wrong—the paper on which I signed my name was two or three inches larger than this—I should think the pencil writing occupied four lines at the top, and I signed at the bottom—I signed where the prisoner told me—I do not sign receipts in the same way—this is not a receipt—I signed it as a direction—I am sure the writing was in pencil—it was a common piece of pencil, similar to this (<hi rend="italic">the end of a pen holder</hi>)—I do not know whether my wife or the other woman saw what was written on the paper, but one of them can-not read—I keep books—I made no memorandum of this order, or of the call</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you had not heard that it was in ink, how came you to say to any-body that it was in pencil? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because it was written in pencil—I was at Norwich at the trial—there were several prosecutions for forging this docu<lb/>ment—I was one of the prosecutors—the prisoner was acquitted—I do not know that the learned Judge said that it was a mere contract as to the bargain, or that it might have been a very good reason for resisting the pay<lb/>ment, but that it did not make a forgery—there was a conversation as to the quantity and the size into which the paper was to be cut—the price was to be 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound, which was put down according to my order—I was on one side of the counter, and the prisoner on the other—I think he wrote on a book in his hand—I cannot tell how long he was writing it—when he had written it, I wrote my name on it—I saw at the time that my name was a long way from the pencil writing—the direction was not in pencil at the top—I have not sworn, over and over again, that "R. Platten, grocer," was at the top—I did not put "Billingford," because I was not asked.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gordon, and received an order for goods from him—it was a personal order—I had three orders, amounting altogether, if the whole had been executed, to 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or perhaps more—the three orders were for the supply of different persons' goods—one of them related to Mr. M'Millan—they were for bareges—I gave an order for the delivery of those goods—we sent them from our premises to Burke, Winter, and Munford's, the packers of the bankrupts, according to their instructions—that was by Mr. Gordon's direc<lb/>tions—here is the invoice, made out in Mr. McMillan's name, to Davidson and Gordon—I did not make it out; I saw it made out—I read it—I am sure this is the one I read—the value of Mr. M'Millan's goods was 426<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was the ordinary fair price at that time, the selling price—the goods are invoiced as "Children's checks"—they are known in the trade by that name, and also "Novelty checks"—that is a name given to another sort of the same description of goods—on Saturday, 17th June, I went to the offices of Gordon and Davidson, in Mincing-lane—I saw the clerks—I do not know their names—I did not see Gordon—I did not get any money on that occasion—I went again on Monday, the 19th—I did not apply for money then, because neither Mr. Gordon nor Mr. Davidson were there, and the clerks could not give any satisfactory answer where they were gone to—I could neither see them nor find them—I have never received the money for those goods—Fotherby is the name of our porter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm trading under the name of Overend, Gurney, and Co.; our proper business is that of money dealers, receiving money at one entrance, and issuing it at another. I know Gordon—I have known him for some years—I knew him when he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200062"/>
               <p>carrying on another business, previous to a former bankruptcy—I did not know that he was a bankrupt before I knew him in 1847.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There was some composition, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what it was—afterwards, in 1848, he carried on business, in partnership still with Davidson—I think he was with Serjeant, and afterwards with Davidson—from the latter end of 1852 down to Oct., 1833, we made several advances to him—I think I have the documents here upon which these advances were made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then I may take it, generally, that they purport to be warrants for spelter, and metal deposited in a particular wharf? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Do you mean the warrants, or the borrowing notes? I can give you whichever you like—I have the warrants that the money was advanced upon, these are a portion of them (<hi rend="italic">producing some papers</hi>)—on 13th Oct., 1853, a circumstance occurred which led me to speak to Gordon on the subject of these warrants—he did not come in the course of business; he came after business, with Mr. Cole—he and Mr. Cole had not been there previously—I had had transactions with Cole previously upon the same description of warrants—the total sum owing to us directly from Davidson and Gordon on 13th Oct., on these warrants, was about 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., rather under—I am sorry to say that no part of that has been paid—it was supposed to be secured by the warrants that I have now in my possession.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When Gordon came, what did you say to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is somewhat difficult to say—we had a considerable conversation—by "we" I mean, myself, Cole, Gordon, and my confidential clerk, Mr. Boyce, whose depart<lb/>ment it was to manage the advances—in the course of that conversation, I mentioned what I had learnt about the warrants—it was an interlocutory interview, it arose from my previous interview with Cole, about 3 o'clock that same day—the particular words, it is perfectly impossible to recollect—the substance of the conversation was to inquire of Cole----</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you pledge yourself to the substance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; am I at liberty to mention what passed between Cole and me in the afternoon?.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> No; when he came with Gordon at 4 o'clock, what was the substance of the conversation that then passed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is difficult to say whether I spoke to Cole or Gordon: suffice it to say that the prime point of my interest was this, to what extent we had been defrauded (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">objected to this general evidence</hi>)—the substance was to ascertain to what depths we had been involved in these advances—if I am per<lb/>mitted to explain, I can do so with great ease—I think Mr. Chambers will hardly object to what I am going to say—whether I addressed myself to Cole or Gordon, I really cannot pretend to say.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you say to either? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Cole had admitted to us that Gordon's warrants were in the same condition that he had stated his own to be in; therefore when we met on this occasion it was to inquire the extent of the warrants of this kind, which we had of theirs as security.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well, Cole having admitted something to you in the absence of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200063"/>
               <p>Gordon, You afterwards saw Gordon at your counting house; now what did you say to him? <hi rend="italic">A. In</hi> the state of mind I was at that time, I should gay I said very little or nothing—I addressed myself to the point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Five minutes ago you said there was a good deal of conversation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No doubt there was, because it occupied a good deal of time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Cole had told you that his warrants were good for nothing, or doubtful at all events? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we had a notice that Gordon's war<lb/>rants were as bad—it is very likely that when I saw Gordon, I may have said to him, "Mr. Gordon, is there any foundation for this?" or some<lb/>thing to that effect, but there was no mystery about it—it was admitted, the conversation proceeded on the basis that there was nothing attaching to the warrants, that the goods had been separated from the warrants—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">again objected to this evidence</hi>)—it is not difficult to explain it, if I might go back to the conversation with Cole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You must remember the effect, at all events, of what passed between you and Gordon and Cole, on that occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most decidedly; the effect was this, to satisfy me that we had been defrauded of an immense sum of money—I do not say by whom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just bring your mind to the time when Cole, Gordon, Boyce, and yourself were together, and state what then passed between you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What really and positively passed between us it is impossible for me to say, but I have no difficulty whatever in bringing to my mind the sub<lb/>stance and the result—in order to make you understand it, it is necessary, as I said before, to explain what had passed with Cole—I must tell you at once, that Cole had admitted to me in the morning that he had lent to Gordon these warrants, and that finding he could not get the warrants back again he had taken possession of the metals himself—now I am quite clear and I can proceed—I then met Cole and Gordon with the knowledge of those facts before me, and proceeded to discuss how we stood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you say to Gordon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing of any personal remark that I made to Gordon—it is said that I said Gordon was a thief—I do not believe I ever did say so, and it is not consistent that I should say so—how could I say Gordon was a thief at the time when Cole had previously taken the whole thing upon himself?—I really cannot recol<lb/>lect any personal words that I said to Gordon, nor can I tell what he said to me—I have no hesitation in telling you, because I have got it down in writing, in substance, what Gordon told me, which was this, after I had satis<lb/>fied myself of the extent of the fraud we had suffered under, I do not say who by, I proceeded then to consider what had become of the property, and from Gordon I got the history of the distillery, which I took down in writing, and have here present—I took it down upon the spot in my own handwriting, and the remainder my clerk took—I took down a very full and particular account of the property he had, as far as the distillery was concerned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is important to us to know what Gordon said on the subject of these warrants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have nothing about that, it was no interest to us either one way or the other—I am not aware that Gordon said anything at all about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then am I to understand you as pledging your oath not to know whe<lb/>ther Gordon said anything about the warrants or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, you are to understand what I have said, that the conversation upon that was upon the admission that the goods had been separated—we were not aware of Gordon giving us positively to know either one way or the other.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200064"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then not being aware, probably you wanted to find out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we did not indeed, it was quite enough for us to know the calamity that had happened to us; we had quite enough to know at such a moment as that to hear that such a thing had overtaken us, without indulging in any personal animosity—I take it for granted that Gordon came there in consequence of my conversation with Cole, though I cannot positively say that—I sent for him, as anybody else would, to know how he stood in relation to his affairs with us, and to these warrants—I sent for him to know how he stood in relation to these warrants, that he might know from Cole what Cole had stated to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having sent for him to ascertain how he stood in relation to these warrants, what did you say to him about these warrants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I proceeded immediately, as I said before, to know the depth of our involvement in these warrants, and then to know what had become of the property—I did know the depth of our involvement too soon, from Cole, who certainly was present, and told us that, as to the whole of the warrants which we held at Hagan's Wharf, the goods were not there to represent them—those were warrants to the amount of 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., some of which Gordon had deposited with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you ask Gordon any questions about that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not believe we did, simply because Cole had admitted that he had lent them to Gordon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Gordon admit or deny, or what did he say about the genuineness of the warrants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember a single word having passed from Gordon on the subject—I then proceeded to learn from Gordon the history of the distillery, which I have taken down—I did not on that occasion take a promissory note, nor have I ever had any communication with Davidson and Gordon about that promissory note—I have not taken any promissory note whatever from Davidson and Gordon direct—we have a promissory note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I hold it in my hand, and there is the envelope in which it has been kept from the time we received it to the pre<lb/>sent time—I am afraid it is not necessary for me to answer whether it has been paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I see this is a note for 120,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on demand; "We promise to pay to Messrs. Cole Brothers, or order, the sum of 120,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; signed, Davidson and Gordon;" do you know whose handwriting that "Davidson and Gordon" is? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not know their handwriting exactly—I have no belief, I cannot answer that question, my clerk can, no doubt; I really cannot say whether it is Davidson's or Gordon's—there is no doubt it is one of them—I took this note drawn by Davidson and Gordon, endorsed by Cole, to sym<lb/>bolize the money which Cole said had been obtained from us, and lent to Davidson and Gordon, and I have kept it ever since—on the following day we received from Cole some deeds connected with the distillery.</p>

I shall be very glad to be examined on this, if you please, because a very great misunderstanding has gone abroad; it will not affect Davidson and Gordon in the least.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had any arrangement been made upon the sub<lb/>ject of the deeds while Gordon was present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; they had not been alluded to in the least degree—I have never, to the best of my knowledge and belief, exchanged a single word with Gordon about the deeds—I took down from Gordon all the particulars about the distillery on the 13th, and I have got it here for your information.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200065"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you expect the deeds to come next day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had not the slightest idea they existed, certainly not—no conversation whatever took place between me and Gordon upon the subject of the lease of the distillery, so far as I know—when I received the parchments from Cole, it was not in accordance with any arrangement with Gordon previously—they remained in our possession, but we never took them as security, or asked for them—they never were sent to us as security, but when Cole became bankrupt, we returned the papers to the assignees—in the first instance they went to our solicitors, and then they were returned to us, and remained with us till Cole's bankruptcy—it did not turn out that Cole had no right to part with them—we did not ask for them—we gave them up to the assignees of Cole—our solicitor did, I believe in July, 1854.</p>

I was the owner of the distillery at West Ham—I think I executed a mortgage deed to Davidson and Gordon in 1851, and they acted upon that mortgage in 1853—I was not in communication with them down to their bankruptcy—I saw them frequently—I was in commu<lb/>nication with them until they took possession of the place, and it was then arranged that they should pay a composition to the creditors of West Ham that was arranged with Gordon—that was properly carried out—I was not in the habit of seeing much of them, very little—I was over there occasionally—I recollect seeing Gordon in Oct., 1583—I saw Davidson in the first instance, I saw Gordon afterwards—that was some time in Oct.—he told me that he had told Chapman everything—I do not know about what—he merely said he had told Chapman everything—I asked him what he meant by everything—he told me that he had had large advances of money from Overend and Gurney upon warrants, and the goods belonging to those warrants were not paid for, and the party those goods belonged to had stopped the delivery—he told me this, by the bye, that he was obliged to acknowledge that he owed Cole 120,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him if he did, and he said, "No"—I then said, "What does Mr. Chapman say to all this?"—I must tell you that Mr. Gordon was evidently very much hurt—he told me that Mr. Chapman had said that he had always looked upon him as an upright man, and he was sorry to find that he was otherwise—there was nothing further that I know of—he then put on his hat and walked out—this was at my counting house—he said that Mr. Chapman had said that what had then taken place was not to be mentioned.</p>

Was the sum demanded, and 90,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not in that account—that would not make 270,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. demanded—180,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was demanded—there was the demand in the first instance, and after that the account was rendered—it is a perfect impossibility to tell within 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. what I owed Davidson and Gordon, and I will tell you why; Messrs. Harding and Pulling, the accountants, have been engaged at the accounts some months, and they cannot find out what it is, not within 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell you anything further than I have just stated—the course of business was this, that Gordon and David<lb/>son received all money on my account, and paid all accounts—the book were kept at Davidson and Gordon's—I had my own books at home, as to the working of the distillery—before they had anything to do with the dis<lb/>tillery they had made advances to a large amount—I say there was a very large amount due to them, and then they took to the distillery—they said the amount of the advances was 180,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On 4th Aug., between 1 and 2 o'clock, Zago, Dominini, and Bevole came to our warehouse—they did not purchase anything—they went to the silk counter, looked at the silk, and left, without buying any<lb/>thing—in consequence of information, I followed them—they went down Aldermanbury, into Basinghall-street, and there Zago stood outside, and Dominini and Bevole went into a coffee shop—I returned to our warehouse, and came back with Mr. Mornement, and two officers in plain clothes—Mr. Jarvis took Zago—he resisted a little—I told him, in the best manner I could, in French, that he was an officer, and, seeing the other two going with the officers, he went more quietly.</p>

               <p>house. Zago and Bevole lodged in my house for three weeks—I knew the other two prisoners, Rossi and Dominini—they were in the habit of visiting Zago and Bevole two or three times a day—on Thursday, 2nd Aug., I went into Zago's room with a tray of linen, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the after<lb/>noon—I saw Dominini and Bevole measuring a great quantity of black stuff—I could not see what it was—it was wide, and was like the silk that I afterwards saw—I had lent Bevole a measure that afternoon—I left the room, and went down stairs, and soon afterwards Zago and Rossi came, it. might have been in about half an hour—they went into the room where Dominini and Bevole were—in a few minutes Bevole brought down the money for the lodging, and the washing also—I had taken the account for the lodging when I went up, and, when I saw them measuring, I gave it to Dominini—Rossi had told me the day before to let the lodgers have their account, for they were going away on Thursday—while Bevole was giving me the money, Rossi and Zago, the lodgers, came into my room, and asked why Bevole was so long—Bevole had paid me 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. too much in the account, and Rossi took back a sixpence, and gave me a penny; that made it all right, and settled the account—I saw no more of the prisoners that night—I heard them go out about 7 o'clock, soon after they left my room—I went into their room, about 9 o'clock the next morning, to make the bed—I did not see any black stuff there then—it was all cleared away—it was in the bed room that I had seen them pleasuring it.</p>

On the morning of 2nd July the prosecutor was brought there, suffering great pro<lb/>stration from the effects of several wounds in his body—one was a superficial incised wound, about an inch in length, below the right collar bone; the second wound was between the sixth and seventh ribs, entering the chest, and wounding the lungs; the third was an incised wound, across the lower part of the belly, and the upper part of the right thigh—it was eight inches long, and about three inches deep in its deepest part—it had divided several of the muscles of the thigh—the cavity of the belly was not opened—it just cleared the great artery—there was a punctured wound on the right thigh, two inches deep, and another superficial wound on the right knee—they were dangerous, and were such wounds as these knives would produce.</p>

On 19th July I was opposite Mr. Bone's stable in Upper Thames-street, about 7 o'clock in the morning; Allen, another policeman, was with me—I saw Brown come from his master's, Mr. Westley's, stable, and go into Mr. Bone's stable with this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it appeared to have something in it—I saw him come out again, he had nothing with him then—I did not follow him, but I saw him come back into Mr. Bone's stable about ten minutes afterwards—I and</p>

               <p>Allen followed him in, and I asked him what that was that he had brought in that bag—he pointed to these wrappers and book covers, and said, "Only a few wrappers"—I asked him where he got them from; he said, of his foreman—I asked him where he worked; he said, "At Mr. Westley's, the bookbinder's," and that he had borrowed them of his foreman—I saw about two tons of different sorts of papers there, several reams of newspapers, and several works which had been printed but never published—there was a great quantity more of wrappers—all the wrappers were in the coach house, but the printed paper and newspapers were up stairs—when we went in, the prisoners were standing over the goods by the scales, the wrappers were at their feet just inside the door—I asked Halliday how he accounted for that lot of goods (that was this large bundle)—he said that he got them of Cox and Wyman—they were in the coach house—I went to Mr. West<lb/>ley's, and returned to the stable with him—Mr. Westley, Jun., was there when I returned, and Mr. Bone, and the prisoners also—when they were all present I said to Brown that Mr. Westley had not given him these things, and he knew nothing about them—he said that he had borrowed them of Halliday one wet day to cover his master's goods up—I pointed to the book covers, and said, "Did you borrow these to cover up your master's things?"—he said no, but he had lost some which he borrowed of Halliday, and had brought these to make up the weight—I told him to consider him<lb/>self in custody—I said to Halliday, "Where are those bags which you brought in yesterday at tea time?"—he pointed to these others, and said, "They are them, they came from Cox and Wyman's"—there was a large quantity—this is only a sample.</p>

METCALPE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you forgotten the name when you went to Southampton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but it is a year and three months since—I made no memorandum of it—he said, "At Shirley, near South<lb/>ampton"—Shirley is part of Southampton, and I inquired there—I first had transactions with the prisoner, as near as I can recollect, about June, 1853—he came into my service at the end of 1853—by referring to my books I can tell you whether I bought shares for him from June to Nov.—I occasionally bought and sold shares for him; one or two small transact<lb/>tions—I was led to believe that he had a good deal of money when he first came to me—I did not invest a good deal of money for him—there were only five or six transactions—I believe he was not doing business with Mr. Massop before he came to me—after he was my clerk, he introduced Mr. Massop to me, and I did business with him through that introduction; it was very shortly after he came—he was to receive half the commission received upon every person who he introduced—I had no settlement with him before he left; he did not give me a chance—the principal business I did through his introduction was for Mr. Massop—there would have been salary and commission due to him, but he absconded—by looking, I can tell what was due to him up to July; I should say that it was not so much as 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it might be about that, commission alone—his salary was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and he was with me nearly six months—none of it was paid—about ten days before I went down to Southampton, Mr. Massop told me that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200083"/>
               <p>these certificates were not lodged, and I spoke to the prisoner about it at the same time—Mr. Massop spoke to me about it on 10th June, and I spoke to the prisoner directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not he tell you that as Mr. Massop owed you money on other transactions, it had better stand as security? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think he did say some<lb/>thing of that sort—I made no agreement to that; I said nothing—the whole of the conversations took place in June, and my visit to Southampton was in June—I went there a few days afterwards—there are no shares issued in the Company—this (<hi rend="italic">produce</hi>) is scrip, and entitles you to receive the dividends—if you want to sell, on transferring this to the vendee, that is the completion of the sale—there is no transfer at all made by the Company; they are not aware in the least who their shareholders are.</p>

In March last year, I delivered to Mr. Jessopp 100 shares in the Great Luxembourg railway—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a sample of them—I handed Mr. Jessopp ten certificates similar to this—I made an entry of the numbers of fifty, but of the other fifty I did not, because I should not have been paid unless I had done them in a certain time; it was in the hurry of business—the numbers were 33841 to 33850, 33571 to 80, 30611 to 30, and 26666 to 75—that amounts to fifty—I delivered them at his office with the other fifty unnumbered, but to whom I do not know.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stockbroker, of Pinner's-hall. On 8th March last year, I gave directions to Mr. Jessopp, to purchase shares for me in the Great Luxembourg Railway, but did not receive any shares from him, or on his account—I have very frequently spoken to the prisoner about these shares—he made a variety of excuses week after week, and he said that he had not received them, and that they had not been delivered—I made frequent applications to him, and he made frequent excuses—I did not authorise him to keep them for me, or to deposit them with anybody for me on my account, nor with any one at Southampton—I have received another 100 shares since from Mr. Jessopp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You never authorised him to deposit them in any manner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I received the dividend from him—I do not remember the amount (<hi rend="italic">looking at a book</hi>)—I received 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Smith on 6th April, I sup<lb/>pose that must be it—I undoubtedly received the dividend—one day, when I wanted the shares particularly, he said that he had left them at the office, that the dividend would be received altogether, and he would pay it to me—I received the money without inquiring at the office whether the shares were there—I had not had many transactions with him independently—our acquaintance commenced about the end of 1853, and he introduced me to Mr. Jessopp about the same time—I discounted a bill for him once—that was the only transaction I had with him as a principal—I have my cash book with me—I have no subpoena to produce my books—I have not been to the office this morning—I have been told that there is a subpoena lying there—I do not remember having any transaction with the prisoner about shares, independent of Mr. Jessopp—I will not swear that I have not—I in all probability gave him the order in this very case—he has not on many occasions bought and sold shares for me on his own account, but only as the clerk—I do not think on any occasion I have had a transaction with him as a principal, only in discounting a bill—I have had some South Devon stock—the prisoner did not buy them for me on his own account, he was not on the Stock Exchange at the time—I think I had joint speculations with the</p>

               <p>prisoner, but only through Mr. Jessopp—yes, I have with the prisoner on his own account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you to divide the commission? when you received an order from clients to buy shares, was not the prisoner to buy them cheaper if he could, and you and he to share the difference? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we on a few occasions bought what we call a consol or two, and divided the profits—if we thought consols were going cheaper, we bought a consol together—that is 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. consolidated stock, and divided the profits—that was done through Mr. Jessopp—it was while the prisoner was with Mr. Jessopp—Mr. Jessopp knew nothing about my sharing the profits with his clerk—we did that per<lb/>haps four or five times—that was 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not recollect buying anything else in connection with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the meaning of carrying over? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you have bought, and are unable to pay, you can sometimes get the people of whom you have bought to deliver them in another fortnight, or another month—I will not swear that I had not as many as a dozen transactions of that description with him—I do not remember carrying anything over with him, and do not think I did at all—I do not know whether my books would show, very likely they would.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were told this morning that your books were subpœnaed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Was it safe to go?—my books would not show a regular debtor and creditor account between me and the prisoner—I believe there is not such an account standing on my books with the prisoner—there is not money due to the prisoner from me at this very moment, I owe him nothing—I will not swear that there is no account between me and him, but I believe not—I swear that there is no money due from me to him, or appearing to be due—I should think he would not have left it all this time if there had been—I frequently made applications to him for the shares, almost daily, both before and after he paid me the dividend—I do not know on what day the divi<lb/>dend was paid—I did not speak to Mr. Jessopp for a long time; I do not know whether it was before June—I do not believe I asked the prisoner to exchange these shares for me for some new shares which the company were issuing, telling him that shares were falling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not produce the Company's receipt to you for ten of the new shares, and leave it with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say whether it was ten new shares, or ten old shares—I do not know whether it was in June—the shares were very much lower in June—I do not think I asked him for new shares at that time, he had other shares of this sort—I remember his show<lb/>ing me one—I do not know how long these speculations went on—there may have been one as late as May, I do not remember—I do not know that I was entering into speculations with him at the time that I knew that he was holding these shares—I had no particular reason for not telling Mr. Jessopp that I was speculating, I should not have cared two straws about his knowing—I have been in business since June, 1853,1 think it was.</p>

James Deane and Co.; they have premises in King William-street, which extend down Arthur-street to within one door of Fish-street Hill—it is in the parish of St. Margaret, Fish-street—the house at the corner of Fish-street Hill is occupied as a warehouse—no one sleeps there, and no one sleeps on our premises at night—on the night of Saturday, 7th July, I locked up our premises about 20 minutes past 7 o'clock—I saw that they were all quite safe when I left them—I keep the keys—I went to the premises on the Monday morning following—I was the first there—it was about 7 o'clock—I found the stock strewed about the place, and in great disorder—ultimately I found a large quantity of stock missing; of watches, chains, pencil cases, and other goods—on looking further, I found how the entry had been effected, that they had broken a padlock on the third floor, and got in at a window—that window was barred, and there was a small door in it which was fastened by means of a padlock—the window had a small door or gate in it—that window leads on to the leads, and that window had been forced, showing that persons had come in from the leads, and there was a ladder placed close to a chimney, which ladder had been taken from our stock inside our house—I found a rope placed round another chimney; by means of that a person could get on the leads or from the leads—I found that persons had broken into the adjoining warehouse, and got through a partition and on to the leads—I communicated with the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. I took Barnett on Friday night, 13th July, in Petticoat-lane—I told him it was on suspicion of stealing a quantity of watches from Messrs. Deane and Co. in the City—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I asked him if he was in the Highway on the Tuesday previous, pawning watches, or in the Commercial-road pawning watches—he said, "No, I was not in the Commercial-road nor the Highway, nor did I pawn any watches"—I took him to Leman-street station, and went to search his house—I found nothing in the house relative to this case—after I had been to his house, I went back to the station in company with his wife—she said to him, "Why don't you tell who employed you to pawn these watches? if you don't tell I will; you ought to think of your children"—he said, "I will tell all about it; I was in the Highway on the Tuesday, and in the Commercial-road, and I did pawn watches there"—he said he was employed by a man of the name of Polack, living at No. 16, Sandy's-row, Petticoat-lane—he was a clothier or general dealer, and if I would go to a house, No. 190, Church-street, Shoreditch, to a person of the name of Mrs. Lowe, I should find some more of the property there—I had before told him I had found some watches in the Highway—he said on Tuesday morning Polack came to his house, and took him to Mrs. Lowe's—he said,</p>

               <p>"We both went into the house together, and I received a packet of watches from Mrs. Lowe, and they were the watches I have been pawning"—I then searched him, and in his waistcoat pocket I found the bit of paper of which I spoke before—when I took the paper out of his pocket, he said that related to some wedding rings that he and Polack had sold at Benham's shop, in Barbican, on the Wednesday previous—I believe Mrs. Lowe is an aunt of Polack's—I went there on the Saturday morning—I found there was a Mrs. Lowe lived there—I spoke to her—I found nothing there—I took Polack the same night at No. 16, Sandy's-row—I found he was carrying on the business of a clothier there—I told him I took him on suspicion of stealing a quantity of watches and jewellery from Deane and Dray in the City—he said, "I don't know what you mean"—I repeated it over again—he said, "I know nothing about it, nor did I have any watches"—I asked him if he was in Ratcliff-highway or the Commercial-road on the Tuesday previous, along with a man of the name of Barnett, pawning watches—he said he was not in the Highway nor the Commercial-road, pawning any watches, nor did he know Barnett—I searched his house, but found nothing relating to this case—the property in his shop was taken down from the shelves, and all packed up in hampers—I asked him why the property was all packed up; he said some of it was come from the Exhibition Change, where he had a stall, and the other was going down to Wales, he had got a shop there—I then took him to the Lambeth-street station where Barnett was, and I said to Barnett, "Is this the man that employed you to pawn the watches?" Barnett said, "Yes, he is the man"—Polack then put his hands together, and said, "Oh my God! if you will say that, you will say anything."</p>

               <p>wish me, searched his person—I searched the room—there was a card table there—I said to Beal, after Haydon had searched him, "Have you any other stolen property in the house?"—he said, "No"—I proceeded to search—I came to the card table drawer, and I had a difficulty in getting at it—he said, "You will find nothing there; there is no drawer there"—it is a table that turns, and there is a well or drawer in it—I continued till I had succeeded in finding the drawer, and in it I found a great number of articles—I have a list of them, which was made by my dictation at the station—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>:) "Eight gold watch cases, and nine movements, eight of the move<lb/>ments fitted the cases, there was one movement without a case, twenty three gold eye glasses, nine other gold watches in cases, three brooches four pairs of gold spectacles, twenty-one gold pencil cases, three Albert chains, three neck chains, a quantity of stones taken out of bracelets, a pair of broken spectacles," and other things—the property which refers to this case are these nine gold watches, three brooches, fifteen eye glasses, four pairs of gold spectacles, twenty-one gold pencil cases, three Albert chains, 1 neck chain, and the broken spectacles.</p>

               <p>but that I had received information from Mr. Rayner, who was the treasurer, that it had ceased to exist for two or three years—I know of no such society as the London Sailors' Mission—I have made inquiry about the whole of the Regent's-park—on the way to the station he said that if I would make the matter right for him he would give me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had seen, "Regent's-dock, Limehouse," on one of the receipts, and at Marlborough-street, I asked the Magistrate to ask him where the counting house of the society was; he said that the word "Park" was a false print, and he had erased it, and put in "Dock"—Mr. Hardwicke asked him where it was; and he said that it was held at Sharpe and Rickett's coal wharf, Regent's-dock.</p>

Habershon, Esq., the architect—I wrote a letter to him, and received an answer; after which I went, in company with another gentleman, to speak to him—I asked him whether the letter was written by him, or his instructions—he said that it was written by his instructions, and said, "I am the vice-president of the London Sailors' Mission"—his office is No. 38, Bloomsbury-square—I do not know his residence—he stated in his letter, and likewise in my presence, and that of the gentleman who accompanied me, that Mr. Buckingham was authorized missionary and collecting agent for the London Sailors' Mission—I was before the Magistrate with this letter, and they refused to hear my evidence.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an Interpreter</hi>). I am a tailor, and live at Whitechapel. On Friday, 6th July, I saw Myers—he said that as far as laid in his power he should raise money sufficient, and he could get work for me to the amount of thousands; that he knew some of the highest foremen in the establishment of Mr. Pearce, the army contractor over the way, and if I would raise money he could get me work—I was with him in a public house, and he pointed over the way—I do not know the name of the street, but that is the owner of the public house (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Richards</hi>)—both Myers and Dowling showed me the house—Myers took me to the public house on the Saturday following at 1 o'clock, and we there met Dowling—when I went in, Myers asked Dowling if he could speak a few words to him—he spoke to him, but I did not well understand what he said—Dowling told me that he was the highest man at Mr. Pearce's, and had got the control—I asked him who Mr. Pearce was, but I could not understand what he answered—he addressed me in English, and Myers translated it—I gave Dowling 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that occasion in the public house, that was because he told me that he would get me plenty of work—I can speak a little English—I talked English with Dowling, and that which I could not speak Myers spoke for me—I could not understand the meaning in English of the sentences which Myers translated, I only listened to what Myers told me—Dowling handed me over six coats to make, that was directly after I had given him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me no receipt for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it was for security for the six coats—I made them up and Myers took them to the place, because I did not know where to go—I went with him, and saw Dowling in the same room—he said in English that I came too late, that he had 100 coats and could not wait any longer for me—Myers said, that we ought to have been there before—I understood some part of it, and</p>

               <p>May; they were all safe then—I have spoken to Mrs. Burnstein about the lock half a dozen times, pretty well every time I have been there, and she always said that I was very troublesome, and rather rude in complaining about the lock, and that the things were as safe as if they were under my own eye, for she never went to the top of the house—I said that she might change her servants, and they might not all be honest, but a lock was never put on—about 26th May, I ascertained from my daughter that the things were gone—I went to the house the very next morning, and it was shut up; I could not get in—I went to No. 31, Lambeth-walk—I first went into the shop, and asked the workmen for Mrs. Isaacs, which was the name over the door; she was called down, and the female prisoner came into the parlour—I asked her what made her husband move my things away so far from my residence; the answer was that she had not gone to Australia, that my things were perfectly safe, and I should have them—I said, "Will you please to write a letter?" she said that she could not, because her husband had gone out to buy a horse—I had not said anything about Australia—we asked at what time her husband would be home; she said that it might be five minutes and it might be an hour—I said, "We may meet him"—we went out and met him in the street—I said, "Mr. Burn-stein, if you please I want my furniture; I have seen your wife, she says that she cannot give them up till you come home"—he said, "I do not know you, I have just come from abroad, I never saw you before"—I thought I had really made a mistake, but I watched him into his house; the house which I had been into—when he got in he called, "Jane;" his wife came down, they talked together for a few moments, and I then went in and said, "I hope you will excuse me, but the time gets on, and I have a great many things to move"—the answer was, "What things, we have no things"—I said, "You said I should have them as soon as your husband came in;" she said, "I certainly had a few things which I bought and paid for"—I said, "Bought and paid for! did you ever pay me one farthing?" she said, "No, but the last payment I made was to your daughter, and that was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I never before heard that she had paid my daughter anything—I said that I would bring my daughter on the next day; I did so, and saw Mrs. Burnstein—she said, "I have nothing to say, I have bought the things and paid for them, and if you talk for a fortnight I will say no more"—I had a policeman ready, and as I was rushing up stairs to see if she had the things in the house, she said that she would break my neck if I went up—I went up and said, "That is mine, and that is mine"—the bed was not there then, but when we went the last time there was a bed brought back—I only saw a small portion of the things; I did not see the pianoforte.</p>

I was with her, and assisted in removing the things to No. 17, Clare-court—we asked Mrs. Burnstein how it was that the lock was not done—she said that it should be done—there was a little common latch, just enough to fasten the door—the very last time I was there, which was three days previous to the removal, I asked Mrs. Burnstein if she would make up the account of rent, because we should like to pay her—she said that it was no difference; it could go on for six months, as her rent was paid up to that time—I went there again, three days after they removed, the neigh<lb/>bours said it was, and found the house shut up—that must have been 1st or 2nd June—I made inquiries in the neighbourhood, and went and told my mother that they were gone—I did not go with her to the house next day;</p>

On 26th July I saw that the doors and win<lb/>dows were all fastened, and went to bed between 12 and 1 o'clock—I was the last person up—about 5 o'clock in the morning I was called up by the police, and found the doors and windows still secure, but there is a partition in the middle of the passage, coming out from the wall, which instead of being in its proper place, I had to push back—it was not in the same state as when I went to bed—it is a door and entrance to the shop by day, and at night is pushed forward to form a partition—it comes from the wall in one solid piece of wood, and separates the shop from the passage—it was partly across the passage—that would enable anybody who was in the passage to get into the shop—it goes from the floor to the ceiling, and runs on castors—it is larger than that dock—the staircase window on the first land<lb/>ing was closed when I went to bed, but I do not know whether it was bolted or not—I observed some little cakes of mud on the sill on the inside in the morning, like what would come off the sole of a shoe, but the window was shut down—the street door was open, and a door of a little passage leading into the kitchen, and communicating with the outside of the house—by open<lb/>ing that door you can get into the passage, and out of the house, or out of the window up stairs—the inner door, out of the shop into a passage, was also open—if a person succeeded in getting through that window they could get into the shop, by moving the partition, but not through the door with<lb/>out breaking it—it is like a street door key latch, when it shuts, it fastens, and cannot be opened without a key; but this was opened from the shop—on going into the shop I found that all the cushions and patent leather were gone—my brother has identified them, they are worth 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was no appearance of violence to that door—about an inch and a half of candle was left burning—the landing window is rather high from the ground inside,</p>

On 27th July, about 4 o'clock in the morning, I went to the rear of the prosecutor's premises, and found some steps standing against the back wall which led to the first floor landing—from that wall anybody could easily get to the window—I examined the window, and found a small piece of candle on which persons had trod, and some dirt on the window sill.</p>

On 27th July, about 3 o'clock, I was aroused by the barking of my dog—I got up, and looked out at the window over into a court, and saw a man, whom I believe to be Smithers, with several parcels of goods—he was in a private passage, leading to a public house—he was packing them one on the top of another, as if arranging them to be taken away—they were large parcels with brown paper round them, and looked like cloth or woollen goods, but I could not see what they were, because they were in paper—I put my trowsers on, went down with a light, went out at the street door, round the corner into the passage to the man, and said, "Halloo, what game are you up to here?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "I know better than that"—he made a spring to get by me—I seized him by the collar, we had a slight scuffle, and he got away, as I had no shoes or stock<lb/>ings on—I followed him two or three yards, and hallooed "Police! stop thief!"—it was twilight out of doors, but dark in doors—about 10 o'clock in the morning I went up to the police station—two men were brought out, and I said, "To my belief, the short man is the one who I had the encounter with, that was Smithers"—his dress and everything agreed with my descrip<lb/>tion—I have not the least reason to doubt it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Summers Defence</hi>. On 27th July, I arose from bed at 7 o'clock to look for work, and went to ask for a job of work at the new bridge that they are building at Westminster, but could not get one; I got up to Paddington at 8 o'clock, and met John Smithers a little after, and we went both of us as far as Maida-hill for another job, but was refused; on our road back we were met by a man about 20 minutes past 9 o'clock, that asked us if we wanted a job; we told him we did, and he said that if we went as far as No. 3, Exeter-street, we could get one, as there was some goods there that a man wanted somebody to carry away; we never saw the man before and have not seen him since; we went, and we saw the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> at the door, and we asked him if he was the man that had some goods to be carried away; he said, "Yes," and we went up stairs with him; he then said that if we carried those goods as far as Oxford-street, we should have 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when we got there, and he said that he would not have wanted us, but he had had his <hi rend="italic">cob</hi> out all night, and he had just put it up, as he could not keep it any longer; while we were considering his proposal, three policemen in plain clothes came up and said, "You must consider yourselves prisoners on suspicion of stealing this cloth;" we both said that we knew nothing about it; don't you think that had we been the men that stole the cloth, or even knew that it was stolen, we would have locked the door or made some resistance, but we did neither; four policemen then took us two, and we went to the station house; the policeman, No. 10, stopped in the room with the cowman; it is my belief that, from what was said before the Magistrate, he stopped back in that room to get the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to put it on to our shoulders, and if he did he would get off; another thing that looks strange is, that the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> heard the charge booked and we did not, but were called in by the Inspector ten minutes' afterwards, and were told that we were charged on suspicion of stealing the cloth; we were then locked up till 1 o'clock, when we were taken before the Magistrate; on our first examination, the baker that is against us now was not there; we were remanded for eight days, and then he came and gave his evidence; it seems very strange, from the evidence that he gives, that he was not there on the first examination; and from what I have learnt since, I believe he is nothing more than a made witness, for had he seen anything that excited his suspicion, he would certainly have come up the first day; I certainly think that the man that sent us to the house to get the job, must have been in some way connected with this affair; I hope that you will get this case thoroughly examined, as I think the police have got the affair together, because they did not catch the people that did it in the fact; it is a made up thing against me on account of this girl, Rose Carpenter; I kept company with her, and sergeant Hazledine seduced her, and threw her on the town; I had a woman at the police court to prove that I was</p>

               <p>sleeping in her room on the night of the robbery, that I went to bed at 10 and got up at 7 o'clock the next morning; she is a hard working woman with a family, and if I had brought her here, her children would have been starving, and I had no money to pay her.</p>

I got off the bed, and took the strap; I struck her with it, and cut her head; she said, "That is what I wanted, now I will give you in charge."</p>

I said, "I do," and I called the station master—I kept hold of the prisoner, and he was taken to the station—there were other persons near enough to have received the watch from him, supposing he had had it.</p>

I went to the prisoner's house to summon him on the complaint of William Forrest, on 18th July, about half past 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening—I found him near his residence, coming along the road—I said to him, "Russell, I have come about stabbing that man"—he said, "Come in, and I will tell you all about it"—I did not make use of any threat or promise—he said, "Forrest came to me this afternoon with a warrant; he poked his knee in the door; I tried to get him out; I was sharpening a saw with a file, and I poked his knee two or three times to make him take his leg away."</p>

I paid in cash, and this acceptance of yours—you got me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Smith, and you said you had had some practice in a lawyer's office, and you would be able to execute my legal business—you executed a writ on James Smith for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the expenses were 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—you got the money—you collected other money, and brought it home—you appeared honest to this time—you said you had spent this money—that was before I gave you into custody—I asked you what you had done with the money—you said you had not a copper left—I did not call on your wife, and promise her that if you would return I would not do anything to you—I said you had better return, and, if you had not spent all the money, you might very easily make it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachmaker, in Great Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, in business with my father and brother. In Dec., 1853, the prisoner came to our place, and hired a brougham, for about a month, at five guineas and a half—I had known very little of him before; I had heard of the name when he was a partner with a man named Little—we had bought a brougham of Little and Norris two or three years before, and I believe it was the same Norris; but I cannot be positive about that—he had the brougham away, and returned it on 30th Jan., that was five weeks and a half; he paid five guineas and a half—on 2nd Feb. he had it out again, according to a letter of his, to hire for a short time; this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I believe the prisoner came himself on 2nd Feb., I cannot say for certainty that I saw him—I received this letter on 30th Jan.—I know his handwriting—I have seen him write, and have got his writing to an agreement—I believe this letter to be his writing—this came on 30th Jan., and on 2nd Feb., I believe he came or sent, and fetched the brougham out—I have no recollection of seeing him in particular that day—I ordered it to go in consequence of that letter—we had no bargain for the hiring, more than this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>; "Dulwich, Jan. 30th, 1854. Gentlemen, I shall feel obliged if you can let me have the brougham again for a few days, as I have one in with a broken spring; the other I will see you about")—that refers to another brougham that he had out on Feb. 17th—we did not hear anything more about this brougham till some time at the latter end of the year, when we traced it as having been sent to the Pantechnicon—I think that was in Dec.—we found it had been at the Pantechnicon, but was sold to Mr. Allen, a coach maker, of Long Acre—we found it there, and sued him for it—on 17th Feb. the prisoner had another brougham on hire for twelve months, according to agreement—(<hi rend="italic">This memorandum of agree<lb/>ment was here read</hi>)—he was to have paid 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he had the brougham away—he left a dogcart as security instead of paying the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 23rd Feb. he fetched the dogcart away, we sent to him to do so—he then paid the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that was the only money we received from him—we heard about the second brougham first, somewhere about July—the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not in part pay<lb/>ment of the first brougham—we found it was sold to Mr. Hillyer, a stable</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Pantechnicon, in Belgrave<lb/>square.
