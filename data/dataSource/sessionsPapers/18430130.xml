                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Judgment-office of the Court of Queen's Bench. I produce the book in which judgments are signed in the Court of Queen's Bench—I have an entry of a judgment signed in an action of Watts against Wittenbury, on the 27th of August, 1842.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you make the entry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Mr. Barlow, the first clerk, did—I can swear to his handwriting—I am the second clerk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you always present at the signing of judgments in the judgment-office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am in no other office—I am in the habit of signing judgments—I am always in the habit of being in the office when they are signed, unless I might be called out—Mr. Barlow is now in attendance at the office—I can fetch him—this judgment has since been set aside on a Judge's order, dated 16th of September—this is the order—I did not sign the reversal of the judgment—it was struck out by Mr. Barlow—I will not undertake to say that I was present when it was struck out—it is very likely the judgment-paper might be signed by me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing I want to sign judgment at your office, I bring with me a piece of paper called a judgment-paper, do I not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in this case it would be necessary, and we copy from the judgment-paper into the book—the book is a copy of the judgment-paper—we make the entry from the judgment-paper—a judgment-roll is also brought—we merely require an <hi rend="italic">incipitor</hi> on that—we stamp the judgment-roll—the contents of the judgment-paper, and the judgment-roll are identical—an <hi rend="italic">incipitor</hi> on the judgment-paper, and an <hi rend="italic">incipitor</hi> on the judgment-roll is all that is required—we sign judgment on that—we always ask for the judgment-paper—that is our authority, because we write on that—we stamp the judgment-paper—we mark the day of the month—we stamp the judgment-roll with the same stamp that we stamp the judgment-paper with—the impression is "Queen's Bench Judgment-office"—it is the stamp of our office—we make the entry in the book from that paper, we take care to have it correct from the judg-ment-paper—they do not always go to far as the amount on the judgment-roll</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300008"/>
               <p>—the judgment-paper contains all that there is in this entry—I do not think it contains more, generally speaking—the entry would be a copy of the judgment-paper—it is copied from it—in the body of the judgment-paper they do not always have the name of the town attorney, therefore we take the name of the attorney who signs the judgment—when final judgment issues we should give a number—we want that on the judgment-paper—we do not care about its being on the roll—the number-roll is asked for, and the num<lb/>ber is placed on the judgment-paper—we have a docket-roll, and the attorney would ask for a number-roll, I write his name over the number, and he takes the judgment-paper—every term we have a docket commencing with No. 1, and going up as high as 5000, that enables me to get at these records afterwards—to the best of my knowledge executions are issued in ten cases out of twelve without the judgment-roll being filed—I believe, in order to procure execution, it is requisite to produce the judgment-paper, but I do not belong to that office—it is not necessary to produce my book to get exe<lb/>cution.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The judgment-roll, in the first place, has the seal of the Court of Queen's Bench on it before it is written on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, before it is completed—judgment-rolls are sold by a particular stationer named Dun-combe—I believe he is appointed to sell them, in order that they may be all of one size—he sells them to different stationers—I should not stamp them unless I saw his mark on them at the time, which is, "Delivered by Dun-combe," or something to that effect—I do not recollect exactly, but I know it so well, seeing the name of the gentleman, it is so constantly under my eye—the Exchequer-rolls are very much larger, and have "Exchequer-office" on the top.</p>

               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And the striking out of the words "taxed and," do you believe that to be your striking out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I inserted the figures "3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that again, and say, from the knowledge of your own handwriting, whether you have now any doubt whether that word, "agreed," was written by you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have a doubt as to the word "agreed," but I should not like to swear it—it is not the usual character of my handwriting—I should not suffer any one else to introduce writing into orders drawn up by me—I should not like to say that the word was introduced since the order was issued, but yet I have a doubt—I should not like to say positively—on look<lb/>ing at it more closely, I believe that the figures "3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." are mine—I have a doubt as to the word "agreed"—I am not positive—I do not know that I should have entertained a doubt had not my attention been drawn to it—these orders are printed forms, leaving a portion in blank to be filled up—it is the</p>

               <p>

                  </hi>. I am first clerk in the Judgment-office—the act of signing judgment consists of copying the venue, the plaintiff's and defendant's names, the sum judgment is signed for, the costs, if there are any, at the time, and the attorney's name who signs the judgment, who is the plaintiff's attorney—it is copied into this book, which is called the day-book of the office of the judgments, and other entries—it is generally called the judg<lb/>ment-book—I signed the judgment in the cause of Watts against Wittenbury—I afterwards struck it out, by virtue of a Judge's order—this is as it origi<lb/>nally stood, "London. John Watts against James Wittenbury, for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. debt, and 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. costs. Judgment on promises pursuant to order"—London is the venue—Watts and Wittenbury are the plaintiff's and defendant's names—it is signed by S. H. Williams, on the 27th August, 1842—I struck out the words, "pursuant to order"—that was entered by authority of a Judge's order—we do not copy the Judge's name—the words I wrote before I struck them out, are "J. T. a.," that is for "assumpsit," either on promises or the case; "p.," for "pursuant;" "t. o.," for "to order"—that imports that the plaintiff's attorney brought a Judge's order at the time—the judgment was signed on the responsibility of the plaintiff's attorney—all judgments are signed on the responsibility of the plaintiff's attorney—I have since then struck out the whole of that with my own hands, because they gave me the order to look at, and the order said it should be struck out—I have no doubt this is the order on which I struck out that judgment—we took possession of the order, and filed it in the office—I did not put any mark on it when I exe<lb/>cuted</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Portions of the evidence given by the prisoner were here read, of which the following is a narrative</hi>:—"I am a clergyman of the Established Church, and a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. I am officiating at present at St. Peter's, Queen-square, Westminster—I have had that church three years last Oct.—I am licensed by the Bishop of London to serve that church—I am the brother of the plaintiff Miss Bailey—my father lived at Belfast—he died in June, 1841—I had been acquainted with Robert Smith the intestate nearly for the last ten years—my father gave me a letter of introduction to him when I first came to London—some money transactions took place between us—this memorandum will prove when—there were none before that—yes, there was one item that occurred be<lb/>tween him and me—he gave me 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he lent me 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1832—it was repaid by my father—I first saw Mr. Robert Smith relating to my sister's money shortly after I came to London, in 1808—I was away from London prior to 1838—I was at Tun bridge Wells several years—I had communication with him as to my sister's property, not in Tunbridge Wells, after I came to London in 1838—I was absent on several occasions between 1832 and 1838, at Tunbridge Wells principally—in the year 1838, I was directed both by my sister and father, to make inquiries as to an investment for her, principally by my sister—I mentioned to Mr. Smith that my sister intended to come to London to reside here, and that she had several monies she wished to have invested in town, and wished to have his advice as to the best mode of investing them, especially in reference to government securities—he replied, 'that he himself would be her banker, as my sister and her father knew his opulence, and his wealth, and his safety'—that is what be said, and he would give her more for the monies than government—he recommended at the same time that a rent<lb/>charge should be purchased for her on some property in London, and he pro<lb/>mised to look out carefully for a suitable rent-charge, and such monies as she deposited in his hands would be immediately forthcoming when such a rent<lb/>charge was found—I communicated the matter to my sister—she assented to the proposal, and the monies were then almost immediately forthcoming, and shortly, very shortly afterwards, the monies came gradually—I paid monies to him from her—an account was kept of that, both by myself and Mr. Robert Smith—this is the account book I had—in 1838, Nov. 5th, 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced—1839, Aug. 1st, 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—1840, June 1st, 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—1841, Jan. 10th, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on Aug. 12th, 1841, 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the last, that consisted of a small sum of money I paid into his hands, and a further sum as interest which he paid me, and which I refunded to him—32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was cash, and 142<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the interest—that I paid back to him to be considered as principal—that makes up a sum of 2,875<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the 'I O U,'</hi>) the morning this was executed, I saw Mr. Smith at my own house—it was the 12th of Aug. 1841—that was the day I paid the 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300021"/>
               <p>a settlement, according to this memorandum book—he signed the settlement—he kept a book—I am aware that corresponding entries were made in his book—I saw them, and his book is similarly signed—when this settlement took place he said my sister should hare a security—he said he would give my sister a written security—he expressed himself as being in a hurry then, but said, as there was service in chapel on that evening, he would bring it to me there ready—I attended the chapel on that day, and saw Smith—it was Thursday, the 12th of Aug.—I saw him in my vestry—he came into the vestry, and gave me this, saying, that he had written an acknowledgment for my sister's money—being disappointed as to the nature of the security, I made some objection to it, to the omission of the interest at 4 per cent. as arranged that morning, and I think I also mentioned I expected there would have been a bond—he then expressed some anger at any doubt being cast upon him—this is not on a stamp—I think I also mentioned that there was no stamp—it all occurred in five minutes' time, before the service, conse<lb/>quently it was hurried—he also added that from my personal knowledge of the whole transaction, no written security was necessary—he said it would give validity to it if the gentleman, the clergyman who was present, and myself would put our names to it—that was Mr. Nickson—Mr. Nickson was there on duty—he preached for me that evening—he attested it at Mr. Smith's request—we both attached our names—these are our signatures—this is his, and this is mine—(<hi rend="italic">pointing to them</hi>)—I saw Mr. Robert Smith two or three times after that—the first time, as a friend in London advised me them I urged upon him to give a bond—that was in about a week or a few days after—I personally saw him—he did not seem to like my request for the bond—he would not give a direct negative—he said be would give, as he had done before, a promissory note, and he gave me this, the note in question—he brought the stamp, without any writing upon it, to my house, on the morning of the 9th of Sept.—at his request I wrote the promissory note, and the lat<lb/>er passage at his own dictation—the latter passage is 'with 4 per cent. in<lb/>terest thereon from the above-mentioned date, for value received by me in cash advanced by her on loan to me at different periods, as by settlement this day'—I wrote those words at his dictation—he signed it in my presence—I asked him to have some other person present to sign it—he said he did not wish to divulge his affairs to the world, and at his request I signed my name as a witness—a small balance of interest was paid then—the arrears of in<lb/>terest that was due on this 'I O U'—I have a memorandum of the sum—it was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I again spoke to him about the bond—he said he would give a letter by which he would bind himself to give it if required—he was again in a hurry, but said if I would write him a letter giving him instructions what to write he would certainly sign it—I wrote a letter, this is it—it is entirely according to Mr. Smith's instructions—I wrote a letter for him, and sent it by the penny or twopenny post, saying on the fly leaf, that I had an engagement in that district in that part that evening, and I would call on him about seven o'clock—in the course of the evening I did call—he handed it to me at his door ready signed—I adverted to a mortgage, but he said he would sooner throw up my sister's money altogether than be annoyed with mort<lb/>gages Mr. Robert Smith was not often in the habit of attending my chapel—he did occasionally—he was not a stated member of my congregation—I do not know the very day he died, it was some time in Sept—Mr. Nickson is dead—he died about the same period of time, I cannot say to a day, I think the latter end of Sept., or the commencement of Oct.—there is the attestation.</p>

I advanced on Nov. 5th, 1838, I received from the hands of my father—he was then living at Belfast—he inclosed it to me in a letter—I received it by a remittance—it was in Bank-notes, generally, I think Bank of Ireland—I took no memorandum of them whatever—I have not got the letter covering the remittance—I did not take any particulars of what the notes were which I delivered to Mr. Smith—not of how much were Bank of England, and how much were Bank of Ireland, or the amounts; no particu<lb/>lars whatever—I handed Mr. Smith over the identical notes precisely as I received them—he adverted to various family things at the time; I cannot remember them—he spoke of his high respect for my father, his knowledge of him, and so forth—I forget what memorandum or security I took in 1838 for the 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. except by reference to my memorandum-book—I want the me<lb/>morandum book and 'I O U'—that was delivered up to the late Mr. Smith on the 23rd of Dec., 1889—I received the interest on the sum, which I have already stated, before the next transaction occurred—the first entry was made in this book on Nov. 5th, 1888—this book was begun at the time—the entries were made at the time they purport to bear date—the acknowledgment I took from Smith for the advance of 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Nov. 5th, 1888, was an 'I O U'—on the 23rd of Dec., 1889, he had paid all arrears of interest—there was no interest between Dec., 1839 and Aug.—not between Nov. 5th and Aug. 12th—I received interest on the 28rd of Deo. 1839, and on the 1st of Aug., 1839, I gave him the further sum of 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got that in the same manner—a remittance by my father to me, by Bank-notes—generally all the monies were Irish, sometimes there were English notes among them—the entries in the book were made from time to time according to the date they bear—they were generally Irish Bank-notes, but some English Bank-notes, and I always handed over the particular monies I received—I took no par<lb/>ticulars at the time any more than the former—the voucher I took on that occasion is expressed in the book, an 'I O U'—my sister was in Ire<lb/>land at the time—this is my writing, with the exception of the signatures—it is, 'In an agreement, this day, Mr. Smith gives Miss Bailey his note, on demand, for the above 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at 4 per cent, and he also paid in cash to her, up to this date, 23rd Dec., 39'—that is the only document—the note is not in existence—it was given up to him—that note was given up on the morning of the day on which I received the 'I O U' from him—the 'I O U' on the separate paper, I think, allow me to look at the book, (<hi rend="italic">looking as it</hi>,)</p>

               <p>this note of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. mentioned in the memorandum to have been given on the 23rd of December, 1839, was given up on the receipt—the date is the 12th of August, 1841—the note was given on the 23rd of December, 1839, and given up on the 12th of August, 1841—I received the 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. interest from Mr. Smith I have already adverted to—that is the only amount I have ever received from him—I think I gave him a voucher for that—it was his own book that I signed, a book with a very few leaves, evidently not a book that he used in his business, a book specially for the purpose of my sister's account, not a book of the same character and description as this—it was an 8vo or 12mo size, bound in dirty leather—it contained no entries of other matters than those relating to my sister, that I observed—I received the 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. interest at the date of that book, in December, 1839—I came to a settlement with him—the book was the only document between us, that I know of—he then put both the 'I O U's there, and the promissory note, I think, it ex<lb/>pressed there—the words 'to her' in this promissory note were interlined by me at the time—the arrears of interest were paid to me in cash—I showed him the letters that I had received from my father and sister in refer<lb/>ence to this subject—I have not one of those letters now—I should observe that Mr. Smith had had himself some conference with my father on the sub<lb/>ject, but I do not know what; some correspondence, I should say—Mr. Smith corresponded with my father—his letters are not in existence, that I am aware of—I think I should know his handwriting, I am not sure, I should be pretty sure of it—my recollection has always continued the same on the subject—the next transaction is 1st June, 1840, that is, 'To cash to Mr. Smith, on his note to pay 4 per cent, interest, 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.'—I got that money in the same way as the preceding, a remittance from my father by letter, partly by Irish and partly by English Bank notes—no particulars were taken—I always handed them to Mr. Smith in my own house—all the money I advanced to him was in my own house—I think the book says the voucher I took for that sum was a promissory note—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the book</hi>)—yes, his note—another note for 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was handed up, returned to Mr. Smith the same day as the 'I O U' of 1841, the last one, was given—that was on the 12th of August, 1841—I counted the Bank notes I handed to him—the Irish and English Bank notes I handed over to him precisely amounted to the sum I have mentioned—I never got one of the Irish notes changed, and what proportion was English and what Irish I cannot tell—they came to me in halves, by two remittances, a half at each time—I pinned them together—I never put my name on the back of any of the notes—I never thought of it at all—I cannot tell you the amount of any one of the Irish notes forming the 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were all large sums—the general sum was a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the next transaction was on the 1st of January, 1841, entered in the book in this way, 'To cash to Mr. Smith, on his 'I O U,' to pay 4 per cent, interest, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.'—I had an 'I O U' that was returned in the same way—we came to an adjustment on August the 12th—it took place at my house—my sister was at that time in Ireland—I met him a few days after that settlement, as I was going in the direction of the British Museum—the date when we met specifically for business is given there, according to this book, the 9th of September—we had a settlement on the 12th of August, 1841—we next met to transact business on the date of the promissory note, the 9th of September—the settlement took place on the 12th of August at my house—I next saw him in the evening, to get the 'I O U'—we met in the vestry-room—the name of the friend in London who advised me to require a bond is Mr. Payne, he is now dead—I am sure of that—he was a private gentleman, he lived in Jermyn-street—he resided there constantly for years</p>

               <p>—he died some time last August—he was not a professional man—he was a private friend of my own—I did not advise with any professional man about the security for these large sums for my sister—the promissory note was given at my own house in the morning, and the 'I O U' in the vestry in the evening, at different dates, as expressed in the documents themselves—I sug<lb/>gested that a more pleasing security should be given than an 'I O U,' and he consented to give the promissory note—the 'I O U' was retained when the promissory note was given—I suppose that must have been through an inad<lb/>vertency, and besides that, here is the letter of the 9th of September—no person was actually present in the room with me on any of the occasions when I paid any of this money, though I have learned since there was one in an adjoining room—I cannot say there was any one present who saw me pay the money—I have adverted to a circumstance, which I presume will come out in evidence, that there was a person present in an adjoining room, there being folding-doors, so as to hear what passed—that was the maid-servant, Laxton, who I have spoken of—she heard what passed—she did not hear through the folding-doors—I believe they were open, as 1 have expressed myself—she was, in fact, in the back part of the room, which communicated by folding<lb/>doors, and they were open, so that I should suppose she had a perfect oppor<lb/>tunity of seeing all that patted—she said so—I was then living at No. 7, Lower Grosvenor-place—it was in the back room I paid the money—she was in the front room—the sums I have mentioned were paid at my different residences—I saw Mr. Smith a very few days before his death—I think ten days, perhaps—I have a doubt of any person's handwriting, except I acutually see them write, but I cannot say I have ever felt any doubt in my own mind of Smith's handwriting—I applied to several persons, after Mr. Smith's death, to see his handwriting; one person I particularly remember, a Mr. Bealby—I borrowed papers of him in order to see Mr. Smith's handwriting—perhaps I may have aaid to Mr. Bealby that he was an illiterate man—I ad<lb/>verted to the rumours that were about him—I never told him I understood Mr. Smith could not write his name, not in so many words—upon my solemn oath. I could not have said in any form of expression that I understood Mr. Smith I could not write his name—I have not seen Mr. Bealby in Court to-day—I did not say to him that I understood Mr. Smith was an eccentric man who had left a large fortune; that he was a very extraordinary man, and could not write his own name, nor to that effect—I have no recollection of expressing surprise on Mr. Bealby telling me he could write his name, for he had done business with him, and had got his writing in his possession—I will posi<lb/>tively swear I did not—I did not say to him in effect I should like to see his handwriting as a cariosity—I asked him purposely for his handwriting, as I have in other instances—Mr. Bealby, at my request, fetched down papers in his handwriting—I told him I wished to show them to a friend, not as a curiosity, but, I think I said, to test his signature—I did not say a word about having his handwriting—I hinted at having knowledge of Mr. Smith, and I said that a relation of mine had many transactions with him, in a very general and superficial way—I asked him for the papers to show to a friend, but not as a curiosity—I kept the paper that he lent me with the handwriting upon it a very few days, perhaps two or three days—I did not Speak of Mr. Smith as a person utterly unknown to me except as an eccentric character from public report—I kept the papers a very short time, two or three days, I should think; it might be another day—I returned them immediately—this is one of the papers I borrowed of him with the signature—he showed me this other, at least he showed me something like it—I cannot say it is the precise one I borrowed—I showed them to Miss Walker, my sister-in-law, and a</p>

               <p>Mr. Brown, a clergyman—he lived off Oxford-street, in a street leading out of Oxford-street, I cannot remember the name of the street—he was not a clergyman fixed in London, he was staying for some time on a visit in town, an old friend of my family, to whom I mentioned all the circumstances—he is a clergyman without any office—I cannot tell where he is to be found—he is an Irish clergyman, I think, of the University of Dublin—perhaps he is in Eng<lb/>land perhaps at Cheltenham now—last January was the last time I saw him—it was at my own house—he is a person of independent fortune, has no fixed residence, and has not had for many years—he is not attached to the Univer<lb/>sity except as an ordinary graduate—I do not know at the present time when is his residence, except at Cheltenham—I have not seen him since last Ja<lb/>nuary—I have not corresponded with him—I showed him the paper in my own parlour, and at the same time showed him these papers, the documents of my sister—he recommended me to look at the writing, in consequence of something particular he had observed in the documents themselves—it was in January I saw him last—I saw him on the 10th of Oct. in the last year, when that circumstance occurred of showing him the different documents—he recom<lb/>mended mended me to get some other handwriting, because there was something par<lb/>ticular in the documents; if you must know it, it was a discrepancy he ob<lb/>served in the signatures, between the 'I O U' and the memorandum—book; I mean a discrepancy in the three signatures, the signature of the 'I O U' and the two signatures in this book—I was consulting with him on the matter, what should be done—he asked to see the documents I then had in my possession—he himself remarked the discrepancy—he recommended me to go to several places, and, if possible, to get what was certainly his real signature, to see if he varied bis handwriting, to get his acknowledged handwriting—I went to seve<lb/>ral people for it; I do not think I can remember their names—very recently I have inquired of a Mr. Gibbons, of Mornington-crescent, where his property is—at the time when my friend wanted to compare them I went into two or three shops, as an urgent case, to know if they had any commercial transactions with the late Mr. Smith—I went in as a stranger to strangers—I remember I went into an iron-shop in Seven Dials, but I cannot remember the name of any person I applied to, further than that I did go into two or three shops at Mr. Brown's suggestion—the person said he knew nothing about him, and had no<lb/>thing to do with him—I applied to Mr. Gibbons, of Mornington-crescent, and through him to Mr. Lewis—I am quite sure I got no other handwriting, after the death, than these documents—I got no specimens of Mr. Smith's hand<lb/>writing but from Mr. Bealby—Mr. Gibbons is a private gentleman in Morn<lb/>ington-crescent—he lives there now—I do not know who Mr. Lewis is—I got Mr. Gibbons to apply to Mr. Lewis—I referred to him in the same way—I said to Mr. Gibbons, or rather to his family, for I did not see himself, that it was very desirable to have as many documents as possible—I got none from Mr. Gibbons—his daughter applied to Mr. Lewis—I know nothing of Mr. Lewis, except as Mr. Gibbons's family mentioned him as a gentleman of high respectability—I cannot tell who he is, except a private gentleman, for I never saw him—he lives at No. 12, I think Crescent-place is the name, round the cor<lb/>ner of Mornington-crescent—I applied to Mr. Gibbons on that subject a few days ago—I have not personally made applications for specimens of his hand<lb/>writing between the time of my application to Mr. Bealby and my application to Mr. Gibbons—the solicitor in the cause has—I always wrote to my father how I disposed of my sister's money, lent to Smith—I have not one of the letters which I wrote to him, stating such a transaction—my father died in June last year, I am one of his executors—I did not see any of my letters to my father, telling him I had lent Mr. Smith my sister's money—my father left an immense mass of general correspondence, but I did not see any among</p>

I paid to Mr. Smith in August—I paid him 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in positive cash—the difference be<lb/>tween 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the interest he paid me—he paid me in sovereigns, at my own house—I think he had a purse—I did not observe—he paid them to me, and I handed them back again—he counted them down to me—as my father was dead, I got the money for that from my sister—when I was in Ireland, she wished to have some little matters in London connected with her mourning, and she gave me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns—I cannot say that thirty-two of those identical sovereigns were paid over to Mr. Smith, for I had money of my own—I returned from Ireland on the 1st of August—I did not give my sister tiny voucher for that 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say that 1 wrote to her to tell her I had adjusted her concerns with Mr. Smith, and had got his note for 2,875<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I inclosed that promissory note in a letter to her, but I think I hardly mentioned or adverted to the fact—I know I transmitted it to her—she has not got the letter that conveyed this note from England, so as to show it existed at that time—that was one of the first posts after the 9th of Sept.—I only sent her this note—I do not remember that she answered, acknowledging the receipt, except that she had received my letter of such a date—I have not that answer—she was writing to me almost every day about family matters, and no doubt I was in my mind satisfied, from her adverting to the receipt of a letter of such a date—I do not say literally I did not mention that I had sent it, but I keep no copies of letters—it is very likely I said, 'Inclosed is Mr. Smith's note'—very likely I did—my sister came to England in the latter end of January, or the commencement of February, in this present year—I wrote to her to return the note—that letter is not in existence—she inclosed it immediately—that letter is not in existence—I have looked carefully for all those letters, but I could not find it—I looked for it immediately upon hearing of the death of Mr. Smith, it being necessary, I conceived, to demand the money—I think I got it back by return of post—I do not know whether Mr. Smith kept large sums of money by him—he never adverted at all to his private affairs, except that he generally spoke of his opulence, his properties—I heard of the fact of Mr. Smith's death, I believe, the next day—I did not read it in the newspaper—I was passing through that street, and I noticed some persons at the door, I was attracted by their manner and conversation, went and stopped for a moment, and they told me that the old man who had</p>

I know Dr. Bailey—I first spoke to him when he came up to me in the Brompton-road—I have been a mason's labourer a long time; then, getting old, I took to selling fruit, and I was selling fruit at the corner of Brompton when Dr. Bailey came to me—I had never seen him till he came up to me there—I did not take notice when it was, but as far as my judgment goes, it was about the 1st of October last—he at first said, "It is a fine day"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "How do you get on with your work?"—I said, as well as I could, but not</p>

               <p>so well as I wished—he asked how I was situated—I said I had a large family, and the eldest helped the youngest—he said, "Have you been long in London?"—I said, "Between nineteen and twenty years"—he said, "Are you in any way experienced in a law-suit?"—I said, "No, I am not, I never liked it, or any one that was given to it"—he said, "What made me ask, I had a law-suit in hand three months ago, and I was defeated for want of one witness; the opposite party had three witnesses, I had hut two, and so I was defeated; will you become one?"—I looked at him, and <hi rend="italic">admired</hi> what he said, and stopped for ten minutes—I said, "Yes," to see what was his motive for asking me the question, he never having seen me before—he put his hand into his pocket, gave me a shilling, told me to call at his house the following day at ten o'clock, at Caroline-street, Coleshill-street, No. 73—I called next morning, and saw him in a room in his house—he began to tell me what I should do—he said, "Mr. Smith's counsellor will attack you very close, and do you know what to say?"—I said, "I do not know what to say"—he said, "Well, I will write it down for you; can you read?"—"I can read," said I—he took a paper, and pretended to be writing,—whether he was writing or, not I cannot say, but he had a pen and ink over a paper—he was on the other side of the table—he read it for me, and told me to read it myself, which I did—he said, "Well, take it home, get it by heart"—I should know the paper again which he gave me—this now produced is it (F)—no one but me saw it—I did not let friend or foe see it till I gave it to Mr. Smith—Dr. Bailey had taken down where I lived when I called at his house, and four or five days after he called at my house, and told me he wanted me to go down to St. Mary Axe, and he gave me a note to a solicitor of his—I took the note there, and Dr. Bailey came in five or six minutes after me—he told me every thing I was to tell his solicitor before I went there—I told his solicitor more than I can recollect now—I did not mind to keep it in my recollection since that, there were a good many words in it which I did not think anything of—I re<lb/>mained with them as much as three quarters of an hour, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after this did you see Dr. Bailey again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell you; to tell you the truth, I only wanted to get rid of him, and his business did not take the least effect on my mind—he called at my house twice, and brought me up to Hyde-park-corner, that I might not forget it—he talked to me about what I was to say—he called on me once when I was in bed—I think it was about half-past eight—I dressed and came down—I fonnd him in the house—he told me he wanted to speak to me outside—I went out—he said he particularly wanted me next day, about eleven o'clock, at the Exchequer coffee-house—every time he called on me he gave me a shilling—he gave me a shilling, and I did go to the Exchequer coffee-house, and what I had said at St. Mary Axe, was all written down before me by another solicitor, I be<lb/>lieve he was—he asked me to read the paper—I told him to read it himself—he read it to me—I told him it was right—then they told me to go over with a young lad who was there through Westminster-hall, before a Magistrate, and my flesh crawled on my bones, and I shook.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well, did you refuse to swear it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did refuse, I would not do it for a million of money—I could not do it—as far as my judgment is I received in all of him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he promised to give me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>time they met with me—that was for bringing me over to hit office to ask if what they heard of me was right or wrong—that was before Dr. Bailey was taken—it was a good bit after I was at the Exchequer coffee-house before I opened my mind to my countrymen, and told them—I think it was seventeen days—I have lodgers, and my two boys work—I sold fruit after I was at the Exchequer coffee-house for about three weeks, but not down to the present time—my wife was unwell, and I and my family got as<lb/>sistance from the parish—all I have received since I was at the Exchequer coffee-house was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day, for five or six days, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I came over to Mr. Flower's office, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more one day at Bow-street—as I had no money I asked Mr. Smith for the price of a penny-loaf, and half-a-pint of beer, and he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is all I have received of their money.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say after it was read over, "It is most true, most correct?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said that it was right, and then put my name to it—when I was at Bow-street, I made sure that Dr. Bailey wrote the paper he gave me, but though his character, and what I hear of him, I cannot be sure of any thing he took in hand, but he bad the pen and ink over the paper, and I made sure that was the paper, and told the Magistrate it was his hand<lb/>writing—it was what I got from him—I have been a merchant before I came to this country—I used to travel with tobacco and whiskey in Ireland—I never got into trouble about tobacco or whiskey—I swear I never was before a Magistrate in all my born days, only one time when I was tipsy—I was a mason's labourer in England four years ago—I left it off except occasionally, but I worked for a Mr. Smith, six months in Five-fields—I sometimes carried the hod, and sometimes navigated for Mr. M'Intosh in the City, and laying pipes down—that is sixteen years ago—when I got work within the last four years I did it—when I do not, I do the best I can, and sell fruit—I do any work I am able to do, and could get plenty if I could run the ladder—I do not carry on</p>

Smith, in the Five-fields making up plaster for liming hair—when I got work I did it—I never went on messages, or as a porter—I was questioned before the Magistrate, by the gentleman behind you—I did not d----n his eyes—he asked me a question five times—I told him I had answered him five times—I will not swear I did not d----n his eyes—if I did there was more people in the room than you to hear it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not know whether you actually saw the signatures, or merely saw them write on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I only saw them write on it—after that was done, I left the vestry, and went into a pew of the chapel—Mr. Smith came out about a minute after me, and came into the same pew—Dr. Bailey read prayers that evening, and Mr. Nickson preached—Mr. Smith and myself remained during the whole of the service—after the service was over I left the chapel, and Mr. Smith overtook me at the Park-gates which part off the Birdcage-walk—when he overtook me we had some conversation together—I asked Mr. Smith where the money was to be put—he said it was some monies that was sent over by Miss Bailey, to be put into his hands, and it was a good thing for her, for if not she would fool it all away—I walked home to hit own door with him, No. 12, Great St. Andrew-street, Seven-dials—I then re<lb/>turned home—I did not enter his house that evening, I parted from him.</p>

Vivian and Sons, Paul's-wharf—on the evening in question I gave the cheque, for safety, to another clerk, named Chalklin—I received it again from him next morning, and then, by Mr. Twining' sinstructions, gave it to Mr. Nash—I afterwards received some money from Mr. Nash—I put up the change, which was the difference between the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd and the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque in a piece of paper—the prisoner did not come for the change—after having sealed it in an envelope, and directed it, I left it myself at No. 28, Nottingham-place, I saw a person named Penn there, and left it with him—the goods have been received back from the wharf, at which they were left—he came with, the cheque about half-past six o'clock, after banking hours.</p>

On Tuesday night, Jan. 10th, I went to bed about half-past twelve o'clock, my niece came up stairs and shut the staircase door—I told her we did not generally shut that door, but it did not signify—no one opened it again—I then went into my own room, shut the door, and went to bed—about two o'clock I heard a noise in the kitchen—I afterwards heard a noise against the door of my room, and afterwards beard a noise in my room—it seemed to me to be on the drawers very near to my bed-head—I sat up in bed to listen to the noise, and saw the figure of a boy or man by the side of my bed—as he was passing along I said, "Who is in ray room?"—I spoke twice, and then heard the person rush out of the room, and something sound as if it touched the edge of the door—I heard a creaking substance passing by very quickly—I afterwards heard a noise in the kitchen—I saw a light shine on my window-curtain during the time the person was in my room—it was not by that light I saw the figure—it was very moonlight, and there were lights in the street—I could see the figure very well—in the morning I found my chamber door standing wide open—I called one of my young people to me, and I then went down stairs—it was somewhere about eight o'clock—I cannot tell exactly—it was before eight—I went down into the work room, and found a cash box there broken open, that had been on my drawers when I went to bed—when I heard the noise in the night I dared not get up, I was so frightened—I had nobody near me except one person who was in rather a delicate state of health—I generally place both my cash boxes on my drawers before going to bed, but this night I put the other containing gold and silver under the bed, and that remained undisturbed—the cash box that was on the drawers was broken open, and about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper taken from it—I had seen it last when I went to bed, on my drawers—I had locked the coppers up my<lb/>self just before going to bed—I generally keep one cash box for silver and</p>

I am married—I was on a visit to Mrs. Gardiner, who is my aunt, I was up last, about a quarter of an hour after her—I saw every thing secure in the kitchen—the window was fastened with an inside shutter, and I believe with a bar—I did not put it up myself, but I saw that it was secure—I was the last to close the staircase door that leads to the kit<lb/>chen, from the staircase to my aunt's bedroom—the kitchen is on the first floor—there is a staircase below the door, and another staircase above it—I slept in the adjoining room to my aunt, over the kitchen—I saw my aunt close her door, and then I closed my own—I heard a great noise during the night, but not being accustomed to that neighbourhood 1 did not think it anything particular, as there are perpetual noises in Whitechapel all night—I live in the country.</p>

I fastened the kitchen window with a bar—I got up about eight o'clock in the morning—I found the kitchen window shutters a little apart, the bar taken out, and lying on the dresser—there was a pane broken a long while before—there was no fastening at all, and the window could be pushed up—it was a sash window—it was down when I went to bed, and in the morning it was open—anybody could have got in through the window by opening it—they could pull the shutters apart afterwards—there is a bar inside, but they could easily push the shutters a little apart, and pull the bar down—the window is big enough for a person to get through—the person must have put the shutters to again—I heard nothing in the night.</p>

I was on duty in Hounslow-road, in the parish of Heston—about a quarter past twelve o'clock in the night, I heard horses galloping in the field where Limpus keeps his horses—I got over the gate into the field, and walked along the hedge, about 100 yards—the horses ceased galloping—I stopped, and saw the prisoner leading one by the top of the mane—he stopped when he came opposite me—I said, "Halloo, what are you doing with that horse?"—he said, "I don't know, I am going to have a ride"—I said, "You must ride with me to the station"—he had not got out of the field—the gate was off one hinge—I took him in charge—the mare galloped away in the field—on the way to the station he said he thought of mounting the horse to gallop away to some place where he might lie down—at the station I was obliged to handcuff him to search him—I found on him a discharge from the hulks—he said he had been transported for seven years, but discharged at the end of four for good conduct.</p>

I know the prisoners—he lived a little below us, and kept a house—I do not know what business he is—I am sure he lived by himself, and not with his father—he is married—his father kept a chan<lb/>dler's shop—he did not assist his father—on Monday evening four weeks, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was going to get some beer for my father, and saw the prisoner and his father in his father's shop—I do not know what he was there for—there was nobody else there—the shop shutters were to, but I could see into the shop—the door was open, and I saw through the door—I was crossing the road, and saw them in high words—I heard high words from them both—I do not know what they were saying—they were speaking in a loud voice—I mean they were scuffling together—I saw the prisoner trying to get a knife from his father, and with that Mr. Richards stabbed the prisoner—the prisoner then took the knife from his father, and, said, "You have done it to me, and I will do it to you" and he then stabbed his father—I did not see where be stabbed him—the prisoner then went away—as he was going out of the shop door, the father took a candlestick from his side, and was going to hit him with it—the deceased's wife then came down, and led him into a room—I did not see how the prisoner used the knife when he stabbed his father—I saw him stab him, but I did not see where the knife went—I did not see whether it had any effect on the father—I was outside the gate—he walked, and his wife and Mrs. Hickman led him into the next room, one holding him by each arm—I knew the deceased by sight before—I saw him again on the Saturday after this—I went into the shop for something, and he served me—he seemed very well then—I did not see him again.</p>

I am the prisoner's brother—my father's name was Henry Richards—I saw him on Monday night, the 2nd of Jan., it was about half-past nine o'clock when I left him—he was then rather tipsy—I did not see the prisoner there, and saw nothing of the transaction—my father died on the 20th—I did not see him after this occurrence till the Sunday following—he ate a hearty dinner then, and drank some ale with me—he said he felt a little pain—I did not perceive much change in him—I did not see him again till the following Sunday, he was then in bed—I was not there when he died—he did not go about his business between that Sunday and his death—I did not see him out of bed between that Sunday and his death—the prisoner had previously served behind the counter for him, assisting in the business, but was not doing so at the time in question—I heard my father send in to ask him to go with some coals on the Monday—I did not see them together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called to the deceased on the 2nd of Jan.—I found a punctured wound in the upper part of the left side of the chest, made by some sharp instrument—it was about an inch and a half in length, and about four inches in depth, extending obliquely downwards and inwards, not a direct wound—I did what was necessary for him, and attended him until he died—I did not apprehend any danger at first—I heard that he went about his business, but I did not see him do so—I gave him strict direc<lb/>tions to keep quiet, because a punctured wound is always a dangerous wound—I saw him every day, and some times twice a day—he was always up stairs in his bed-room when I saw him—after I first saw him the wound assumed a very dangerous appearance, inasmuch as it never showed any disposition to heal—it was very insidious—there was low fever—I apprehended danger after I dressed the wound the first time, and came to examine it the second time, and saw no disposition to heal—he died on the 20th—I examined him after death—the cause of death was inflammation of the pleura, the covering of the lung, and of the pericardium, the covering of the heart, caused by the wound—I am quite sure the wound was the cause of death—by the Coroner's direction, I fitted this knife to the wound, and they exactly coincided in shape.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Webb, a cheesemonger, in the Edgeware-road. On Sunday, the 8th of January, I was in company with a person named Howard—I bad been to Dr. Vaughan's chapel at Kensington, and was returning from there about one o'clock—we entered Hyde-park by the Kensington gate—there is a public footpath there, leading by the barracks, which are on the left-hand side as you go into the park—I observed a sentinel there pacing backward and forward in front of the railings that separate the park from the barrack-yard—it was the prisoner—his sentry-box I think was inside—I saw none outside—I and Howard stopped there—we were attracted by the soldiers in the yard in their undress—they were sweep<lb/>ing—they had caps on which hung over the side—one of the men jumped on the stool (on which, I suppose, the soldiers sit) leaning on a spade, looking down, and the others were sweeping underneath him on some paved stones—when we stopped to look, the men in the barrack-yard called to the prisoner, "Send them on"—upon that one of them said, "Hit them with your car<lb/>bine"—I could not see who it was said that—the prisoner upon that said, "Go on," in a very imperative tone—Howard said, "I am not aware that we are doing any particular harm"—the prisoner said still more imperatively, "Go on, Sir"—I said, "I certainly shall not run away"—we had moved a few paces after he spoke the first time, and were proceeding slowly along—we were not within any part of the barracks—I was on the verge of the foot<lb/>path, which is about ten feet wide, the verge furthest from the barracks next the roadway—after I said, "I certainly shall not run away," the prisoner instantly knocked me down—I was in advance of him, going from him—I had my back to him—he came behind me, and struck me on the left side of the head, and I fell on my right side in the road—I was completely stunned by the blow—when I recovered myself I was bleeding dreadfully from the head, the blood was streaming in torrents—my hat was cut through both the outside and the lining—I bled very much indeed—the blood stained my outside coat, and second coat, my waistcoat, through my stock, shirt, and flannel shirt, to my skin—I was assisted to Mr. Morris's, and had my head dressed—I had not said or done any thing more to the prisoner than I have described, before he knocked me down.</p>

               <p>there was not sufficient room for it to stand—he was pacing backward and forward in front of the barrack gate, outside the gate—it was not at the barrack gate that I stopped, but beyond, nearer the Kensington-gardens gate—I was able to see obliquely into the barrack-yard—I was not immediately on the beat of the sentinel—I was a short way from the sentry-box, on the footway, and the sentry-box was inside—I was more than a yard from the sentry-box—I do not know the distance—we crossed the footpath to go in at Kensington-gardens gate, and stopped on the footpath to look at the sol<lb/>diers—I have told all that took place on this occasion—I made use of no expression besides what I have described—I said I certainly should not run away—I had said nothing befoie that—no remark passed from me or Howard to the soldiers—I did not say, "Let us stop here, and see these scavengers violating the sabbath, instead of being at church;" nor, "They have not been long up, they have got their nightcaps on"—I distinctly swear I did not—I will swear I did not use the term "cap" at all, nor did Howard—we did not continue using expressions of that kind for some time—the prisoner did not repeatedly request us to go on—he said twice, "Go on"—those were the only words that passed from the sentry to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not go on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I considered I was on a public footway, and we had not been on there more than a minute and a half—I had no particular reason for not going on—indeed, we were moving on slowly—I did not say, "Who do you desire to go on, you b----soldier? you may go on and be d----"—that is different from the expression which the prisoner imputed to me in the officer's room—it was, "I shan't go on, you b----soldier, go to h----"—I swear solemnly that I never used such words—I was not using any language of that kind when the prisoner struck me with the carbine—Mr. Smith was behind me—I had never seen him previously—when I was knocked down he came up, shook me by the hand, and said, "I saw the villain knock you down, and I shall be happy to help you bring him to justice," or some such remark—but I have an indistinct recollection of the words—I believe he gave me his name.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 8th of Jan., I had been with him to chapel, and about one o'clock, we were in the footpath leading to Hyde-park, by Kensington-barracks—as we went by, we observed the soldiers in the barrack-yard—the prisoner was the sentry on duty outside—he had a carbine—I and Fitch stopped to see the soldiers in the barrack-yard, as they had just come out of their stables with their brooms up—the footpath is very wide there—we were standing on the side nearest the carriage-road, the farthest from the barracks—as we were standing looking at the soldiers, the soldiers hallooed out to the sentry, "Send them on!"—another immediately told him to knock us down with his carbine—with that the prisoner came up and ordered us to go on—I said, "I am not aware that we are doing any harm"—he again ordered us to go on in a more imperative tone—Fitch replied, that he cer<lb/>tainly should not run away, in a very temperate tone—we moved on—I was moving on when the blow was struck—I was a little in advance of Fitch—I</p>

               <p>did not see the blow struck, but on turning round, I saw Fitch down in the carriage-road—his head was bleeding, his clothes stained with blood, and his hat cut—the soldiers did not offer to assist him in any way—I assisted Fitch, after he recovered himself, to the doctor's to have his head dressed—neither I nor Fitch did or said anything to the soldiers besides what I have stated, before the blow was struck—I never used any such expression as, "You b----soldier, go to h----," or anything of the sort, nor did Fitch, in my hearing.</p>

On Sunday, the 8th of Jan., about one o'clock in the day, I was in Hyde<lb/>park, near the barracks—I was about three yards behind Fitch—I was pass<lb/>ing along the public footpath, going the same way as Fitch and Howard—I could see all that took place between them and the prisoner—they stopped together—I stopped about three yards behind them, looking at the soldiers in the yard sweeping—when they stopped, I heard the prisoner say to them, "Go on"—they did go on, directly, about half-a-yard, not much, I should suppose—the men in the yard sung out, "If he don't go on, knock him down with your carbine!"—the prisoner immediately said, "Go on"—they did not go on, and he knocked Fitch down with his carbine—he laid hold of his carbine with both hands, and struck him over the side of the head—Fitch laid down—he seemed stunned, to me—I walked up, as quickly as I could, to lay hold of him—I said, "You are cut"—the blood streamed down his face—the prisoner turned coolly round and put his carbine to rights again—the blow started the ramrod—I was not close enough to see whether the blow started it, but I saw him put it down after—neither Fitch nor Howard used any violent or provoking language to the prisoner, previous to his striking the blow, nothing more than I did myself, turned round and smiled—no violence was committed by them to the soldier, or any abusive language used—they did not say, "You b----soldier, I shall not go on; go to h----!"—I was within three yards of them, and should have heard if they had.</p>

               <p>and Harris, who were in partnership—that partnership was dissolved about June last—I afterwards made an arrangement with Merritt, that he was to be made conductor, (taking him from the horsekeeper's place,) so that his wages on an average the year through would be about 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—before that it was 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was proprietor at that time of three horses and harness—in July I made an arrangement with him that the profits of the omnibus I ran with Harris would be 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I agreed he should receive 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—that his part of the profits should amount to 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, the year through for his services as conductor—I did not give him the slightest share or participation in the horses—I hired an omnibus to run from Ordnance Mews to the Bank—I was to pay the expense of keep<lb/>ing the horses, and the omnibus was to pay the expenses—a horsekeeper was hired, and five horses were devoted to the omnibus—the prisoner was to go with it as conductor—he lent me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in one instance, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in another—I paid him back again in Aug.—I did not borrow any money of him on the horses, nor authorize him to take the horses away-Cox was my horsekeeper—I carried on the omnibus from July to Jan.—I paid Merritt from the earnings of the omnibus down to 10th of Jan., and on the 10th of Jan. I learnt something had happened to the horses—on Saturday the 14th, in consequence of information, I went to the house of Pur<lb/>ser, at Lampton, about a mile from Ealing, and found him at home—I asked if he had any horses for sale—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Will you allow me to look at them?"—he said, "Certainly, walk in"—I went in—he showed me three horses—I immediately said, "They are my property—they were stolen from me on the 10th—I have a receipt to prove they are mine"—I described the party who stole them from me, and said I must demand them of him—he said he could not give them up—he had bought them, and then that he had partly paid for them—I said, "What have you paid?"—he said he could not exactly say—I said, "Whatever it is I will pay you, and take them away"—he said I could not do that—I said, "Then I must give you in charge"—I went and met Sergeant Jeeks, told him of it, and he went with me to Purser's, and then he said he had got the horses from Merritt, and partly paid for them—he would not satisfy us what he paid for them—I gave him in charge—I told him there was also a set of horse-harness stolen from me with "B" on it—he declared he had never seen them, and denied all knowledge whatever of it—the fourth horse which, I had not found then, was a grey mare—I told him four horses were stolen, and asked if he knew anything of the fourth—he said he did not at first—I took him to the station, and then he said he recollected Merritt and he had sold a grey mare to Hitchcock, at Greenford—I was about to have him locked up—he then said he was going, out with his wife to dinner, and had his horse ready harnessed to go, and if I would only grant him that he might not be locked up, the horses should remain on his premises, and not be removed, and he would not advance any money on them, nor part from them on any account, that Merritt was to call for the money on Tuesday, and if he did not call he would give up the three horses to me on paying 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which I said I would do—I asked if he would give Merritt into custody if he came—he said yes, if I wished it—I gave him orders to do ss—I went to his house on Tuesday with Ser<lb/>geant Thompson, and Merritt and his wife were there—I said to Purser, "I have come for the horses"—he said, "Oh, I have bought them since, and paid for them—I have the receipt in my pocket"—I immediately gave Merritt into custody—the three horses were taken to the station—I did not give Purser in charge till the Friday—the whole of the harness was found on the Wednesday in Purser's back room—they have my initials on them—Merritt</p>

In July last I was living in the same house as the prisoner Merritt—he is married to my step-daughter—Brooks is my son-in-law—he married my own daughter—I heard the arrangement they made at starting this omnibus; that they were to lay out equal sums of money to purchase horses, and different things connected with it—they were to hire an omnibus, and the expenses were to be paid out of the earnings—Merritt had purchased a mare of Brooks previous to the partnership, and it was agreed that this mare would be taken in at the same amount as he purchased it for—that mare was <hi rend="italic">swapped</hi> away—they never worked her, as she was a kicker—Harris and Brooks were in partnership before that, and they purchased her—they broke partnership—Brooks sold the mare to Merritt, and she was to be received back at the same amount as he sold her at—they changed her away—the horses they purchased were brought to the stable—I saw the horses, and heard them both talking together about what they paid for them—I heard Merritt say to Brooks the week before they broke partnership, that there was water running from the horse's eye—on the evening of the 9th of Jan. Merritt came to my room—Brooks was there—they both talked about dissolving partner<lb/>ship—Brooks offered to give Merritt 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and exonerate him from all the debts, which he said was 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he would also take him as stableman, and give him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—they were not quarrelling then—Merritt would not agree to the proposal—they laid out the property in two lots; one lot to consist of a horse, mare, and harness; the other, a horse and mare—they considered each lot worth 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they then talked about which lot each should have—I said, "It would be the fairest way for me to make tickets, and you draw for them, "but it broke off that evening—on the 10th they went to work again—Brooks went the first journey, Merritt the second, and Brooks the third, and when Merritt was to have gone again, he had gone away, and the horses too—I never heard Brooks call Merritt a servant during this transaction—they both considered themselves proprietors of the <hi rend="italic">buss.</hi>

                  </hi>. I keep a coffee and pie-shop in Ratcliff-highway. On the 5th of Jan.

Scott and Son's, St. James's-place")—on the 20th of January, at breakfast-time, I said to him, "At what time to-day will it be most convenient for me to go with you and cash this bill?"—he said, I should oblige him very much, if I would allow the account to stand over till the following Monday, and he would then draw his own money himself—I said, "Very well;" but in the course of the morning a young woman called on me, and stated something which he did not hear—at dinner-time I repeated ray ap<lb/>plication to him, to go and get the bill cashed—he said nothing then—after dinner, the young woman and her mother came to the house, and said, in his presence, that she believed him to be no better than a man who had passed a similar kind of bill on her—I do not know what he said to that—I said I thought she was deceived, I had no doubt he would put on his hat, go with me, and get the bill cashed, and prove his character good—he made no answer to that—I repeated it again, he still made no answer—at last I put my hat on, went to the door, and said, "Now I am ready, will you come with me?"—he then said he wished to speak to me—we went into the parlour, and all at once he said the bill was not a correct one, but be ex<lb/>pected to get a situation on the Monday following, and he would pay me, or endeavour to pay me, if I would wait till then—I said that would not do,</p>

He has a place where his horse provender is kept—the prisoners were in his employ—it was their duty to take the teams where they are ordered—on the 13th of January I told them to go to Fetter-lane, to work for Mr. Rook, of Bethnal-green—they were to cart gravel from Fetter-lane to Bethnal-green—they started a few minutes before nine o'clock—I saw them be<lb/>fore they started—Barnard had two horses to his team, and Kennett had two to his—each had to mind his own team—before they left the premises they went to the place where the provender is—I saw Kennett nil their note-bags with provender, and Barnard had two—they took the nose-bags out of the stable into the yard—they were allowed to take out what they did for the use of the horses—that would be a proper quantity for the four horses during the day—they then started, and in going out of the yard there were some grains in a truck, which had been brought in the night before—there was no objection to their taking the grains if they gave it to the horses—they had no business out of the road between Fetter-lane and Bethnal-green—their right road Was down Holborn, and through Smithfield—they had no business in Gray's-inn-road.</p>

               <p>Camden-town. On the 13th of Jan.

I have known Sear ten years, and always considered him an honest, upright man—I know this horse was his, I purchased it for him—he gets his living by his horse and cart, and removes goods—he has worked for me occasionally with his horse and cart—one of his carts was broken, and I suppose that is why he did not use his own cart on this occasion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to William Hollidge, of Stepney. On Friday morning I got up, put the parlour things in order, and got master's breakfast ready—I went into the kitchen, and left the table covered with a white table-cloth and a blue one—the parlour window is rather better than two feet from the ground—I heard the spoons, and cups and saucers rattle—I went into the parlour, and found the window up, and the table-cloth taken off—I immediately looked out of the window, and saw the prisoner running along the pathway (the window was shut when I left the pariour) the pri<lb/>soner was tucking the cloths under his arm as he ran—I could see the corner of the blue and red cloth as he tried to put it under his arm—I had seen him near the house about ten minutes before, when I took in the milk—I saw him pass the window several times the week before that, and am sure he is the man—I went to the station, and gave a description of him—the same day, about twelve o'clock, I was speaking to the beer-man, and saw the prisoner coming along within twenty yards of the parlour window—he jumped off the path, and ran along the road, when he saw me—the cloths were my master's property—he was about forty or fifty yards from me when I saw him going away—I only saw his back, but he looked behind him as he was going along, and I saw his face—I have no doubt of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant in the shop of Swan and Edgar, of Regent-street. On the 3rd of Jan. the prisoner came in about two o'clock, and asked to look at some black satin—I showed her some—she purchased one yard and a quarter for six shillings—she asked to look at kid gloves, and bought one pair—she then asked to look at some lace—I went to the place where the lace was kept, for one box—I brought the box to the counter—she looked at it, and purchased a yard and a quarter—she asked to look at some other—while I went for the second box I left the other on the counter—I came back—she did not purchase any from that second box—she asked to look at some Valenciennes lace—one box of lace was left on the counter while I went for the Valenciennes lace, and the other was taken away—I had to go about forty yards—I was away a few minutes—when I came back she purchased two yards out of the third box—she paid for what she bought, 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I offered to send the things home, which she declined—she left the shop—I then took the two boxes, and placed them on the counter before Mr. Little.</p>

Blackburn brought me two boxes of lace—the pieces in them had been counted, and the number marked on the box-lid—I did not mark them—in consequence of having lost lace we made a point of counting the num<lb/>ber of pieces of lace, and marked them on the lid—I opened the first box, and counted it—I found eight pieces short, and in the second box three pieces—two pieces in the third box, seven in the fourth, and four in the last box, altogether twenty-four cards from the five boxes—I and Mr. Hope followed the prisoner out of the shop—she went round to the left-hand side of the window, about two yards from the door, and turned round—then Mr. Hope laid hold of her, and brought her into the warehouse—from there I took her into a private-room—I went for a female searcher—I was gone about two minutes—I left the prisoner in the middle of the room, with Hope and the policeman—on my return I found a quantity of lace on the floor—I said to the policeman, "There are twenty-four pieces," which was the number I missed, and there were twenty-four pieces, containing about 300 yards, worth 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist my father, James Edward Watts, a pawnbroker, in Hereford-place, Commercial-road. On the 11th of Jan., about half-past twelve o'clock, I was in the shop—I noticed the two younger prisoners, Hurley and Powell, outside the window—(a day or two before this about four inches had been broken out of the corner of one of the windows, and we had put some paper across to cover the aperture)—I saw one of the younger prisoners, I cannot say which, with his hand in the window, taking three gold snaps out, and a silver piercer—he put his hand through the win<lb/>dow from outside—I saw the snaps remove—I had them in my view at the time the hand took the snaps, and then the two younger prisoners went away—Gill was standing about a hundred yards from the house—I had not seen him at all before the snaps were taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not said before that you saw something taken? and have you not given the names of the prisoners, and assigned to each what he did? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only the elder prisoner, Gill—I had not seen Gill at the window that morning, nor on any previous day—the paper was taken off from the outside of the window, and the inside piece of paper was burst.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not before said that you saw one of them (naming him) take something from the window, and that you afterwards discovered that it was the snaps? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my recollection, my Lord—this is my signature to this deposition—it was read over to me—I do not now know which is the prisoner Powell—I know Gill—he is the elder one—I did not give names to the prisoners before the Magistrate—if anybody has put down that I said I saw Powell take the paper away, and put his hand through the glass, and</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it is not true that you delivered two to your brother, and ran after the third? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I delivered two first; I took them when they came back to the window the second time, and then I ran after the taller prisoner Gill—I understand his name is Gill—I was not asked the name only before the Grand Jury—I did not find any thing on either of the prisoners—the property was found in a hole under a gateway, where I found the elder prisoner—he had been standing a hundred yards off, and he ran round a gateway—I do not remember saying I saw something taken—I allowed them to take them out, and they went away to the prisoner Gill, who was standing about a hundred yards from the shop—the two younger prisoners returned again to the win<lb/>dow, and one of them had got his hand in the window again—I cannot say which it was—I immediately went out and took the two younger prisoners, who were at the window—I took them into the shop, and left them in care of my brother—I immediately ran after Gill, the elder prisoner—when I over-took him he was concealed behind a gateway, three turnings down the Com<lb/>mercial-road, about a quarter of a mile from the shop—I brought him back to the shop—I then gave the three into custody to the officer—I did not pick up anything behind the gateway—the officer did—this is the property—I did not know either of the prisoners' names—I was not asked their names—they gave their names before the Magistrate, but I did not pay attention to them.</p>

I am master of the schooner <hi rend="italic">Elswick</hi>, lying in-the river—on the 11th of Jan., between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was in the neighbourhood of the Mint, near Rosemary-lane—I was quite sober—I had 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there were four "dragon sovereigns" among them, and 3 half-sovereigns, and two sixpences—they were in a bag in my right tide pocket—I met Cosgrove, and went with her to a room somewhere at the back of Rosemary-lane—I went into a room down stairs, and saw Lewis stirring the fire—I sent her for six pennyworth of gin—she returned with it, and we drank it—I was sitting on a chair—Cosgrove stood against me, and after that sat in a chair—Lewis was standing close to my knees with her hand on my shoulder—Dolphin came into the room, and turned her face towards the window—Lewis then said, "Wait a minute," upon that Cosgrove and Lewis left the room—I rose from my chair, and said to Dolphin, "Where are those two women?"—she said she did not know where they were—I put my hand into my pocket and missed my bag, containing this money—I instantly rushed to the door to look after them, and when I got there I could not see any one—I returned and saw Dolphin in the act of locking the room-door with a padlock—I told her I had been robbed—she said, "Where?"—I said, "In this house"—she tried to persuade me I bad not been robbed, that I was mistaken—I said I was not, I should take care of her—the said, "I was mistaken in the house"—I said, I should take care of her—she said she would wait there if I would go and look, or something of that kind—I found I could do nothing with her—I went to look out for an officer—I found an officer—I told him what had happened, and the amount I had lost—I went with him to Dolphin's house, and found the door pad<lb/>locked I returned two or three times in the course of the night, and found nobody there.</p>

               <p>—in consequence of that, I went to his house the next Friday—he was not at home—the door was locked—I thought he was gone to some friends—I went again three times that evening, but always found the door locked—I went again on the Saturday, and found it still locked—on Monday morning a parcel came to my house—it contained the key of his house—I went to his house with the key, and went into it—I went to the room in which my pro<lb/>perty had been deposited—the door was locked, the same as usual—I unlocked it with my key, and on entering the room I missed all this property stated in this indictment—I have seen the articles mentioned in the indictment, and I identified them as being mine—the prisoner had no authority from me to re<lb/>move this property, or do any thing with it—he had no business in the room at all—I communicated with my brother, who came off to London.</p>

I might owe 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to my brother, but I do not know—I do not keep the books—these goods were not removed exactly for the purpose of avoiding an execution for these debts—I was rather afraid of my brother, or of the Bank, at least—I might have told the prisoner that I wished these goods to be put into his house to avoid an execution that I ex<lb/>pected from my brother—that was not my only reason—another was that I had let part of my house—the Bank had threatened me with law proceedings—I partially removed the goods to avoid the threatened execution—I have never paid the prisoner with cloth when I owed him anything—I do not know that he told me he did not understand the law, and was afraid of getting into trouble—I will swear he did not—I do not recollect that he ever said so—I did not tell him he need not fear, I would make it all right—I do not believe his wife said so, nor that either of them did—I never knew from him that these goods had been booked at Deacon's warehouse, for London—on Sunday evening, the 15th of Jan., I saw a woman named Sarah Crawley at Newark, between six and seven o'clock, I went to her house to inquire—it was dark—there was a man with me—he had a bunch of keys—I bor<lb/>rowed a candle from Mrs. Crawley—she might have asked me who the man was—I do not recollect that she did—I might have told her he was a particular friend of mine, a Mr. Gibson—he tried the lock of the prisoner's door—we had asked leave first of the landlady—I sent for another man named Revell—we picked the lock, and went in—Revell picked it—I believe Mrs. Crawley paid the man for picking the lock—the prisoner had been very kind to me in opening the shop for me, and I gave him flannel, and several things—I thought I was indebted to him for what he had done—I think I gave him a</p>

               <p>coat to come up to London, about three weeks ago—he said he would come and work six weeks in London, till work was brisker, and then he would re<lb/>turn—I never told Mrs. Crawley that I had entrusted the prisoner's wife with the key, in order to remove the goods, nor any thing to that effect—the lock was picked, because they had taken the key away—they returned the key in a parcel with a note—I gave the parcel which contained the key to my brother—I employed the prisoner to teach my son the art of cutting—I gave him one waistcoat piece for that—I only gave him one—I paid him what he demanded—I paid him with this waistcoat—he was only an hour or two teaching him—he made no charge at all—I do not believe that my son brought the key of the room on the 27th of Dec. to the prisoner's wife—this is the first word I ever heard about it—the prisoner's wife might have removed some of these things from the room to my house—if she did it, it was by my directions or my son's—if I wanted them either to sell or use, I should have them again—she never got them unless I was with her—I do not know whether I ever went to the prisoner's house of a night to remove goods to my shop for the purpose of sale on the market days—I might fetch some—I will not swear whether I did or did not on the 12th of Jan.—if I did they were my own—I swear I never employed the prisoner and his wife to bring my goods up to London, or to remove one single article.</p>

I was in the street on Saturday morning, the 7th of January—I saw Ashley with the vice on his shoulder, about nine or ten o'clock, in Bowl-yard, going towards Belton-street, which leads into Nottingham-court—I know it was my master's vice—I went and told my master.</p>

The prisoners are customers at my house—on the 26th of Jan. they were in my tap-room the greater part of the day—they were there before I came down stairs, before ten o'clock in the morning—Brazier and Bates went away about ten minutes before six—Bristow had gone away about half an hour before them—Richards and Folley were left there, and I heard them quarrelling, as I thought—I went into the room where they were, I knocked my foot against a piece of wood, and had nearly fallen down—I asked what they had been doing—Folley said they had been dancing; and I found the floor was broken to the extent of about half a yard long, and about a foot wide—I looked down the hole, and saw a bottle in the recess where I keep wine, in the cellar under that floor—(there were two holes in the floor, but one of them did not go into the cellar)—a person could not go down the hole, but by putting their hands down they could reach the wine—I called Carter—he went down into the cellar—I went down, and missed three bottles of port wine—I knew they had been there before, because I had taken stock on the Wednesday evening, and this was on the Thursday—when I came back from the cellar Richards was gone—I said to Folley, "Some of you have been at my wine, tell me who it is"—he said, "I know nothing at all about wine"—I had been in the bar, and had not been in the tap-room for an hour or more before I found the hole—the last time I had been in the tap-room I did not perceive any hole in the floor—no one had been in the tap-room but Jeremiah M'Carthy.</p>

I was at the White Bear about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening, on the 26th of Jan.—I was called into the tap-room by Mrs. Meacock—there were Richards and Folley in the room—two holes had been broken in the floor—I could reach the wine which was in the recess from one of the holes—I went into the cellar, and found the wine had been disturbed—three bottles had been moved—two of them were gone, and had been emptied and put back, but not in its right place—I had taken an account of the wine the night before, and taken one bottle from that tier; and on Thursday morning, at nine o'clock, there were seven bottles on that tier, and I found only four bottles full of wine and one empty—after the floor is washed they throw sand on it, the sand runs through the cracks, and settles on the top bottles in that recess—the empty bottle that was in the recess I gave to the constable; and the other empty one that he had had got sand on it, the same as the one I gave him—I know the prisoners.</p>

I found him at the Five Ink Horns, Bethnal-green—I found on him five good shillings, fourteen keys, a box, and some lucifer<lb/>matches—I asked what made him run on the Thursday—he made no reply—on the 12th I went to Gray's, and received this shilling from Mason.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Harleyford-place, Kennington. I was formerly in business as a farrier and veterinary surgeon—I have known the prisoner for four or five years—he was in business as a leather japanner when I knew him—he became bankrupt in February 1841, or early in that year—previous to that I had advanced money from time to time to him to the amount of upwards of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as a security I had a bill of sale from the Sheriff, and a lease of the pre<lb/>mises—the prisoner was living at Pentonville prior to his bankruptcy—I had a man in possession—the messenger was withdrawn, and there was no further dispute as to his possession—the prisoner was notable to obtain his certificate, and I lent him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get it—the business was not carried on for a period of seven or eight months, and I kept the man in possession all the time—in Au<lb/>gust, 1841, an agreement was entered into between me and the prisoner—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it has his signature and mine to it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "Memorandum of agreement made this 19th day of Aug., 1841, between William Weedon, of Hertford-place, Kennington, gentleman, on the one part; and George Jenns, of Cumming-street, Pentonville, on the other part, as follows; that is to say, the said William Weedon having arranged to carry on the business of a patent leather japanner, as formerly carried on by the said George Jenns, he, the said George Jenns, doth hereby agree with the said William Weedon to superin<lb/>tend and manage the said business for the said William Weedon, and to employ his time therein, and to use his best endeavours to promote the same, at or for the salary or sum of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, to be payable weekly; and the said William Weedon hereby agrees to pay the said weekly sum. And it is lastly agreed that this agreement may be put an end to by either of the parties giving to the other one month's notice in writing. Dated this 19th of August, 1841."—the bu<lb/>siness was at Hoxton Old-town—Rudge, my son-in-law, was a clerk in this business—I did not know anything of the business—what led to the agree<lb/>ment was, Mr. Jenns said 1 had nothing to do, if I would carry on the busi<lb/>ness he thought it would be an excellent opportunity for Mr. Rudge to have</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember the execution being put into the prisoner's premises at Hoxton by your father-in-law? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I remember the one at Pentonville; he took possession of his private house there, and I believe obtained a bill of sale from the sheriff—he kept the pro<lb/>perty perty, and I believe the other creditors got nothing—that was probably a month before the prisoner was made a bankrupt—Mr. Jenns was the person who understood this business, but could not obtain his certificate—I believe there was an understanding that the business should be carried on in Mr. Weedon's name till Mr. Jenns obtained his certificate, but I was not present—it was intended, when he got his certificate, that I should go into partnership with him—I cannot say that it was Jenns's business carried on in the name of Weedon till Jenns got his certificate—the bills that were made out "Weedon late Jenns,"were during the time till he obtained his certificate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That was before the last quarter; but since that, look at these bills for goods sent in—is not Mr. Jenns charged by all these for articles sent in to the concern? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they are so—I think he got his certificate in June or July last year—I presume Mr. Jenns, having been a bankrupt, was a poor man—I cannot an<lb/>swer whether he took from the business, from time to time, such sums as he required for his support and maintenance—my orders were to pay him so much a week, which was principally 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he took out a sum which varied; and there was an overplus of what was paid to him, above what was paid to me, of 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that account taken on this footing, that you looked through the books, and saw what had been taken out of the concern by him, and what by you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, just so—it appeared that in the course of the year I had re<lb/>ceived 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had received 136<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—that was the total amount of cash that he had had from time to time—we first charge him with the total cash he had in the year, and next with sundries, 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these were not articles that had been sent in by Mr. Weedon; for instance, a wash-house was built, and there were ropes, and poles, and fanlights, and other things for the wash-house, for Mr. Jenns's convenience, Mr. Weedon charges him with that, and for the rent, hire of furniture, firing, &amp;c., 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is all the items on the debtor side—on the other side is put what I took out, 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by promissory note on demand—in settling this account I was actiug as the agent of Mr. Weedon—the account was settled between Mr. Weedon and Mr. Jenns, and Mr. Weedon then received a promissory note for 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the effect of that would not be to put me on equal terms, in point of cash, with the prisoner; but that bill, if paid, would make Mr. Weedon and Mr. Jenns on equal terms—having that balance secured by the bill—we then balanced the account from Aug. 1841 to 1842—the account showed a deficiency of 253<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and Mr. Jenns's acceptance was given for one half that loss, which the concern showed.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember, in Dec. last, some terms of arrangement being pro<lb/>posed by you on the part of Mr. Jenns to Mr. Weedon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, by the re<lb/>quest of Mr. Weedon—I do not remember Mr. Weedon saying anything about taking away the books on that occasion—I have heard him say he would take away the books—I have not heard him say he would get in all the monies, take the books, and Mr. Jenns might do as he liked—he had it in contempla<lb/>tion to take the books away—I have not heard him say, he charged Mr. Jenns with felony to frighten him into a settlement—I have heard something of the sort said, in Mr. Weedon's presence, by Mr. Hobler, the attorney for the pro<lb/>secution—he certainly said, that by putting him into prison he would then come to terms—he did not at the same time tell him that Mr. Jenns was his partner, and there was no pretence for calling this embezzlement—I cannot say that Mr. Weedon said nothing of that sort—Mr. Hobler said, by putting him in gaol he should bring him to some terms—this was at Mr. Hobler's office, a week or ten days previous to the prisoner's being taken up—Mr. Hobler is not my father's regular attorney—he has got half a dozen—there is a Mr. Dixon who advises him—I think Mr. Dixon was nor present at this conversa<lb/>tion—I had been present before, when this was the subject of conversation—I certainly have heard Mr. Dixon tell my father-in-law that Mr. Jenns, on his own statement, was a partner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am constable of the East and West India Dock Company. On the 27th of January, I saw the prisoners at the Export-gate of the East and West India Dock with a truck—Dennis Mahoney gave me a pass for a quantity of old broken wood and hoops, and empty tins, &amp;c.—I examined the truck, and found, under the wood, a barrel of pitch—I asked Jeremiah Mahoney what it was, he said it was an old empty cask—I sounded it, and said it was not empty—Jeremiah Mahoney said, "No, it has got a little bit of pitch in it"—I found it was full of pitch—I said, "How do you account for this? there is no pass for a barrel of pitch"—he said, "No, I can't read, but it is included in the &amp;c."—I said, "They would never give you a pass without including the pitch"—M'Carthy and Donovan said they knew nothing of the circumstance, but they were employed by the two Mahoneys.</p>

On Thursday, the 5th of Jan., I went to Mr. Austin's mill with a sergeant and a constable—I got there about twelve o'clock—Mr. Austin had then gone to market—I waited till half-past one—I then saw a horse and cart driven by Lutman come down the Green-lane, into the Green-man-road, leading to Mr. Austin's mill—I saw him go to the mill with his horse and cart—he got out of the cart, and went to the mill-door—I could not see from where I was placed, whether he went in or not—in a few minutes he came out, and took his horse round to the window, at the end where they deliver goods—after a few seconds the aft-door was opened, and a miller came to the door—Lutman was in the cart, and received a sack full of something, placed it at the bottom of his cart, and then received a second sack full of something—he then took an empty sack, laid it upon the top of these sacks, and drove off, not in the same direction that he came, but still that was through Cowley, the main-road, to his home—he had not come the main-road—directly I saw him drive away from the mill, I ran after him, and overtook him—I laid hold of his cart, and said, "Lutman, what have you in your cart?"—he said, "Beans"—I said, "What quantity?"—he said, "Two sacks, one of split beans, and one of whole beans"—I said, "You have just got them from the mill, have you not?"—he said, "No, I received the sack of split beans at the mill, but the sack of whole beans I brought with me in the cart"—I got on the cart, and took him—I told him he need not say any thing to me, I should have to mention it again—we rode some distance, and before we got to the station he said, "I don't mean to say that I took the beans to-day to the mill; I took the two sacks there some days ago to be split, and to-day, finding they had not split both sacks, I brought them away"—on opening them at the station, I found one sack of whole beans, marked "John Saunders," and the other of split beans, marked "Bourn, Brentford"—this is a sample of split beans from Mr. Austin's mill—here are the split beans and the whole beans I found in Lutman's cart, and there were a few small black beans at the mill, but none of these sort.</p>

I was watching at Mr. Austin's on the 5th of Jan.—I was in his counting-house from eleven till half-past one—I saw Lutman drive a cart to the mill-door—he came into the mill a short time, then went out, and drove to a loading-window, where they are in the habit of receiving corn from the mill, and there I saw Read deliver two sacks to Lutman, and he drove away—Otway stopped him when he got two or three hundred yards—I afterwards saw Lutman with Otway—I</p>

A few minutes before nine o'clock, on Friday evening, the 27th of Jan., I was in plain clothes, in the New Road, near Lower Lisson-street—the prisoners were all three standing together, about a dozen yards up Lower Lisson-street—they were talking together—I went up Lower Lisson-street to meet them—they separated about a yard apart, and came to meet me—I went on, and passed Crain, who came first—I then passed Carrall, with this piece of lead on his left shoulder—it was not a dozen yards from Mr. Cabbell's house, which is No. 14—I turned sharp round, and followed Carrall—Foggerty was behind me—Crain got first to the New Road, looked right and left, and then beckoned Carrall to come on—Crain went towards Homer-street, to the left, and Carrall went straight across—Foggerty said to me, "Master, what is it o'clock?"—I crossed, took hold of Carrall, and said, "What are you going to do with that lead?"—he said, "My mate behind just picked it up, and I am going to take it to the sta<lb/>tion-house"—I took hold of him, he dropped the lead, I sprung my rattle, and the others ran away—Crain towards Homer-street—I did not see where Foggerty went—I took Carrall to the station—shortly after another officer brought in</p>

               <p>Crain—Carralle then said that Crain had picked it up—" No," said Crain, "I did not; it was the other picked it up, who is not here"—in halt an hour afterwards Foggerty was bronght in—I am positive he was with the others, and said, "Master, what is it o'clock?"—I went back about half an hour after, and saw some mortar disturbed at No. 14, Lower Lisson-street, on the wall, by the side of the door—that attracted my attention to examine further—I waited till the constable came up—I knocked at the door, and a female an<lb/>swered me—I ultimately went on the portico, and discovered a lot of lead had been removed—this piece of lead, which I took from Carrall, was folded in the same form as it is now, but I unfolded it to match it with the lead—there were three pieces of lead remaining on the portico—they had been folded, but have been unfolded since—I unfolded the three pieces and the one I took from Carrall, and applied them to the portico, and the whole four pieces formed the whole of the cover of the portico—there was no doubt about it, and it had been recently cut—I live in a house nearly opposite No. 14, and saw this lead was perfectly safe at four o'clock that afternoon—I put my head out when my bell rang, and saw the lead.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother, Sarah Avila, a widow, in Mile End-road, where she carries on the business of a pawnbroker—the prisoner lived as shopman in her warehouse for about two years, and has left for three years. On Sunday, the 8th of Jan., Sarah Gale, our servant, gave me information, when I returned from chapel, about one o'clock—I went to the station for a police-constable, and went with him over our premises—we have four warehousemen—in the second warehouse I found a ticket for a coat, and a ticket for a pair of hose on the window-seat—they related to articles which had been pawned at our shop—several of the bundles had been disturbed, and I missed a silk handkerchief from one of them—I went into the shop, and missed three watches from the plate-board; and ultimately I missed eight more watches from the drawer under it—this shop is connected with my mother's dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stebonheath, or Stepney—altogether I missed eleven watches, which were worth abont 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bolts of the door which opens from the shop into the street, had been drawn, and it was only on the latch—the garden at the back of our house is next door but one to the Vintners' Alms-houses—there is a wall between our garden and the Vintners'—a person could easily get over that wall and into our garden—the back door of our house is usually unfastened after day-light, and was unfastened that day—when we receive property in pledge, it is en<lb/>tered in a book, which is in my writing—I have referred to it, and the pro<lb/>perty which is here produced, exactly corresponds with it—this knife, purse, and handkerchief belonged to William Bryant, who is in our employ, and the other things were in pledge at my mother's—I know these four watches—I have compared them with the description we have of them—they were in our house on Sunday, the 8th of Jan.—on the Saturday following I went to Mr. Hall, a pawnbroker, and saw the prisoner there—he had on a coat, a waistcoat and a handkerchief, which I believe to be those lost from our ware-house—they were just like them—I have no doubt they were them, but I could not swear to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I went to Oporto in 1832, and remained there some years—on the 16th of Dec. last I obtained these orders from the Portuguese Com<lb/>missioners—on the 16th of Dec. I saw Jeremiah Healey on the subject of selling these warrants—he was recommended to me by a man—I saw him on the day I received them—he was attending the place where the Commissioners gave these warrants—he gave me his address, and said if I disposed of them to any one he would give me as much as any man—on the 19th of Dec. I went to his house with my daughter, between nine and ten o'clock, with these warrants—I was asked up stairs—I sat down, and saw the two prisoners—they asked if I had got the bills—I produced them—I said, "I called on you to ascertain the amount you will give for these bills"—Jeremiah Healey said, 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound—the gross amount of them is 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and there is five per cent, on them till they are paid—I did not agree to sell them—he handed them back to me, and to the best of my belief I put them into my pocket in my coat—I would not swear that I did—I was then coming out, and Jeremiah said, "I hope you will perform your contract to me, to let me have them sooner than any one else"—he put his hand on my shoulder, and we talked some time—I then bade him good night, and next morning I missed them—I went to him that day, and he said he knew nothing of them—I went again on the 21st—he said he knew nothing of them—I heard no more of them till Ben wood called—I went with him to Healey's—Jeremiah said he would not give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the chance of my payment, and I had better write to the Commissioners—in consequence of information I went to Mount-street—I found Jeremiah there—I called him on one side, and said I was given to understand he had these bills, and he had best give them up; I did not want to have any more to do with him—he said, "D—n your eyes, do you think you are going to <hi rend="italic">bounce</hi> me out of them?"—Catherine was with him—she said she knew nothing at all about them—I called a policeman, and gave them both into custody—these are the orders.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in High-street, Shadwell. The prisoner was in my employ about sixteen months—in consequence of something in the week previous to the 9th of Jan. I agreed with Mr. Barrett to mark a half-crown—about ten o'clock on the 9th of Jan. I went down into my shop and asked the prisoner to account for what money he had taken—he said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a pair of boots, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a pair of shoes, which had just gone out—I said, "Has there been nothing else sold?"—he said "No"—I said, "You sold a pair of slippers for half-a-crown at nine o'clock"—he said, "Yes, but you had the money for them." I had been called down at ten minutes past nine, and there was a customer in the shop, who bought a pair of slippers for half-a-crown—I had got that half-crown—I said, "Yes, but you sold a pair exactly at nine"—he denied it—if he had sold another pair at nine, and bad received half-a-crown for them, he was half-a-crown short in the money he had accounted to me for—I told him that when I came down at five minutes past nine I lifted up the lid of the desk, and in a back place, where money never was kept, I saw the edge of a half-crown—he said, "I suppose you put it there"—I said, "No, but I will tell you how it came there"—I told him for a long time I had suspected he was robbing me, and for the last few weeks I was quite sure of it—he denied it—I said, "Have you a half-crown about you?"—he said, "Yes"—he then threw down two half-crowns and two shillings on the counter—I told him that the half-crown with which the slippers were purchased was marked, and on taking up one it was marked—I sent for Mr. Barrett, and in the prisoner's presence asked him if he knew that half-crown—he said yes, it was the one marked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Home and Chaplin, carriers. I live in Seymour-street, Euston-square—the prisoner was in their employ on the 28th of Dec.—I remember leaving the railway station at half-past seven o'clock that morning with the prisoner—we had a cart—there were parcels in the cart—the prisoner drove the horse, and I sat by his side—I remember a box being put in at Euston-square station, directed to Mr. Stereker, Budge-row—I sorted that with other parcels—the direction was nailed on with five tacks, and tied round with cord—it appeared to be a rather heavy box—the cart was driven to the Old Bailey—I remember there seeing the parcel—I left the cart to deliver a parcel in Prujean-square—I was gone about five or ten minutes—when I returned I found the cart was standing at Mr. Fenn's door, in Newgate-street—the prisoner was not with it, but standing at the corner of the Magpie and Stump—I asked why he left the cart—he said he left some one in charge of it—I did not see any one in charge of it—the prisoner and I then went to the cart—he asked if I would go and do something in Pater<lb/>noster-row, and I asked him to take a parcel to Fisher's, in Newgate-street—I left him in Newgate-street, and I took the cart to Paternoster-row—he ap<lb/>pointed to meet me at the corner of Queen-street, Cheapside—when I left him, he turned round to go towards the Magpie and Stump—when I got to Paternoster-row, I looked for the box, and it was gone—I had seen it in the cart when we stopped in the Old Bailey—after delivering the parcels in Paternoster-row I went to Queen-street, and saw the prisoner there—his brother and Cottrell were with him—I asked him whether we had not a parcel directed for Mr. Stereker, Budge-row—he said, "No, that was yesterday, or the morning before"—I said, "I think we had one this morning"—he did not go any further with the cart, he said he was not very well—he had had rather too much to drink, and he asked me if I would go with the cart—Cotterell was to go with me—it was the prisoner's duty to have gone through with the cart, and delivered the parcels with me—in the evening of that day I found, at the bottom of the cart, the direction of "Mr. Stereker, Budge-row"—I put it in the bottom of the cart again—the next morning I told the prisoner I had found a direction to Mr. Stereker, Budge-row—he said that was the name he had got one charged to in his book, and asked what I had done with the direction—I said I had left it at the bottom of the cart—he asked me to get it him—I told him I would, as soon as we got rid of some of the parcels—I found it the same morning, and gave it to the prisoner—he tore it up, and told me to swear that I never saw the parcel—on the Saturday I communicated this to my brother—I and he went to the railway station.</p>

On the 26th of Dec. eight shillings and three sixpences, marked, were given to me by my husband, about five o'clock in the afternoon—I cleared the tills, and put the marked money in—I left the bar—there was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in one till, and two shillings and two sixpences in the other—I saw Beresford, the inspector, in front of the bar after I put the money in—three customers came to the counter—I saw them served—I did not see what they had—after they were served, I ran to the tills, and there was no disturbance in the tills, and no increase—the silver was not moved—my at<lb/>tention was only drawn to the silver.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Furzefield-wood on the 4th of November with Gibbs—I saw a person, and in consequence of what Gibbs said, I ran after the person—he got out of the wood, but I did not lose sight of him—I over<lb/>took him—it was the prisoner—he had a stick in his hand—he struck at me—I put my arm up, and he knocked my hat off—I ran up to him, and got the stick out of his hand—I got behind him—he got a knife out of his pocket, and said, if I did not let go of him, he would run it into me—he struck at me six or seven times—I kept behind him, and got hold of his arm—Gibbs came up, and said, "Is it you, Philip?"—he said, "Yes," and then I let him go—he attempted to stab him, and I knocked him off—he said he would not be taken by anybody—he got out of the field over the hedge, took a brick and threw it at Gibbs—I saw Gibbs hit him on the arm in the field, and try to knock the knife out of his hand—after he got over the hedge, and threw the brick, I said to Gibbs, "It is not worth while to run the risk of our lives; you know him."</p>

I was going to my sister's, and saw the two prisoners running down James-street, one after the other, and no one but them—that is the first turning past the prose<lb/>cutor's—my attention was directed to them by hearing one of them say, "Go on, go on"—I crossed and stopped them both—Mercer said, "What do you stop me for? I was crying, Stop thief"—I went to the spot where it appeared there had been a separation, and I found one cigar on the pavement.</p>

On the 23rd of Jan., about half-past six o'clock, I was in the bar—Kelly brought me a keg—I said, "Who took it?"—he said, "Taylor"—I took it from him, and put it behind the bar—there was about a pint of peppermint in it—it was mine—I saw it that evening on a corner of a shelf inside the bar—it could be reached from outside the bar, from the staircase—it had a brass tap to it—I went for a policeman, but could not find one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor; until lately I was in partnership with Mr. Sutcliffe; we carried on business in New Bridge-street, Black friars—we were professionally concerned for the late Richard Constable—I believe our engagements with him commenced in May, 1838; he was at that time residing in Manor-street, Kennington—he had a life-interest in a place called Mount Pleasant, at Lewisham, at that time—I prepared his will—I cannot say when—he died on the 31st of December, 1840—this is the probate of the will—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—after the execution of his will I prepared a deed of settlement, by way of conveyance of his property; that must have been about Feb., 1839—I prepared the deeds on behalf of Mr. Constable—these are the deeds—I pre<lb/>pared this deed of the 1st Feb., 1839, and here is another of the 4th and 5th—they were prepared at the same time—I attended the execution of them—all these instruments assume to dispose of his real property—Mr. Constable was introduced to us as a client, by a Mr. Joseph Stanley—I do not know when Stanley died—from time to time, during Mr. Constable's lifetime, Stanley saw me on the part of Mr. Constable, about his affairs—Mr. Constable was very old and infirm—I have no doubt that Stanley came to me in July, 1840—he came, I think, in Aug., 1840, and gave me instructions about preparing a deed—I prepared the deed, in pursuance of written directions, which I believed were given by Mr. Constable—I had a letter, which I believed, at that time, to have been written by Mr. Constable—that letter was handed, with all Mr. Constable's other papers, to Messrs. Hale, Boys, and Austen, who succeeded us in the business—I am not attesting witness to all these instruments, only to these two of the 1st of Feb., and 4th and 5th of Feb.—I think I am acquainted with the handwriting of Mr. Constable—I have seen him write, and have bad frequent letters from him—I also attested his will in January, 1839, and a mortgage-deed, in 1838, the transfer of a mortgage—this is the letter which Stanley brought to me in August, as from Mr. Constable (<hi rend="italic">marked</hi> A)—in consequence of that letter I prepared the draft of a deed—Stanley brought me back the draft—it remained in my office till Dec.—I got it engrossed by Stanley's direction—this is the deed—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the deed charged to be forged</hi>)—it was engrossed on the 30th of Dec., 1840, and handed to Stanley on the 31st—I am quite sure of that—I cannot form any idea as to what time of the day Stanley had the deed from us—it was the last day in the year, and we closed our office rather earlier than usual that evening, but I cannot remember the time—our office opened at ten, or a quarter to ten o'clock, and closed, I should think, at four—at the time it was given to Stanley, it was not exe<lb/>cuted by any body—it had just come from the stationer's—I cannot re<lb/>member how soon I saw the deed again—it must have been a few days—it was brought to me by Stanley, and I rather think Stanley signed the deed in my presence, but I am not sure—when he brought it, it was executed as</p>

               <p>it now appears, signed by Mr. Constable, and attested, as to the signature of Mr. Constable and his daughter, by the prisoner—I did not see that done, it was brought back in that state—I cannot be certain whether Stanley signed it in my presence—I remember baring some conversation with Stanley about the deed—I think he signed it—he was a party to the deed—his signature is to the deed as a party to it—I know the prisoner—I do not think I saw him at all during Mr. Constable's lifetime—after his death, and the deposit of that deed with us by Stanley, I saw the prisoner at my office some few times—he came, relative to the Lewisham affair, and the affairs of Mr. Constable generally—he came from Stanley—he assigned Stanley's illness as a reason for his coming instead of Stanley—he told me where Stanley lived, when I was desired to go down and see Stanley at Mount Pleasant—I went down, and found Stanley there—that must have been in the summer of 1841—it must have been shortly before his death, which was in August, 1841—I remember the prisoner calling at my office while Stanley was ill, when Miss Constable was there, and I introduced them—I told Miss Constable that the prisoner was a nephew of Stanley's, and she said in his pre<lb/>sence she was glad at seeing him for the first time—after introducing them, I left them to talk by themselves—Miss Constable was very desirous of knowing the state of Stanley's health—before that I bad not looked at the deed with any atten<lb/>tion—I was not aware that the prisoner purported to be the attesting witness to Miss Constable's signature to the deed—on that occasion Miss Constable expressed herself to him as a person she had not seen before—something was said about Stanley's being ill—Miss Constable desired to know where he was to be found, and to be informed of his state of health from time to time—the pri<lb/>soner did not tell her where he was to be found—he did not give hit address, but promised to inform her from time to time of his health—I do not know what he said about the address, but it was concealed both from me and her—the forged deed remained at my office until Stanley's death—after Stanley's death, the prisoner called on me, and produced a paper, which he described as being Stanley's will—after I had read the will, and discovered that Stanley had been devising this gentleman's estate to the prisoner, I explained to the pri<lb/>soner, or to Mr. Jones, a professional gentleman, who was with him, that Stanley had no interest in the estate beyond the payment of a debt that was secured by this deed—at that time I considered this deed to be a genuine document—he produced the original will at the time—it had not been proved—I still re<lb/>tained the deed in my possession—I had a lien on it for costs incurred in the preparation—application was made to a Judge for an order to compel me to deliver it up, which was refused—my costs were something above 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I ultimately delivered up the deed without an order—I cannot give the date when the deed left my possession—it was delivered up on the payment of my costs due from Mr. Constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The application about that deed to the Judge occurred on the 1st of Dec., 1841? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Then the deed must have gone out of our hands a few days after that—I was not present when the deed was handed to the party—I had examined it before it left my office, to see how it was executed—at the time I parted with it to the prisoner it had the same attestation and execution to it as it has now—it purported to be signed by Richard Constable, Elizabeth Hollis Constable, and Joseph Stanley—at the time I introduced the prisoner to Miss Constable I had paid no attention to the mode in which the deed was attested.</p>

               <p>dare say I also received notes from him upon the subject of which I afterwards saw him—Miss Constable was living with her father at that time—I think he always wrote his own letters—I do not know of Miss Constable's sometimes being his amanuensis—I saw her frequently at the house in the course of my communications with her fathers, and he used to come on the subject of her father's affairs as well as Stanley—those visits of hers did not continue up to within a short time of Mr. Constable's death—I should say I saw nothing of her from Trinity Term, 1840, until her father's death-there was then a bill of foreclosure in Chancery with respect to the mortgage—this deed purports to be an arrangement for paying off the demands on Mr. Constable, and also paying off the mortgage—if that had been carried out, it would no doubt have relieved him from his embarrassments—it would depend, of course, on the value of the property, supposing it realised the amount, he would have the surplus, if any—I bad not been consulted by Mr. Constable himself as to the best means of proceeding to get out of his difficulties—the occasions on which I saw him were on business—Stanley lived in the house with him part of the time when I was doing business with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And Miss Constable too? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the last time I saw Mr. Constable must have been in the early part of 1840—I transacted his business myself-I drew the draft of this deed myself—it was settled by a conveyancer—I think the draft was ready to be perused in Aug., 1840—I did not go down to Lewis ham with it—I gave it to Stanley—I cannot say how long he kept it—I know the business stood over till Dec.—at that time the proceedings in Chancery could not go on-I declined patting in the an<lb/>swer—the cause stood still for that time—I have looked at all these signa<lb/>tures to the deed—I think this one of Stanley's I saw him write—I will not be sure—I cannot say how long it was after the 31st of Dec, 1840, that I saw the prisoner—I think the first time I saw him was in consequence of his having made a bill of exchange payable and lodging some money with us—I think it must have been some months after Mr. Con<lb/>stable's death-the deed has blanks in it—I was applied to by Stanley to perfect this deed immediately after I got it, after it was returned executed—I have never been applied to by anybody else to fill up the blanks—I told Stanley we could not supply these blanks unless we had the authority of Miss Constable-I got that authority—this paper (<hi rend="italic">marked</hi> B) purports to be dated Feb., 1841—at that time I had the deed in my possession—I saw Miss Constable after this letter was delivered, not repeatedly—I saw her very few times after receiving that letter, two or three times—I think I must have seen her in the summer of 1841, but I will not swear that—the blanks have not been filled up—I did not tell her I would not fill up the blanks—I never spoke to her at all on the subject of that letter—I did not ask Stanley to get her authority to fill up the blanks—I refused to do it-after this letter purporting to be Miss Constable's authority came, I took advice as to the propriety of stamping the deed and filling up the blanks, and found it would be injudicious-it was in consequence of that advice that I did not do so—here is a sum of 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. referred to in this letter—there had been a sum of about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid, which had been borrowed of my partner, not of the firm—that was paid by Stanley on the 24th of Dec, 1840—perhaps there might be interest on it-Stanley had borrowed 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Sutcliffe, and deposited the deeds of the Lewisham estate—he borrowed it as Mr. Constable's agent, as he assumed—the 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to my partner—I did not make the slightest reference to this letter when I saw Miss Constable-I did not expect there was any thing</p>

               <p>to he said about the deed—I had no suspicion—I never accounted to Miss Constable for not filling up the blanks after receiving this letter—I should have mentioned it if I had been asked about it, but I never was—in my in<lb/>terviews with Miss Constable, no reference was made to the deed or the let<lb/>ter—her attention was never called to such a letter purporting to come from her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then were you never applied to again to fill up the blanks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think Stanley, after the receipt of that letter, mentioned the subject, and there the matter dropped, as far as I was concerned—when the prisoner was intro<lb/>duced to Miss Constable I think he was there on business of Mr. Constable's—the prisoner and Miss Constable never met at my office but that once to my knowledge—I think I never saw them together after that—I think the deed and the papers were delivered up without a Judge's order—we had retained them for our bill against Mr. Constable—when that was paid we delivered them up—the bill was paid to our clerk, who is here—at the time I received the deed back from Stanley, apparently executed, I believed it to be genuine—I made an affidavit, in which I stated die time the deed came out of my pos<lb/>session—that affidavit was read to Mr. Constable's medical attendant—that must have been five or six weeks after they paid the bill—that was when I first questioned the validity of the deed, in consequence of what the medical man said to me—the last payment was 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—that was some time after the 1st of Dec., 1841—I do not believe I ever applied to the prisoner for payment of our account—I did not apply to anybody—Hale and Co. had applied to us for the bill—they paid the bill that they might get the papers out of our hands—the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd was the first bill that was paid, and the other bill for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for business done for Mr. Constable—I did not endeavour to raise a loan on the deed while it was in my possession—I entered into negociation for a loan, on the old title, in Trinity Term, 1840, never after that—that money was to be raised for the purpose of paying off the mortgage—I was not then in possession of Mr. Constable's deeds—there were no deeds of Mr. Constable's in our possession, except a deed left as a deposit for 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we wanted to get money to pay off the incumbrances on Mr. Constable's estate—we endeavoured to do that—I do not think I saw Mr. Constable on that subject, nor Miss Constable—all that took place was with Stanley—I do not remember ever seeing Miss Constable at any time when there was a question about getting money to pay off her father's incumbrances—I do not think she ever evinced any wish of that kind—I believe all the conversation was with Stanley. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the object of your seeing her at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When she came, she came for advice on particular points, in reference to giving a notice to quit, and those sort of things—I rather think I did though, try to get money after Dec. 1840—if yoa will give me the bill, I can tell—this is my bill against Stanley—oh, yes, I remember I saw Mr. Vigors, of Chancery-lane, on the 23rd of Feb. 1841—that was soon after the deed came into my possession—I saw Mr. Vigors for the purpose of raising money to pay off all the incumbrances—I saw Stanley on that subject, but not Miss Constable—I did not succeed in raising the loan—I should say this was not one of the deeds upon which it was to be raised—it was supposed Miss Constable was in a situation to give a mortgage on the freehold estates, in concurrence with Stanley—it must have been on that deed, if Stanley had any thing to do with it—it was not carried into execution, and we were not successful in raising the money—there was another attempt made, I see, on the 22nd of March—that must have been after I got this letter, authorising me to fill up the blanks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you attempt to raise money on this deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The deed itself was not mentioned—we considered we could give a good mortgage on the estate, with the concurrence of Stanley and Miss Constable—Aldridge, the</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I reside in Bridgehouse-place, Southwark. I was acquainted with the late Mr. Richard Constable—I attended him professionally up to the time of his death—he died the last day of 1840—at that time he lived in West-square, Southwark—I also knew Joseph Stanley—on the eve of Mr. Constable's death Stanley came to my house to fetch me to see Mr. Constable; in consequence of what he said, I accompanied him back to Mr. Constable's house—we got to Mr. Con<lb/>stable's house a few moments after the clock struck seven—the clock was striking seven as we entered West-square—when I got into the house Mr. Constable was just dead—I had seen him on the previous day and on that morning alive, I should think between eleven and twelve o'clock in the forenoon—I cannot exactly state the time—he was then dying—he was decidedly not capable of retaining a pen in his hand—he was not sensible.</p>

               <p>prisoner came to me, on my return from Ireland, about the 19th of Nov., 1841, and after speaking of his uncle's death, he inquired what I was going to do respecting the freehold at Lewisham—I said, "I really hardly know what to do with it"—he said, did I know any gentleman who would relieve the free-hold from its difficulties; there was a mortgage of 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due on it, and the interest—I said no, I did not know any gentleman that was so inclined—he then inquired if he paid off the mortgage, would I give him an interest in it?—I said it was a very pretty place, and I would give any gentleman an inter<lb/>est in it, who had the means of enjoying it—he inquired what I could live upon as an income—I said my views were humble, and a small income would support me—he said, could I live on 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year?—I said "Yes, I could"—he said if he were disposed to relieve it from its difficulties, would I give him an interest in it?—he said that he could do so—I inquired what his means were—he said he had 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. his own property; that he had four shops of business, the one he resided in, one at Croydon, one in Crawford-street, and one at Chatham, and that in the course of a few months he should have a very respectable wholesale warehouse in Wood-street; that his brother would lend him 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he had so much interest in the City, that he could pro<lb/>cure 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at two hours' notice at any time—I said if he could do that, I could certainly see no objection to give him an interest in it—(at this time I had not seen the deed in question)—he inquired what the incumbrances were—I told him there was the bill of costs due to Mr. Parker; there was 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing to the mortgagee, with the interest accruing thereon; there were thir<lb/>teen guineas owing to the Bridge-house estate, for ground-rent for a field; that the house I had insured as long as I could for 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it was now falling in—he said that all those things he would immediately set smooth, that it was a very pretty place, and that in a fortnight or three weeks' time I should see it in as good condition as I had ever seen it before—(there are twelve acres of land to it)—I lent him a pencil, and he calculated what the sums would amount to, and said it would be no inconvenience to him, he could get it done very easily, and left me—I forgot to say that he likewise mentioned that Ely-place, Holbora, belonged to his family, and that they had a very great interest in one side of Earl-street, Blackfriars, if it did not wholly belong to them—no one was present at this conversation—(it occurred in the house of Mrs. Gibbs, No. 4, Kent-place, Pimlico, opposite the end of Lower Belgrave-street—Mrs. Gibbs is a very old friend of mine, and was thirteen years house-keeper to the late Sir William Stirling—on my return from Ireland I wrote to the prisoner, and he wrote to say he would call on me, which he did)—when he had calculated what the amount would be, he said he would see Mr. Boys, of Ely-place, on the subject—I attended at Mr. Boys's, I believe, a day or two afterwards, but the next evening I went to the prisoner in Southampton-street, as I wanted to talk to him about the furniture—he had come so late, that the evening was too far gone to enter on the subject, and I went to him next evening to talk about the furniture, and general property—there were papers of great value to me—when I got there he was not at home—a Mr. Newhall came in soon after I arrived, and after waiting some time, and com<lb/>plaining that the prisoner never kept his appointments, he left the bouse for a very short time—the prisoner returned home in the meantime, but I did not talk about the papers and other matters of consequence—Mr. Newhall came in again, and complained that Mr. Birch had behaved excessively ill, and said that he was no lawyer, and did not know what he was about—that seemed to be conversation between themselves—they seemed to have been to Mr. Birch on some occasion, and were dissatisfied with him—he said Mr. Birch was a fool; that he had prepared a deed of reversion for the Thompson family</p>

               <p>to sign, which is a numerous branch; that he had shown no consideration, and therefore the deed was invalid, and was of no use—I did not say one word to the prisoner about the furniture, or other matters upon which I went to see him—I was there perhaps an hour, or more—I went late, because I would not interrupt his business, his evenings I considered more at leisure—I waited for some time—Mr. Newhall said that Mr. Birch had erred in his judgment; that he understood what my very liberal proposal had been to Mr. Blackwell, and in the formation of another deed, great care must be taken not to com<lb/>mit such an error—I left the house without mentioning the subject on which I went—Mr. Newhall broke in quite on another subject, said Mr. Stanley had robbed him, and that he had been often deceived by him, and I had no oppor<lb/>tunity of saying any thing about the furniture—he said Mr. Stanley had made false representations to him, and if the prisoner did not turn out an honest man he should suffer very considerably, for he had put 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods into bis hands—I do not think I went to Mr. Boys the next day—I went there a few days after the prisoner's visit to me at Pimlico—I did not mention any thing about the furniture and other important matters at Mr. Boys's—I did not doubt the prisoner's honesty at the moment, until I had fully executed the deed, and then they shuffled altogether about the furniture, and would not give any part of it up—previous to going to Mr. Boys, the prisoner had given me his promise that the furniture, and other things that belonged to me should be given up; that it was in the possession of his mother, who lived in Camberwell, but was at that time in Derbyshire, and he apologised for not being able to go with me at that time—that was between the 6th of Sept., when I arrived in London, and that day month, when I was in Ireland again—the prisoner wrote to me in Ireland, and his address was Southampton-street—I was very anxious to know what he had done with the property generally, and when I came to England I took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> from the Euston station, and went through London to Southampton-street, though I was very much fatigued—I saw the prisoner standing in his shop—I did not know till then that he was a draper—the moment he recognised me, having seen me at Mr. Birch's, he apologised for not being able to ask me into his sitting-room, as there were some gentlemen there on particular business—I inquired after his uncle, whose death had taken place in the interval, and which was the cause of my coming to London—he said he had died in his house; that he had had every care taken of him; that he was a very distressed man, that if he had not done so, he must either have died in the street, or have been taken to the workhouse—this conversation was in the prisoner's shop, in Southampton-street—I do not know whether we were quite alone—there might have been some of his men in the shop—I dare say there were—two women passed while I sat there, who I have since discovered to be his wife, and Phoebe Blackwell—they were not there—they passed through into the inner room, and shut the door after them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now when you were at Mr. Boys' office, do you mean to say thai this deed, to which you then affixed your signature, was not distinctly explained to you in all its parts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not—I do not know the points of it at all—I know nothing that it contains more than this, that Phoebe Blackwell's name was contained in it, and I objected to her name, not knowing her—I afterwards agreed that her name should remain, as I had a great deal of confi<lb/>dence in the prisoner, and Mr. Boys said, "It will make a great deal of con<lb/>fusion if we strike her out, and it will not affect your interests at all"—I said, "I know nothing of this man except being Mr. Stanley's nephew, and he has the appearance of an honest man," but I said, "Does it not seem very odd, Mr. Boys, to give an interest to a person I never saw?"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that all you knew with respect to the deed, that it gives an interest</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300226"/>
               <p>in something to Miss Phoebe Blackwell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner in the mean time had brought the draft to me, two or three evenings after I had been to Mr. Boys—it was all done within a few days—the prisoner called on me twice at Pimlico—he brought me the draft, and said he had brought it for my perusal—I said, "Mr. Blackwell, I cannot understand it, it is a great roll of paper, I shall not understand one-half of it, and if you comply with your promises to me, that is all I require," and he took it away with him again—it was soon after I arrived in England that he brought the draft to me, and soon after his first visit to me at Pimlico—no one was present when he brought the draft to me—he begged that no one might be present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did he beg that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the evening that he first proposed it—I proposed that I should name his offer to some of ray friends—he said, "No, don't do that, you will be vacillating about it, you won't find any one else that will make you a better offer, and don't mention it to any one"—I did not open or look at the draft at all—I did not make inquiries respecting the furniture when he brought the draft—I paid a great many visits to South<lb/>ampton-street after that—it was before he brought the draft that I went there and saw Mr. Newhall there—that was between his first and second visit to me at Pimlico—I did not ask him about the furniture when be brought the draft, because he came so late in the evening and hurried away again—I do not know how long he was there—he scarcely sat down—when I saw the roll of paper I said, "This is all <hi rend="italic">leather</hi> and <hi rend="italic">prunella</hi> to me, I shall not understand it; and if you make good your promises to me that is all I shall require"—I had told Mr. Boys the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went respecting the deed, you said be need not explain it, it was all leather and prunella to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you signed it, making that observation, did you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not ready to sign at that time—Mr. Boys appointed me to go there one day, and there was a mistake in the stamp, and then he appointed for me to come on the next evening—I went next evening—the prisoner came and fetched me from Pimlico in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I then signed the deed—that was on the 14th of Dec.—it was then that the observation was made about Phoebe Blackwell's name being in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any portion of it read then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said that I thought it was of no use to read it, I did not care about it; if Mr. Blackwell fulfilled his en<lb/>gagements, as I had no doubt he would, I did not want to hear any thing about it—Mr. Boys said he never allowed any lady or gentleman to sign any thing in his office without reading it, and in that case he read a part of it—I believe that was what Mr. Boys said—he read the part attaching to Phoebe Blackwell and her brother—I said to Mr. Boys, "Stop, sir, if you please, I don't want such a name as Phoebe Blackwell, I know nothing about her," and he then made the remark about her being so mixed up with her uncle's affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any copy of this deed delivered to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did the deed say with respect to the prisoner and Phoebe Blackwell? I cannot recollect what it was he read—I recollect Phoebe Blackwell's name was introduced, and I objected to it—it was a small portion of it that was read—after reading it he said, "Are you satisfied?"—I said, "I do not know that I have any reason to be dissatisfied; I dare say I shall find this young man very honourable, and that is all I shall require"—Mr. Boys said, "It won't affect your interests at all" and he then invited me round to his desk to sign it—I was going to sign it, he called Mr. Martin, his clerk, I think, and he said, "Stop, Miss Constable, before you sign it I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300227"/>
               <p>will call my partner, Mr. Austen, in to witness it"—he did so, and it was signed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you believe that it would not affect your interests at all when you signed it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Except, so far that it would relieve me from all the difficulties I was labouring under—I was frightened to move—I considered, by affixing my signature, that I was conveying the freehold estate to the prisoner for a consideration, for my living—I was under an impression that it would be a great benefit to me—the prisoner had firmly impressed on my mind that it would not affect my interests, and not to mention it to Mr. Boys—if the pri<lb/>soner had performed his promise honestly he would have had a great deal to pay—he is a very young man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have spoken in high terms of Stanley; at that time had you any reason to alter your opinion of Stanley's honour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first doubt I had thrown up on Stanley's honour was by Mr. Newhall, who very much astonished me in depreciating him in every way—up to that time I had not the least doubt of Stanley—I had a very high opinion of him, and so had my father—he died with that impression—Stanley had been very much trusted by my father and myself, we placed the greatest confidence in him—he was con<lb/>stantly with us during the time we resided at Lewisham—it was a lone place, he resided in the house—my father was eighty-seven years of age—we had known Stanley ever since the year 1810—he was then a rich merchant, in King's Arms-yard, Coleman-street, in the wool trade—when he afterwards came to us, he represented that he had been some years in America—he was trusted and confided in by my father and myself from the moment of his putting his foot into our house, from the year 1837, and then he represented that he had just arrived in England—he resided in our house at Lewisham—we went from town to Lewisham—my father died in West-square—Stanley did not reside in that house—we had been there from the period of leaving our house in the June preceding—the house, Mount Pleasant, at Lewisham, was let furnished to a Mr. Freeman, a solicitor, of Coleman-street—I never saw Newhall till I saw him at the prisoner's house—I saw him after that—I have seen him about three times in the course of my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that paper, (<hi rend="italic">marked</hi> X) whose handwriting is that? only look at the signature, if you please? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen what the subject-matter is; I think it is my signature—(<hi rend="italic">looking at an account</hi>)—this is neither my writing or my signature—I see what it is, I have heard of it before—I have not seen what the contents are—Mr. Newhall told a gentleman in the gallery of this Court, the other day, that I had signed an agreement for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never seen this paper before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, how do you know that this has anything to do with Mr. New<lb/>hall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, there is his name attached to it—I do not know what it alludes to—Mr. Newhall said there was an acknowledgment for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever see Mr. Newhall on the subject of any sum of money owing to Mr. Stanley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw Newhall bnt once at the prisoner's—I have seen him in his own counting-house, in the presence of Mr. Petch—whatever transaction took place with the prisoner relating to Mount Pleasant was in his own house—there was a transaction with Mr. Newhall and the pri<lb/>soner relating to Mount Pleasant—no mention was made of any claim of Stanley's of money due to him from my father or myself, or to the prisoner—an account was drawn out by Mr. Newhall regarding the deed Mr. Boys was going to prepare—he said, as Mr. Birch had fallen into so great an error in preparing a deed of reversion, it must be carefully guarded against, and he consulted with the prisoner what sum should be entered to make the next</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300228"/>
               <p>deed I was about to execute legal—it was stated that there had been no con<lb/>sideration shown in the former deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it stated also that the sums had not been filled up in the former deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know no deed but the one the Thompsons had executed—I know nothing about sums in a former deed—I never saw the Thompsons' deed of reversion, but they told me it was without consideration, therefore it was of no use—it was not stated that the sums had not been filled up in a former deed, I will swear that—the account was drawn out to insert a certain sum to make the deed that I was about to convey to the prisoner valid—the prisoner proposed that it should be 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Newhall said no, he thought two sums of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be much better—I know of no account—there was no memorandum, or any paper written, in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not just now say there was an account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is the ac<lb/>count that you have; that is the one I heard Mr. Newhall had spoken of the other day, when he said he had an account for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I was at the prisoner's, the prisoner, Newhall, and myself were present, and alone—I saw Newhall writing, but not on such an account as that; it was a small piece of paper, which he took out of his pocket, the back of a letter, or something he was making memorandums, and certain sums were named—the prisoner said it should be 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that would be sufficient—they first talked of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Newhall thought it would be too much, and then the prisoner said it should be 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Newhall said he thought two sums of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each would do much better—that was to make the deed I was going to give to the prisoner valid—Newhall said that a deed without a consideration was of no use—what memo<lb/>randum there was he made himself with his pencil, and Mrs. Blackwell ob<lb/>jected to it—she put her head just inside the room; she was not in the room, but she called the prisoner out of the room—I heard her say something to him, and he said, "Oh, no, you may trust him with anything," and she went down stairs again—I did not write at all, I will swear that—the memorandum was made with a pencil, which Newball took out of bis own pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About how long were you arranging all this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The arrangement, whatever it was, was not more than an hour altogether; I dare say it was an hour—Mr. Newhall, in the prisoner's presence, went into the history of the prisoner's uncle, and the prisoner sat quite dumb—he came to me next evening, and I said I thought Mr. Newhall's conduct with respect to his uncle was very extraordinary indeed—he said he thought so too; he never was so astonished at anything in his life; and be then again repeated that his uncle had no funds, and he would have died in the workhouse if it had not been for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look at this paper, you may read it carefully? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is not one word of truth in it—the sums of money that appear there as paid, were paid out of a sum of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which we had sold our house at Kennington, in which my father had resided for fifty-two years, and I can give you the number of every note that was paid—it was in 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is this paper then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a paper stating that Mr. Stanley has paid all these sums, every shilling of which was put into his pocket, and independent of that he makes a charge here for a sow and eight pigs, Which I paid myself to the man, and he never saw the man—it is entirely a fictitious account—we gave him 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the carpets—"acceptances for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." we gave him—the stoves he bought of a Mr. Bell, in the new street that turns out by the Bank, I forget the name—he had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that—the house painting was 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of which we paid every shilling—we paid Collett 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ourselves—"balance of a bill of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," we owed no such balance—"a bill of costs, 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," which we paid ourselves—he had the money—"Ssmith's bill,</p>

"—they did not come to half the money—we have the account of them—they were bought of Mr. Longdon, of Shooter's-hill—it is true that Stanley accompanied us, but my father paid the money from his own pocket—from his own funds—here is "expenses to Wales, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," there is not a word of truth in it at all—this paper is not Stanley's writing, nor is it mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now Miss Constable, I ask you distinctly, whether you ever settled an account with Mr. Newhall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—no ac<lb/>connt of any kind was ever prepared by him in my presence, more than some memorandum which he made, which I understood was two sums of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and nothing more that I was aware of—I have no doubt this (<hi rend="italic">the letter marked</hi> C) is my father's handwriting, and this also (D)—these letters have been picked out from hundreds of others, which have been stolen from our private papers, at the house at Lewisham—boxes, trunks, and drawers full—these letters are some of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In saying, that the letter marked "D" is genuine, do you speak from the signature alone, or from the body of the letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have looked at them both, one is a letter written to Mr. Stanley in Wales.—(<hi rend="italic">One letter was dated</hi> 1838, <hi rend="italic">the other</hi> 1839.)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When your father and you first became acquainted with Stanley, he was a merchant of opulence in London? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was—in the year 1837, he occasionally called at our house at Kennington, but he did not become an inmate of our house till we went to Lewisham which was about June, 1838—he came to us with the intention of paying 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week for his board—that was his own proposal—he was very delicate about it—he said he would not come on any other terms—he never paid a farthing from the time he came, till he quitted—he wanted assistance constantly—he seemed to be straitened in his circumstances at that time, but he showed us a document, which would entitle him in a short time to 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a skin, which had much the apperance of one of these deeds—we never got any produce from that security.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you aware of the existence of any such deed as this charged to be forged, when you had the conversation with the prisoner, in which he proposed that you should be allowed 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and that that was to form the foundation of some other deed to be prepared and executed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—the conversation at which Newhall was present, was at the time it was agreed that the consideration should be first 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., then 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then two sums of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, but I did not agree to any of them—it was their own sug<lb/>gestion—this account was not shown to me then—no paper was shown to me at all—there were no papers on either side—this is the first time I have ever seen such an account—I was certainly not aware of the existence of this forged deed when I executed this other deed—the prisoner made the items for the deed that I did execute—there were two small estates, one at Caermarthen and one at Huntingdon, and he remarked to me, "Here are two small pro<lb/>perties, what will you do with them?" "Why," I said, "they are totally unencumbered, Mr. Black well?"—he said, "Well, so they are, but would you have any objection to my including them, and then I can act as your agent?

               <p>question about Phoebe Blackwell, and Mr. Boys told me she was a lame person residing in Derbyshire—I have since seen her, and she is not at all a person answering that description, she is a tall hale woman—the furniture at the house at Lewisham was worth about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but then the wine and plate, and other property was locked up, and not included—the house had been let furnished, at five guineas a week—I do not know what has become of the plate—I have never seen any of the furniture, except what I have been indicted about, and which I got, but that is so dreadfully mutilated, and in such an imperfect state, that I sold it to a broker for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was indicted for getting that by a forcible entry—there was no great quantity of plate left in the house—a little service, and nothing more—my father had a great objection to having much—it was worth, I should think, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had eighteen dozen of foreign wine there, and forty gallons of home made wine—I have not got any of that back—I understand they were very highly dissipated, and drank very ex<lb/>travagantly—the prisoner promised that when I was settled, and was willing to receive the furniture, he would give it all up—that was shortly before I signed this deed—after I had signed the deed, I made a great many applica<lb/>tions for the furniture, but never got anything—this paper is my handwriting—it is the retainer, Which I gave Mr. Boys—it bears date 20th of Dec., 1841, but I did not sign it till March.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Wood-street, Cheapside. In the year 1841, I had some transacttons with the prisoner, the result of which was that he was indebted to me about 1,258<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—my trading account, I think was about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took a shop in Southampton-street, Camberwell, for a nephew of mine—the prisoner afterwards had that shop from me and my partner—I believe part of the sum I have mentioned was the consideration for obtaining that shop, and there was one or two dishonoured bills—I knew a person named Stanley—I Cannot exactly remember to a month or so when the prisoner took possession of the Camberwell shop, but I think it was about Aug.—I think in 1841.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you on any occasion go down and see Miss Constable there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I went over to see Blackwell respecting my accounts—I think, as near as I can remember, that must have been some time about Dec., 1841, but I have not made myself acquainted with the dates—it was Dec. or Jan.—I will not be positive which—I was introduced to Miss Constable on that occa<lb/>sion—I was very anxious on account of my account being so very large, and I was introduced to Miss Constable respecting the amount of the property down at Lewisham—a conversation took place between myself, the prisoner,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300232"/>
               <p>and Miss Constable, on the subject of the property—it was stated either by Miss Constable or the prisoner, I cannot swear which, that the property at Lewisham had been disposed of to the amount of 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or guineas, to as<lb/>certain the real value, and that the prisoner was in a position to pay my account—whichever stated that, the other heard it—I believe, as far as I can possibly state, Miss Constable was appealed to by the prisoner—Miss Constable stated to me that there was a certain deed conveying the property from Mr. Constable to Stanley; that she was perfectly aware that Mr. Stanley or her<lb/>self, I will not be positive which, had given instructions to Mr. Birch to fill up a deed—I had been endeavouring to ascertain the value of the property, that I might take security from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she say who were the parties to that deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as my me<lb/>mory serves me, I understood that she had witnessed a deed conveying this property, which ought to be filled up—that she was a party to the deed—I will not say a witness—that she had witnessed, or was a party to a deed which required to be filled up, I believe, for the amount of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and upwards (I had not at that time put an execution into the prisoner's house)—the prisoner or Miss Constable, when both were present, in the room, informed me that such a deed was in the hands of Mr. Birch, and I believe the prisoner said he had not the means to settle Mr. Birch's account—I went to the prisoner's house again, and saw Miss Constable, I believe about a week or ten days after; during that time I had advanced the prisoner the money to take the deeds out of Mr. Birch's hands—on the second occasion that I saw Miss Constable, I made a memorandum—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the account produced</hi>)—it is my writing; I copied that from receipts which were placed before me, which I was informed Miss Constable was in possession of—Miss Constable and the prisoner together, informed me so—I believe the prisoner produced the receipts—he laid them before me, that they were from Miss Constable—that was not in Miss Con<lb/>stable's presence—I copied them in another room—they were both present after I copied them, when I laid the copy of the receipts before them—I can<lb/>not say in whose handwriting the part beginning, "I have carefully compared," is—I saw Miss Constable write the words "Elizabeth Hollis Constable" to this account—that was done after I had copied this from the receipts, and after she bad seen it—I believe she stated that the deed I have referred to was as a security for sums of money which Mr. Stanley had paid on behalf of her father, and that the receipts were for those sums—I left this account at South<lb/>ampton-street on that occasion—I do not recollect having it in my possession after that evening—I have never seen it since, to the best of my recollection, till this day.</p>

Costers, of Aldermanbury, to the amount of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for goods had by the prisoner—I did not put my name to a bill—I guaranteed the account, by giving a writing for any goods they might advance to the prisoner, to the amount of about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I was only guarantee, I believe, for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not guarantee for more than 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., further than I believe, my word of honour—I am not certain whether I was guarantee for exactly 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—their account was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I paid them off in cash—I paid them in the year 1841, I believe—I cannot speak posi<lb/>tively to the date—I paid part, I believe, in 1841, and part in 1842—I can<lb/>not say how much I paid in 1841, unless I had my ledger here—I have not looked for the purpose of giving my evidence—I paid Costers in the whole, I believe, 490<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I considered I was bound in honour to pay that amount—I paid it by two or three acceptances—I have not got the bills with me—they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300233"/>
               <p>can be produced—I paid them through the hands of Sir John Lubbock—I was also security to Walters, of Wood-street, for 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd for goods the prisoner had in his trade, and Coster's was for goods had in his trade—I have not got an invoice of either of them—I cannot say that I never saw the in<lb/>voice—I might have seen it at the prisoner's—I cannot swear whether I have or not—I also became guarantee to Sargentson, Weston, and Co., Scotch warehousemen, about the same period—it was in 1841, and I think about March—I cannot swear to dates, unless I saw my ledger, and saw the time—I paid them 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was guarantee for about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe it was in 1841 that I became guarantee to them—I am not positive, without re<lb/>ferring to my books—the next sum I paid was 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Birch, if my re<lb/>collection serves me, I advanced that on the prisoner's account, to get a deed out—I never got possession of that deed till it was handed to me by my solicitor, after a confirmation deed had been granted—I received it from my solicitor, I think about Jan. or Feb., 1842—Mr. Reynold's, of No. 10, Adelphi-street, Strand, is my solicitor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray have you ever been in any difficulties? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, I certainly have been in difficulties—I have compounded with my creditors—the last time, I suppose, was about four months ago, about three months ago—I am not certain to the date—I was not a dealer in bills—my father-in-law was security—the whole of my debts was between 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have only paid my trade creditors—the chief creditor was my father-in-law, for money which I received from him—he guaranteed the whole of the creditors 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, with interest, which every creditor was paid in full—I think my trade debts might amount to 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear they amounted to 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And that your father-in-law has paid 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not on that account—not on the last trading account—I mean the first.</p>

Costers was not among my debtors—they were persons from whom I had goods in my line of trade—I was never insolvent before that to my knowledge, except when I compromised with my creditors, on account of advancing money on these deeds—that is nine or ten months ago—I advanced 1250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know Mr. Holding—I do not know that I owe him any thing—my father-in-law has Undertaken to pay the whole of my debts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath have you not deposited among other deeds, belonging to the prisoner, Miss Constable or Mr. Constable, the deceased, this very forged deed, for a debt you owe him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I <hi rend="italic">signed</hi> them over to my father<lb/>in-law—I do not know whether he <hi rend="italic">signed</hi> them over to Mr. Holding, or what he has done, but he left them there as a collateral security for money that he must have had from Mr. Holding no doubt—I believe 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>was in the trouble I have spoken of, eight or nine months ago—I might have been sued four or five times, and I was sued about three or four months ago, for a small account of about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I do not suppose ever came into the warehouse at all—I believe those are the only times I have been sued—I cannot swear to once or twice—I could very safely swear that I have not been sued twenty times—I will not positively swear to it—I took a lease of the place at Camberwell—that lease is now disposed of to a gentleman—I do not know where it is—I suppose it is in his possession—I delivered it to a Mr. Greenfield, a draper, liv<lb/>ing at Blackheath, I think, or Greenwich—he had it immediately after the prisoner gave up the premises to the trustees to whom he assigned his pro<lb/>perty—I never had any other house in which the prisoner carried on busi<lb/>ness—I had a house in Crawford-street—I cannot state what number it was—the prisoner had those premises for about two or three months—he carried on business there—I was obliged to pay his rent—I had those premises in my own controul about three or four months—I did not take them—I be<lb/>came answerable for the rent to a person named Simpson—the prisoner did not take them—Mr. George Oxborough took them—he is a draper—he failed—I do not know What has become of Simpson—I know nothing of the house at Chatham—I did not know that the prisoner had a house there until he made an assignment to his creditors—I have been to the prisoner's house at Croydon—it was in the principal street—I never had anything to do with that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in the habit of being referred to, for the prisoner's character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in the general way of business—I should say perhaps for a dozen or fifteen accounts—I think not more—I will not swear it—I cannot say whether they were all for Camberwell—I did not give references for Chatham or Croydon—I believe I have been applied to, I have no doubt—I have not given references for Camberwell, Croydon, Chatham, and Crawford-street—neither did I know that he had a business at Croydon or Chatham.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why, did you not say just now that you had been to his house at Croydon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, but immediately I found he had a house at Croydon I closed his account—I did not close my own account till a long time after that—it might be a few months after—I will swear it was two months—I can<lb/>not positively swear to the time—I never carried on a retail shop—I was concerned in a retail shop—I had a nephew, for whom I took the house at Camberwell, in which the prisoner afterwards carried on business—my nephew did not fail—I disposed of the stock to the prisoner and his uncle—I and my partner did—M'Gooch was my partner—he retired from business with a fortune—I had been in partnership with him from about eight to ten months—he was a man of property—our agreement was to bring 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the concern—I brought in no capital at that time—my capital was then employed in a business with Mr. Hill, who I had formerly been in partnership with, but I did not know that I had no capital at that time—I entered into partnership with Mr. M'Gooch, about March, 1841, I think—Mr. Hill was a wholesale Manchester warehouseman, and carried on busi<lb/>ness at No. 29, Wood-street—he is now carrying on business in St. Martin's-lane—he has disposed of the business in Wood-street—I cannot say how—he has not been my partner for these two years—we separated because the concern did not answer—we did not fail—I do not know what you may term failing—I paid my debts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not Mr. Hill tell you he would have nothing more to do with you, and insist on leaving you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think Mr. Hill made such a re<lb/>mark—I cannot say that he said so—I am not aware that he ever made use</p>

               <p>of any such language—I will not swear it—in the heat of passion, what may have taken place, I know not—he did not tell me that from my connexion with the prisoner and Stanley be would have nothing more to do with me—it was regarding private affairs between him and me, respecting my bringing more money into the establishment, and Mr. Hill likewise doing so—my father-in-law objected to advancing more money as long as I was in partner<lb/>ship with Mr. Hill—I had brought 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the concern—that was lost—I did not lend that to Stanley—I did not know Stanley at that time, and knew nothing about his affairs whatever—I knew he was the prisoner's uncle—he was dressed as a respectable tradesman, I should say, when I saw him at the counting-house in Wood-street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray what are you now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not doing anything now, and have not done anything for about four months—I have been a shopman—I have not been in a retail shop—I have not been a shopman for the last four years—I joined Mr. Hill in Sept., 1839, and I have not been a shopman since, and never in the employ of any person—I left off being a shopman on join<lb/>ing Mr. Hill—I am now living at No. 13, Wood-street—the house is let to a Mr. Leith—it belongs to a Mr. Melville, a patent thread-manufacturer in Wood-street—I do not lodge there—I have the upper part of the house—the warehouses are let to Mr. Leith—I am a tenant until March—I am not there to take care of the house—I paid 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year rent—I have now let the house to Mr. Leith, from the 25th of Dec. last, but he occupied it six weeks or two months previously, on condition that I remained in the house until I met with a private residence—Mr. Leith paid no rent until the 25th of Dec.—I carried on business there as a Manchester warehouseman—I never assigned my stock to my father-in-law—I did not cart it away in the night—I dis<lb/>posed of my stock to Messrs. Sewell and Cross—I sold the whole of it at certain prices, with a discount off—I did not-dispose of the whole by the lump, but by stating certain quantities of goods at cost price, which I dis<lb/>posed of to them, with a discount off—I had had some of those goods for nearly eighteen months, I should say—the whole of the stock amounted to I should say 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—perhaps 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth I might not have had more than a month—I will swear that I had not more than 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth a month before—I did not sell any of the stock to any one besides Sewell and Cross—I sold none in what is called the <hi rend="italic">slaughter-house</hi>—I never sold my stock in that way—I swear that positively, not to anybody—I did not dispose of my stock the last time I compounded with my creditors—I had the manage<lb/>ment of that stock—my father-in-law did not have it—I swear that—I went on with my regular trading, my father-in-law being security—I disposed of it in the general way of business, to various houses round London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your solemn oath, were you not in partnership with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, to my knowledge—I have asked my solicitor, and he distinctly tells me that the agreement then entered into, never was of any effect, and is not binding—I intended to go into partnership with him—I do not know whether it was before or after this debt which I got the deeds to cover—the agreement between the prisoner and myself, as regards the partnership, was this: I had been speaking to my father-in-law that I wanted money; Mr. M'Gooch did not bring the money which he agreed to do, into the establish<lb/>ment, therefore, Mr. M'Gooch withdrew from it—the prisoner proposed to me that he would bring in 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the establishment, and join me, providing I would produce the same—I agreed with the prisoner, on this condition, that if I paid Mr. M'Gooch out of the establishment, he would not enter into any agreement with him, unless he would have it binding to forfeit 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he did not fulfil the engagement—I do not say that I have ever had 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300236"/>
               <p>in my life—I have had money at my banker's—they have not been my cre<lb/>ditors for a single shilling—they have trusted me and discounted for me to the amount of 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were five bills taken as security for the stock, which my bankers discounted for me, which had the joint names of Stanley and Blackwell to them—Stanley became security to my solicitor, jointly with the prisoner, for the stock which I handed over to him, belong<lb/>ing to my nephew—the prisoner and I entered into an agreement for the 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-piece, I think on the 1st of Nov., 1841—the prisoner was to produce 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear that I took these deeds as security after that—I will swear that I did not get these deeds for the purpose of afterwards handing them to my father-in-law—I did not owe my father-in-law any money at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you the deeds in your possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Me and my solicitor together, I believe, for about a fortnight or three weeks—then I went on to my banker's, Sir John Lubbock, and told them that I wanted a pro<lb/>missory note discounted—they immediately discounted me a promissory note for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I left the deeds, as a collateral security, with Sir John Lubbock—in about a month I paid the note back, for which they allowed me the interest off—I got that money in my trade—I was then carrying business at No. 13, Wood-street, as a wholesale dealer, not with Mr. Hill—it was twelve months, or more, after the dissolution with him—I have been a great many times to the house at Camberwell to inquire for the prisoner, always wanting to get money—he owed me a very large account at that time—I have seen the prisoner and his wife there on several occasions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the occasion as to which you have been giving evidence, did you, the prisoner, and Miss Constable, go up stairs together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went up stairs to Miss Constable and the prisoner—they were there—I never saw Miss Constable, to my knowledge, till I met her at the prisoner's—I am not cer<lb/>tain whether that was the first time, or whether it was the night before—I saw her twice at the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you on that occasion state to Miss Constable that you were glad you had found the means of <hi rend="italic">trimming</hi> Birch, who was no lawyer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that I made use of such words as "<hi rend="italic">trimming</hi> Birch," or any thing of the kind—I think I could safely swear I did not—I said that I had not confidence in Mr. Birch—I did not make use of the word <hi rend="italic">"trimming"</hi>—I said it was my opinion that Mr. Birch was not a clever solicitor—I had no reason but my opinion for so stating—I have frequently heard gentlemen speak of one solicitor and another, and as my solicitor I certainly should not have confi<lb/>dence in Mr. Birch; that was my only reason, and from his conduct towards the prisoner, in not giving him information about the deeds and things in his possession—I have no other reason that I know of—I did not say that Mr. Birch had made a mess of a deed which he had had prepared for the Thompson family—I will swear that—I never mentioned the Thompson family, neither did I know any thing of any transaction with the Thompson family—I believe at the second interview I had with Miss Constable, when I copied the receipts which were produced to me, I said that my solicitor would not take these deeds as security.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What deeds do you mean? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I mean the deed that is in blank, and Miss Constable said—(I cannot say whether she said she had written, or Mr. Stanley, but that) instructions had been given by them to fill up the blanks—Mr. Reynolds was my attorney then—he knew from Hale, Boys, and Austen, that the deed was in blank—I authorised him to get me security, or otherwise to enter the warrant of attorney, which I had on the property in Crawford-street, and Southampton-street—it was not upon that blank deed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300237"/>
               <p>that I advanced the money to the prisoner, hut on a confirmation deed, exe<lb/>cuted by Miss Constable, Poebe Blackwell, and the prisoner, at Hale, Boys, and Austen's, which was handed over to my solicitor—I do not know that I said that Mr. Birch had made a mess of a deed, by not putting any consider<lb/>ation in to it—I believe I can firmly swear, to the best of my belief, that I did not—I certainly should not like to go further than that—I did not, to my knowledge, say that I was glad Miss Constable bad fallen into the prisoner's hands, as he would be sure to improve the estates for her—I will swear I did not make use of those words—I might have stated in the course of conversa<lb/>tion, that I was very glad Miss Constable and the prisoner had arranged their affairs—I knew nothing of their private matters—I did not at that time know that the prisoner was a pauper, and not worth a shilling—he had acceptances of mine out at that time, over due, and unpaid, in the way of trading, I should suppose to the amount of about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear it was not above 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were five bills of 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and three of those were re<lb/>turned to my bankers dishonoured—in the way of trading, save and except those bills which were returned to me, which I had the security of the warrant of attorney for, I believe the amount was not more than 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear there was not 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. overdue, and unpaid at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say it was not exceeding 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot swear that, without you will allow me to see my ledger—there was Coster's account then not wholly paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, or the prisoner, say that you thought 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be a good sum to put in the deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not positive—I cannot say whether I did or not—I do not remember proposing 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner saying, "No, put in 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I only stated to the prisoner in passing, that I thought if all they said was as available as they represented it to be, as Miss Constable and the prisoner both stated, independent of the property which was at Hunting<lb/>don, and in Wales, that I thought when I was making out these copies, 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a sufficient sum for passing over the estate from one gentleman to another, and Miss Constable replied that they could prove still further receipts if I wished to copy them, but it being then near twelve o'clock at night, I felt uneasy at my wife waiting my return—I might have proposed to have 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. put into the deed, but I cannot swear it—the prisoner might have said that he thought 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be better—I did not on that say that I thought two sums of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each would be better than 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear that positively—I never suggested two sums of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or any thing to that effect—I never proposed the division of the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into two sums—I never pro<lb/>posed that the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be divided—I will swear that to the best of my knowledge—I believe I did not—if I must swear one way or other I should distinctly say no—I can go no further—I am a man of property now—I do not see that I am bound to say to what amount, my creditors may be here<lb/>after influenced by it—I have been insolvent—I have never been through the Insolvent Court—I have not been insolvent twice—my father-in-law became security, and I paid my creditors off myself—I asked them to give me time, after which I paid them interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Repeat the conversation that passed with Miss Constable, you, and the prisoner, at the house at Camberwell, respecting the value of the property at Lewisham? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Miss Constable gave me a statement then that the house had been disposed of, and was bought in again for, I believe, (as far as my me<lb/>mory serves me, to the best of my knowledge,) 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and she then stated, to further prove the value of the house, that it had been let furnished at 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, the house and grounds—I then inquired respecting how it came into possession of Mr. Stanley, and I was then informed that there was a rever<lb/>sionary</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300238"/>
               <p>deed of sixteen nephews and nieces, who bad an interest in this estate, which was the cause of its being disposed of, to ascertain the real value—that reversionary deed is now jointly with those in the hands of the bankers—to the best of my recollection I have stated all the conversation, or the greatest part of it—I do not at this moment recollect every word—the conversation was very similar at the second interview, with the exception of copying these receipts—the receipts were not produced by me to Miss Constable—I cannot say whether they were produced to her by the prisoner—he brought the re<lb/>ceipts and the different things down from Miss Constable into the room, and left them in the room for me to copy, and I did copy out the receipts, and that is a true copy of them—I afterwards went up stairs to Miss Constable, and asked her if that was a true copy—the receipts were not produced by me in her presence—I cannot say whether I saw them produced by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then have you told the truth when you said that the prisoner brought down the receipts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in the lower room—the prisoner stepped down from the sitting-room, where he was in conversation with Miss Constable, and brought them—he produced the receipts to me in the kitchen, where I copied them—there were various receipts—I should say ten or fifteen or more than that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Take that account in your hand, and be cautious how you answer; it contains a list of items in your own handwriting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I see some writing at the bottom.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What part of that writing will you on your oath swear you saw Miss Constable write? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "Elizabeth Hollis Constable"—I will not swear to any thing else—I wrote the paper through—after I had written it I gave it, in the presence of the prisoner and Miss Constable—I cannot say to whom I gave it—I might have laid it on the table—they were both in the room—I do not know whether I handed it to the prisoner or Miss Constable, but I saw Miss Constable write this "Elizabeth Hollis Constable," in the room—I saw her write that—I put the paper down, or gave it to the prisoner or Miss Constable, I do not know which.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after did you see her name to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say from twenty minutes to half an hour—I am not quite certain whether I was in the room all the while—I was in the room with Miss Constable I should say after this paper was signed—I was in the room until she signed it—I saw her write those words—I will not swear who wrote what is above it—I do not remember.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why you never left the room until she signed it; on your solemn oath, did not the same person that wrote this name write that which is over it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot swear—I do not remember—I do not know why the prisoner did not put his name to it as a witness as well as me—I did not ask him—I was not acquainted with these things—I put my name because I was asked by the prisoner to do so—I am not certain whether Mrs. Blackwell or Miss Blackwell were there, or who was there—I know Miss Constable and the prisoner were present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But as you were a person to be benefited by the deed, why did not you ask them to witness it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know I was to be benefited by the deed when that paper was signed—it was a transaction between the prisoner and Miss Constable—I cannot say what it was signed for—I was waiting there to get my account, for goods supplied to the prisoner in his trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the same person who wrote as you say, "Elizabeth Hollis Constable," write those several lines which are above it, beginning, "I have carefully compared?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot swear that the same person wrote the other, not having noticed it—had I been aware that I was to come</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it ready signed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware of that—when I came in, I saw Miss Constable take a pen, and write, "Elizabeth Hollis Constable"—I can swear positively that I saw Miss Constable take a pen from the ink-stand, and write, "Elizabeth Hollis Constable"—I was called in to witness it—I am not aware that I ever left the room from the time I was called in to wit<lb/>ness it, till Miss Constable had signed it—I was not in the room when I copied this deed—I did not leave the room from the time I was called up from copying this deed in the kitchen, I mean this copy of the receipts—when I was called up stairs to witness that, I never left the room till Miss Constable bad signed it—I never saw Miss Constable write but once—I never saw Miss Blackwell write, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look at that name, "Elizabeth Hollis Constable," the word "Hollis" particularly, and tell me whether you cannot see a tracing of pencil, or something of that sort, upon which that signature is written? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I was called to witness this, Miss Constable, I believe, as far as my me<lb/>mory now serves me, might be in the act of writing this name, and on her doing so, I immediately said, "I will not be witness to this unless I see you take the pen and write "Elizabeth Hollis Constable"—part of this might have been written by her, but I would not witness it unless I saw her take a pen from the inkstand and write it over again, not again, I did not wish to say—as far as my memory serves me, she might have written part, but I dis<lb/>tinctly swear I saw her take a pen and write "Elizabeth Hollis Constable"—I have come here to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at the word "Hollis," do not you see the tracing of a pen or pencil in that word, upon which it has been written over again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cer<lb/>tainly do see some little signing, or something or other—I do not know what it is, but I distinctly swear I saw Miss Constable take a pen and sign her name—I see something, as if it might have been slurred over, or something of that sort—I do not see any thing slurred over in the word "Elizabeth"—there is a little soil, a little grease, or something of that sort on it—I do not know whether to call it tracing, or what—there appears to be a little soiling on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you see there is a distinct mark of something hard upon which the word "Hollis" has been again written? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is something—I cannot dis<lb/>tinctly state what it is, or any thing of the kind—to the best of my belief, I told Miss Constable that I would not witness the signature unless I saw her write all the words "Elizabeth Hollis Constable"—I will swear I said I would not be a witness till I saw her write her name with a pen—I do not know</p>

               <p>why I should say such a thing, but I have some recollection of stating words to that effect.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you want further receipts for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To fill up the deed—this was after the deed had been taken out of Mr. Birch's hands, and was in blank, but which Miss Constable stated ought to be filled up, for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd she thought was the sum which her father was indebted to Joseph Stanley—I am not certain whether Mrs. Blackwell was present when this was read over—I will not swear that she did not read it over—I will not swear that she did not write this in my presence—she might have written it, but I did not notice it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Never mind that, but tell us what the arrangement was by which you got that deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That Miss Phoebe Blackwell and the prisoner should allow me to hold the deeds, as a collateral security for money which I had advanced to pay off the lien—both Phoebe Blackwell and the prisoner said that—the prisoner said that he would allow me to hold the deeds belonging to his estate, as a collateral security for the money I had advanced—I entered up a warrant of attorney on the premises in Crawford-street—the agreement was, that I was to pay Sutcliffe and Birch's bill, and to hold this deed as a collateral security for my debt—I paid Sutcliffe and Birch's bill, I think, to the best of my recollection on the 1st or 2nd of Dec., 1841, late that evening—the deeds were handed to Hale, Boys and Austen's clerk, by their clerk—I had possession of these deeds, to the best of my recollection, in Feb., 1842—they were banded to me by my solicitor.</p>

In the autumn of 1841, we were employed by Mr. and Miss Blackwell, as their solicitors—we were to get some papers out of the possession of Sutcliffe and Birch—we afterwards got those papers out of their hands—their bill was paid before the papers were delivered—I saw Miss Constable after that—she subsequently executed this deed in my presence—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the confirmation deed</hi>)—I am not the attesting witness to it, Mr. Martin is the attesting witness—I see Miss Constable's signature—I saw her three times on the subject pre<lb/>viously—the prisoner was with her on those occasions—at the time I first saw her on the subject of preparing this deed, I had seen the other deed, where there are blanks—that deed was adverted to on the first occasion—I am not sure it was produced, but either the deed or a copy was there—the title was the sub<lb/>ject of discussion, and this blank deed, and the effect of it, was one point under consideration—I have an original memorandum of my own—this was on the 10th of Dec., 1841—the opinion of a conveyancer had been taken previous to that, and here is the case—when I saw Miss Constable, the question that we were considering with Mr. Black well and Miss Constable was the perfecting the title of this estate, in consequence of the deed in blank having been obtained from Sutcliffe and Birch—the case, which had been laid before the convey<lb/>ancer, was before me, and under discussion and consideration, and I have here the minutes which I made, when the prisoner and Miss Constable were present—this was on the first occasion—the prisoner brought the case that I had before taken the opinion of counsel on—I had given it to him, if I recollect right, the day before—I explained to Miss Constable the effect of the title—I cannot state the exact words I said—I called her attention to it—two other deeds had been prepared by Sutcliffe and Birch—they were settlements, apparently on her part, of this property, and the effect of these I explained to her as well as this, and she expressed regret that the title was in that state by means of the blank deed—she fully understood that a deed was necessary—I explained to her the parties who were interested under the trust, sup<lb/>posing the blanks for the sums had been filled in—Stanley's name was men<lb/>tioned to her, as being a party interested—I mentioned it to her—the first part of the minute that I made here is the amount of the debts due, which were to be the consideration for the deed to be prepared—I explained to her that there were certain blanks in the deed, for debts to be entered to certain parties, and I explained to her the effect of the trusts, and that Stanley was the trustee—Stanley was then dead, but was represented by the prisoner, who claimed the interest which he had under his will—we were not her solicitors, but the Blackwells'—that was the first time I had seen her, but she was so satisfied with Blackwell, that she instructed us afterwards, at a subsequent interview, to prepare this confirmation deed—we were engaged for both parties, and had the drafts for counsel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that account, did you ever see that whilst the deed was pre<lb/>paring? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From a pencil memorandum at the back, and from recollection, this was in the office at the time the deed was prepared—I cannot say that this account was produced at either of the three interviews with Miss Con<lb/>stable and the prisoner—I am not sure that it was—there is a pencil memo<lb/>randum of mine, "Received, Dec, 4th, 1841"—that shows it must have been in receipt by me on Dec. 4th—this is my own writing—I think I received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300242"/>
               <p>it from the prisoner—I cannot say whether it was produced in the presence of Miss Constable—the figures were acted upon as the basis of the draft, for inserting the sum in this conveyance—at the first interview, I adverted to the deed in blank—I have a minute that advances were made to Mr. Constable—I cannot say who said it—both assented to it—I made a minute of what passed on the first interview—in Miss Constable's presence, it was stated, that Stanley's executors had a claim of 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I took down, in the presence of Mr. Blackwell and Miss Constable 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as due to Stanley's executors—Miss Constable did not deny that that was the fact, she assented to it—I made this memorandum at the time, of what took place at that interview—I took the whole of these minutes from both of them—the exact sum which it was agreed should be inserted as the sum due from the prisoner's estate, was afterwards fixed on and afterwards inserted, according to that account, when the deed was drawn out—but in her presence 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was what was agreed to—I also understood from her or Blackwell (she assented to it) that advances were made to Mr. Constable, and also to her, after his death, before the deed in blank was executed, and after also, by Stanley—the prisoner and Miss Constable were both present at this time—Miss Constable did not deny it at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that it was both before and after the deed in blank was executed, advances were made to Mr. Constable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, to Mr. Constable, and to Miss Constable after his death—that the claim of Stanley's executors consisted of advances made both in Mr. Constable's life-time and after his death—I was so told at the time—the last item in this account is Oct. 30, 1838—that was supposed to be after Mr. Constable's death in 1840.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the second interview, had this deed of the 14th of Dec. 1841, been prepared? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—at the first interview Miss Constable expressed a wish to convey the surplus of this property to Mr. Blackwell alone, and it stood over for me to see Miss Blackwell, which I did—they were both interested under the will of Mr. Stanley, as executors and devisees—I saw Miss Blackwell in the mean time; and, at the second interview, re<lb/>ference was made to her being a party to the deed—I have got the memoran<lb/>dum of what took place at the second interview, with Miss Constable and the prisoner—we further discussed the matter, and I took instructions to prepare the deed—according to Mr. Kemp's, my conveyancer's opinion, in the best way—allusion was made to the sum which ought to have been inserted in the deed in blank, because the interests of some of the parties whose names were in the deed in blank, without sums, had to be attended to in the new deed—1109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the sum mentioned to be inserted in the deed as the sum due to Stanley's executors—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the draft</hi>)—that was to be taken as the sum due to his executors, and was to include the sum which ought to have been in the blank deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could that possibly be, when Stanley did not die till six months after Mr. Constable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As I was instructed, there was a sum due to Stanley—I was instructed that there was a debt, part paid in Mr. Consta<lb/>ble's life-time, to him, and part to Miss Constable, after his death—it was only part of the sum that ought to have been in the blank deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, having received these instructions with regard to the preparation of this deed, did Miss Constable and the prisoner attend at the time it was executed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They did—that was not on the third occasion—I saw them once before—I saw them on the 13th the third time—the first interview was on the 10th of Dec., the second on the 11th, the third on the 13th, and on the 14th I saw them again—on the 13th I explained again to them the nature of the intended deed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are the provisions of the deed? Do they follow the blank deed, and only alter as to the sums? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It purports to be a convey<lb/>ance by Miss Constable to the prisoner and Miss Black well, in consideration of 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., composed of a mortgage debt of 2350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 1109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the debt due to Stanley's executors, 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the amount paid to Sutcliffe and Birch, and 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the amount of our debt and interest, altogether making 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there is no provision of any annuity or any surplus for her—she ex<lb/>pressed her readiness to give the prisoner up any surplus there was, and there is a covenant by the prisoner and his sister to indemnify her for mortgage debts, taking them to themselves—there is mention of the estate in Wales—it is a very small estate indeed—Miss Constable and the prisoner both said it was a very small cottage—there is also some property in Huntingdon that is not valuable, worth 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believe, not more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> She attended, on the fourth occasion, for the purpose of executing this deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I believe she then executed it, though I am not the attesting witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before she executed the deed, did you explain it to her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I explained it to her fully—I did not read it in full, but I explained it to her, and she understood it—the consideration was supposed to be exactly 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of this deed; and when I came to add up these executed deeds, it came to more; therefore it became necessary to have the stamp altered, and she went into the calculation with me—I checked it with her, and the prisoner—I made her quite understand, that the prisoner was not to be her trustee—that she was to have no expectation—that she was to discharge her father's supposed debts and have nothing—she never gave me to understand that there were any debts of her father's beyond this mortgage debt, and those debts mentioned here—all the property was to go in liquidation of those debts—she was to be free of the debts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And also free of any inheritance,—to be abroad in the world without a shilling? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but she always stated the property to me, and the prisoner too, as worth very little more than the mortgage debt—I did not take any pains to sift into the reality of any debt to the Stanleys—I did not know whe<lb/>ther he was a man capable of lending 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I heard nothing of him—I have got a minute the first time I saw Miss Constable and the prisoner, that he (Stanley) was a friend of Mr. Constable, and acted for him—I only knew what they told me, that Mr. Stanley was a friend of Mr. Constable, and that he was an elderly gentleman—I understood that—I knew nothing except what Miss Constable and the prisoner told me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not think, for the protection of a lady, ignorant of law affairs, that it was your duty to satisfy yourself that this consideration existed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, in the fullest way possible—I explained every thing to her, and I think Miss Constable knew very well what she was about, from the four or five interviews I had with her, and if she misled me I cannot help it—I acted for her afterwards in several things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand that you knew nothing of the circumstances of Stanley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in that extended sense—I heard of Stanley when I first came to Ely-place, and I had seen him up to 1836 and 1837, but since then I had lost sight of him altogether—I never was acquainted with him—I have seen him at Ely-place—I believe my predecessors acted for the prisoner's father and brother, in a heavy Chancery suit, and during the progress of those matters, Stanley came to the office on the part of the prisoner's father, who was a client of the house—I never in my life called at Stanley's lodging, that I recollect—I never heard of such a name as Mrs. Jenkinson, or of such a place as Swinton-street,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300244"/>
               <p>Gray's-inn-road—I never was there that I recollect—I never called there on Stanley, that I recollect—I will swear I never did—I never recollect calling on Stanley in my life—I never called and paid him 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for him, nor ever paid his rent for him—I never called on Stanley, or paid him anything—I never knew Stanley—I never paid 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or any other sum for his rent, at any house in Swinton-street, Gray's-inn-road—you take me so by surprise—these are questions which I had no idea of ever being asked, because I never called on Stanley, or knew anything at all of his fate—when I saw him last at Ely-place in 1836 or 1837, I did not know his circumstances, but I should say he was not a rich man—I did not know that he was in destitution and poverty—I did not expect from his appearance that he was rich—I can form an opinion of any body as to their apparent wealth and station in life—I am quite prepared to swear that I have never been to any lodging of Stanley's, or to any house where he lodged—I am quite at a loss to recollect what you can allude to—I think you must be under some mistake—I am quite prepared to swear it, and I do swear it to the best of my recollection—I never knew where Stanley was lodging, to my recollection, because I never heard of him except in some way connected with the Blackwells, the prisoner's father and brother—Stanley never came to my office in Ely-place, and sold me cigars or tea—I have never seen him there with cigars and tea to my recollection—he may have had some parcels with him, but I do not know that he was there with tea—if he came, he came on the business of the prisoner's father and brother, connected with the Chancery suits—I have looked to see whether I have any memorandum of his coming to our office, and that enables me to answer you the more clearly as to the years 1836 and 1837—I saw him in 1836 I think, or 1837, about some dispute he had with a Mr. Parker, and I learnt from him then that he was in the tea trade—he did not on that oc<lb/>casion produce cigars for sale—he never did such a thing, nor tea either—he told me himself, in Ely-place, that he was in the tea trade; he did not tell me where he was carrying it on, and I did not ask him—it was not my business—I never knew that he was in the habit of hawking tea about the streets—I never heard of it—the prisoner introduced Miss Constable to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know that she was coming? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not sure whether the prisoner did not say he would take the case to her, and show her the opinion—I did not know for certain that she was coming—there was no appointment that I can recollect—I think when I gave him the opinion, it was to show to her—I do not know that he told me he would bring her to me—I will not swear he did not—it is very probable that he would bring her—I expected that he would—I have said as much, but there was no appointment made—I have been in partnership since 1834 or 1835—I never had such a deed as this put into my hands before—there were other deeds with it, and I never saw such a complicated title before; and so thought my senior partner, Mr. Hale, with whom I consulted—it was not left to myself alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have the kindness to tell me whether, when you saw that deed in blank as you found it, you entertained no suspicion of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought it a curious deed, but not further than that—it is an extraordinary state for a deed to be in—I do not know that I entertained any suspicion of it, beyond what I have stated—I will swear I did not beyond what I have stated—from the appearance, I necessarily looked on it as an imperfect document, and a very curious document altogether—I did not look on it as a suspicious document, not with a view of supposing that, for instance, it had been forged or obtained improperly, or any thing of that sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You thought that an attorney in his senses, would allow any man in his senses to execute a deed charging his estate with several debts, without setting</p>

               <p>out what they were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We got the deed from Messrs. Sutcliffe and Birch, and we gave a certain credit to it from obtaining it from them—I do not know whether I should have suspected it, if it had not been obtained from them—it would depend upon how it came to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing it had been brought by the prisoner, the attesting witness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what I should have done in that case—it would depend on all the circumstances of the case, because affidavits had been made about these deeds by Mr. Birch as alluded to in his bill of costs—I took a retainer from Miss Constable—I did not require her to antedate that retainer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your solemn oath did you not send her a retainer, and require her to antedate it, or antedate it yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that 1 recollect—I do not recollect doing it—I have no recollection of requiring her to antedate a re<lb/>tainer for three or four months—to the best of my recollection I did not—I sent it by the post, if I recollect right—I will swear I did not require her to antedate it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the retainer</hi>)—this is dated, Dec. 20th—I will swear that that was not signed in March, 1842—this was sent by the post at the time of the date—here is the envelope, and here is my memorandum at the back, of the same date—I will swear that this was not signed by Miss Constable in March—I will swear it came to me at this time, and that I had it in my possession ever since Dec. the 20th I think—I do not know that I sent it to her—I believe it to be written by Miss Constable—it came by post—I will swear that—I believe this envelope belongs to this letter—I will swear it—to the best of my recollection Miss Constable took a form of a retainer, and she said she would write it, and she sent it by the post—she took the form from me—I think she was going out of the country, or going away—it was necessary to prove her father's will, and I suggested she should leave an authority for us to act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why could she not write it at your office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was her own request to do it—I swear from recollection that that was the transaction—I could refer to bills of course, but this is a retainer that came by post at this time upon which we acted, and proved the will—I did not say she copied the retainer—I gave her a form which she took away—it was her wish to do it—I do not know why.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray do you know Miss Phoebe Blackwell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I had never seen her to the best of my recollection, before about the autumn when we were acting for her and her brother as Stanley's executors—I never re<lb/>presented her to Miss Constable to be lame, and living in Derbyshire—I will swear that most positively, nor any thing to that effect—I never described her to Miss Constable in my life, because Miss Constable was there with her some<lb/>times, very often at Ely-place—I will swear that on my introducing the deed to be signed by Miss Constable, she did not say, "Mr. Boys, stop here, what has Miss Black well's name to do with me? I do not know her"—as I stated before, Miss Constable in the first instance wished to convey the sur<lb/>plus of this property to the prisoner alone—she wished not to have the pro<lb/>perty conveyed to Miss Black well—she at first objected to Miss Black well's name being in the deed—I did not tell her that she was so mixed up with Stanley that it could not be prepared in, any other way—I told her that she was mixed up in this way, that they were joint executor and executrix under the will—that they were jointly interested under the will, and that it would be improper to make a conveyance to the prisoner alone—the instructions to counsel to prepare the draft goes on that principle, and I always kept her interest, and the prisoner's in view, for that very reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not think it a very unprofessional act to take upon yourself to act for a grantee and a grantor, the grantor being a woman unprotected?</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300246"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not if she perfectly understood what she was about, and if I had the as<lb/>sistance of counsel also—counsel prepared the draft for all parties—I had my instructions—I took on myself to act for all parties with Miss Con<lb/>stable's sanction—I do not consider that an unprofessional act, with the as<lb/>sistance that I had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How would the assistance of counsel which had for its object the pre<lb/>paration of that deed, interfere with the question, whether you should act for a party giving, and a party taking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because counsel were instructed to prepare a deed for all parties, which is very frequently the case in the pro<lb/>fession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say to Miss Constable, "You appear to be a stranger, have you no friend but this Blackwell; had you not better consult somebody on your own behalf?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I did not not say those very words, I did to the effect—I can go no further than my memorandum and my recollection—I asked her if she wished us to act for her, and she said, "Yes"—I am not sure whether I asked her if she wished anybody else to act for her—I cannot say—we did act for her afterwards—I made myself a trustee in the deed—I did not receive any money on its execution—I obtained money on it after<lb/>wards, the costs of it—that was not 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the costs relating to the deed itself were about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I forget the amount—there were some other costs—that money was paid on the completion of the security, from the prisoner to Newhall—I do not know who paid it—my clerk settled it—what hand actually paid the money, I do not know—the agreement was a security from the prisoner and his sister to Newhall, and on our handing over the deeds, we were paid our bill of costs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By whose direction did you hand over the deeds to Newhall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As the solicitors of the prisoner and his sister—I have no written direc<lb/>tions—it was a general direction when we were instructed to settle the agree<lb/>ment—there was an agreement to deposit, to which Mr. and Miss Blackwell were parties, and Newhall—I have not got it—I placed this deed in New<lb/>hall's hands when the agreement to deposit was executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As between Blackwell and Newhall, you were not concerned for both those, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we were concerned for Blackwell and his sister—the agreement was the authority for handing over this deed to Newhall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, had you not verbal instructions from the prisoner to hand over the deeds to Newhall, and among them this deed in blank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not from the prisoner alone, but from the prisoner and his sister, on the terms mentioned in that memorandum, which are very particular as to Miss Blackwell, because her interest is different, but still kept in view—Mr. New<lb/>hall's solicitor prepared an agreement to deposit, as an equitable security on this property—we were instructed by the prisoner and his sister to deliver over the deeds to Newhall with the agreement, and not without it—we were not justified or authorised in parting with these deeds except with the agree<lb/>ment, when the matter was closed—we were then justified in parting with them, by our instructions as solicitors to the prisoner and his sister—we had directions not to dispose of the deeds without the agreement—we were di<lb/>rected to deposit the agreement and deeds also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that recital of the deed in blank, and you will see that it there states the deed was executed on the 30th of Dec., although it is not dated, it says "whereas, by an indenture of release bearing no date, but executed on or about the 30th of Dec.," by what instructions did you insert that recital? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In consequence of a statement in the case—I see it is stated in the case that it was executed on the 31st of Dec.—then I have got a note, "We have, since</p>

               <p>this case was drawn, been informed that the deed was executed on the morn<lb/>ing of the 30th"—I do not recollect who told me so—I might have got this information from Mr. Hale, or the prisoner might have told me—this note is my own handwriting—I think I made it the day when the prisoner brought back this case, and when he and Miss Constable were together—I cannot say which of the two gave me the information that induced me to make the note—it was when they were present together, to the best of my recollection.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When do you say you made that note? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think on the 11th—the first day that the prisoner and Miss Constable were with me—that was after the case had come back from counsel—it is very fre<lb/>quently the custom to make notes when we find the fact is not correctly stated—I positively swear it was not there before the case was laid before counsel—I made it because it was an altered state of facts, because it was so very near the time of Mr. Constable's death—that was the subject talked of when Miss Constable was with me for the first time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was talked of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The deed having been executed so shortly before Mr. Constable's death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you were not told to make that al<lb/>teration by the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I will not swear it, because they were both together—I cannot carry my recollection so nice as that—I recollect that it was spoken of as a deed, executed very shortly before Mr. Constable's death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what way was that noticed; as a strange thing, out of the ordinary course, or what? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only in ascertaining the date, there is no date to the deed, and I had to describe the deed in some way or other in the draft, and it was the only way of arriving at it—I only took it from what I was told by the parties—the date of this new deed is the 14th of Dec., 1841—this retainer was given a week after, as she was going away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was the probate taken out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not for some time; I forget when—there was a sum of money at Somerset House, which she obtained under that probate, and which we got for her—that was not contained in the deed—the will was not proved for some time, because there were proceedings going on in the Court of Chancery, and she did not want to be made a party to them—she came back after some time, saying she wanted this money from Somerset House; the probate was then taken out; we received the money, and paid it to her—about April she came again with a Mr. Petch, and she complained against the Blackwells, and talked about proceeding against them—she asked me to take proceedings against them, not at first, but afterwards; I refused; I told her we were not concerned for either party in dispute; I told her it was a civil remedy—I might have told her that her remedy was an action for <hi rend="italic">trover</hi>—she complained that they had taken away all her goods and furniture—I think I did not hear that this was a forged deed until about that time, about the summer, when Mr. Petch and other parties came with her to our office—I never learnt it from my partner, Mr. Hale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not learn from Mr. Hale that Dr. Lever had been with him, called his attention to it, and warned him against it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not that it was forged; I have some recollection of something being said about the deed being executed very shortly before Mr. Constable's death, that something</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300248"/>
               <p>was not right about it; but as to hearing about its being forged I did not hear that till quite lately—I did not hear it till this new deed was executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Surely you did, for you have just said that you made a memorandum on the draft, because you had been informed that it was on the morning of the 30th it was executed, the day before Mr. Constable died? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but they are asking me whether I heard it was a for<lb/>gery before then—Mr. Hale had not said anything to me about its being irregular—he had not said anything about it before the new deed was executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And you had no notice, through Mr. Hale, or any<lb/>body else, that the deed was a forgery? be cautious what you swear. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not that I recollect, not till about the time I told you; I do not recollect that it came to my knowledge before the confirmation deed was executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This is a very important fact; nobody could mistake whether when they were about to get a woman to execute a fresh deed, they had notice that the former was a forged one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had not at the time this was drawn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to pledge your oath to that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, positively—I did not know by information from Mr. Hale that there was anything wrong about the deed till after the deed of confirmation was exe<lb/>cuted—I did not know at the time I took the conveyance to the prisoner and his sister, that, with the exception of this property, they were paupers; I did not inquire—I did not know how they got their living—they were not able to pay me, except through Newhall, who advanced the money for the purpose—I do not think we had required to be paid for what we had done before that time; I will not swear we had not, without referring to my memoran<lb/>dum—I did not at that time know that they were in such very needy cir<lb/>cumstances; I knew the prisoner himself was in difficulties—I knew that he had been obliged to quit the house at Camberwell, that there were proceed<lb/>ings at law against him, and that there were overdue and unpaid bills against him; I knew that, at the time of the execution of the deed, but previously I had known nothing whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, under these circumstances, knowing him to be in difficulties and necessities, and this woman to be unprotected, and acting for both, think that he was a fit man to have so important a trust as that reposed in him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If their statements were right, and their figures, she was giving him very little; there was very little surplus made out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why was she to give him anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was the mortgage; in fact, the property was worth very little; in fact, she knew so much about it that she wished to get rid of it; there was the possibility of her being made a party to a Chancery suit; there was a mortgage of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and a legal debt of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, on this very property, and a Chancery suit going on at the time, and Mr. Kirk had been endeavouring to find her out to cite her, and make her a party to the suit, which she was desirous of avoiding; therefore we considered that the prisoner was taking but very little under this deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go through this case with Miss Constable and the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; I read it through, and on the information I received as to the morning of the 30th, I wrote this on the margin—Miss Constable did not deny the accuracy of any of the statements in this case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you acquainted with the handwriting of Mrs. Blackwell?</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300249"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not think I have ever seen her write, or the prisoner—this case, and the opinion, were read over to Miss Constable.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">MARTIN</hi>. I am the attesting witness to this deed; I saw Miss Constable execute it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in the room all the time, or merely called in to witness it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Merely called in; I know nothing of what passed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> to <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BOYS</hi>. Was this deed with the blanks in it, with the signa<lb/>tures and the attestation, ever drawn to Miss Constable's attention? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware that it was—there were two other deeds in her favour, exe<lb/>cuted, I think, in Feb.—her attention was called generally to deeds—I never called her attention to the fact, that as this was a deed executed by her father on the day before, or the very day of his death, whether she recollected the transaction, or who were present—I never anticipated any inquiry of this kind—I cannot say exactly which told me, but I collected from them that it was the 30th—in the case of a will I should ask whether it was executed on the very day of the man's death—the only question about this deed was the date of it—it was in blank—it had no date; and of course that was the subject of conversation, and the effect of that deed with the two others—I do not re<lb/>collect that I asked whether the prisoner had ever seen either of the subscrib<lb/>ing parties at the time—before this second deed was executed I had reason to believe that the prisoner had seen Miss Constable and her father before the beginning of the year 1841—it did not occur to me that I was making at deed in favour of the prisoner, who was the attesting witness of the other deed, in favour of Stanley, because he was interested under Stanley's will.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The Deed of Confirmation was here read. It recited the whole of the former deed, with the addition of the blanks being filled up, it stated that there (was a debt of 1109 l. 7 s . due to Stanley from Mr. Constable; and finally conveyed the property mentioned in the first deed to the prisoner and Phoebe Blackwell, for the purpose of meeting the demands upon the estate, including the above sum of</hi> 1109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.)</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at the very beginning, and explain what those items mean? <hi rend="italic">A. (Reading</hi>)—"Mount Pleasant House, Lewisharn.—Richard Constable, Dr. to Joseph Stanley. 1838, Feb. 1st, paid for carpets, as per annexed, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I suppose that item was obtained from Stanley's memory, or perhaps a bill delivered to him—I should think it was taken from an account that Stanley kept—he and I bought the carpets together—we went together to choose them, and he had 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. given to him to pay for them, by my father—there was a trifling balance, which he never accounted for—the next item is, "Paid acceptance, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for furniture"—that was paid by a bill, and I have the acceptance, but not with me—it was to a man named Rushton, in the Kent-road, accepted by my father—"Mr. Buffin, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., stoves as per bill 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—they did not cost anything like 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had the money to pay for them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he any funds of his own, by which he could have paid for these several things? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have ascertained since, that he had not 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had nothing—"Radburn, for painting house, 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I paid that man myself in the house, and Stanley was not present—he brought the gentleman down, and gave him a promissory note for the amount, and I paid him in his presence—I do not know the gentleman's name—he lived somewhere at Rotherhithe, and this gentleman was his landlord—"Collet, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he was Mr. Abraham Constable's coachman, and received it from my father—"Hind's bill of costs, 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—Mr. Hind was the coroner of Sitting<lb/>bourne, and these were the costs accruing from Mr. C.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mr. Boys has said that your attention was called to the amount due, namely, 1,109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. therein stated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I beg Mr. Boys's pardon—I never had my attention called to any such thing—this case was never shown or read to me by Mr. Boys—I never had any case shown to me there—he never called my attention to his having taken counsel's opinion respecting the new deed—I dare say I should not have understood it if he had.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This confirmation deed which you executed, conveys to the executor and executrix of Stanley, all the property, to pay the supposed creditors of your father, and states that his estate is indebted 1109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd to Stanley's executors; was that explained to you by Mr. Boys? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I had no explanation of the kind—I never entered into it—it was never suggested to me, or ever sus<lb/>pected—it was given to the prisoner under a very different impression—I agreed to make it over to him under a very different impression.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the expectation held out to you to make over the pro<lb/>perty to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That he would give me a deed of annuity of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, that he would clear the estate of the incumbrances bearing on it of 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, and Mr. Parker's bill of costs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you not, when executing the deed, to say, "I see nothing about this 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year that I am to have?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not read tie deed my<lb/>self, nor did I hear it read, except a small part, which took a very short time, and on hearing Miss Black well's name I objected to it—I omitted to state when I was in the witness-box before, that on my calling at the prisoner's, at the time Mr. Newhall was there, the prisoner took an opportunity of telling me that Mr. Newhall was a man of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and was the gentleman who was to advance the money from the City, to clear the incumbrances, and he was rather doubtful of my communicating with Mr. Newhall—Mr. Newhall left the house with me, and the prisoner requested that if he inquired where I</p>

               <p>lived, to tell him that I lived at Brompton, but he did not make such an in<lb/>quiry—while I was there Mrs. Black well just put her head into the room, and called her husband into the passage, and I heard her request him not to allow Mr. Newhall to make out the sums to be entered in the deed.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why were you to have 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year by way of annuity, if it was of no benefit to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was then at his own option to do as he pleased—he could sell it if he pleased, but he did not bold out that view to me—he said he had the means of turning it into the same comfortable residence it had been, for himself—he was to have it if he had given me the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and fulfilled his other engagements—I did not dispute that at all—if he had paid me my 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and discharged the estate from its incumbrances, I meant him to have the property, and I did not consider he would be very greatly advantaged—he has never paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of any thing—he has suffered every thing to go to ruin and destruction—I imagined that the debt of 1109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was only a consideration to give validity to the deed—I did not understand that it meant to appropriate that as a supposed debt to Stanley—I never had that pointed out to me.</p>
