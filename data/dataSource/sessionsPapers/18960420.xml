(<hi rend="italic">For</hi> £1 <hi rend="italic">for lodging and food</hi>). I put the coin in my pocket, went to Mr. Pocock's shop, and bought two pairs of boots, and paid for them with the sovereign the prisoner had given me; he said that it was bad—I went out, saw the prisoner outside, and told her she would have to come to Pocock's shop, because it was a bad coin—the went, and the manager asked her where she got it—she said, "From the Mandeville Hotel"—I asked her to give me a good one; she said she had left them on my mantelpiece—I gave her in charge.</p>

On April 3rd, about half-past ten at night, I was with Detective Tritton in Mare Street, Hackney, and saw the two prisoners, with three others, standing with their backs to an iron railing, seven or eight feet high, flush with the shop, 371, Mare Street—they were rattling at the gate; from the appearance they were trying to force the gate with their backs—they could not see us; we were concealed—there were a number of persons in Mare Street—the five men were all standing in a heap—we heard the gate go open, and then missed the two prisoners; the place was very dark; the other three moved a little way down the street—a few seconds after I heard a bursting noise, like the bursting open of a door—we crossed the road, and as we got on the kerb I saw Bayliss run out from the passage into the street, and he was arrested by Tritton; he was followed very closely by the witness, Money, in his stockings, and as he was dosing the gate he said, "You have burst open my door," and Lewinski then pushed himself behind Money into the street, where I arrested him—Lewinski had on only one India-rubber shoe—I asked what he had done with his boots—he said someone had <hi rend="italic">pinched</hi> them at Lee Bridge—one of</p>

Mare Street is a busy thoroughfare—there is a public-house right opposite the prosecutor's shop, and a good light from it—I had never seen either of the prisoners before, to my know-ledge—I have made inquiries about Bayliss; he bears a very respectable character—I think I should have been able to identify Bayliss's face even if I had not seen him come out of the passage; there was a good light—my attention was directed to the men, to see what they were going to do—I am positive that I saw Bayliss among the men, and that I saw him come out of the passage—my colleague took him into custody as he came out—he was dressed much rougher than now, and dirty and untidy—he bad boots on and a hat.</p>

On April 4th, between two and three, I was in warehouse <hi rend="italic">G</hi> at the docks—warehouse F adjoins G, and there is connection between the two—they are near Cuber Street gate, of which Roche was in charge—he had to take passes for all goods leaving the dock, and to search vans leaving the dock—no van is allowed to leave the dock unless the person in charge has a pass for whatever goods are in the van—it is Roche's duty to look in the van, and see if the things in the van correspond with the pass—I saw a four-wheeled covered van coming into the dock through Cuber Street Gate—Sullivan and two other men whom I do not know were in the van—the van stopped opposite F warehouse—one of the men got out, and, after standing in the road for a few moments, he went into the ground-floor of F, and about that time the prisoner Smith came on to the floor where I was in G, and commenced examining some old bark that stood in the cor<lb/>ner—he had no business there at that time of day—I left the warehouse and went put of the dock, and waited about the dock gate till about 3.45, when I saw the van coming from Cuber Street gate—the bags were above the van-rail, and anyone could see them as the van approached—I allowed it to proceed some way, and reach the West-end gate, when I took hold of the horse's head—Sullivan immediately threw the reins over the hone's head, and jumped out, and ran away—I pursued and caught him—no</p>

               <p>one else was in the van then—I handed him over to a constable and came back to the van, which I took into the dock—I saw in it five pepper bags, marked "X. Y. Z.," in a triangle—I said to Sullivan, "flow do you account for these?"—he said, "I don't know anything about it. I did not drive it out; the other man drove it out I was asked to drive the van by a man I do not know"—I asked him where he was going to take it; he said he did not know—I handed him over to a constable, and went back to Cuber Street gate, where Roche was on duty—I found Smith in Roche's box; he had no business there whatever—I told him I should arrest him for being concerned in stealing five bags of pepper, the property of the Dock Committee—he said, "I know nothing about it; I never stole any pepper"—I said to Roche, "A van has passed out of this gate with five bags of pepper. I have stopped it. Have you a pass for it?"—he said, "No"—I said, "What have you got to say about it?"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—with assistance, they were taken to the police-office—I was relating the circumstance of the case to Superintendent Kale at the Police-station, when Smith said, "There has been a lot of it going on, sir"—Roche was not present; he was in the outer office then—the superintendent said to Smith, "I consider it my duty to caution you that anything you may say will be taken down in writing, and may be used in evidence against you"—Smith said, "I went and delivered the bags of pepper to-day to Garwood's van; Sullivan was one of three men in charge of the van; one of the carman saw me this morning, and asked me about the pepper; I delivered it to the van; I knew it would pass out of the dock, as Roche was in the swim, I spoke to Roche about it this morning; he said it would be all right"—Kale wrote that down; it was read over to and signed by Smith—it was read over to all three prisoners after Smith had signed it; they made no reply—they were then handed over to Police Sergeant Lambert and charged—when the charge was read over to them; they made no reply—I examined Roche's box at the gate, and took possession of all the passes there; I could not find any pass for five bags of pepper.</p>

The top rail of the van in front where the bags were was five feet nine inches from the roadway—it was a covered van, with curtains at the back flying loose—I saw the bags before the van reached me—I should say a man sitting down in his box could see into the front of the van—the van was loaded 92 yards from Roche's box; it was not his direct duty to notice vans being loaded—if an empty van passed his box, it would be his duty to satisfy himself that it was empty—I don't know what he would do if he thought it was empty—when the van passed out I was over 100 yards from the box—if someone had shouted out "empty"; I should not have heard it—I have been an inspector for several years—some months past we received certain information about Roche and Smith, and in consequence they have since been under observa<lb/>tion—there is an off-license beer-house opposite Roche's box—it would be contrary to the rules of the Bock Committee for a foreman to leave the docks while on duty—it was not necessary for Smith to come towards Roche's box if he wanted to get a drink; there is another gate at the other end of the dock; it was just after four when I stopped him, and about 4.30 he would leave off work—Roche has been in the employ about nineteen years—I have heard that previously he was in the Metropolitan</p>

                  </hi>. On April 1st, at a little after seven o'clock, I was in an omnibus, going to Ludgate Circus—the prisoner was there when I got in, and sat close to me on my right—I pulled my pocket from under me, and my purse was in it then—when I rose to get out at Ludgate Circus, he rose, too—as someone was coming down the steps, I sat down, and he sat down, too—I missed my purse; he was then on my right tide, where my pocket was—I said, "My purse is gone"—he passed me and ran—I followed, and called, "Stop thief!"—he went up Fleet Street, where I lost sight of him—he was brought back two or three minutes afterwards by a constable, and I recognised him and charged him—it was a black purse, and there was a button-hook in it, and some postage stamps and 9s.</p>

                  </hi>. On April 1st, about 7.15, I was' at Ludgate Circus; a King's Cross omnibus pulled up—I was waiting to get in, and stood on one side while the passengers got out—some people got out in front of Mrs. Mitchell, and the prisoner followed just behind her, and hustled her; she said, "There, in that moment he has taken my purse"—I ran after him, and when he had got a hundred yards up Fleet Street, he got behind a <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>—I was within a yard of him; I never lost sight of him—he started to walk, but was arrested before he had taken three steps—I said in his presence, "There is the man; he has taken a lady's purse"—on the way to the station we met the prosecutrix, who said, "That is the man"—the prisoner turned to the constable, and said that he should make me responsible, and make me pay for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was not whispered; anyone standing near could hear it—it was said before and after the prosecutrix came up-more than one passenger followed her out; I believe the outside passengers had all alighted—it would not be correct to say that the only person behind her was the man who ran—I am under the impress<lb/>sion that I did not lose sight of him for an instant from the time he left the omnibus—at the moment he left the omnibus I could see everything that he did—by saying that he hustled her, I mean that he like fell on her—when I started to run, there was a cry of "Stop thief!"—if other persons ran besides me and the prisoner, they must have been behind me.</p>

About 8.45 p.m. on March 23rd, I took a woman into custody for being drunk, disorderly, and using obscene lan-guage—she went quietly for a little while, and then threw herself down opposite Gale Street, and called out, "Come along, Jack"—I was struck once on the head with a belt, and immediately after I received a wound between two fingers of my left hand, with which I held the woman—I released the woman, and turned to the prisoner, and I was stabbed in the palm of the hand, and three times in the head, through my helmet; three blows penetrated my helmet—I was exhausted from loss of blood—I was attended by the divisional surgeon, and have not since been on duty—the prisoner was not drunk—I knocked him down with my truncheon, but he got up and ran away like a deer—I am sure he is the man; you will see a mark on his left temple where I struck him—he surrendered himself to the police at Arbour Square—I could not say how often he struck at me with the knife; I guarded off a lot of blows—I only remember being struck once with the belt—I came to the conclusion that he was sober from the way he ran away.</p>

On March 24th, about 9.45, I was on duty in Farringdon Avenue, and saw the two prisoners enter from Farringdon Street for about ten yards, and return to Farringdon Street again, and stand at the bottom of take Avenue till No. 363 came round his beat, trying the doors—he then returned to Farringdon Street—as he left the Avenue the two prisoners entered and walked up the Avenue forty yards, nearly to where I was standing in the doorway of No. 11—they turned sharp, and went to the warehouse of the Marine Tile Company, No. 23—I distinctly heard the jingling of keys—they then went to No. 21, nearer to me, and again I heard the jingling of keys—they then went to No. 17, where they stopped three, or four minutes—a uniform officer entered the Avenue by Stonecutter Street, and the prisoners put their hands in their pockets and walked towards him, and so to the door where I was standing—I jumped out and seized them, and said, "I am a police con<lb/>stable"—I secured Baxter, handed him over, and chased Clark, who was running—he turned down Ludgate Circus, and came walking back—I caught hold of him, and said, "I want you"—he said, "You have made a mistake"—I took him back to where Pullen was holding Baxter—I found this life-preserver in his trousers pocket, and this piece of wire rolled up in his coat pocket—I searched for a bunch of keys, but could not find one—I saw the officer take this life-preserver from Baxter's pocket—I found no marks on the doorway—they both said, "You have made a mistake"—I said, "lam going to charge you with loitering, with intent to commit felony, and to enter the house by means of false keys"—I took them to the station, and found this key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on Clark; it fits No. 15 and No. 23—the key of No. 23 will not open No. 15, but the false key opens both—I found a key on Baxter, which opened No. 12, and these cards between his shirt and trousers—I asked what he had got them for—he said they were for small theatrical cases—I saw them sign the property-book—Clark refused his address—Baxter said he had no fixed home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am of no occupation—I live at Finborough Road, South Kensington—I was in the Board of Trade, and retired on compensation—on December 11th, 1890, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, in consequence of which I went to 26, Coventry Street, Piccadilly Circus, and saw written on the window, "<hi rend="italic">Bureau de Change. Thomas Morgan and Co.</hi>"—I went in and saw the prisoner, to whom I had written previously, and I had received a letter from him to call and see him, which I cannot find—I said, "I am prepared to go into this business with you if you will tell me all about it"—he said it was a very safe and promising genuine business for anyone to invest in, and that it was his own, and no one else was connected with it—he explained the nature of the business to me, and said, "Now here is an excellent opportunity lord you to invest your money while you can do it; I will produce the books to show you the business I am doing, and you will see for yourself while you are here, customers coming in and out, and transacting business"—he first of all said that he wanted £250 to begin with, and if I was in a poison to finance his business up to about £750, or, at the outside, £1,000, that would be ample to secure a successful business—he proposed that I should act as clerk, and have £130 a year, and if I was satisfied with the business, I might become a partner—I was to have interest on the £250—nothing was arranged that day; I went away to consider the matter—I then received this letter: "26, Coventry Street. Dear Sir,—Referring to our conver<lb/>sation, trust you have decided to accept the proposal made by me; the busi<lb/>ness is a sound and true one, and capable of further improvement with further capital"—I went and saw him next day, I think—he wanted me to advance £250 as soon as possible, which I said I would do, and I drafted an agreement, after which I gave him £250; the receipt is on it—I obtained judgment for the £250 three years afterwards, and it was, paid—about January 12th I advanced him £190 on the security of two Russian bonds; they were in my possession once, but he took them to Rothschild's and left them there; I never had them again—on February 12th I made him a further advance of £200, and on the same day £28; on April 16th, 1891, £25; and on May 11th I gave him a Brighton debenture, value £100; on June 19th, £100, and on the same day £50—the various sums make £300, and there were other sums; I have not received any of them back—I believed the business belonged to him, or I would not have made the advances—I obtained judgment in March for £1,634, including interest and other sums not mentioned—in 1884 I presented a bankruptcy petition, but allowed it to be dismissed because he said he would pay the amount and the costs—I presented another petition, and he was adjudicated bankrupt upon it—after the receiving order in October, 1895, and after he had been examined in bankruptcy, there was a motion before Mr. Justice V. Williams to inquire to whom the business belonged, and after hearing evidence on both sides it was discovered that it belonged to Miss Fostick</p>

               <p>—in October, 1895, I discovered that he was an undischarged bankrupt—he never told me so, but it came out in the proceedings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I retired from the Civil Service eight years ago, and have had no occupation since—this was the first time I advanced money to a stranger in answer to an advertisement—I never lent money before and charged interest for the loan—I have said, "I have been living partly on the interest of loans I. have made"—I meant to convey that those loans were investments secured by documents—I have bought shares, and I have one or two mortgages—I have no bills of sale—I have some of the prisoner's bills of exchange; no others—T have one I O U—after I advanced the £250 he often alluded to the business being his own, and said that he was offered £200 for the goodwill of it—I got a guarantee from Miss Fostick for £300—I sued her, but did not go on with the suit—I dropped the proceedings, but they are still pending—that was last November—the prisoner had two tape machines on his premises in Coventry Street for speculating on the Stock Exchange for the rise and fall—in these sums I have included sums I paid him for cover; I have included everything—the cover does not amount to £80—I have found out that the guarantee was worth nothing; that was in consequence of the dispute as to whose business it was—he deposited with me a policy for £100 and another for £500 after I had advanced him £400—they were policies on his life—while these proceedings were pending at the Police-court I had an interview with Mies Fostick, as she wanted to see me—I did not say that I would settle the guarantee for £500—I had two interviews with her; my solicitor was present at one—I met them accidentally at his office at the first interview, and the general matter was discussed—the object of the meeting was that I should accept a sum to settle the matter, but the meeting was accidental as far as I was concerned—I found them at the office, and money was discussed—I had another interview later on with Miss Fostick—there was a gentle<lb/>man there, but I did not understand that he was a solicitor—if I had got possession of the business I should not have brought the present proceedings; the business was the only thing I had to look to; my money was all gone—the fact of my bankruptcy was mentioned; the prisoner did not say, "I am an undischarged bankrupt," nor did I say, "That does not matter; I am an undischarged bankrupt, too"—it is nearly thirty years since I was bankrupt, and I was discharged—I made all the subsequent advances to the £250 on securities, but at the present moment they are next to worthless.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I received a letter of July, 1891, from the prisoner—that was just before July 2nd, when the £400 was advanced.

The total amount of indebtedness was settled by counsel, by consent, on March 8th, 1894, at £1,634 17s.—I was continually endeavouring to get whatever I possibly could from him, till my patience was exhausted—I got about £80 from him, but not till I took proceedings—that was not for salary—I said one day in the office, "If you won't give me satisfaction I shall make you a bankrupt"—he said he did not care whether I did or not he did not care about bankruptcy; he could take care of himself—I said, "You seem to</p>

               <p>treat bankruptcy as a very light matter, but I can tell you bankruptcy is very different now to what it was in the old days; I was once obliged to go through the Bankruptcy Court for liabilities incurred by a former partner of mine, but I got my discharge through the assistance of my friends, who, when they knew the circumstances of the case, sympathised with me, and made no opposition, and I got my discharge without asking for it"—I have never recovered one penny from Miss Fostick—that is the reason I consented to this matter being suspended.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Appoint-ing to see the witness town after two o'clock on Saturday.</hi>) I went and saw the prisoner; he said that he wanted a man, as his man was always getting intoxicated; that it was a very good business and a lot to be made out of it, and I should have to go with men with adistringas; that he had five or six a day, and sometimes had a difficulty in getting men to go—he asked me for £50 security—I said that I was not in a position to do that, but would consider it—I then received this letter: "Dear Sir, I have not decided on anyone up to eight this evening. Have to call on my solicitors. I can see you at eight o'clock"—I said that I could not give £50, as I had not got it—he asked for £35 and a bill for £15—I then received this: "Please be not later than eleven o'clock with the deposit"—I went on the 12th to 79, Newing<lb/>ton Green, the address of the first letter, and he took me to Mr. Croker—on February 15th I received this letter, in consequence of which I called at Dalmeny House on February 17th, and read this agreement for me to go into his service as general workman and shopman, bat the one he read said manager—I gave him £20 and this bill of exchange (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then went into his employment, and remained till March 21st—there were only two distresses while I was there, and the average takings of the second-hand furniture shop were 17s. or 18s. a week—Elijah Smith was there the whole time—I gave the prisoner notice to terminate the agreement, because he had not enough business to employ the men he paid my wages at 30s. to March—30s. is owing, and I got 6s.—I asked him for my money, and he gave me a fearful black eye, for which he was fined 20s. and costs—on March 17th tie brokers came into the</p>

I live at 30, Glen House, Brentford—I work at the Ealing District Steam Laundry, North Field Lane—on the afternoon of March 27th I was looking out of the laundry window—I saw a man get over a gateway or a fence—he looked round; he then went round the corner of a rick and stooped, he had something in his hand—in about three seconds he came back, and it was all smoke—he got over the gateway and stopped there till it was all ablaze, then walked towards Ealing Dean—I did not see his face; I saw his back—the man was dressed in corduroy like the prisoner, only he had a cap on—after a bit. I walked towards Ealing Dean with a young girl—I spoke to Mr. Steel's foreman about what I had seen; and he knew the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The rick is about 150 yards from the laundry—the man climbed over the fence—Martha Welsh is employed at the laundry—she was looking out at the same time—the man might have jumped over the fence—he got over somehow—I should say the rick was set fire to at the south corner—I have not had it pointed out to me—it was the furthest point of the rick from me—I do not know the Lammas Fields, nor the Recreation Ground; there are fields; I am a stranger—I have been at the laundry four months—I had been looking out of the window three or four minutes—I did not see a single boy about there, nor run<lb/>ning away—I picked the prisoner out at the station by his height and his clothes.</p>

I am a labourer, of 16, North Field, Ealing—on Friday, March 27th, I was in North Field Lane, taking a quiet walk towards Little Ealing—I stayed near the hay-stack about five minutes, when all at once I saw smoke, and instantly flames coming from the stack—I hurried towards the stack—I saw a man come out of the gate that goes into the meadow—he was dressed in drab clothes with a cap on—he walked slowly towards me and stood still suddenly—I said, "Have you seen anyone go away from the hay-stack; have you seen any boys?"—he made no reply—I said, "Did you do it?"—he said, "I saw two boys go across the fields"—he left me—I saw no one else near—I think it was the prisoner by his clothes—I could not speak to his face; he was so quick.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am one of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of London—on January 16th I presided at the South London Sessions, when George Cheeseman and Robert Warrier were arraigned on a charge of committing a robbery, on December 24th, of a van, horse, and harness, and five bags of flour—in the course of the trial, the defendant, John Parslow, a police-constable, 257 <hi rend="italic">M.</hi>, was called as a witness for the prosecution—I had before me the deposition containing his evidence before the Magistrate, Mr. Blade, and whilst he was examined before me I followed with my eye a copy of his deposition, which was in front of me—I had not the original; we never hare; we always have a copy; the original is often in Court in the hands of the Counsel for the prosecution—it would now be in the custody of the Clerk of the Peace, at Newington—I follow the evidence with the deposi<lb/>tion very carefully, and if there is a variance I take a note of it, not otherwise—I take it for granted that the defendant said what appears on the deposition; at this distance of time I cannot recollect the exact words he uttered—I followed my usual course on this occasion. <hi rend="italic">The Defendant's deposition was then put in, and read as follows:</hi>—John Parslow—On the 24th inst. I saw the prisoners at 7.45—Cheese-man driving this van in George Row, and Warrier, walking by the side—Cheeseman jumped out and ran away—from inquiries, I went to Kitchen's Wharf, Shad-Thames, and Cheeseman was called—he said, 'I know what you want me for'—I arrested him, and when charged he made no reply—Warrier was afterwards arrested, and I picked him out of several others—Cheeseman said at the station, 'I was at work at eight o'clock'—Kitchen's Wharf is 500 or 600 yards from George Row—I took the time from my watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined for Cheeseman.</hi> I looked at my watch just before I saw the van; I was twenty or thirty yards away—I saw the foreman at Kitchen's Wharf—Cheeseman was fetched—the foreman was not present at the interview, only Cheeseman, Police Constable 182 <hi rend="italic">M</hi>, and I—he said, 'I know what you want me for '—he did not ask on the way to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189604200061"/>
               <p>station what he was wanted for—Cheeseman did ask what he was wanted for—I meant that 182 <hi rend="italic">M</hi> did not ask—it was 10.45 when we got Cheeseman to the station; he was not then charged—he made no state<lb/>ment to me—he did not say he never left work till arrested—I am sure I saw him at a quarter to eight. "All that is stated in that deposition was repeated—Mr. Swann represented Cheeseman and cross-examined—this is the note I took of his cross-examination: "I saw the van 200 yards from the coffee-shop; I have known both the prisoners nine years"—the prosecution having been completed, eight witnesses were called on behalf of the prisoner—the defendant was then recalled; I took down what he said: "I returned to the station with the van between 8.36 and 8.40; the station is a mile and a half from George Row; I saw it (i.e., the van) at 8.17; the prisoners ran away at 7.45"—then there were more wit<lb/>nesses for the defence, and, in the result, both the prisoners were acquitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. I have no independent recollection of this matter; I followed my usual course of checking the evidence by the deposition; I could not positively swear to the words, of course; I should adopt the same course with regard to each witness—I think this was what is called a Court prosecution, where the depositions were handed to some learned Counsel—the prosecuting Counsel generally has the ori-ginal—William Cotter was the first witness, then Charles Lindsell, the carman—I followed his deposition in the same way, and I have one or two notes in addition—a way-note was produced; this is it; it gives the time of the carman's arrival, seven minutes past seven—if he produced a document, I should probably not take a note of it, because it would be before me; I have no note of its production—I have no note of the cross-examination of Lindsell—with regard to George Bartlett, I followed his deposition in the same way; I have no note to the contrary—the same applies to the evidence of Otway, who arrested Warner; I have no note of it—the defence was an alibi in both cases—several witnesses were called for Cheeseman, and two, I think, for Warner—Mr. Sills appeared as Counsel for Cheeseman, and Mr. Swann, I think, took his brief—the case was taken the first in the morning—I have on my note in Parelow's evi<lb/>dence, "I saw it at seventeen minutes past eight"; I think that must refer to the van—I asked him at what time the van got to the Police-station, and he said, "8.45 or 8.40."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have no note of Lindsell's cross-examination—he was cross-examined; I do not think both the prisoners were represented by Counsel; Warrier was not, or I should have taken a note of it—Mr. Geoghegan did not appear at the trial; Mr. Sills, or Mr. Swann, acted for him; I think an application was made on account of Mr. Geoghegan's absence; I can't recollect whether it was refused or not; I think it was.</p>

I am chief clerk at the Southwark Police-court—on December 26th I acted as clerk when Cheeseman and Warrier were charged—I heard the prisoner give evidence, which I took down—this is his original deposition in my writing; I took it down from what he said—on January 2nd, the day of committal, I read it over to him, and he signed it—I cannot remember whether the prisoners were represented on December 26th—on the second occasion questions were asked in cross-examination by a solicitor representing Cheeseman—Cheeseman, on that occasion, called Patrick Riley and Henry Woolridge—the case was then committed for trial to the South London Sessions, and the witnesses were bound over in the usual way—this charge-sheet was before me when Cheeseman and Warrier were committed; it was practically before the Magistrate; I marked it off on his behalf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The business at Southwark Police-court is very heavy indeed—a very large number of cases, and other business has to be got through in one day very often—on Mondays we often have from sixty to eighty cases—the charge-sheet comes to the Police-court from the inspector on duty at the Police-station; he brings it, and takes it back—all the charge-sheets are placed before me at the commencement of the business by the inspector—the inspector, or sergeant acting as in<lb/>spector, takes the charge, I believe, and puts in the charge-sheet the nature of the charge, the person making it, and signing the sheet, and the witnesses—I have no experience of charges being taken at the station—Warren is an inspector of that division, and I believe Marsh is also, I do not re<lb/>collect his name—Bank Holidays are very heavy days with us; December 26th would be a heavy day—when the prosecution is not represented by Solicitor or Counsel, sometimes a Magistrate will conduct the case, and sometimes the clerk—the Magistrate has before him a register, which in<lb/>forms his mind of what is on the charge-sheet—sometimes, when a prisoner is charged on summons, the constable is asked if he wishes to ask questions of a witness; but in indictable offences a constable has nothing to do with asking questions, the Magistrate or his clerk would do so—these cases have to be disposed of with the greatest expedition; we must get the goal delivery every day—William Cotter, who signed the charge-sheet and com<lb/>plained of the loss, was the first witness called in this case, and Lindsell, the carman, was the second—the document he produced as to his time at Addis's Wharf is annexed to the depositions—Lindsell does not seem to refer to it in his evidence, but I have no doubt it was produced on the first day; I could not say absolutely—I see no exhibit mark on it; it may be that in the hurry of business the Magistrate did not mark it as he generally does—I do not think the witnesses were ordered out of Court in this case—I believe the prisoner was in Court when Lindsell was examined; I cannot say positively—in a case of larceny, the first question usually asked is the time at which it was committed—Lindsell made a statement as to the time; he was asked questions as to the time, and cross-examined upon it, and probably, in making his last answer in cross-examination, he produced the note from Addis's Wharf—Bartlett and Otway were also called on that day—I believe the depositions were so hastily taken that the caption only deals</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189604200063"/>
               <p>with one date, and the cross-examination seems to follow as though it occurred on the same day—I or the Magistrate would have to decide how much detail of a statement would go on the depositions—we must exercise discretion as to that—a man might say a good deal more than appears on the depositions—the sentence in the depositions in Bartlett's evidence, "On 24th, in Bermondsey Street, I went with Parslow to Reed's Wharf," should be, "On 24th I was in Bermondsey Street"—the two witnesses called for the prisoners might have made statements to a certain extent—they would have been questioned by the Magistrate or me, as they appear to have been cross-examined, and no one appeared then for the prisoners—there are a great number of warehouses in the district of Shad-Thames and Bermondsey Wall, and a great many persons are engaged there in carting—I remember the prisoner as an officer in cases at our Court for several years—we have a good many cases from that district against carmen for working horses in an unfit state—the prisoner has had cases of that kind at our Police-court—I know nothing of the Carmen's Union; I never heard of it before this case—I believe Warner was not represented at the Police-court—he would be asked whether he wanted to cross-examine the witnesses—he does not appear, according to the depositions to have asked any question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We were under considerable pressure on the 26th, and probably on January 2nd, as there would be an overflow of business on remand from the 26th—questions asked by the Magistrate or me would not be under the head of cross-examination, being "By the Magistrate" or "By the Court."; but I think in this case the word cross-examination should be "By the Court"—I do not think this was a cross-examination by the Magistrate; I really cannot say.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, Parker's Buildings, Spa Road, Bermondsey—up to December 24th I had been from time to time em<lb/>ployed as a day labourer at Kitchen's Wharf, where I was paid every night—day labourers get to the wharf about 7.55 a.m., to see if they can get work for the day—on December 24th I left home about 7.45 to go to Kitchen's Wharf—I went up Parker's Buildings and the Neckinger, through Dealing Street, Rose Court, across Dockhead, into Shad-Thames, and got to the wharf about 7.55—on my way I spoke to a greengrocer, Perry, in Parker's Buildings; and in Dockhead, opposite the Feathers public-house, I met Jacques, who walked with me to the wharf, and re<lb/>mained there with me—outside the wharf were Jordan, Doughty, the engineer, and others—I stood there among them until we were called in at eight o'clock by Mr. Willoughby, the foreman at the wharf—we worked at unloading a barge of emery stones—I continued at that till 10.30—Jaques, Jordan, Doughty, and I were in one gang; Doughty was my mate with the truck—we loaded the emery atones into a truck, and then Doughty took the handles of the truck, and I shoved him up—about 10.30 Mr. Willoughby called me out; I was working in Al, just inside the door—Willoughby stood in the middle of the narrow road; it is only wide enough for two vans to pass—I went out and saw the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189604200064"/>
               <p>prisoner and another policeman, both in uniform—the prisoner said to me, "I want you, Cheeseman," and I said, "What for?"—he said, "You will know all about it when you get to the station"—I said, "Let me go and get my hat"—he said, "Oh, you will have plenty of time to get that"—he laid hold of me, and then a policeman in plain clothes came and laid hold of me on the other side, and they took me to the station—Willoughby was present during my conversation with the prisoner, and he could hear what occurred—I did not say to the prisoner, "I know what you want me for"—on the way to the station I asked the prisoner to tell me what he wanted me for; and on two or three occasions I asked him to let me walk, without showing me up along the street, as it made me look like a thief—I did not think he was going to charge me with being a thief—the prisoner did leave go of me, but the plain-clothes officer would not—I said, "Will you tell me what you want me for?"—he said, "Come along; you will know when you get to the station"—up to the time of getting to the station I did not know what I was charged with—when I got to the station, at about 10.45, I was put in the first room on the left—I again asked the prisoner what I was there for—he made no answer, only told me I was to wait there—I asked the inspector on two or three different occasions what I was there for—he did not tell me at first—twice I went to him, and he did not tell me—the prisoner was not there at that time—the prisoner left me at the station—I remained in the same room—about 2.30, I believe, the inspector sent for the prisoner to have me brought before the Magistrate—the inspector told me, the third time I asked him, about 2.30, what I was charged with—the moment I was told I sent for Willoughby—he came to the station a little after two, before I saw the prisoner again—I spoke to Willoughby, and he went in with the inspector—that was before the prisoner came back—when the prisoner came at 2.30 he brought Sweetman with him—I did not know his name then—I was still in the room on the left—the prisoner opened the door of the room about half-way, and pointed me out—I holloaed out, "It is not fair, Parslow"—Constable Griffin was in the room with me at the time—a con<lb/>stable, sitting near the door, got up and shut it, and shoved the prisoner and Sweetman out—I cannot swear if that was Griffin, or what constable it was—I was sitting on a fixed seat against the wall, near the fire, because I was wet through; I was taken in the pouring rain—there was a table in the room under the window; I was on the opposite side of the room to the table—I remained in the room till about five o'clock, when I was placed with a lot of men who were brought into that room—as I got off my chair, Otway said, "Cheeseman, you can place yourself where you like"—I said, "I don't want to move," because I knew I had been pointed out already—the prisoner was there then, and a short stout inspector, and about a dozen men—Sweetman was brought in and told to pick out the thief, or words to that effect—he failed to pick anybody out—he was asked three times to see, and he said, "No, he is not here"—the inspector said, "Have another good look round"—and he had another good look and said, "No, he is not here"—the inspector said to the prisoner, "Are you satisfied?"—I don't know what the prisoner said, bat he went out some little time after—the other man and Sweetman went out—I remained in the room for another half-hour or more, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189604200065"/>
               <p>then the prisoner took me into the next, room and charged me in the presence of the same inspector—Mr. Cotter was there, and Lindsell, the carman, was brought in while the inspector was writing down the charge—I did not know who Lindsell was till I was tried at Surrey Sessions—when Lindsell came in I asked him if he knew me—he said, "No"—I said, "Have you ever seen me before?"—he said, "No"—I could not say exactly if he remained in the room; I was too much upset when I heard the charge—the inspector went on writing, and then asked Mr. Cotter to sign it; he refused at first; then he and the inspector had some conversation, which I did not hear, and Mr. Cotter said he would sign it on those conditions, and he did so—I don't think the charge was read out to me from the sheet; but I heard that the prisoner charged me with thieving a horse and van and five sacks of flour—I believe the time first mentioned at the station was 7.40—I heard the time mentioned at Southwark Police-court as 7.45—I was then taken to the cells—it was about six o'clock—I was detained in custody that night, and the next day, Christmas Day, and night, and on Boxing Day morning, December 26th, I was brought before Mr. Slade at South wark Police-court; and then Warrier was placed beside and charged with me—I heard the evidence given by Mr. Cotter, the prisoner, and others on that day—I was not professionally represented—the case was remanded for a week—I asked for bail, and the Magistrate granted it—on January 2nd I surrendered upon the remand—I was then repre<lb/>sented by a solicitor—in the meantime the London Carmen's Union had taken charge of the case for me, and at their expense I was represented—the witnesses for the prosecution were, recalled and cross-examined, and then Riley and Woolridge were called for me—they are here—I and Warrier were committed for trial to the Sessions, which began on January 15th—I surrendered to take my trial on the 16th—the prisoner gave evidence against me, and he and Bartlett, the plain-clothes officer, swore the same against me as they did at the Police-court—a number of witnesses were called for me—Mr. Geoghegan was to have defended me, but he was not there, and Mr. Swann defended me—I asked to have the case postponed, as Mr. Geoghegan was not there—both Warrier and I were acquitted—it is not true that at 7.45 a.m. on December 24th I was driving a van in George Row, or that Warrior was walking by the side, or that I jumped out of the van and ran away; or that I stole a van standing outside Reed's Wharf on that morning—I have known the prisoner for about six years, and he has known me for that time by sight and to speak to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known him as a constable in this district—I have spoken to him at times—I never had the slightest quarrel or differ<lb/>ence or dispute with him—neither he nor anyone else ever had a case of any kind against me—I don't think I had seen the prisoner for two months before the day I was locked up; I would not be positive when I had last seen him—if a man wants work as a dock labourer he goes to one of the wharf gates on the chance of getting a day's work—the employ<lb/>ment there is by the day; it is not regular employment—there are plenty of constant men there regularly; extra men, who are paid every night, go and get taken on when they are wanted for extra work—I was not a constant man—extra hands go or not, just as it suits them—I have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189604200066"/>
               <p>been getting work in this way at the docks as an extra hand for about ten months—bad luck drove me to the water-side—I have been principally to Kitchen's Wharf—I don't think I have done two days' work at any other wharf—I think it was about the middle of last year when I first went to the water-side to work; it took me a little time before I could get a job—a man does not get a job the first time he shows his face—I first got a job at the docks as a dock-labourer twenty-three or twenty four years ago; I commenced working there again last year, after eleven years in business—I have worked at Kitchen's Wharf now for about six months; I went there first three or four months before Christmas, as far as I recollect—I worked there as often as they wanted me; I don't think I have lost a day's work this month, only for the holidays—I don't know how many days a month I worked in October, November, and December; if there was work I worked six days a week—I am in pretty fair regular work now—for three months before Christmas I was in pretty fair regular work—a day or two, now and then, I might not have been on, through slackness, but, as a rule, I got a pretty fair turn of work there—before working at the docks I had been a master carman up to January, 1895; I lost about seven horses in five months—for some little time after I ceased to be a master carman I did a little dealing in horses and vans, and anything I could buy—that lasted three or four months, and then I took to the water-side—as a master carman I drove vans—I had also been a greengrocer and fishmonger—I had been a master carman, a man that took work, about eight or nine years, I should think; and I have had greengrocer's and fishmonger's shops, and horses and carts—at the time I was a fishmonger I drove my own horse and cart, and got a job when I could—I did regular work for a big man in Mark Lane when I was a master carman—I have done dealing for nearly twenty years, not in any particular place—I have heard about robberies of vans and flour, at the end of October, November and December; I don't know how it was done—I have heard vans have been stolen in Shad Thames—Horsley down is close by where I work, and Bermondsey Wall—I only heard of the one being stolen from Shad Thames—I did not hear of one being stolen from Bermondsey Wall, or from East Lane, or George Row, or from Artillery Street—I had been at work on the Monday before the 24th—I cannot say how many days I had worked the week before; I was at work the week before—on December 23rd I got to Shad Thames about 7.55, and went to work at eight—when Willoughby comes to the wharf he first opens the door at the bottom, and goes to his office and opens the door on the first floor—there might be twenty or more men outside, waiting for employment—a man might look about to see which is the busiest place; but a man who has got a turn of work stands by one place—the foreman knows the men he wants—he comes to the door and calls in those he wants; the other men are not allowed to come in, and they would move away to some other place—I cannot say whom I met going to work on the Monday, or on the days of the week before that I went to work—Hickman's Folly is a turning out of George Row; you can come through there into Dock head—I spoke to Jacques right opposite the Feathers, and right opposite the top of Rose Court—the Feathers would be within a few minutes' walk from Kitchen's Wharf—between seven and nine in the morning there is much traffic in the streets about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189604200067"/>
               <p>these wharves; it is a pretty busy neighbourhood about Dockhead and round there, at eight and before—I don't say it is difficult to get along then for vans, it is for people—I don't think it is very difficult to get along with vans in the morning along Dockhead—the water-side is a very busy place in the morning with traffic; Bermondsey Wall is a busy place—a decent horse would walk from Reed's wharf to the Ber<lb/>mondsey Police-station in about ten minutes—I should not think they are more than three-quarters of a mile apart—a man would want a good deal of <hi rend="italic">knocking along</hi> if it took him twenty minutes—there is a way to come out of Reed's Wharf where you would not have much traffic—I don't think I ever saw Bartlett, the plain-clothes man, before he came to the wharf, but I think he had a lot of ill-will towards me, or else he would not have said what he did—I did not see him go up to, or be with, Wil<lb/>loughby—I do not know that he told Willoughby what he wanted me for—I never heard that—I heard he went up to Willoughby's office—Wil<lb/>loughby was in the middle of the road when he said, "Cheeseman, you are wanted"—it was raining pretty sharp, enough for me to get very near wet through before I got to the station, and it was not very long before that that we had to go and put our coats on—Willoughby came into the road and called me out, and he stayed there till the police took me away—I left him standing there—there was another uniform constable besides the prisoner—I did not see Bartlett there till the prisoner seized me, and he came on the other side very quick—I do not know where he came from—the prisoner took me in custody at once, after I had asked him what he wanted me for, and he had said I should know when I got to the station, and I had asked to get my hat—he did not let me get it—I was looking the prisoner foil in the face at this time—I don't think I addressed him by name when I said, "What do you want me fort"—I was wearing a cap at the time—on my way in the morning I had worn this hard felt hat—I was dressed as I am now, except that my trousers were tied up—the other uniform officer was with the prisoner just outside the office door—I had seen that other officer before—I don't know his name—I don't think he had any grudge against me; he never spoke a word, and took no part in it—he followed me—it rained all the way to the station—when I got to the station I was not taken to the in<lb/>spector's room, but to the room where I stayed—I don't know that any<lb/>thing was said to the inspector about my being brought there—I went and asked him two or three times—I asked the prisoner several times in the room to tell me what they wanted me for—I was never told the charge till the inspector told me at 1.30—the prisoner and the plain<lb/>clothes man told me I should know when I got to the station—the in<lb/>spector did not, in my presence, ask anything about the case, or tell the prisoner to go and fetch the prosecutor—the inspector did not tell me to wait until the prosecutor was sent for—I was taken to the room, and the prisoner went through to the inspector—the inspector did not tell me that the prosecutor could not attend till 2.30—I saw Mr. Cotter, the prosecu<lb/>tor, there at one o'clock, and I did not know who he was—the inspector did not tell me that—Constable Griffin sat by the door of the room; I have known him for a number of years, and could speak to him—we should address each other by name—I don't know if he was looking after me; I did not want any looking after—I saw another constable in the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at F Block, Peabody Buildings, and work at Kitchen's Wharf—on the morning of December 24th, at 7.45, I left home, and on my way to Kitchen's Wharf I met Cheeseman at about 7.48, opposite the Feathers—he had come up from Rose Court towards work—I walked with him to Kitchen's Wharf; we got there about 7.52 or 7.53—we remained outside till eight, when Willoughby came out to choose his men—I and Cheeseman were among those chosen, and we went in at eight o'clock—we worked in the same gang till 10.30, when Cheese-man was called out—he had not left the gang on the wharf from 8 till 10.30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was spoken to about giving evidence when the solicitor's clerk came to the wharf two or three weeks afterwards—I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189604200071"/>
               <p>asked about this particular day—I used to go early in the morning to Kitchen's Wharf to try to get work; I got work there pretty regularly—I did not try other wharves if I did not get work there—I got work there on this morning—I was not at the Police-court—I go to the wharf by Abbey Street, Parker's Row, and Dockhead—I walk on the left-hand side to the post-office, just before you get to the Feathers, and then I cross—I was not in a hurry that morning—it was muzzling with wet—I had walked with Cheeseman on other occasions to Kitchen's Wharf—it would take three or four minutes to get from where I met him to the wharf, and it would take about the same time to get to George Row—the week before this I had worked every day at Kitchen's Wharf—I had been work<lb/>ing there for six years; I was not a regular man, but I got a job pretty well every day—men who have been there a long time can get it—I had seen Cheeseman working there for three or four months, as a day labourer, I should think—men who come there do not get taken on every day at first; the old hands work their way up—about fourteen of us have worked there for a considerable time—sometimes there are more than twenty men outside the gate in the morning; on ordinary mornings there are about sixteen—they are all taken on sometimes, sometimes none are—sometimes they only want a few people, and then the old hands would be sure to get the turn.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 158, Waller Grove, New Cross—I am foreman at Kitchen's Wharf, and have been engaged there ten years—I get to work at eight in the morning—I arrive at the premises at four or five minutes to eight; work commences at eight—I remember the morning of December 24th last—I got to the wharf at three or four minutes to eight that morning—I saw several men standing outside; they were Kirk, She a, Harding, Cheeseman, and several others whom I didn't notice at the time—I am able to say that Cheeseman was there—he had been employed as a day labourer at the wharf for some months past—at eight o'clock I went to the door and opened it for the purpose of calling in the labourers whom I was to select for the day—I did that at eight o'clock—I nodded to those I selected; sometimes I call them by name—I can give you the names of half-a-dozen or more'; they were She a, Emmett, Jaques, Doughty, Jordan, Cheeseman, Gerard, and some others; I believe eighteen in all—Cheeseman came in and went to work—he remained at work there up till about 10.30 that morning—he did not leave the wharf or his work up till that time—about 10.30 a plain-clothes man and two uniformed constables came to the wharf; they were Bartlett, who was in plain clothes, and Parslow, and 150 M, I don't know his name; they were in uniform—Bartlett came to the office on the first floor just as I opened the door; the other two were not within hearing—after Bartlett had spoken to me I went down and saw the other two constables, and called Cheeseman—Parslow said, "I want you, Cheese-man"—Cheeseman said, "What do you want me for?"—Parslow said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189604200072"/>
               <p>"You will know all about that when you get to the station"—Cheeseman said again, "Can't you tell me now, what have I done?"—Parslow re<lb/>peated his remark—Cheeseman was wearing a cap all over his face; Parslow walked him up the street away from the wharf, and Bartlett walked up behind; I think he was on the other side of the road when they passed these remarks—the other constable in uniform walked away from the wharf, I believe in the same direction as the others, but I did not take that notice—I don't think he was sufficiently near to hear what passed—he was about a dozen or fifteen feet, I should think, from us—I was present all the time—it is not true that Cheese-man said to Parslow, "I know what you want me for"—it is not true that I was not present during the interview between Parslow and Cheeseman; later on the same day I went to Bermondsey Street Police-station—I got there just after two—I saw a constable first in the waiting-room; I spoke to him—I next saw an inspector as he passed through the waiting-room—he spoke to me—Parslow was not there at that time—I saw Cheeseman on that occasion; I spoke to him, and he spoke to me—Griffin, the policeman in charge, was there—he sat on a chair at the side—I merely said to Cheeseman, "You will be all right presently"—I was told to wait there till I saw another inspector—I then went into the inspector's office—I got there about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I then left the station—during the time I was there I did not see the defendant—I did not go back again that day—I was a witness at the Sessions on Cheeseman's trial, and was also a witness before the Magistrate in this ace.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not before the Magistrate on the 26th, when Cheeseman was charged at the Police-court—I believe I first made a statement in this case to the solicitor of the Carmen's Union just after Christmas, I can't remember exactly—I must have made a statement before I went to the Police-court—I think it was two or three days after Christmas; it was made at the wharf—I do not know why I did not go to the Police-court; I was suspended to the Sessions—I was not asked to go to the Police-court—I saw the solicitor to the Carmen's Union two or three times, at the wharf—I don't know where the Carmen's Union meet—I knew Cheeseman as a carman—he had a horse and van of his own at one time; that was about twelve months ago, I should think—I have known him several years in Bermondsey; I had no business with him—I first gave him employment as a dock labourer some<lb/>where about August—I was only in Court here on Saturday for about a minute—when I go to the office of a morning I go to the foot of the iron gate to see whether any barges had arrived in the night—afterwards I go to the office—if there were any men there connected with the office I should see them, but they were not there; in the ordinary way, I should see the men belonging to the barges; then I go to the office, open the doors, take the letters out of the box, and put them on the desk—I have to determine each morning how many men I have to take on—I have only been late at the office three times in ten years, and that only a minute, or perhaps two minutes—Mr. Kitchen is my employer—I gave Cheeseman work in August or September—I cannot say how many days he worked in September; I should say three weeks; I have not the parti<lb/>culars; I suppose they are available—they are entered in a book; that</p>

               <p>would show each day and each name—I looked at the book yesterday; I cannot say from memory how many days he worked in September—an in<lb/>spector asked me to look at the list; I called it out to him, and he put it on paper—it might have been only eleven days that he worked in Sep<lb/>tember; I have a lot of things to look after—on this morning, when the plain-clothes man and the two policemen came, the two policemen were in the street, standing together—the plain-clothes man did not tell me that Cheeseman was wanted for being concerned in a van robbery; I did not know he was a policeman; he told me so afterwards—he came up the stain to the office, and said, "Do you know a man named Cheeseman?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Do you know anything about him?"—I said, "No, only that he has worked here," and I said to him, "Do you? What do you want to know for?"—he said, "I am an officer from Bermondsey Street"—I said, "Anyone might say that"—he said, "I will prove it to you, if you will look out of that window; there are two officers in the street"; I looked out of the loop-hole; it is not a window, and there were two officers there—he said, "Have you any idea where he was this morning; when he was at work?"—I said, "He is at work"—he said, "Oh, is he?"and he looked surprised—he said, "I will tell my mate," and he went down into the street; that was all that was said; I don't think I spoke to him afterwards; I don't believe I did that morning—up to that time I did not know that any robbery had been committed—Parslow asked me to call Cheeseman out—I can't re<lb/>member whether I have ever said that before to-day; perhaps I was not asked the question—Bartlett said, "I will go down and tell my mate"—he did not tell me what he went down for—if that is in the deposition it is a mistake—I said to him, "Who an you I"—I spoke to him in a gen<lb/>tlemanly manner—he said, "I am an officer"; I said, "How am I to know that? Anybody might tell me that"—I said that in a genial manner—I don't think I knew what Cheeseman was wanted for till later in the day; I was wondering what he was wanted for all the morning—Bartlett might have told me that he was wanted for a van robbery, but I can't re<lb/>member exactly; I can't recollect every word he said; I won't say he did not tell me; I think he must have done it—I spoke to Parslow when I came down; I remember asking him if he had got the right man, if he was sure he had got the right man—he had not got anybody at that time, but he had already asked me to call Cheeseman out, so that I must have been told by Bartlett; I did not have any conversation with Parslow, not above half a dozen words; I asked him if he was sure he had got the right man, because I thought this man would not do such a thing—I had not been told what part he had taken in it; I had not been told any particulars then—the time I told you was a quarter to eight when this occurred—I knew that Cheeseman had been at work that morning, I don't think I asked when—as far as I know, my memory is good—I should not think the plain-clothes man could hear what I said to Parslow; he may have heard; I don't think he could—the uniform man did not say anything; he was standing beside Parslow, about a couple of feet apart, when I came down—Parslow was in the road, the other man was on the pave<lb/>ment—they were two or three feet apart the whole time—I did not hear Trinder's evidence before the Magistrate—when I looked</p>

               <p>out of the loop-hole I saw him—I mentioned the van before the Magistrate—the truck was about six yards away—the plain-clothes man was six yards away, but may have heard; it was only a narrow road—I cannot recollect exactly whether I said before the Magistrate about the plain-clothes man going or being behind the van—I cannot remember if I mentioned the van at the Police-court—I had heard a good deal of van robberies that had taken place about that time; vans driven away, the flour disposed of in some way, and then the vans turned loose—that has been going on for some eighteen months or two years—I cannot remember if there were five between September and December—there has not been any flour robbery since December, to my knowledge—a van of tea was stolen last week—it was not raining hard; I do not believe it was raining at all; I cannot remember that exactly—I went just outside the office door—I don't think it was raining fast, or I should have remembered it—I should not trouble about sheltering if it were raining; I should do my work just the same—when the men are unloading a barge in the rain they wear mackintoshes—I don't remember if they had their coats or mackintoshes on before this happened—they generally work without coats if it is not raining—Cheeseman was working under cover—I heard what passed between Parslow and Cheeseman; the other uniform man stood beside them—I walked just inside the door and called Cheeseman, and then walked back—the prisoner said, "Cheeseman, I want you," and Cheeseman said, "Want me! What do you want me for?"—Parslow said, "You will know all about that when we get to the station"—Cheeseman said, "Cannot you tell me what I have done?"—I did not like to interfere and tell him; it did not matter to me; I did not know anything about it, and I was not asked the question—I did not say at the Police-court that Cheeseman said, "Cannot you tell me what I have done?"—the prisoner and Bartlett walked Cheeseman off—I did not notice whether Bartlett caught hold of Cheeseman's arm—I don't know what became of the third, uniform, man—I went about my business upstairs to the office in the wharf—later in the day I heard full particulars of the case from half-a-dozen men in the street about Shad Thames—I did not see Cheeseman's son; his younger son came to me at two o'clock, and I went to the station—I heard he was brought up on the 26th—I saw him during the remand employed at the wharf—I knew when he had to go to the Police-court on the remand—after the committal I saw him—I only made a note in the time-book on the morning of the 24th of the time the men came on—I know Warrier by sight as a man about Shad Thames—I have seen him about there for some time—some times men are taken on at the wharf later in the day if a barge comes in, but very seldom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have no doubt as to the hour at which Cheeseman came on that morning—I have looked at the book, which tells the hour at which the men come on—the prisoner was employed at the wharf between his arrest and his discharge at the Sessions—after his committal I had a subpart, and I went and gave evidence—on December 24th, when I first spoke to the plain-clothes man, I was on the first-floor, outside the office-door—the office is in the corner of one of the warehouse floors—I talked to him for a few minutes—I cannot remember if Bartlett said anything then about the charge—he went downstairs before me—I followed him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189604200075"/>
               <p>almost immediately—I don't think I spoke to him after I got down—I only spoke to the prisoner after I got down; a minute after I spoke to him Cheeseman was called out—I must have been told the charge against Cheeseman at the wharf, before he was called out; I think Bartlett most have told me upstairs—I cannot be quite certain about it, but that is the best of my memory—I remember 7.45 being mentioned as the time of the robbery; I cannot remember for certain when it was mentioned, or by whom.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 57, Marborough Road, Old Kent Road—I am foreman at Reed's Wharf, where I have been employed for thirty-three years and three months—on the morning of December 24th, one of Simmond's and Cotter's vans, driven by Lindsell, arrived at the wharf at 7.52—it had already in it five bags of flour—Lindsell brought with him this delivery order, which entitled him to receive twenty bags of flour</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189604200077"/>
               <p>from the wharf—after showing me the order, he took it into the office to have marked upon it the time of his arrival, and left it there—after he had been to the office I saw and spoke to him—the breakfast hour at Reed's Wharf is from eight to 8.30—there was not time to load twenty sacks between 7.52 and eight, so I made a statement to Lindsell, and he went away from the wharf, leaving his van, containing five sacks of flour, outside the wharf in Mill Street—I saw it there—I was there between eight and 8.30 that morning—I last saw the van in front of the wharf in Mill Street about 8.15—I did not see it taken away—Sweetman, a watch-man, was on duty at this time—it was his duty to look after this wharf and the lower one between eight and 8.30—after 8.15 I was still on the premises—I speak most positively to the van being there up to about 8.15—I next saw it at 8.33, where it was just backed in ready for loading at the Mill Street wharf—Lindsell was there then—the prisoner came up alone, I believe; it was the first time I had seen him that morning—he said to Lindsell, "Bring your van to the station"—Lindsell drove the van away—he came back with it at 9.15, and then it was loaded with the twenty bags and driven away—it would be the carman's duty to have marked on the delivery order the hour at which he came back from the station to load the flour, and the time at which he left the wharf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I presume the time is put on the orders at every wharf—if the van were at Addis's Wharf that morning the order would show what time the van left—I think the Addis's Wharf order shows 7.30—that wharf is also on Bermondsey Wall, lower down—7.52 it the time this order was deposited with us; it would be the time the order gets to the clerk in the office—I heard of several flour robberies outside this wharf shortly before this one; vans were driven away, the flour taken out, and then the vans abandoned—that was during September, October, November and December—no flour robberies have come under my notice in that district since December—I do not rely on documents for the times I speak of—I rely on the times I saw the carman—two or three days before January 16th I was asked to recall what had taken place on that morning—I said before, "I take my minute recollection from the time entered in the books; without that help I should be unable to fix the time so definitely"—that is true—I get the time 8.33 because the men were five minutes late going to breakfast, and I took the time when they should be back; and just as the van was going to load the constable came—it was 8.33 or 8.35, I could not answer for two minutes—I was waiting to call the men in from breakfast when I saw the constable—I remember the time was exactly 8.33—I looked at my watch just at the time, and then saw the van being: backed in—the watchman had nothing to do but walk between the two wharves—six vans were loaded at the wharf that morning previous to Lindsell's—to my knowledge, at breakfast-time only, this particular van was outside the wharf, and at 8.30 there were others, but not at eight—no other orders were passed then—it is the watchman's duty to look after the wharf, not after the outside vans; the carmen must look after their own vans—the watchman is outside, between the upper and lower wharves, in Bermondsey Wall—the van must have been got from the upper wharf, down Bermondsey Wall, and to the end of George Row, and have come back over the same ground—George Hammond, one of the weekly men,</p>

               <p>first told me the van had been stolen, and after that the watchman told me he had seen it taken away—he told me that about 8.28; I cannot say to a minute, but I came from my breakfast about five minutes before the half-hour—the van was in such a position that it could be easily led away in a moment—Sweetman told me he had seen a man get up into the van and drive it away—he said he was stationed in the narrow way of Ber<lb/>mondsey Wall, and a strange man drove the van away, and another man ran alongside of it, and they passed him, and from there he (Sweetman) went to a coffee-shop in the corner to see if the carman was there—he said the van was taken along too quick for him to stop it, and he well knew the carman—he said it was going at a trotting pace; it happened to be a clear thoroughfare—the lower wharf is 200 or 300 yards from the upper wharf; there are two or three wharves in between; I have not measured the distance—it is a straight line between the upper and lower; you can stand and see from one to the other—he said he knew both the men by sight—he never told me their names; I made no inquiry—I do not know if a boy was supposed to have been left in charge of this van; I think not—I heard that Lindsell asked a boy to look after the van, when he went to his breakfast, and I said to the boy, "How is it the van went?"—the boy was with another van there—my master is Mr. Reed—he came to the wharf that morning at nine o'clock—when he heard about this he saw Sweetman—Sweetman said he went to one coffee-shop, and could not find the man, and then went to another, and found him there—the nearest coffee-shop would be the one at the corner of the lane—the carman was at the one in George Row—I saw Sweetman there at 8.15 and 8.30; he went to his breakfast at 8.30, and was back by nine—he had gone to his breakfast when the prisoner came—the prisoner said to me, "I know the two men, and I will have them"—I don't know if he made inquiries of Lindsell as to whose van it was; he did not do so in my presence—I did not tell the prisoner there was someone else who knew the men—the prisoner came there about 8.33—at times there is a good deal of traffic about these streets in the morning—the carman drew the van out; I don't know if he got on it after it got out of my sight—I did not see him get on it—I should say it would take about twenty minutes to walk a horse and van from the upper wharf to the Bermondsey Police-station at that hour, with the ordinary traffic about—the shortest way would be through Artillery Street, I should fancy—instantly the prisoner came up he said to Lindsell, "Bring your van to the station," and he went—the prisoner told me who the men were, and that he would arrest them—as far as I know now, I said nothing—the van got back at 9.15—when Sweetman came back from breakfast he did not give me further particulars about the robbery; he went about his work—he said he did not follow the van—the van had not come back at that time—I asked no further particulars of him when he came back from breakfast, and he gave me none—Sweetman came back and had the conversation with me, and went away to his breakfast before the van returned, so that he did not wait to give the carman any information—I do not know if Mr. Reed saw Sweetman again a few days afterwards—shortly afterwards Sweetman left the employment of his own accord, without notice—I saw the prisoner when he came to the wharf, between one and two—he made no inquiry about the boy who was supposed to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189604200079"/>
               <p>look after the van; I did not tell him anything about that boy—he asked me if I would allow Sweetman to go to the station, and I said "Certainly"—I saw the boy about there—I have heard of van robberies taking place between the lower and upper wharves, and elsewhere in Bermondsey Wall—I did not go to the Police-court in this matter—the men came back from breakfast at 8.35, and some at 8.30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I gave evidence at the Sessions—I understood the boy mentioned was quite a small boy with a carman in charge of one of Chambers's vans—I first saw the boy there at 8.25—I did not mention him to the prisoner—Sweetman's duty would be confined to watching the upper and lower wharves between eight and 8.30, and he would be en-titled to go to his breakfast after the men returned from theirs at 8.30.</p>

I live at 76, Abbey Street, Bermondsey, and am a carman in the employ of the Bermondsey Vestry—on December 24th, at 8.32, as near as I can guess, I was in George Row—I fix the time because when I left our foreman said, "Joho," which means blow up to go to break<lb/>fast, and we go to breakfast from 8.30 to nine—our wharf is in George Row, at the bottom of East Lane—we shoot our dust there—I had been at the wharf that morning, and when the foreman gave the signal for breakfast I went into George Row, and I saw Woolridge stop a horse and van in the middle of the four cross roads—I know the prisoner well—he was not there, or near there, at the time—I saw Lindsell come up—I do not know Sweetman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Stork's Road, Bermondsey—I am employed by the Bermondsey Vestry as a dustman—on the morning of December 24th I started my first load in Oxley Street, and took it to the Vestry Wharf to deliver into the barge; my carman is Basil—I got to the wharf a few minutes after eight—we finished shooting the refuse about 8.25, and by the time I had got ray ticket for the foreman in the office, he had just sung out, "Joho," which meant we were to go to breakfast; that was 8.30—I then went down East Lane towards home, and I saw a coal merchant or hawker, Woolridge, stopping a horse con<lb/>nected with a van, which had flour in it, at the bottom of George Row—I saw no policeman there; I am quite sure.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sedan Street, Walworth—on December 24th I was employed at Reed's Wharf to load vans—I went on duty at eight o'clock—from 8 to 8.30, the breakfast hour, I had to watch the lower wharf—I walked up and down; I could see what happened outside the upper wharf—I first saw Simmonds and Cotter's one-horse van at eight o'clock outside A warehouse in the upper wharf—at 8.15, as near as I can say, I saw that van driven away by one man, while another walked by the side—I should know the men again if I saw them—Cheeseman was not one of them, nor was Warrier (whom I know by sight) the other—they went up George Row, passing me within about three feet—I went to Waitman's coffee-shop, but not finding there anyone who knew any<lb/>thing of the van I went to Mitchell's coffee-shop, where I saw Lindsell</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189604200084"/>
               <p>-having his breakfast—I spoke to him, and he ran out after the van—I ran behind him—when I saw the van again it was about the middle of George Row—I saw Woolridge, a coalman, stop it—I went up—Woolridge, two dustmen, Lindsell, and other people were there—I stopped there about five minutes, and then Lindsell took the van back to the wharf, and I went to the coffee-shop and had breakfast—up to that time I had not seen the prisoner—no policeman was among the people when the van was stopped—it was about 8.30 when it was stopped; I should think it was about 8.25; it could not have been earlier than that, and it could not have been later than 8.30—after having breakfast I went back to the wharf—I got there about 8.40—I then saw the prisoner, Silverside, Pink, and Lindsell—the prisoner said he wanted my name and address—on the same day, about 1.45, I saw the prisoner outside the lower wharf—he said he wanted me to go to the station with him to identify a man—I walked with him there—on the way he said the man I had to identify was a big, stout man, with dark clothes, no whiskers, legs tied up, and a cap, and that his name was Cheeseman; and he said, "Now, don't be frightened to identify him; I have seen Mr. Cotter; there is £50 reward for the man who catches these thieves"—I said, after hearing the description, that Cheeseman could not be the man—when we got to the station the prisoner opened a door just at the top of the steps, and said, "There is Cheeseman; there is the man I want you to identify"—when he opened the door I could see Cheeseman—a policeman inside the door shoved it to, and said, "You ought to know better, Parslow, than to fetch a witness in like that"—I got to the station about 1.55, and stopped there till 5.45 in a room on the other side of the station to that where Cheeseman was—at 5.45 I was called into the inspector's office, where I found a number of men, among whom was Cheeseman, and I was asked by the sergeant to identify the thief—he said, "Have a look round; don't be frightened; have a good look round"—he was the only person who spoke to me; three times he told me to look round—I said the man was not there whom I had seen driving the van—the man I was asked to identify was supposed to be the man who had been driving the van, but he was not—at 10.10 that evening I got a telegram, asking me to go again to the Police-station, and I went—the prisoner was there—Warrier was placed with a number of other men, and I was asked to identify him, but I did not do so—the man whom I saw driving the van was a man of about my own height and stamp, with a full face, slight moustache, long overcoat, bowler hat, a bird's-eye handkerchief; the man walking by the side was a tall, thin man, with a cap, a cloth coat and waistcoat, cord trousers, and a plaid scarf round his neck—in my judg<lb/>menta, neither of those men resembled Cheeseman in appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The gates of the wharves were shut—I was alongside the lower wharf, standing on the path outside, in Bermondsey Wall—there have been recent robberies in this neighourhood—I had heard that people had driven away flour-vans, got rid of the flour, and then turned the vans loose—they had occurred shortly before this, and just in this neighbourhood—I saw three vans outside the upper wharf at eight o'clock—Simmonds and Cotter's van had five sacks of flour in it, the other two were empty—Simmonds and Cotter's van was nearest the upper wharf—I have no doubt that van</p>

I have been in the Police force for twenty years—on December 24th I came to Bermondsey Police-station at 8.55; the prisoner was then leaving it—I reported myself to Burbage, and from instructions he gave me, I followed the prisoner—I was in plain clothes—the prisoner gave me information about the robbery, and I went with him to look for Cheeseman—I first went to a place in Prince's Road about ten minutes' walk away, where Laxton, a carman, was—the prisoner made inquiries there—from there we went, five or</p>

               <p>seven minutes' walk, to Talbot's, where Cheeseman's brother was work-ing, and the prisoner made inquiries there—I did not see Cheeseman's brother there—the prisoner then made some inquiry from a man who was loafing about there, and we subsequently went to Kitchen's wharf—there I went up alone into the office, and saw Willoughby, and explained what we came about—after some conversation he called Cheeseman—the men were working on the opposite side of Shad Thames—when Cheese-man came out he walked straight to the prisoner, who was some distance up the road, and said, "I know what you want me for"—I did not see any other officer there in uniform—when Willoughby had called Cheeseman out he walked straight up the road towards the office—it was raining very hard at this time—I heard the prisoner tell Cheeseman that he would be charged with being concerned with two other men not in custody in stealing a horse, van and harness, and five sacks of flour—Cheeseman said, "Allow me to go back and get my hat"—I said, "We will send for it when we get to the station"—he had on a grey cap at that time—he was told again on the way to the station what he would be charged with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We only called at the place where Cheeseman's brother worked to make inquiries; we were not thinking of arresting the brother—I did not know who the prisoner wanted to arrest—he said he had known the man for nine and a-half years, and was positive of him, and I was sent to help him arrest him—the prisoner went in to where the brother worked; he did not know whether it was that Cheeseman or the other, I suppose—when he came out he did not tell me the result of his inquiries—when I went to Kitchen's wharf I told Willoughby that the offence was committed between 7.40 and 7.45; that was what the prisoner told me—I believe Willoughby asked me what time it was committed—I said before the Magistrate, "I told him (Willoughby) I wanted Cheese-man on a charge of stealing a horse and van; Willoughby did not ask me what time the offence was said to have been committed; I did not say between eight and nine; in reply, Willoughby did not say that Cheese-man was there at work at eight"—I asked what time he booked on—I was not surprised to hear it was eight o'clock; that was the time Willoughby told me—I told Willoughby the offence was committed about 7.45, I am sure, and he said he had booked on at eight—I cannot recollect whether I told him the time—I did not have time to go and tell the prisoner what Willoughby said about his booking on at eight—I told the prisoner that Willoughby had told me that Cheeseman was at work at eight—he did not express surprise—I did not know whether Cheese-man was the right man or not—when Cheeseman was called out, Willoughby, without waiting to hear what was said, walked straight back into his office; I swear that; and Cheeseman came straight over to the prisoner—on the way to the station Cheeseman twice asked the prisoner what he wanted him for; and he told him the charge again on both of those two occasions—Cheeseman was quite sober; I can give no explanation of why he asked a second time—it took about twelve minutes to go from Kitchen's wharf to the station—he asked the ques<lb/>tion in Artillery Street, about 500 or 600 yards on the way—he never asked the question a second time; he was told the charge a second time in Artillery Street; the first time he was told was in Shad Thames,</p>

On December 24th I was on reserve duty at Bermondsey Street Station from ten to two with another man—I remember the prisoner and Cheeseman coming into the waiting-room, and going straight through into the inspector's office—after Cheeseman had been detained a short time he came into the waiting-room, where I was—he said he did not know what he was there for, and that he wished to see the inspector, to ask him what he was charged with; that was after he had been sitting there about five minutes—I said he had been told what he was charged with—about five minutes after he went into the inspector's office, and I followed him in—Inspector Nash was on duty—the inspector said, "I have told you you are charged with stealing a horse, van, and flour"—Cheeseman made no answer—when he was with me in the room alone he again asked me two or three times what he was charged with, and I told him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was not charged; he was told what the charge was—the prosecutor was not there to charge him—it is not usual for a policeman, even if he has seen the robbery, to charge the man—I could not swear off-hand if he was told where the robbery was said to have been committed—I did not hear what was said when he went to the inspector in the first instance—he was not told in my presence the particulars of the robbery—he wanted to know the particulars of the charge—I told him, "You know what you are charged with; the inspector has told you"—I did not hear the inspector tell him; I only concluded that was what he was told.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have always found Cheeseman to be quite a reupect<lb/>able man—I did not tell him that if he was not guilty he would be dis<lb/>charged—he did not ask me what he had better do, and if he should send for witnesses—I do not think I remember Willoughby coming—I was not called out; I was told to look after Cheeseman, and I did so between two and six—there is more than one way to the inspector's office—no conver<lb/>sation passed between Willoughby and Cheeseman while he was in my charge—Willoughby might have come while I was off duty, from ten to two—the waiting-room has one door leading into the passage and one into the inspector's office—when nothing is going on in the inspector's office, the door leading into it is open—Cheeseman's son came nearly at 5.30 to bring him some refreshment—Cheeseman was then in the dock, being charged, I believe—I told him he would have to wait.</p>

On December 24th I was at Bermondsey Police-station from ten a.m. to two p.m., when Marsh came on duty—I relieved Burbage—at 10.45 the prisoner came with Cheeseman to the station, and straight to the inspector's office—I said to the prisoner, "So this is the man you saw jump out of the van?"—the prisoner said, "Yes"—Cheeseman was standing close to me—I said, "The prosecutor is not here; you will have to remain until he arrives; sit down in the other room"—it is the ordinary practice to wait till the owner of stolen property comes to prefer the charge and sign the charge-sheet—Cheese-man said, "I don't know why I am detained here, or why I am brought here"—I said, "On a charge of stealing a horse and van and flour; sit down in the other room"—I directed the prisoner to go and fetch a member of the firm to come and prefer the charge and sign the charge-sheet—in the course of the morning Cheeseman came to the door of the inspector's office, and asked why he was kept there—I said, "You have been told why you are detained; on a charge of stealing a horse and van"—he said, when he was first brought into the inspector's office, "I know nothing about a horse and van"—in the room in which I was there is a window, which gives me a full view of the reserve-room—the door between that room and mine is shut when anyone is with me, but, standing at my desk, I can see the whole of the reserve-room—about 1.45 the constable returned, and said that no one could come and sign the charge-sheet till 2.30—I went into the waiting-room and told that to Cheeseman, and asked him if he would like to send for anyone—he said, "Willoughby, my foreman, can prove that I was at work at eight o'clock this morning"—I asked Cheeseman's son, who came to the station, to go and see Willoughby, and ask him to</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, of 131, Arlbrook Road, Balham—about 10.45 p.m. on April 6th, I fastened the back door of my house—next morning, about 4.55, my wife woke me, and I saw the prisoner in my bedroom—he ran out as fast as he could—I jumped out of bed and ran after the prisoner, who had my watch, and trousers, and waistcoat—he clambered over a fence, and I ran through the passage and out at the front door—I caught him, and hit him under the ear, and knocked him down and jumped on him—he said, "You b——! let me get my knife"—I held him till assistance came—he had dropped the trousers and waistcoat, getting over the fence—he had my watch in his hand when I caught him, and he struck at me with it—I took it out of his hand—he had no boots on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I saw you in my bedroom—you had something under your arm—the policeman took you, and then I went back and put on my trousers.</p>

On the morning of April 7th I was in or near Arlbrook Road; I heard cries, and ran in the direction of them, and found the prosecutor in his night-shirt, holding down the prisoner with one hand; he had the watch in the other hand—he handed over the prisoner to me—the prisoner said, "We have been drinking together; the man is mad"—at the station there was found on the prisoner this table-knife, ground to a point, in this case—the prosecutor and the prisoner were about fifty or sixty yards from the prosecutor's house when I came up; there were three business premises in between.</p>

On the morning of April 7th I was at Balham Hill—I heard shouts, and ran and found the prisoner in Johnson's custody—I went and examined the prosecutor's premises—I found a boot and this waistcoat at the rear of the premises—I brought the boot to the prisoner, who said, "That is mine; let me put it on"—the prisoner was arrested thirty or forty yards from where I found the boot, just outside the prosecutor's yard—this piece of leather in the boot corresponded with a footprint in the yard.</p>
