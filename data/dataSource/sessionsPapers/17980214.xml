               <p>Q. Was this hole large enough for a man to creep in by? - A. Yes; the lower part of the iron was forced in so, that it formed an elbow.</p>

They were part of them in the bottom of the window, and the rest upon what we call the shew-gate, which is above the shew-board; I sent for a carpenter, and in consequence of what he said, I gave information at Bow-street, his name is Rose.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a carpenter; I have known Graves some years, he lived with Mrs. Lang, No. 1, Newtoner's-court, Chandos-street, St. Martin's, about 100 yards from Mr. Cooke's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what part of the house it was that Graves lived in with Lang? - A. The ground-floor; I was sent for, on Tuesday, to mend Mr. Cooke's shutter, and I found it had been cut with a centre-bit; I communicated some suspicions that I had, and a search warrant was obtained, I repaired the sash, and then they fetched me from my own house; I went with Taylor, the officer of Bow-street, and Mr. Cooke, and the Beadle of the parish to Graves's lodgings; the street door was open, it was about half past seven on Tuesday morning; on going into the parlour, I believe the beadle of the parish was before me, Mr. Taylor followed me into the parlour, on the ground-floor, where Mrs. Lang and Graves had lived; the door was fast, and Mrs. Lang got out of bed, and let the officer in; the officer immediately proceeded to search the drawers, where Mr. Taylor found two chissels, and a centre-bit, and an iron brace, a tool that smiths generally make use of, they were found in a drawer, I believe it was open, I am not certain; after the officer had found these things, there was some doubt, whether there was not another centre-bit, which answered the description of the shutters, I immediately searched the drawers myself; after the officer had searched them, I took the drawers entirely out, and found another centre-bit, and I found upon the floor, under the bed, where Mrs. Lang lay, two pair of black silk stockings; I took that centre-bit to my own house, because I knew the other had not been made use of, I tried it with the shutter, I knew, when I found it, it was as near the size as could be, and, on sitting it together when I got home, the centre-bit had run against a nail in the stile of the shutter, and stopped its progress; I sitted the centre-bit to the shutter, and found it answered the size.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that that is the centrebit, which had been used upon the shutter? - A. I am clearly of opinion that it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is a centre-bit an instrument in common use amongst carpenters? - A.It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Graves after he was in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing? - A. I did not chuse to have any conversation with him upon the subject.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you find the stock that the centrebit is worked by? - A. The officer has got it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have known the prisoner Graves for some years? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known Lang for some time? - A. I have known her from seeing her in the neighbourhood, no otherwise.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140004"/>Q. You know, that previous to that time, they cohabited together? - A. I have seen them frequently together at this house.</p>
               <p>Q. They lived together as man and wife? - A. I should imagine so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Was this centre-bit of a very uncommon size and shape? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then any other centre-bit, having its edge turned, would have made the same impression upon that shutter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing at all particular in the effect of that centre-bit upon the shutter, but that the edge is turned? - A. Yes; there is a nail that the edge is turned against.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted the centre-bit is not of all other tools the most free from accident? - A. Yes. we take great care of our centre-bits.</p>
               <p>Q.Suppose it had dropped down, would not that turn the edge? - A. No, not of steel, as this is.</p>
               <p>Q.Suppose, by any accident in turning, you meet with a nail, it would turn the edge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you come here without any hope of interest? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear of such a thing as a reward in a burglary? - A. No; I did not apprehend them, I sent others to apprehend them.</p>
               <p>Q. But you give evidence, you know, and assist in convicting; if they should be convicted should you not think it a very good thing to have a share of three forties? - A. I do not expect any such thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.What is your reason for knowing where Graves lived? - A. I had seen him there, I knew him very well two years ago.</p>

(Produces a centre-bit, a stock, two chissels, and a gimbles.)</p>
               <p>Rose. This iron brace is what the smiths use, it is the same as a carpenter's stock, only theirs is made of wood, and this is made of iron, it is very different from what we use; there was a nail that I had at Bow-street, that was in the shutter that the bit had run against, but being over careful, I have lost it; the iron plate upon the shutters was put on with small tin tacks, very imprudently, and the centre-bit had forced the iron forwards, and turned it like a piece of brown paper.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am sister-in-law to Mr. Cooke, I always serve in the shop in the evening: Before the robbery, about six o'clock, when the lamps were lit, I observed the prisoner, Graves, at the shop-window, he went away on seeing me; I put the lamps into the window and went away; in a little while after, I saw him again at the same window, on the right hand side, on seeing me he cast his eyes down to the street, he turned his back towards me, and went out to the edge of the pavement; I went to the shop-door and saw him retire to the end of Round-court, we are two doors from Round-court, there were more people with him; a little while after he was at the same window again; on seeing so ill-looking a man so often at the window I removed the silk stockings that laid loose upon the show-board from the window; thinking he meant to cut the glass; he was backwards and forwards the whole evening, I dare say I saw him eighty times in the course of the night till we shut up shop, which is generally about nine o'clock; he once came to the shop-door, and looked all round the shop, I watched him all the evening; I saw Field once in the course of the evening, he went by, laughing very loud, which occasioned me to notice him; he did not stop, his head was tied up as it is now, he was not with Graves at that time; Graves always retired to the court whenever I missed him, I made it my business to look; I know no more, except that the property is Mr. Cooke's.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two pair of stockings, and tell me if they are your brother's property or not? - A.They are entire silk; and this pair of stockings, with the white feet, has my own mark upon it; the other has not the ticket upon it, but it is a particular rib, and is the only pair we had of this pattern, they were folded up with the white feet hanging out underneath; it was folded up, by myself, in a bundle for show, and that pair was the top-most; they were all safe at twelve o'clock at night when I went to bed; I always go round the shop the last thing before I go to bed, to see that every thing is safe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cooke. These are my stockings, this pair with white feet; we had but two pair of that quality in the house, and the ribbed ones were with them; the ribbed pair are what we call a very blue white stocking, they being unfashionable I dyed them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. It is not an uncommon thing to dye stockings black? - A. Upon my oath I believe them to be mine, they are a very remarkable pair.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Allen.) Q. What kind of light was it when you first saw Graves? - A.It was quite dusk, we were putting in the lamps.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140005"/>Q. How could you distinguish the countenance of a person at that time? - A. The lamps were just put, it is a large two light burner, and our windows are excessive large.</p>
               <p>Q.And they throw sufficient light into the street to enable you to distinguish the features of a man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And you had an opportunity of seeing him twenty times during the course of that evening? - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Field you saw but once that night? - A.Only once; he was passing laughing very loud, which occasioned me to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake, from that transient circumstance, to swear that it was Field that you say you saw pass laughing? - A. Yes, I can; I am very positive of it, I saw his countenance and his features.</p>

I accidentally went into that public-house to get a pint of beer, and some bread and cheese, for my breakfast; I was sitting by the fireside, and this man was just by the door, he was never in my company at all, and before I had drank my beer they came in and took me as a prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - I am the son of the last witness: I received information that the gelding was taken away, on Thursday night, by the Ongar coachman, at the Three Nuns, in Whitechapel: On Friday noon, I went into Smithfield-market, I had not been there a quarter of an hour before I saw the prisoner, Carter, upon the horse; I looked about for an officer, I could not find one; I saw Mr. Pope, and asked him to lend me assistance; we went and cheapened the horse, and asked him, where he brought it from; he said, he brought it from Hampshire, he said, he had had it four months upon his hands, and two months he had sent it to the Straw-yard, at Kensington Gravel-pits; we then asked him the price; he said, 10l.; he said, he had been used for plough and cart; we pointed out the blemishes, and then left the man upon the horse; while we were cheapening the horse, the other prisoner came up, recommending the horse, as knowing the horse, and man likewise; we then got two officers, and sent them to the Crown public-house, in the Market; then Mr. Pope fetched the two men into the public-house, as if we had thought better of the horse, and intended to buy it; we then asked him about the consitution and ways of the horse; Carter gave the same account as before; Peatty gave no account, only that it was a good horse, and he knew the horse and the man; we asked Carter several questions, and found he prevaricated very much in his answers; I then charged him with taking it from my father's stable, and we found him change colour, and not say a word against it; I gave them in charge to the two officers, and they were taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all this pass in the hearing of the other man? - A. Yes; I sent the horse by another constable, to Mr. Pope's Livery-stables, in Little Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe the horse? - A. Yes; he was a gelding, lame of two feet, and the hoos broke away from the off fore foot; the horse was brought to market with a leather halter, the same as he used to wear in the stable; I had not seen the horse, I believe, for a month before; I cannot swear to the bridle, it has had the winkers cut off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Scott. Q. About what time was it that you met this man in Smithfield? - A.About three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear to the halter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear that that is a halter from which the winkers had been cut off? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find Peatty at all in possession of the horse? - A. No.</p>

                        targets="t17980214-3-victim89 t17980214-3-viclabel21"/> there: On Saturday the 20th of January, the prisoner came into our shop, about dusk, and asked for patent worsted stockings; I told him we had ribbed stockings if they would suit him; he asked to see them; I shewed them to him; he picked out four pair, I folded them up for him; then he asked for a pocket handkerchief, he chose two, and offered me a two pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the whole amount of the things he had looked out? - A.Thirteen shillings; I told him we had not cash in the house, I would go out and get him change; I went to the next door neighbour's, and asked him if he could change it; he said, if I would give him two shillings he would give me two guineas; I gave him two shillings, and he was going to indorse it with my mother's name; he said, if it was a bad one he should look to us for the money, I told him to look sharp after it; the maid was coming up with a candle, he held it to the light, and said it was cemented, he would not change it; I took the note and went over to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note? - A. This is it; I put my name at full length upon it at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any constable with you from the watch-house? - A. I took Henry Bates to my mother's; the prisoner was standing at the door when I went past to go to the watch-house; I might have been absent ten minutes, I cannot positively say, Bates, and another man, ran over to my mother's before me, the prisoner was then in the shop mixed with other people, I did not see him at first, and I said, the man is gone; he said, no, here I am, where is the change; I then went behind the counter, and said, your note is a bad one, Sir; Bates, and the other man, said he must go with them, and they took him over to the watch-house, and searched him, I was there, but I did not see the whole of the search; I saw him take out a paper, I don't know what it was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Is that note in the same state in which you received it from him? - A. The man began endorsing my mother's name upon it and then scratched it out.</p>

               <p>Q. It might be quarter of an hour for what you know that you were absent? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had had change yourself you would have given it him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you occasion, in your way to the watch-house, to pass by your own house again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar was standing at the door then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long a time might elapse, from the time you saw him at the door, till you returned from the watch-house? - A.It might be about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that five minutes to compose a part of the ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were several other persons in the shop when you returned? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I hardly need ask you if he had been so disposed, in the course of that quarter of an hour, he might have gone away? - A. He might so.</p>
               <p>Q.Though you suspected he was gone away, he was the person that gave you the information that he was not gone away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to the shoemaker's after? - A. Because the hatter told me to go there.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. Upon the inspection of this note, are you able say what it originally was? - A.

               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Praed. Q. From whence do you derive your knowledge of having signed this note? - A.(Refers to a book). I signed four hundred ones on that day, they were from 80l to 1200. (The note read).</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that note, (showing him the ten pound note); is that a genuine Bank-note? - A. It was a genuine Bank-note before the alteration.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does there appear any alteration to have taken place in it? - A. Where the sum was, it now appears to be a ten.</p>

            , Esq. sworn. - Examined by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140010"/>Mr. Fielding. Q.Is that the examination of the prisoner taken before you? - A. It is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he asked by you how he came by these notes? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I must beg first to ask a question or two, before Mr. Tolfrey answers my learned Friend's question. - Q.At what time was that examination taken? - A. On his first being apprehended, a very short examination was taken, and he was committed for further examination; the examination that is now produced, was taken the second time that he came up.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect, as well as you can, the day of the month when this examination was taken, or the day of the week? - A. He was apprehended on the Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. At the first examination, I believe he had his friends attending him, his Counsel and Solicitor? - A. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any Solicitor and Counsel attending him? - A. I believe there were three examinations, and I think it was the third time, that this examination was taken, and then there was a Solicitor and Counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. At the former examination, he had not any friends on his part, to give him any advice at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if his friends and Counsel had been there that day, and gone away, supposing that no examination would have taken place? - A. His attorney had been there that morning, but I do not know upon what account he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. That examination, I believe, took place in a private room? - A. Yes; it was desired by the Solicitor for the Bank that it might be kept private.</p>
               <p>Q. At either of these examinations, were you induced at all to hold out any favour to the prisoner at the bar? - A. No; not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing held out to him to induce him to tell the story that he afterwards told in the examination, or which could lead him to do so? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Not previous to that time, nor at that time? - A.Neither.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the conduct of the prosecutor, which very often happens in circumstances in which the Bank are concerned, favourable to him upon either of those examinations? - A. I really do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there, from the conduct of the prosecutor and yourself, humanely considering the case, any thing that could lead the prisoner to suppose that favour would be extended to him? - A. I certainly did hope, at first, that it would have been such, as would not have led to his commitment; that was the impression upon the mind of the Solicitor for the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not think, that from the liberality and humanity of the prosecutor and yourself, he might have collected that? - A. He might at the second examination.</p>
               <p>Q. And that in the presence of his Counsel and Attorney? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And notwithstanding that, there was another examination in private, at which, neither his Counsel nor Solicitor were present? - A. That was in consequence of a search.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, the third examination did take place in the absence of those who had before attended to give him advice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At which of the examinations was it that you advised the prisoner at the bar to speak the truth? - A. At both the examinations.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that conveyed to him in such sort of humane and friendly language as to induce him to speak the truth, if he was so inclined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was with an evident tendency to make him speak the truth? - A.Certainly; he was advised also by his own Counsel, in my presence, to speak the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any conversation that fell from Mr. Winter, Solicitor for the Bank, to induce him to give the account that he did give, in reference to the detection of other forgeries? - A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were other forgeries talked about? - A. No; I recollect, upon the second examination, Mr. Winter desired his Attorney and Counsel to go out and speak to him, and that if any other persons were concerned with him, they would mention it; they retired with him into another room; when they came back, they said, they had advised him to tell the whole truth, but that he had still told the very same story that he told when he was first apprehended.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp took an objection that the examination was inadmissable, in as much as the account given by him was induced by a hope of mercy held out on the part of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>The objection was over ruled by the Court.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. By the term humanity, do you mean mercy and forgiveness? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. You see he does not desire him to confess, but to tell the truth, which is a very different thing from telling a man it will be better for him to confess.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron Thompson. The Magistrate cannot extort a confession from a prisoner.</p>
               <p>The Counsel for the prosecution declined offering the examination in evidence.</p>
               <p>- WINTER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q.You, I believe, went to the house where the young man lived? - A. Yes; in Grosvenor-street, Miss Davey's, I there found, in a drawer used by the prisoner, in a place called the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140011"/>butler's pantry, a book, entitled, the Artists' Assistant in drawing Perspective, Etching, Engraving,&amp;c.; another book, containing a set of German Text Copies upon copper plate, a tea-cup, containing a composition, the ingredients of which I do not know; a bottle that appears to have contained gum-water; in a tea-cup, a small hair brush, and in a case, several other hair brushes, an instrument which appears to have been used for erasing; and after the examination at Marlborough-street office, I found some small bits of paper, upon which I make no comment. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You found these things in the butler's pantry? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar was not there at the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know, of your own knowledge, that that was the prisoner's drawer? - A.Certainly not; it was so pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the particular time you found this? - A. I rather think the day of the last examination, the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended? - A. The preceding Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. So that from the Saturday to the Wednesday, any body so disposed, might have put these things into that drawer, or taken them away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, unfortunately at this time, it has more than once happened that Bank-notes have been picked up in the street, that have afterwards turned out to be forged? - A. There is a man now in custody, whose defence is of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, without adverting to any person in custody, that Bank-notes have been picked up in the street, which have turned out to be forged.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is that to us, it is only Mr. Winter's opinion at any rate.</p>
               <p>Mr. TERRY called again. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have seen this note, look at it again, (the two pound-note), how does that appear to you to have been effected? - A. With ink prepared with water and gum.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it been stamped or engraved? - A. No; it has been done either with a pen or a brush, or both.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had an opportunity of trying that composition that was found in this cup? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it in your judgment done by that kind of composition? - A. I have endeavoured to analyse the contents of the cup, it is composed of several things; the imitation on the Bank-note consists of blue, which has been laid on first, and then Indian ink and common writing ink; the contents of the cup are blue Indian ink and writing ink.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, upon your oath, has that alteration in the note been effected by the same materials as you found in that cup? - A. By the same kind of materials.</p>
               <p>Corss-examined by Mr. Barrow. What are you? - A. An engraver and printer to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it ever been any part of your duty to study chemistry? - A. It has not been my duty, I have studied it a little.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of blue is this you have been speaking of? - A. There is a cake of Scott's blue.</p>
               <p>Mr. Winter. That is a cake of blue that I found in the same place, at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Terry.) You have already sworn, that this imitation has been effected, first, by laying on a coat of blue, then the Indian-ink, and then the common ink? - A. I cannot say whether the Indian-ink, or the common ink is put on first.</p>
               <p>Q. At any rate, you think there must have been a foundation of blue? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How then came you to say, that the materials, by which this was effected, must have been of the same sort as this which now appears before the Court? - A. I did not say so; when I said the contents of the cup, I spoke of the blue which then laid in the cup, the mixture is only of India-ink, and common ink, the blue is in the cake, there may be a small quantity of blue, I cannot say, I am rather doubtful, whether there is any blue in it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you have analysed it? - A. Yes; you may separate them now with a brush.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us, in general terms, what you mean by analyze? - A. I took a very fine clean hair pencil, upon very white smooth paper, and being able to distinguish the two articles, the writing and the India ink, and having got them separate, I took a little of each on the point of a brush, and made a wash, in that which I supposed was the Indian ink; I found a body, an opaque body, for Indian ink is made principally of a kind of soot, the common ink I found transparent of a light nature, capable of staining which India ink does not do, besides which, I perceived, belonging to each, the common ink has always a blue cast, on account of the logwood with which it is made; the India-ink has a body, being made of lamb-black, and oil of vitriol.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barrow. Q. I thought you said it was made of soot? - A. Is not lamb-black soot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barrow. Q. I do not know? - A. I know it is, and nothing else; therefore I concluded the contents of the cup were common writing-ink, and Indian-ink united with a very strong gum.</p>
               <p>Q. Among chymists, the usual course is to separate the articles? - A. Yes; if you can separate them.</p>
               <p>Q. Indian-ink is a compound of itself? - A. It is a compound of soot, oil of vitriol and strong gum together, with water, common writing-ink is compounded of gall, logwood, and either vitrified cockle, or vitrified oil.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140012"/>Q. And I believe gum? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any known process in chymistry, by which you can divide these compounds? - A. I do not understand you; I found them at the side of the cup ready separated, and at the bottom they were blended.</p>
               <p>Q. Such was the process you made, that you can say upon your oath, you separated each of them? - A.When Mr. Winter gave me the cup, there was at the bottom, a cake of blue water colour on the sides of the cup; I found what I still believe to be, in streaks, and separate from each other, two articles, the one writing-ink, and Indian-ink, but at the bottom these two articles were blended together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Have you made any experiment upon any piece of paper? - A. Yes, (produces two papers;) this is the bottom of the cup mixed with common writing-ink, to see whether the colour agrees with what I apprehend it to be.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever amuse yourself in drawing or painting in water-colours? - A. Yes, sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it any thing extraordinary, that those persons who do employ themselves in drawing, should have camel hair pencils, and compositions of this sort? - A. Yes; when people draw and paint much, they have those sort of things.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not essentially necessary? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you? - A. I said before my Lord-Mayor, almost two years, but I find it was not quite one year, she lived twice with us, once she went away sick, I had a very honest character with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost money before to any amount? - A. I cannot say to what amount, I stamped them in the officer's house, in his presence.</p>
               <p>Ceoss-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This is a prosecution for one penny? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And if she had asked her mistress's pardon, she would not have been sent to the watch-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She came to you with the character of having lived seven years in one place? - A. No; she lived at other places between that and her coming to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You marked all these halfpence with the same mark? - A. Yes; I marked them between three and four in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any customers in the course of that afternoon? - A. Yes, a good many.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mix these halfpence with others? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body else serve in the bar besides yourself? - A. Yes, my wife; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she might not have given change out of these halfpence that afternoon? - A. I am sure she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner went away sick the first time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not a good opinion of her then? - A. Yes; or else I should not have taken her in again.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has got all the money that was found? - A. The constable has got it.</p>
               <p>Q. To the amount of several pounds-you having lost but one penny? - A. Not that I have sworn to.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you buy a pennyworth of wood at a time? - A. Yes, sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether this girl had a penny from your wife to buy a pennyworth of wood, you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>

The next morning, Saturday, I got up about seven; I went to the window, and saw Beal's cart drawn just under the Windsor stable door, I dressed myself, and came down stairs, I went to the cart, and in the cart was a sack with some oats and beans mixed in it; I then informed my master, and came back again; I did not see my master till past nine; when I came back, I saw Beal come into the yard, and went out again; the cart was standing in the same place I had seen it before; then Mr. Beal came in again to harness his horse, that was between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drew the cart there, you don't know? - A. No; Mr. Beale put his horse into the cart, and whispered something to Parker, who is the ac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140021"/>complice; Bickeridge was then in the stable; Beal put his house to, and another man helped him to harness it; Beal then went out of the yard with the horse and cart, I followed him out of the yard, and stopped him; I asked him what he had got in his cart, he said he had nothing at all but what was his own; I told him, if he got up, I thought he would find something there that was not his own; he would not get up, he had his dog in the cart; I told him, if he would move the dog, I would get into the cart myself; Beal said, then I will get up into the cart with you; there were two sacks in the cart, I took hold of the sacks, and asked him if that was all he had in his cart, and he said, yes, for any thing he knew; I got into the cart, and found the sack, with the corn in it, covered over with straw; I asked him if that was his, he said he did not know how it came there; I took the sack, and gave it to a gentleman to lift down, and I told Beal he should not go any further till my master came; he begged I would not make any piece of work about it, but if it was our corn, we should have it again; I told him I could not do that; he begged I would let him go, and if there was any thing the matter, he would settle it when he came again on Friday; afterwards he said he would tell the truth, he said that Parker told him there was something put into the cart for him; he said no more about the corn, but he said Mr. Gray was a long while, and he was afraid he should not get home by dark; I did not let him go till he was taken into custudy; the corn was taken into the Bell Savage parlour. I went into the Windsor stable the night before, there were about four bushels in the bin, and in the morning there was but about half a bushel left.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sack that was in Beal's cart full? - A. No, it contained about two bushels; when the constable came, my master took Beal into the parlour, and asked Beal how he came by the oats, and he said Parker told him there was something for him in the cart; I went to fetch Parker, and my master asked him about it, and he said Old Dick, that is, Bickeridge, told him there was a sack there, and desired him to put it into the cart, which he did; then I went to call Bickeridge, he was in the Windsor stable at work, he came in, and my master asked him if he knew any thing about the corn and beans that were put into Beal's cart; Bickeridge said he knew nothing at all about it; my master directly said, Parker says you told him to put it into the cart; Bickeridge said, how can you tell such a lie, Jem, for I nevertold you no such thing; and then they were all three taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long have you been ostler at this place? - A. Three years and a half.</p>
               <p>Q.Beal has been a constant frequenter of your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Every Friday, when he comes to Fleet-market? - A. Not every Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. He deals in fruit in Fleet-market? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Early in the morning he is obliged to be in the market upon his business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you saw the cart, Beal was not in the yard? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.But Bickering was in the stable? - A. I cannot say; he was there almost directly after.</p>
               <p>Q.Parker said, when he was taken up, that Bickeridge had told him to put something in the cart for Beal, did he not, at the same time, tell you that Beal was not there at the time it was put in? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Beal had a pretty fierce dog with him? - A. I cannot say that he was very fierce.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not quiet the dog for you to get into the cart? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I attend the Marlborough-street office: On the 10th of this month, between twelve and one, the prosecutor told me he had lost his waistcoat, and I went with him to Calomel-buildings; I desired the prosecutor to go up first, and if I found that he answered to his name, I would be at his heels instantly; he asked if William was at home, and I heard the answer, yes; I stepped up immediately, and saw the prisoner asleep in a chair; the prosecutor gave we charge of him; I then said, William, waken, I must see what you have got about you; upon that he got out of the chair, his back was to the fire-place; I put my hand into his waistcoat pocket, unbuttoned his breeches, and said you may see every thing; he then put his hand into his sob, and pulled out a duplicate; he endeavoured to throw it into the fire; I perceived it, and the duplicate dropped down at his feet; I said, those things will not do with me, my eyes are as quick as your's; I then picked it up, and took him to the pawnbroker's, in Chandless-street; the pawnbroker produced the waistcoat, and it was sworn to by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>PHILIP MULCASTER sworn. - I am a pawnbroker: The prisoner brought me this waistcoat about ten in the morning, he told me his name was John Williams, that he lived in Charles-street; I lent him one shilling and sixpence upon it, he asked two shillings and sixpence.(Produces the waistcoat).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to see a young man that works with this gentleman, and as I was coming away, the young man came out into Park-lane, and gave me a handkerchief to carry to his washerwoman; I went home directly, down Brick-street, Piccadilly; I met a young man, an acquaintance of mine, who asked me to pawn this waistcoat for him, and he would give me a pot of beer, and I did pawn it for one shilling and sixpence; I took him the money, and offered him the duplicate, and he would not have it, he told me I might keep it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140027"/>for myself; when these gentlemen; came to take me, they wrested the door open; I was going to give them the duplicate, and it jumped out of my fingers; I had no intention of throwing it in the fire.</p>

             sworn. - I am a coach-maker: The prisoner came to our house, on Monday, the 15th of January, and asked if we bought left-off coaches; I told him, we did, sometimes; he said, he had got one to sell, and asked me to go and look at; I asked him where it was; he said, in Burleigh's-gardens, Old-street; he said, he had had it about two years, and had served it on a job a year and three or four months; he said, it had been standing four months in an open cart-yard, and only had a three days job for it; he asked me when I would come to look at it; I told him, we were going to Windus's, and then we would call, but it was uncertain when; and then he went away; he came again in about two minutes, and said, if I had a mind, he would bring it up next morning to our house in Wells-street, Oxford-road; the next morning it was brought in a cart; he told me, he had brought the coach; I told him, if he would leave it till next morning, I would speak to my father, and he should have an answer; he appointed me to meet him the next morning, at the Six Clerks office, Chancery-lane; I met him there; he asked me what was the most I would give; I told him, ten pounds; he said, I should spend a shilling then; and I said, I was not so near as that; I then gave him a guinea earnest, and he agreed to call upon us on Friday, for the rest; then we went to a public-house just by, and had a shillingsworth of wine and water; I asked him what gentleman he had served with the job, for a year and three months; he said the gentleman was dead; he said, he bought the coach of one Old Howison, in Old-street-road; he said, he was dead too; I asked him what he was, at the Six Clerks-office, and he said, he was bag-bearer, that he had about eighty pounds a year; and he said, he had candles and lodging found him; he said, he had another way of getting money, he gave out writing, and paid a halfpenny for fifteen lines, and got a penny for it; and then we parted; I made enquiry the next day, and found the coach was Mr. Jones's, and I went to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not sell him the carriage.</p>
               <p>Leader. He sold it to me, and was to call for the remainder of the money, on Friday; I shewed the coach to Mr. Jones, and he owned it.</p>
               <p>Jones. I knew this to be my carriage by the two black supporters to the arms; the carriage was blue, and one black wheel the off side before, and another broke; the other wheels were blue; the lining had the same arms upon it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had this carriage of Jones for a job; I wanted a little money upon it, Mr. Leader told me, he would give me ten pounds for it, and I said, I would not sell it; they took my watch from me; I did not know of my trial coming on, or else I could have had plenty of gentlemen to speak for me from Chancery-lane.</p>

W. her mistress said, this sixpence was in my purse, I can swear to it; she said, I am sure you have got my purse; the mistress cried very much, and she dropped the sixpence; the girl then pulled out something like a night-cap, and undonbled it, and took the purse out of it, she held it to her mistress, and said, here it is; and she took it out of her hand, and gave it to me; I told the money out before them, there was a guinea, a crown piece, six sixpences, and a shilling; the girl that I sent, could not get a constable, and I went myself to the office for one; I have had the purse and the money ever since.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Milne.) Is there any money amongst it that you can swear to? - A. I did not say I could swear to it; I had that sixpence in my possession, but I cannot say it was in my purse, I had taken it that day. (The purse and money produced).</p>
               <p>Q.Did you observe what the letters were? - A. I made some remark upon it, but I cannot tell what now.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you put all the money that you took that day, into your purse? - A. I cannot say that I did; she said she had found the sixpence upon the tap-room floor, and afterwards upon the table, I might have pulled it out with my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she found the sixpence, or the purse, upon the tap-room table? - A.Both.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you keep your pockets at night?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140030"/>- A. Under my pillow; the prisoner slept in the same room that night, in another bed, my husband was not at home, I was not disturbed.</p>

               <p>Q. Who had been in the kitchen in the mean time, you do not know? - A. I asked them, if any body else had been in the kitchen, and the man immediately said, he had not been out; my sister had been down in the kitchen just before, for a plate of bread and butter, she had asked me, if she should assist the servant in getting the tea, and I had told her to go; I followed her immediately to take some better tea things from the parlour to the kitchen; I had not then missed my purse; I took those things off the tea-board, and placed the others on; Mr. Hedley then came into the kitchen, and asked me for my purse, I gave it to him unopened.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you opened it in the mean time? - A. Yes, I had; the prisoner Shannon came to me, and told me, I had given her a French half-crown, I was then in a room where the children were dancing; I went out into a dark passage, and opened my purse to give her another, but I did not then take notice of it, I was engaged with company, that was within a quarter of an hour after I had given her the first half-crown; I afterwards went into the kitchen, Mr. Hedley asked me for my pocket-book, which I gave him unopened, he took it up stairs, and immediately returned, and asked what I had done with the notes, I immediately recollected leaving the notes on the dresser; I then returned to the kitchen, and then it was that the conversation took place with the prisoners, that I have before related.</p>

               <p>Your petitioner lived five months servant to Mrs. Hedley, in Belgrave-place, and during that period received the approbation of her employer, never having had the smallest reflection upon her character, till through some misfortune, which your humble petitioner knew not, an execution took place, and the proper officer was put in possession; the next evening Mrs. Hedley came into the kitchen, the officer sitting there, and taking out her pocket-book gave your petitioner a French half-crown for some butter, which the shop-keeper refusing, I brought it back and gave it my mistress, who was then up stairs; I went up stairs, and received another, in the dark, out of the same pocket-book, from my mistress, I then went again to the shop; soon after my mistress's sister came down to help get the tea; soon after that, Mrs. Hedley came down, and said, she was ruined, and she desired me to turn out my pockets; she said, she had left upon the dresser, although it must be observed she had taken the same pocket-book out up stairs in the dark; I submitted to be searched, and nothing was found upon me; the officer next underwent the same, and they would have hurried the officer out of the house, perhaps for a private purpose, but he refused till another man came in his room; I was removed to Mount-street watch-house, where I was again searched, notwithstanding there was no woman there, and your petitioner's prayers and entreaties to the contrary, representing the cruelty and indelicacy of the action, I was stripped even to my linen before Mr. Hedley, and nothing found upon me; your petitioner now stands trembling before this august tribunal, and begs your Lordship will weigh her case with benevolence and humanity, and consider whether Mr. Hedley would suffer an execution to be put into his house having near thirty pounds in his wife's pocket, when his credit must suffer, and his new instituted school be ruined without appropriating it to that purpose; I had a good recommendation for a character to my place, I declare my innocence, and humbly intreat that your Lordship's benevolence will discover, that through the whole of her unhappy case, she is perfectly innocent of the present charge.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Would that prevent the box from tumbling out? - A. Yes, it would.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it a tilted waggon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p> - LEVERTON sworn. - On the 5th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was walking through Broad-court, at the west end, joining to Bow-street, and a waggon was passing by at that instant, I saw the prisoner close to the tail of the waggon falling, with the box, either upon his head or shoulder; it did not occur to me that he had stole the box at that time, I supposed he might be some porter who had taken an opportuity of resting his box on the waggon a little; seeing him in that situation, I stopped in the middle of the street, and expressed my fears that he was hurt, as he had had a desperate fall, he was then lying upon the ground; he said he was not hurt, and immediately took the box upon his shoulder, he was going away with it up Hart-street, and immediately opposite the office-door belonging to the Theatre, the waggoner ran up to him, caught him by the collar, and said, you have stolen this box from my waggon; in consequence of the man making that declaration, I helped to detain him; the prisoner made great resistance, so much so, that his coat was nearly torn off; he said, he had found the box, and had not stole it; I insisted upon taking him into the office of the Theatre, when a constable was sent for from Bow-street, and he was taken there; when the waggoner gave the same evidence that your Lordship has heard this morning, and he was committed. (The box produced).</p>
               <p>Williams. This is the box, the direction upon it is in my own hand-writing; this bowl with a silver top, I remember very well; and this blue coat and waistcoat, and breeches, and the velveteen breeches, two shirts, velveteen coat, seal-skin waistcoat, and two whips; I am sure they are they same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, My Counsel, I understand, is not here, or has not exerted himself, in defending me with respect to the charge laid against me.</p>
               <p>Court. You do yourself no credit by that observation, your Counsel has done all that could be done for you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Counsel has so far defended me I trust, as fully to satisfy your Lordship and this honourable Court, that I am innocent of the charge of felony; I do not pretend to say, contrary to truth, that I did not see the box, God forbid! I was coming down Broad-court that evening, on my way to St. James's market; I saw the box laying upon the causeway, and I took it up, as any innocent man might have done; my intention was no other than to take it to an adjacent house, and there advertize it for an owner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Is your wife here? - A. No. The next day the watchman, Downes, brought me down one of the cheeses; it was a cheese that had a crack in it.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is this place from Mr. Peacock's? - A. He lives at Ratcliffe, I dare say a mile off; a man that is here picked up the cheese, it is cut in two halves.</p>

               <p>Downes. I never lost sight of the prisoner after I saw him covering the cheese.</p>
               <p>Peacock. I know this to be my cheese, from the mark of the person I had it of, B.H. and my own mark besides, P.; I had not sold one of that kind of cheese for a month before; I had no other cheese that was cracked in this kind of way; I had forty or fifty of them, some of them I have had three months; the Cheshire cheese, which was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140034"/>largest cheese I had, laid on the top of this; the Cheshire cheese has never been found; I dare say it weighed 90lb.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been to Wellclose-square, to get some steel to make tools for my brother, who is an ivory-turner; it being near ten o'clock, the shop was shut up; and coming up, I heard a noise, and I heard a man call out, and I ran up, and asked him what was the matter, and whether he wanted any assistance; a man came up, that was in liquor, and said, take him to the watch-house, and the watchman stood looking at me a long while, before he would take me to the watch-house; I asked the man what I should be taken to the watch-house for? and he said, he dared to say I was one of the gang; I went with him to the watch-house, and sat there till almost eleven o'clock, and the man brought the cheese up.</p>

               <p>Q.How long were you gone? - A.About three or four minutes; the prisoner was found up among the hackney-coaches; he said there was another coach called, and he went to attend that; he said he had put the trunk into the coach, and he knew nothing of it; I said, I would have him taken up, and then he went away among the hackney coaches again, where he was found again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your box contain? - A.Four guineas, a metal watch that cost four guineas, a gold ring that cost six shillings and sixpence, and the rest was wearing apparrel, worth about two guineas and a half; I have never seen any of my things again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you left the prisoner in charge of them? - A. Yes; I desired him to attend the coach while I went with another man to the stage.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A man came up to me with another trunk, and said, it was a woman that could not afford to give any thing, that had employed him to bring the luggage, and as I was called to another job, I might as well let him get what there was; she said, very well; and then I went into the rank of coaches about my business again; I attend the coaches as a waterman, to put the bags on, and give the horses water; somebody came up, and said, a trunk was gone out of the coach; I came down, and told her I did not know any thing of it, I had put it in, and left it there; I went into the rank again, and I was fetched back again; I resigned myself up, and went to the watch-house, as I knew myself innocent of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that blue coat? - A. I believe this to be mine; the lining of the right-hand pocket is wore more than the other, by the wearing of a snuff-box, the linings have been taken out of the sleeves, or I could have proved it with more certainty, because I always have, to all my coats, a piece of silk at the bottom of the sleeve; I lost stockings of this pattern, but the mark is taken out, this pocket handkerchief I cannot swear positively to.</p>

               <p>Q. The pocket handkerchief with a red border? - A. I have one in my pocket exactly the same,(produces it;) which has the mark of J B upon it, and it corresponds exactly with this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the scissars? - A. They have been in use a great length of time, in constant use for ten years, and I firmly believe them to be mine.</p>

               <p>Q. It is valued at thirty shillings, it is not worth more is it? - A. I do not think it is worth so much; it has a base-metal chain and key to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.There is no particular mark about the watch, or the key, or chain, except a parcel of letters put round the dial-plate? - A. That is all.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, if any other letters answering to your name, were put round another watch, you would not know that from this? - A. I cannot say; I know I had such a watch.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. If any body else had these spoons, which have no mark, and which have nothing by which you can distinguish the one from the other, would you be able to distinguish my spoons, if I had such sort of spoons, from these? - A. I do not know how that might be; they are certainly the spoons.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at these silver salt spoons? - A. I will not swear that they are silver, but they are the spoons; there is no mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. There is no mark upon them, by which you are able to swear to them, whether they are silver or not? - A. There is no mark that I have fixed upon.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you been using a funnel this afternoon? - A. No, I have not drank any wine.</p>
               <p>Q. It has been pretty much used in Mr. Jolliffe's house? - A.It has been badly used.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live in service before you lived with Mr. Jolliffe? - A. Yes; in some of the first families in London; I never lived less than four or five years in a place.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never had the misfortune, in any of your services, of a funnel dropping, and getting bruised before? - A. Yes, that has dropped several times out of my hand; I believe all servants have that misfortune at times.</p>
               <p>Q. So it is from these kind of bruises, that you mean to swear to this funnel? - A. Exactly so, as I said before.</p>
               <p>Q.These things, I take it for granted, were not all taken at one time? - A. I look upon it they were all taken at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen these things before they were missed? - A. I believe it was three or four days,</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know enough of the value of the plate to fix a value upon any of these things? - A. I am no judge; but I think I would not lay the value of them at more than thirty-seven or thirty-eight shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come to you on the 30th of January? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140044"/>Q. Did he purchase any goods? - A. He bought a pair of boots, and two pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they amount to? - A. One pound eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any man with him when he came? - A.There was an elderly person, I imagined him to be the mate.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he offer to pay you? - A. By tendering me down a 20l. note, as it appeared to me to be, (the note produced); I believe this to be the note.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the note that he tendered you in payment? - A. I took it and looked at it; I did not like the appearance of the colour of the paper, and I did not like to change it, but sent it over to a neighbour opposite me.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom did you send it? - A. By my son, and he brought it back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the note your son brought back was the same note? - A. It looked like the same; then I inspected more closely into it, and sent it to a Mr. Allybone by my son.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your son bring it back unchanged? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. After your son had tried there, what did you do with it? - A. I took it to a Mr. Culland, in Wapping.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get change for it? - A. I sent it by a servant maid to Mr. Culland, only to inspect into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring you back the note? - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. After she returned you the note what did you do with it? - A. I took it to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver it to there? - A. It was a holiday; I delivered it to a clerk, and he delivered it to a Mr. Blifs, the inspector.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it delivered to Mr. Blifs in your presence? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver it to? - A. I don't know the gentleman's name.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Mr. Blifs? - A. I saw him about three minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the note in Mr. Blifs's possession? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether Mr. Blifs put a mark upon it? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note you saw in Mr. Blifs's possession the same note you sent in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is the mark of W. A. upon the back of the note? - A. That is my mark.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you make those letters? - A. I signed them at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had shewn this to Mr. Blifs what did you do? - A. Mr. Blifs returned with the note, and we went to Mr. Winter, the Solicitor of the Bank; two officers attended Mr. Blifs, and then I went with them to my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to your own house, did you find the prisoner there? - A. The prisoner at the bar was there, and this gentleman, the mate.</p>
               <p>Q. When the officers came to him did you hear him say any thing about the note? - A. When the officers came in rather hot upon him and searched him, he stood with a great deal of fortitude.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you hear him, while the officers were searching him, say any thing about this note? - A. I heard him say, he took it Chichester.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. I see you have put your initials upon it, you have no doubt but it is the same? - A. I know it to be the same, I think I could pick it out of a hundred, I observed the word, pounds, wrote with a pen, and not a copperplate; I don't recollect I ever saw one wrote with a pen, but the grand reason is the colour of the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the Bank, you gave it to a clerk, whose name you do not know? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. He took it from you, and went away for about three minutes? - A. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course, except from your supposing it to be the same, it having been out of your possession three minutes, you have no other way of knowing it? - A. No other way than by believing it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. The next time you saw it, it was in Mr. Blifs's hands? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that the prisoner said something, do you mean that he spoke any words in English? - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean by words in English, he made use of the name of a town, or the name of a man? - A.Several words in English.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he talked of the town of Chichester? - A.He did say Chichester.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean, upon your oath, to say that he spoke the English language fluently? - A. No, by no means fluently; "no good" is an English word, and he said, "why?" when it was told him by the mate, that I did not like to change the note, he came and asked me in this manner, "why?" I told him, I did not like the colour of the note, I thought it was a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the only thing you can remember? - A. I think it was very properly answered.</p>
               <p>Q. The conversation between him and the mate was in their own language? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe, when they were talking their own language, that many of the words were like our own English? - A. I cannot say that, I did not pay any attention.</p>
               <p>Q. You sent the note out three times? - A. No; twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Those different times of offering the note, took up some space of time? - A. It did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140045"/>Q.Each of the times that this note was returned, he continued still in your shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he entertain an idea of your suspicions? - A.There was not a doubt of his understanding my suspicions, because he was told of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you have been gone to the Bank? - A. It took some time; I might be gone very near an hour and three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q.Notwithstanding this suspicion, and knowing where you were gone, you found him, on your return, still waiting for you? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You described that he behaved with a great deal of fortitude? - A. With a great deal of fortitude.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. When you told him of your objection to the 20l. did he say, he could pay you in any other way? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make your objection to the 20l. note before you went to make enquiries about it? - A. Yes, I did, before I took it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made those objections before you sent your son to get change for it? - A.Not to the prisoner at the bar, I had made those objections to my son.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that loud enough for the prisoner and the mate to hear? - A. I don't think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask the prisoner to pay you in any other way? - A. When he tendered me down the 20l. note, I did not like the colour of the paper, and I asked him, if he could accommodate me with a smaller note; I was made to understand, by the mate, that the prisoner had no smaller; the prisoner had his pocket-book in his hand, and he shewed me a note, which he said, was a 50l. note.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked for a smaller note, and he said, he had not a smaller note, did you mention any thing about cash? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You understood by the mate and the prisoner, that he had not a smaller note than the 20l.? - A. Yes; when I asked him, if he had a smaller note, he said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. You first suggested your objection to your son, and sent him out to get change? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. On his return, you told the prisoner and the mate, you had some suspicions about it? - A. I did; and the mate gave him to understand, I did not like to change it, and he said, why?</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. Q.You are the son of the last witness? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you in the shop on the 30th of January, when the prisoner at the bar and his mate came in? - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you come in? - A.Between the hours of eleven and twelve, those two men were then in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.What were they doing? - A.They were bargaining with my father for a pair of boots and two pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them spoke to you father? - A. The mate was rather the interpreter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other speak any English or not? - A. I did not observe that he said any words of English that I could distinctly understand; they agreed to pay one pound eighteen shillings for one pair of boots and two pair of shoes; the prisoner at the bar gave my father a 20l. note for the payment of those boots and thoes, he took it out of a pocket-book; my father said, he would be obliged to him if he would accommodate him with a smaller note, as he had not change enough to change it.</p>
               <p>Q. What said the prisoner? - A. I did not understand the prisoner said any thing, but shewed a 50l. note; he shewed a note in his pocket-book, which he said, was a 50l. he did not take it quite out of his pocket-book; my father gave me the 20l. note, and desired me to go over to Mrs. Glegg, who keeps a public-house, to get it changed; I took the note from my father, and gave it into Mrs. Glegg's hand; it never passed out of my sight till I returned it to my father; he then sent me to a Mr. Allybone, in order to have his opinion whether it was a good note; I did not go there to change it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you take the note back? - A. Mr. Allybone was not at home, I gave it to his wife, and she carried it back into a back room, to give it to her son, and there it passed out of my sight for a few minutes; she brought me back a note, which I believe to be the same that I gave to her, I took it back again to my father; my father and I went behind the counter to examine the note, and my father held it up to the light, and he perceived the water mark was very dull, and he saw the word, pounds, was wrote with a pen instead of the copperplate; my father said, gentlemen, if you will stop a minute, I will go up stairs and compare this note with some notes I have got; my father went up stairs, and when my father came down, he said, he had not change enough in the house, but he would go out and get it changed; my father put on his hat and went out, and took the note with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was gone, had you any conversa<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140046"/>tion with the prisoner? - A. I had with the mate, but not with the prisoner; I could not understand what the prisoner said.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was your father absent? - A. I believe about an hour or an hour and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at any time learn where your father was gone? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. When your father returned, what passed between you and the prisoner? - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came with your father? - A. I believe two officers, and Mr. Blifs, belonging to the Bank, came with my father; the officers immediately searched the captain. (The note produced).</p>
               <p>Q.Is that the same note you took, have you any means of judging? - A. By every appearance of the note, I believe it to be the same, but I cannot swear positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any questions put to him respecting where he got the notes? - A. I believe the inspector asked him where he took the notes, and the mate said, Chichester, and the captain said, Chichester.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That was after the mate had said something to the prisoner, which you did not understand? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the captain say, Chichester? - A. I did, repeatedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing more passed? - A. I don't remember that there was, I believe I have told you the whole of what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what they found upon the captain? - A.There was a 50l. and a 10l. note; the 50l. note, they said, was a bad one, and the 10l. note was good.</p>
               <p>Q.Any money? - A. Two guineas in gold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Before you parted with the note to Mrs. Allybone, you had put no mark upon the note? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was Mrs. Allybone absent with the note? - A. I believe, about a minute or two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.She went completely out of your sight? - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. The mate was the person who was the spokesman upon this business? - A. He was, the whole time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you mean by the spokesman? - A. He was the person who interpreted what the captain said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did the mate speak bad English himself? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you might understand in general what he said, he might speak some words you did not understand? - A. In general, I understood what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that the mate could understand every thing that you said? - A. I believe he did by the answers he made.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time your father and you were holding the note up to the light, where was the prisoner and mate? - A. They were in the shop at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they, while your father and your were behind the counter, holding up the note to the light, see that you were doing so? - A.They could.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time your father said, gentlemen, if you will stay a little, I will go up stairs and compare the note with some I have got there, did they hear what your father said? - A. I believe they did.</p>
               <p>Q.Then it appeared to you, that the prisoner at the bar perfectly well knew what your father said? - A. If the prisoner did not, the mate perfectly did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the mate in general communicate the conversation held between your father and him to the prisoner? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you think your father was gone about an hour and a quarter? - A. It might be an hovl and a half or more.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. While your father was absent, where was the prisoner and the mate? - A.They were in the shop all the while.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with them in the shop? - A. I was there, I believe, the whole time; I don't believe I was out of the shop, except to see what o'clock it was once.</p>

               <p>My Lords and Gentlemen, I am innocent of the crime laid to my charge; the two Bank-notes found in my possession; I received from Mr. Van-Haberbach, on the quay, at Dunkirk, the day I failed from that place; I have been acquainted with him for many years; in the course of my acquaintance with him, I had lent him 20 guineas, which I asked him to pay me, he told me he had got no money, but said, here are two Bank-notes, they will be as good in England as guineas; you may pay yourself, and bring me some goods; he mentioned some hats, razors, great buttons, and small buttons, and some cloth; I put them in my pocket, and when I was at Messrs. Van-Dyke and Co.'s office, I observed that a pilot, to whom one of the clerks paid a Bank-note, wrote something on the back of it, it occurred to me that the notes I received of Mr. Van-Haberbach had not any thing written upon them; I shewed one of them to Mr. Vint, and asked him if it was a good one, as Mr. Van-Haberbach had not written upon it, and Mr. Vint said it was, and shewed it to one of his clerks, who said the same; I could not tell whether it was a good one or not, never having seen a Bank-note before, excepting five, which I received from Mr. Hobbs, of Chichester, the last voyage before the present one, and the only time I was ever in England before.</p>

               <p>Q. What part of Dunkirk? - A. I cannot exactly say where.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect where you saw him last? - A. About an hour before we failed from thence.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what these papers were? - A. As far as I could see they were two notes, but whether they were great or small I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen Bank-notes before? - A. I never saw other notes, except one or two the captain shewed me at Chichester on board; how big they were I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you ever seen any notes before these you saw at Dunkirk? - A. I never saw any others than those that the captain shewed me at Chichester; I heard the captain say he had got two Bank-notes to purchase goods, and that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them open or folded up? - A. I did not observe whether they were open, or whether they were folded.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How much money did you mark? - A. Four half-crowns, seven shillings, and five sixpences; the next morning, after marking the money, I went into a room adjoining the shop, and I saw the prisoner go to the till, and take out something, this was about a quarter before eight o'clock; I went and looked at the till, when he was gone to his work, and I missed the half-crown; the night before, I sent to acquaint a constable about it, and desired him to be in readiness at a public house; I went to him, and he came to the house, and searched the prisoner, and found the half-crown upon him, he came about eight o'clock in the morning; he also found a pick-lock key; he took him away, and had him before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was the mark you put upon it? - A. I filed it on the edge; I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. Had you marked the money at any other times? - A. Yes, the night before that; but never before that.</p>
               <p>Q. What mark did you put upon the other half-crowns? - A. I marked them with a punch; several were marked with a punch, and two were marked with a file.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You said, if I understand you right, you had prepared a constable on the preceding night that you were robbed, ready against the next morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I believe, the prisoner is not the first that you have prosecuted for the same offence? - A. Never before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Matthews. Q. Had you any other people about the shop? - A. Yes; we had another lad besides him.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNEDY sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street office: The prosecutor sent for me on the 11th of January, and desired me, the next morning, to wait at the Duke's-head public-house; I went about a quarter before eight o'clock, and the prosecutor came to me, and desired I would go with him; I went to his father's house with him, and he called the prisoner at the bar out of the work-shop, and he told me that was my prisoner; I asked him what he had been robbed of, and he told me a half crown-piece; I searched the prisoner, and found a half-crown-piece in his pocket; I searched him again, and took a picklock key out of his pocket, it was made of a piece of wire, then I took him to the Magistrate; I have kept the half-crown-piece from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prosecutor.) Q.Look at this half-crown, is this the same? - A.I have no doubt about it, because it is marked on the edge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. When you paid him his week's wages it was not impossible that a halfcrown, like this, might be amongst the money you paid him? - A. Very unlikely; I will take upon me to swear that was not amongst the half-crowns I paid him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. When you went up to bed, what kind of security did you leave your house in-in what way were the doors fastened? - A. I sleep down stairs in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the doors fastened? - A. They were fastened with a bolt.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go up stairs for? - A.Because the watchman said, he thought he had confederates with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation was the door and windows in? - A. The front door was upon the latch before I went to bed; when I was going to bed, it was nearly eleven o'clock, the watchman came to the door, and knocked at the door again, and he asked me, if I had lost any thing, I told him, I had not, he said, he was very glad to hear it, for he had a very great suspicion of them; that was all that passed between us, then the watchman went away, and I fastened the door; by the watchman saying to me, he had a great suspicion of them, a thought struck me of this room where the clothes were hanging, I took a candle and went up stairs, and I found the room door open, there were some shirts hanging up to dry, and some taken off.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was become of those shirts? - A. There were some laying on the floor, they were rolled together apparently, I have nothing farther to say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you the owner of the house? - A. I rent the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't keep the house entirely to yourself, you let it out to a number of lodgers? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. And till a certain hour arrives, the door is only kept on the latch? - A. Only on the latch.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore your locking-up time was not arrived, for near half an hour? - A. I sometimes lock up the house at nine, and sometimes later.</p>
               <p>Q. Any of your lodgers coming into the house, might have left the door open? - A. I believe I was the last man up in the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long was it, from the time of your going up stairs, to the time of your going to bed? - A. It was half an hour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You yourself will not swear, that the door might not be left accidentally open by the lodgers coming in, and the man might come in by the door being open? - A. Such a thing might be done; when I came in, I left it upon the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very possible one of your lodgers might have left the door open, and this man have come in? - A. It might be possible.</p>
               <p>Q. The man Champness enquired when you saw him for serjeant Miller, where does he live? - A. He lives within one hundred yards, in another street in the neighbourhood, and I directed him to serjeant Millar, on the watchman saying he knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, the young man is decently connected? - A. I know nothing to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you know Champness before? A. I knew Champness from a child; I asked him what business he had there, and he told me he came after one serjeant Miller; then I asked serjeant Taylor what he meant to do with them, and immediately serjeant Taylor said, there is nothing upon them, let them go about their business.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sailor-boy on board the ship Commerce? - A. Yes; on the 10th of January, between six and seven o'clock, Ritchie and Penny brought a bag of tallow into the half-deck, between the pumps and the main-mast, and it was agreed that I was to go on shore with it; I was ordered to go on shore for half a gallon of beer for the Custom-house officers; Ritchie went with me; we got the lend of the Charlotte's boat, that laid alongside of us; Penny gave the tallow into the boat to Ritchie.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a shop does he keep? - A. A tallow-chandler's shop, in Star-street, near King James's stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in your sailor's clothes then? - A. Yes, I was in the same dress that I am in now; after I had just entered into Star-street, there was a man of the name of Melkin asked me what I had, and where I was going to; I said, what was that to him, and went into Mr. Archer's shop; I put the bag behind the half-door, it is a door that divides into two.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop? - A. A little girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody else? - A. No; I told the girl I had brought some tallow; she stamped with her foot, and Mr. Archer was coming up, when Melkin came into the shop; then he took hold to the bag, and asked what was in it, and dragged it to the door; Mr. Archer came up out of the cellar at the same time; some words passed between Archer and Melkin, but I cannot tell what they were; I saw Archer put something into Melkin's hand; I could not hear what passed; Melkin then threw the bag into the cellar, and went away then as I thought; but he says since that, he did not; the mouth of the bag was loose, and the tallow sell out as he was throwing it down the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. What weight might there be, do you think? - A. About forty pounds; Archer and a young man were in the cellar picking it up, they fetched a thing like a frying-pan, and put it into; I went down, and helped them to pick it up; just as I came down into the cellar, Melkin came close after me, and took a sample of it; he told me to go up out of the cellar, and after that he took me to the Shadwell office.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the bag if it was produced? - A. Yes. (It is produced). There were some holes in the bag, and it was tied up in several places.</p>

               <p>Q. Be so good as look at that tallow? - A. We had such tallow as this, I had linseed also, and this tallow is spotted with linseed.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the sample, and tell us if that is the same kind of tallow? - A. They are both of the same quality.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any bag out of your ship? - A. Not till I had a letter from the Police-office, and then I missed such a bag as this, but I cannot say whether this is it or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long had these boys been on board? - A.Ritchie has been with me near three years, and the other about five months.</p>
               <p>Q.During that time, have they not had the character of honest good lads? - A. I never suspected them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was the character of Lumsdale before? - A. Like the others; I never suspected him of any thing that was bad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. What is that tallow worth? - A. About forty-six shillings a hundred.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TELLKAMPFF sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the clerks attending at Shadwell office; I was present when Ritchie was under examination, I took it myself, I saw Ritchie sign it, and I saw the Magistrate sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he signed it, was there any promise or threat held out to induce him to confess? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. There is a little talk sometimes in the outer office, was he not told there, that it would be a much better thing for him to confess? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Nor that it would be worse for him if he did not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Brown.) Were you present with him in the outer office? - A. No; he was in the custody of Cook, I believe.</p>
               <p>JOHN COOK sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Was Ritchie in your custody? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he went in to be examined, was he not told it would be better for him to tell all he knew? - A. He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Not that it would be worse for him if he did not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Tellkampff read the examination of Ritchie before the Magistrate, which exactly corresponded with the account given by Lumsdale the witness).</p>
               <p>Ritchie's defence. I have gone on shore very frequently, on errands for the master and mate, with Lumsdale, I did not know that he had any such thing as that along with him; I leave the rest to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>Penny's defence. I was in the ship, and never out of it till I was brought out by one of the officers; I know nothing at all of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You do not know any thing at all about Ritchie going but what Lumsdale told you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN LUMSDALE sworn. - Examined by Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140064"/>Knowlys. Q. I went on shore the 9th of January, the mate sent me on shore, and Ritchie went with me; we took some tallow on shore with us in a mat.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Biggin.) Q. When was it that Lumsdale told you that he and Ritchie had stole some tallow the night before? - A. He did not tell me any thing about stealing the tallow that night, only that he was in the boat with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did Lumsdale ever, at any time, tell you any thing about stealing any tallow, except that which you gave evidence of on the last trial? - A. No; except at his examination before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q.Lumsdale went on shore on Tuesday night by your orders? - A. Yes; and when he came back with the boat, he told me Ritchie had been with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Lumsdale.) Q. What was done the night before you were taken up? - A. I went on shore with Ritchie.</p>
               <p>Q. On that night did you take any thing with you? - A. Yes, I took a mat with some tallow in it; I got the lend of the Charlotte's boat, and me and Ritchie got along-side our own ship, and Penny handed over the tallow into the boat to me, and Ritchie rowed the boat to King James's stairs, and I went to Mr. Archer's house to see if there was anybody that I thought would stop me; I saw nobody, and I came back to the boat and took the tallow to Mr. Archer's; there was about the same quantity of it as there was the night I was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever steal any tallow before this-this last voyage? - A. Yes, three times before; Mr. Archer gave me twelve shillings for it; there were two or three forty pounds, I think, of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Are you quite certain that the quantity was two or three forty pounds, and that you received twelve shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that before the Magistrate? - A. No; I said twenty-five pounds, and that I received five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. This examination of your's, at Shadwell-office, was upon oath? - A. Yes; and I did tell the truth; I did not say that I did not receive more.</p>
               <p>Q. But you were sworn to tell the whole truth? - A. I did not give all my evidence then, I told the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sworn to tell the whole truth? - A. Yes; I told the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. But not the whole truth? - A. No; I had been in prison with Penny, and he said, if I turned King's evidence, and confessed more then we agreed to confess, and he ever met me afterwards, he would be hung for me, meaning that he would kill me; and that was the reason why I did not tell the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tellkampff read the examination of the prisoner, Ritchie, taken by himself as follows;"Taken on the 11th of January, 1798.</p>
               <p>"On Thursday evening last, after we left work, Lumsdale asked leave of the mate to go on shore; that there was a quantity of tallow lying upon the beams in the said ship, that had fallen out of the casks, which the cooper could not get into the casks; Penny, Lumsdale, and myself, agreed to take it, and Lumsdale and myself brought it in the boat to King James's stairs; Lumsdale carried it to sell; he told me and Penny that he had sold the tallow, but did not say to whom, and that he had got two-pence halfpenny a pound. I had no part of the said money, only some bread and butter; I was never concerned in taking any out of the ship before, and neither mate not master knew of the tallow being taken out of the ship."</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. The 11th of January was of a Thursday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Lumsdale was brought to your house the same night? - A. Yes; and Ritchie the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. The day he describes himself to have taken it, was on the Thursday before? - A. Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140065"/>Q. Whereabouts was the weight of it? - A.It was about forty pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us all that passed? - A.His house is about 30 or 40 yards from the stairs; I went towards Mr. Archer's, and I was stopped in Star-street by Melkin, he asked me what I had got; I then went into Mr. Archer's shop and put it behind the half-door, there was only a girl in the shop; Mr. Melkin came in, and asked what was in the bag, and he dragged it from behind the door; the little girl stamped with her foot when I came in, and Mr. Archer came up, then words passed between Mr. Archer and Melkin, but I don't know what they were; the bag of tallow was thrown into the cellar; I saw Mr. Archer put something into Melkin's hand, I did not know what; then the bag was thrown down the cellar; I went down the cellar; and some tallow had fallen out, Mr. Archer and a young man picked it up, and I helped them; they put it into a thing like a frying-pan, and before it was all taken up, Mr. Melkin came down and took a sample of it, and told me to go into the street, and then he took me to the Justice's office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Archer know you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the same dress that you are now? A. Yes; only I had a black handkerchief on; I am 16 years of age; I should know the bag again if I was to see it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Are you sure that Melkin did not tell you to throw the bag down? - A. He did not tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Archer said so, or was it Melkin? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said at the Justice's, that Melkin told Archer to throw it down? - A. I don't recollect, I think I did say so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you think now? - A. I think it was Mr. Melkin desired Archer to throw it down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You stated to the Jury just now, that some of the tallow sell out? - A. Yes, some of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say before the Justice that all fell out? - A. I never said all of it fell out of the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say before the Justice it was put into a frying-pan, or any thing of that sort? - A. I said Mr. Archer was picking it up, they did not ask what it was put in.</p>
               <p>Q. The bag was torn? - A. Yes, in several places.</p>
               <p>Q. The bag was so broken that it could not be put into the bag again with security? - A. I don't know that, I did not put it into any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been aboard ship? - A.Two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, on board of ship, such a thing as I am going to describe to you-did you ever hear of sweepings, whether there is not a good deal of tallow swept up, which is thought the perquisite of the crew? - A. I have heard of a thing called sweepings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this tallow dirty or clean tallow? - A. It was not very clean, nor yet very dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. You are admitted an evidence on the part of the Crown, and you have been in custody ever since? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a serjeant belonging to the Tower Hamlets: On the 10th of January, in the evening, I was in Star-street, I saw a person coming with a bag, and I asked him what he had got; he said, what is that to you; he said, he had got some tallow; he went into Mr. Archer's, and threw the tallow down, I went in and seized Lumsdale with one hand, and the tallow with the other; Mr. Archer came up and desired I would let the boy go away, for he might be sent on board a man of war, and drop the tallow down, and he would give me half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. If you would let go the tallow and drop it down, he would give you half-a-crown? - A. He nodded towards the cellar, I received the half-crown, and I dropped it down; I afterwards went down and took a sample of the tallow from the bag, and brought the boy along with me to the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What did Archer say? - A. Mr. Archer said he would go down with him; I went down with them, and we found the bag as I stated before; Mr. Archer took the tallow from under the drip-board, he pointed to it himself, it was in a tub or cask; the officer said he must have the tallow, and Mr. Archer put the tallow into the bag out of the tub; the officer then said, he wanted the other tallow that was brought before; Archer said, what was left of it was lying under the drip-board; a sheet of paper was procured, and Mr. Archer put it into it; we took the tallow to a Magistrate.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Shadwell-office: I went to the house of Mr. Archer, in consequence of an information by Mr. Melkin; I went with Mr. Melkin and the boy Lumsdale, to Mr. Archer's shop; the girl was in the shop, and she called him out of the cellar; I said to Mr. Archer, I am come for the bag of tallow that was brought by this boy; he asked me what was the matter; Mr. Archer seemed to turn himself round, and under the drip-board he picked up the bag; says I, Mr. Archer, I must have the tallow as well as the bag.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. The bag was empty? - A. Yes; says he, here is the tallow in this cask or tub, and he assisted me in shooting the tallow into the bag; now says I, Mr. Archer, you must go with me to the office; he said, I wish you would let me wash and clean myself before I go; I told him he must go with me, he begged I would not take him with me, but leave him behind; I told him there was a felony committed, and therefore I could not leave him; Mr. M'Carthy came to the door, and several other people, and said he would pass his word for him, he is a publican, and keeps a public-house on the other side of the way.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What time was this? - A. This was about eight o'clock, it might be a quarter after; I brought him to the office, and the boy went under an examination, and likewise him, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. After he was committed what passed? - A.After he was committed, he went over to the public-house with me; he begged to go to his house again, for he had some particular business to settle; after some time, I granted the favour; I carried Lumsdale, Melkin, and Cook, with us.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he say any thing more? - A. He said he thought they would come after the tallow again. (The bag produced.)</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he not give you as a reason that the bag was so holely that he was obliged to put it into something else? - A. I cannot swear he said that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Is the bag in the same state in which it was at Archer's? - A. No, I cannot say it is, here is a skewer in it, the string had slipped off.</p>

               <p>Q.Has the daughter had access to your workshop? - A. She has, for two years past, I believe. On the 9th of February, I was sent for to Messrs.

             sworn. - I am clerk to Mr. Adams: We weigh silver out to the workmen, and we weigh in again; I have found silver deficient for a year and a half or two years back.</p>
               <p>Q.Lately? - A. Yes; I believe within the last month.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. These deficiencies will arise, I suppose, if the filings or scrapings should be taken away? - A. I suppose they might.</p>
               <p>JAMES FARREN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am clerk to Messrs. Cox and Murle: On Thursday, the 8th of February, the prisoner brought to us this silver.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state is that silver? - A. It is very badly melted.</p>
               <p>Q.What did it appear to have been? - A.Silver filings and scrapings.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What difference is there between the scrapings and the filings? - A. I never was in the workman's line, the prisoner at the bar brought it to me, and desired me to get it melted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Had she ever been at the shop before? - A. Yes; she told me she was the wife of a springer and liner, which is a branch in watch making, she left it with me; after she was gone, I looked at the silver, and suspected, from the appearance of it, that it had not been properly come by; she came the next day, and I sent for Mr. Aldridge, in Aldersgate-street, he questioned her about it, and we stopped her; I told her, we suspected it was improperly come by, and she at last confessed that her husband worked for Mr. Adams; she said, he was not in fault at all, and begged we would not hurt her poor girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promise of favour made her, or did you tell her it would be better for her to confess? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor worse for her if she did not? - A. No, she kept crying out, her poor girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say how she came by the silver? - A. No, we sent for the girl, and she confessed she had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing that she said, pass in the presence of the prisoner? - A. No, we kept them separate; she left the silver in the name of Lowe.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Adams.) Q. In what capacity did the husband work for you? - A. As a polisher and filer of spoons.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140068"/>Q. He did not work in the capacity of a springer or liner? - A. No, nothing of that sort is carried on in our house.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the difference between scrapings and filings? - A. The scrapings are done by an edge 100l that scrapes off long pieces, the filings are what fall from the file.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Are these scrapings and filings? - A. Both filings and scrapings are exceedingly visible.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us the manner in which you were alarmed? - A. The girl came with a letter into the parlour, and three men came in just at her back, we asked what they wanted, they said</p>
               <p>"money and watches."</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the faces of these men? - A. No, they were disguised; there was one had a crape over his face, and two of them, I think, had handkerchiefs; I gave them my watch, and what money I had in my pocket, it was only a metal watch, I gave them my purse, it contained only one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your sisters give them any thing? - A. Yes; then they asked for colonel Waugh; they said we had nothing to fear if we were quiet, but if not, we must be tied.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any arms? - A. Yes, they had all of them pistols; the man who stood over us said that colonel Waugh had done him an injury in the West-Indies, but he would be revenged that night; one always stood by us, two went up stairs, and one staid in the passage.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You could not see the face of those persons, can you describe the dress of that person that stood over you? - A. No, I cannot, I was so much frightened; we staid about an hour in the parlour, while they were bringing down the things, and when they had brought them down, the person who stood over us said, ladies you must now go into the back kitchen, till we get the passage clear, and the things carried out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go into the back kitchen? - A. Yes, and my sisters with me, and the servant, the man accompanied us.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there? - A. I think near about an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did you see any property taken away? - A. I did not see them, I heard them pushing and forcing the things open, drawers and other things, some time after the person left me; I don't know whether they left the house together.</p>
               <p>Q. After that person left you, did you hear any other person in the house? - A. I think they went all away; we staid a good while in the kitchen, because we were not sure they were gone; there were four boxes belonging to colonel Waugh, that were packed that day by colonel Waugh's servant and his brother.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you tell me what property you lost? - A. I lost two trunks, I can tell some of the property, but I cannot tell the whole.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 7, New-road, St. Pancras, I am a housekeeper: On Wednesday, the 31st of January, I had occasion to go to Mr. Woodroofe's, the Acorn public-house, Bridewell Precinct, on business, between one and two o'clock; the landlord not being at home, I waited for him; while I was waiting for him, a hackney-coach came up to the door, and four men came into the house, part of them from the coach, with four boxes or trunks, I was sitting in the bar; the coach being so near, I observed the number to be eight hundred and twenty-one; they endeavoured to go backwards to a back parlour, rather retired; all seemed, apparently, confused to get backwards to this parlour; the landlady asked them, where they were going; they said, into the parlour; she made answer, I am not going to have my parlour made a warehouse of; there is a room for you, if you like to sit down; it was a room on the left hand, at the side of the bar, they went in there, and called for a shillingsworth of rum and water, and they threw the door to; there they remained some time; one of them came out to have the second glass filled, he went away, and brought the same coach off the stand again; the landlady and I had a strong suspicion, she sent for her husband, she found her husband was at the Harrow, a little way off, in Water-lane; just before he came in, one of them came out of the room, and put a box into the coach, the coach got about ten or a dozen yards from the door, when a second came and brought a box out, and called to the coachman; then the landlord went out and looked at the coach and number, and the men that were in the coach.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. When the landlord came back, what did you and he do? - A. After he had taken notice of the coach, he went into the room, his wife requested me to go; I followed the landlord into the room, and there was one box standing upon the table, and as much paper torn to pieces as I could hold in my two hands, on the table; the landlord questioned them about the paper and about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140071"/>the trunk, he imagined they did not come by it honestly, he told them so; the prisoner at the bar replied, that he was a gentleman, that they were his; the other man was dressed somewhat like a servant, with a striped jacket; he unstrapped the trunk, and shewed us the contents; he shewed us some men's wearing apparel and breeches; he said, he would go to shoemaker-row, it is not far off, to fetch a person; we let him go; just as he went away, the landlord went into the bar to serve some liquor, and left me and the prisoner in the room; after his companion was gone, he endeavoured to make his escape, he wanted to follow; I laid hold of him by the collar, I was towards the door-way, he was innermost in the room; the landlord said, in the bar, don't let him go, he shall not go till his friend comes back; he directly made a push to get away, I laid hold of him by the collar to prevent him, till such time as his friend returned; he then drew a brace of pistols from his pocket, and he gave me a violent blow on this finger, and cut my knuckles with the pistols, I was obliged to let go my hold; he held the pistols to my face, and to the best of my recollection, he expressed, "come on now, come"on;" I drew back a little, and I called out for the poker, when a coal-heaver pushed in to my assistance, and laid hold of him, he pushed him to the further end of the room, I followed him; the coal-heaver wrenched the pistols out of his hand, and we held him there till such time as an officer was sent for from Bridewell Precinct, to search him; at the time we held him, before the officer came, he offered us half-a-guinea, if we would let him go; I made a reply to him if he would give me one hundred, he should not be loose; when the officer came, he searched him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did he find? - A. He found a telescope in a leather case. The officer belonging to Bridewell, me and the landlord, lodged him in the Compter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Who took charge of the trunk? - A. The officer belonging to Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who took the telescope? - A.Weaver, the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When he was searched, there was nothing found upon but the telescope? - A. Nothing that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at the door preventing him going out, it was then he presented those pistols? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not loaded? - A. I did not open them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. How was the prisoner dressed? - A. The prisoner had a light brown great coat on, and a pair of pantaloons of a white colour, tied down like a marine's, they were made of canvass.</p>

               <p>Q. When you missed the horse, you went down to Banbury? - A. Yes; on the 6th of November; I went to Mr. Wyatt's, he keeps the White Lion, he is the post-master.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went there, did you find any horse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.D marks of this gelding before you missed - He was a black horse, he had a star in his face, two saddle marks upon each side, four white marks upon his pole.</p>
               <p>Q. How was his tail? - A. His tail was a full switch tail.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was his legs? - A. His off leg behind was white.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Mr. Gosling had the horse? - A.About a year and a half; I bought him for Mr. Gosling, he is a cart horse; I found him at Mr. Wyatt's, at Banbury, in the stable, he was standing there, trimmed, his main had been pulled and his tail docked.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the tail appears after it was docked? - A. As a coach-horse, it was quite fore then, it appeared to have been done for the value of a day or two, it was quite raw and fore; I am sure it is the same horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the horse know you? - A. I think he did; immediately as I went into the stable, the horse turned his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners at the bar at Banbury? - A. I got down on the Monday night, and I saw the prisoners the next day morning at breakfast, at Mr. Wyatt's.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts in the house? - A. I am not positive what room, but I think, in the kitchen; nothing passed between us, Mr. Wyatt was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they taken into custody? - A. On the Tuesday morning, the same morning I saw them at breakfast, it was near nine o'clock, I was not in the room when they were taken, I was with them when they went before the Magistrate, I don't know the name of the place, Mollington, I think, was the name; the Magistrate committed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do I understand you, that over night, you left this horse and two others in the field? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master was very angry with you the next day, because the horses were gone? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us you shut the gate, did you tell your master so? - A. I am sure it was shut.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Describe how it was shut? - A. By listing of it up.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Had you ever known the horses go astray before? - A. They had got out, but this horse never left his company.</p>
               <p>Q. You had always been as careful in shutting the gate as you were that day? - A. Yes; but sometimes they got through a gap.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were there gaps in the field at the time you speak of, where they could get out? - A. Yes, there were gaps there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. What distance might the field be where the horses were from the common where you found the other horses? - A. About four or five hundred yards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140075"/>Q. How many miles might it be from your master's house to Banbury? - A. That I don't know; it is about forty miles to Oxford from Hounslow, and I suppose it is about one or two and twenty miles from there to Banbury.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the horse in the stable, he appeared differently from the horse you had lost? - A. He was trimmed and docked.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us the horse, when you opened the stable-door, turned round and saw you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Notwithstanding those alterations, you had no doubt it was your master's horse? - A. No; the moment I saw him I knew him; I can swear it is the same horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaillant. Q. Thought the horse has got out of the field before, you always found him with his company? - A. Always.</p>
               <p>Q. But you found the gate open in the morning? - A. Yes; and found the other horses only a quarter of a mile off.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you? - A. I keep the White-lion, at Banbury; I have seen the prisoner, Swaine, at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Banbury from Oxford? - A.Twenty-three miles.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Swaine come to your house? - A. On Thursday the 2d of November, between nine and ten o'clock at night; he brought a black gelding with him, it was a heavy coach-horse, or a light cart-horse, I conceived him to be fifteen hands high; I particularly remember a mark upon his pole, four white strokes near the ear, a star in his forehead, three, or more, spots by the saddle.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his legs? - A. Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, before that, receiving any hand-bill? - A. Not before the horse was taken; I saw a hand-bill which came by the post, on Saturday November the 4th, and, in consequence of that hand-bill, it led me to observe the horse more particularly than I should have done.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe? - A. I observed the horse had been lately docked, within a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else? - A. I observed him to have a hollow back.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the prisoner, Swaine, brought this horse was any body else with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Swaine riding the horse at the time he brought him? - A. Yes; he rode him into my yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass between you and Swaine? - A. Not immediately.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he come as a guest to your house with this horse? - A. He did; and the next morning trimmed the horse, he supped and slept at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed the next morning? - A. He told me he had got a very useful horse for my purpose, to run at the wheel of a coach; this was after he had trimmed him.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to trimming, what do you mean? - A.Trimming heels, pulling mane, and cleaning ears; then he told me he had got a very useful horse for the wheel; I asked him whereabouts; the price might be; he said, twelve guineas; we did not deal; I did not think the horse was two dear, but I did not chuse to hazard my money; the horse was cheap at that price.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other conversation pass between you and Swaine? - A. He repeated it very much, he begged of me to become a purchaser.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from him where he came from with the horse? - A. He said he had bought him; I believe he said at Uxbridge, but I am not confident.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn how long he had hand him? - A. I don't think he said how long he had had him; that was all the conversation that took place on the Friday; he staid in the house the remainder of the day of Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. The horse remained in the stable all Friday? - A. The stable yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the other prisoner, Holderness? - A. Yes, I do; he came on the Sunday evening, much about eight o'clock; the horse remained there Friday and Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he come? - A. He came on horse back.</p>
               <p>Q. When he arrived at your house, was the other prisoner there? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they meet each other? - A. I believe, Swaine might expect him, for they went into the yard together; they had been at my house five or six weeks before that, and Swaine staid then eight or ten days.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them both together, and they appeared acquainted with each other, do you remember any conversation passing relative to this business? - A. Not till the next morning; when I saw them before, they described themselves as partners in a coach, and dealers in horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they give any other account of themselves at all then? - A. I don't recollect that they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they say that they came from? - A.Ealing, in Effex; this was the former time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on the Monday morning, you say you had some conversation, were they both together at that time? - A. Yes, about nine o'clock; they both requested me to go and see the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before the time they requested you to go and see the horse, that you received the handbill? - A. I received the hand-bill before; Swaine says to Holderness, I have shewn Mr. Wyatt the horse, and he does not chuse to buy him; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140076"/>thinks he is rather too sluggish; then I was requested, by Holderness, to see the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what passed when you were with the horse? - A. I asked Holderness the price of the horse, and he asked me twelve guineas; I did not become a purchaser, I was confident, from the description of the hand-bill, it was the horse belonging to Mr. Gosling; they desired me, if I thought him too sluggish, to run him in my coach; I did not immediately say I would not, because I was in expectation that the horse would be owned; I had, on the Saturday, sent up information, from what the hand-bill expressed, to Mr. Bennett, at the Rose and Crown, Hounflow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try him in the stage? - A. No; I kept them in suspense about trying the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them say where they got the horse, or purchased the horse? - A. They said they bought him, but I don't recollect they said where.</p>
               <p>Q. All this happened on the Monday? - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did any body arrive at Banbury? - A. I believe it was between ten and eleven o'clock at night, on Monday evening; Hall came.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he shewn this horse? - A. Yes; and he owned him as the property of Mr. Gosling, he described the horse before he saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the prisoners at this time? - A. They were in bed in one of my rooms; on the next morning, about nine o'clock, I made known the charge I had got against them, and charged them in custody of the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. You were present at the time the peace-officers secured them? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing? - A. They sat with their backs to the light, consequently the constable was behind them; the constable said, you must go with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say? - A. They said they should not go till they knew what it was for; I told them, it was in consequence of horse-stealing; they requested to know which horse it was, Holderness did, and Swaine was close by him; I told them it was the black horse; Mr. Gosling's servant came in, and they turned round from the table, and Holderness said, he lived servant with Mr. Gosling.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that before Hall had said any thing to them? - A. He had made his appearance, but he had not spoke, Mr. Gosling's name had not at all been mentioned; the constable said, I must not be detained here, you must go with me; and he took them before a Magistrate, and he committed them to Oxford Castle; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I understand the prisoner, Swaine, came to your house on the Friday evening? - A. On the Thursday evening; the other came three days after.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a good many other inns in the town besides your's? - A. There is but one other inn.</p>
               <p>Q.Notwithstanding it was thus public, from hand-bills passing through the town, yet those men remained in your house afterwards, and actually wanted to part with the horse? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us when the horse came to your house it was docked? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was nothing uncommon in taking the shears and dressing a horse? - A. Nothing uncommon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the Post-master? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any other hand-bill, except the one you have mentioned, by the post, answering the description we have heard of? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other hand-bills that came in the form of a letter by the Post directed to other publicans? - A. There was no other hand-bill that came to Banbury that day to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you got the hand-bill? - (The hand-bill produced).</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Are you sure this is the handbill you received? - A. Yes; I put my own mark upon it when I received it. (It is read).</p>

               <p>Q.Describe how the body was dressed? - A. He had a new pair of breeches on, and a mixture-coloured coat, like a pepper-and-falt colour; he had a pair of velveteen breeches on, of a quite light colour.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by velveteen, it was not leather breeches? - A. No; he had a kerseymere waistcoat on of a light stripe, and a flannel waistcoat under that; he had a round hat, it was upon his head when I found it, and one side of it was otten.</p>
               <p>Q.Were his pockets searched? - A. His coat pockets were searched; there was one farthing, a tobacco-box, a pair of spectacles, and a pocket-handkerchief, a linen one; the body was carried to the Cherry Tree, at Bromley; I helped to fatch it out for the corner to sit upon it; I have lived there ever since, and work at the same place I did then.</p>
               <p>Q. So that, in all probability he was not a man known in the neighbourhood? - A. Not that I have heard.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you happen to know the prisoner? - A. Yes, I knew him very well, I knew him a boy; I knew him when he lived at Mr. Atkinson's, on the Green, at Stratford.</p>
               <p>Q. What employment was he in at Mr. Atkinson's? - A. As a servant, a livery servant.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course, finding the body under these circumstances, was very notorious? - A. Yes, the field was soon full; it was given out to be Mr. Phillips's collecting-clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Phillips is a brewer? - A. Yes.</p>

            , and his shirt was marked A R Z, he had a round hat, with the name John Whitely, manufacturer, Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no means of tracing who he was? - A. A clerk of Mr. Phillips's had at that time absconded with a large sum of money, I knew the clerk well, which made me more particular in the examination of the body, a rumour had gone abroad that it was him, his name was Dickinson, he is since returned, and is now in Mr. Meux's brew-house; I directed the officers of the parish to make every possible enquiry, but it has not been discovered to this day who the person was.</p>
               <p>Q.In all probability it could not be any body in the neighbourhood? - A.There was no person missing at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to know any thing about the prisoner at this time? - A.No, I did not; the Jury found the murder to have been committed by a person or persons unknown, on the body of a person unknown.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. FORD sworn. - Court. Q. Mr. Ford, when were you applied to with respect to the prisoner? - A. I was at the Secretary of State's office, I believe, when the letter came from the West-Indies.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the letter coming from the West-Indies what was done? - A.Having read one of the inclosures in that letter, I directed an enquiry to be made, respecting the persons he had charged with the murder, in order that I might have them apprehended; when the prisoner came to England, I found one of the persons was a gardener, his name was Stephens, and another person of the name of Davis, who was a coachman to a gentleman in Kent, but I could not discover any thing at that time about it; I then wrote to the Mayor of Portsmouth, desiring him to keep the prisoner till I sent for him; when I heard he was arrived from the West-Indies, I sent down an officer to bring him to London, and another officer to apprehend Stephens, Stephens was apprehended before the prisoner came to town, I examined him, and he denied it; I then examined the prisoner, his examination your Lordship has got.</p>
               <p>Q. That, of course, was carefully taken, and contains the account he gave of the transaction?(The examination produced.) A. Yes, it is in my own hand-writing, and signed by the prisoner, I saw the prisoner make that mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of these men produced before the prisoner? - A.There were three shewn him, Stephens, Davis, and Skinner, they were shewn to him at different times; Stephens was shewn to him at the first examination; I had Stephens put into a yard, among other persons, and I made the prisoner look out of a window, to see if amongst there persons any one of the murderers wee assembled, he said no, none of them were there; I asked him to look again, to see if any body was there that he knew, then after some time, he said he knew one Stephens that was there, upon which I had Stephens confronted with him; he then said, that was not the Stephens that had been concerned with the murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that Stephens answer the description he had given of him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other Stephens answer the descrip<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140079"/>tion in his information except him? - A. No; no, other person came.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no other Stephens answered the description but this Stephens, and when shewn to him, he said, that was not the Stephens? - A. He said it was not. - In regard to Davis, nearly a similar circumstance took place: he was put into the yard with the others, and he said, there were none of the persons concerned in the murder, but that he knew a man there whose name was Davis, but that was not the man he meant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, after that, give any other account of any other, Davis or Stephens? - A. No. - With respect to the otehr, he was shewn a man answering the description of Skinner, he said he did not know him, that was not the Skinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he acknowledge this was what passed upon his examintion in the West Indies? - A. He acknowledged it was the substance of what passed in the West-Indies, except he had never said, that Stephens had cut the man's throat.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in fact, he did not deny that person was said to be Mr. Phillips's clerk? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that paper transmitted from General Taylor, in the West-Indies? - (The paper produced.) A. Yes; they were given to me in this manner,</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner has deposed that Stephens and Davis were concerned in the murder, did he admit before you that part of his deposition? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He understood, and admitted that he had said the person that was murdered, was the brewer's clerk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And that that was the account he had given of it in the West-Indies? - A. Yes; there were no other persons to be found of that description, and he said, they were none of them the persons that he meant.</p>

            , and Thomas Skinner, they went to a public-house called the Three Drovers, where they had three pots of beer, when Davis proposed to him taking a walk with them to a public-house at Oldford; that they all went there, and stopped there eating and drinking till three o'clock in the afternoon; that none of them then said a word about robbing or murdering any body; about half past three, Davis proposed taking a walk across the field, which was agreed to; that, in a field, they met a gentleman coming towards them in a blue coat and bucks-skin breeches, the gentleman passed them all, except Davis, who was behind, and believes Davis knocked the gentleman down, for when he turned round, he saw the gentleman upon the ground, and he and Stevens, and Skinner, then went up and asked Davis what was the matter with the gentleman, if he was in liquor? upon which he replied, he has plenty of money, let us have some of it; Davis then took out a small pen-knife, and while skinner and Stephens laid hold of him, Davis cut the gentleman's throat, the gentleman struggled, but did not say any thing; Davis then took some notes out of the gentleman's pocket, and some cash out of his breechest pocket; that he took out a great deal of cath, and put it into his own pocket; he then dragged the body into the corn, the field having either wheat or rye in it, he thinks the latter, that it was pretty high, and that it quite hid the dead body. - This examinant says, that when Davis first saw the gentleman, he said, he believed that he knew him; that after they had so committed the murder, they went to whitechapel, and from there to Red-Lion-street, where they had some beer, and afterwards to a public-house in Holborn, where they had some beer, and went into a private room, and Davis shared the money amongst them, and gave the examinant 150l. 50l. and 10l. in notes, and the rest in guineas; Davis said, the murdered gentleman had been gathering money from public-houses, and was a collecting clerk; after they had shared the money, the examinant went away, and got home about two o'clock in the morning; the examinant lodged at Stratford; he carried the money generally about him, and about a fortnight afterwards, he changed the 50l. note at the Coach and Horses, at Stratford, that he had in change a 10l. note, and the rest in cash; that the landlord changed it, his name was Gibson; the examinant lived on at Stratford, and worked labouring work as usual, and in about twelve months had spent all the money; that he had drank a good deal, and was a good deal troubled in his mind, so much so, that about a year and a half age he enlisted as a soldier with serjeant Jervis, at Stratford, and six months afterwards, was sent to the West-Indies, with three hundred men, to recruit the troops at Matinique; he says, once after the murder, he met Davis, Stevens and Skinner, and drank with them at a public-house in Whitechapel; that he had seen Davis at a public-house in Red-lion-street, about two months after the murder; he afterwards saw him driving a hackney-coach in Holborn, and drank with him; and he has never seen Stevens or Skinner since; that when the murder was committed, Davis left the knife near the dead body, it had a black handle. Examinant says he thinks he was born near Saffron-Walden, in Essex, and is about thirty years of age, and that the prisoner now shewn to him, Stevens, was not the person who was with him, when he committed the murder aforesaid.</p>

Davis, mentioned in the former examination, is a coachman, thirty years old, rather lufty, about five feet eight inches tall, wore his own lank hair curled at the sides and short behind, had on a blue coat, round hat and boots; that after he had cut the gentleman's throat his hand was bloody, and he washed it at a ditch; that he does not know where he is now. - Examinant further says, Stephens is about five feet eight inches high, longish nose, older than Davis by a few years, and wore a drab coat; that examinant knew him where he lived, five or six years before, as gardener at Mr. Cooke's, the distilers, at Bow, but does not know where he lived when the murder was done. With regard to Skinner, he never saw him till the day of the murder; he looked like a labourer, about forty years old, black hair hanging over his shoulder, flourish made, black eyes, and full thick nose. - Examinant was in liquor at the time the murder was done.</p>

             called again. - Q. Were you, in consequence of the examination of the prisoner, employed to inquire after either Davis, Skinner, or Stephens? - A. Yes, Stephens.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him? - A. Not the Stephens that was first apprehended; Sayers is here who apprehended him first.</p>
               <p>JOHN SAYERS sworn. - I apprehended Stephens; I made the first inquiry in Red-lion-street, Holborn, after Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to inquire there? - A. I believe, it was in consequence of the confession of this man, that first led me to inquire there.</p>
               <p>Q. what was his name? - A. I am not sure, I believe, John; I found that he lived with a gentleman in Mark-lane; in consequence of that I went there, and learned that he was in the country, and the gentleman said, he would produce him on any day at Bow-street, when the prisoner was examined again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he produced? - A. Yes; he came to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you go to Red-lion-street to inquire? - A. In some part of his confession, he said he was a coachman, and he had lived with a Mr. Atkinson, in Red-lion-street, there I learned that Mr. Atkinson was gone away; I told them I wanted to see his coachman, that I was just come out of the country; in consequence of that, I found him in Mark-lane, and he was produced at Bow-street; I went to one of the India Warehouses and apprehended Skinner; Warren had described him as a coachman too; from the description of Skinner, I made inquiry among the Hackney-coachmen how many Skinners there were Hackney-coachmen, and there I learned there were three brothers; I asked if there was any one of them that had long carrotty whiskers; and they said, yes, there was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner described him as such? - A. Yes, but not in my hearing; I learned that two of them were dead; I apprehended the one that was living, and took him to Bow-street; the prisoner, to the best of my knowledge, said, that he knew that man, but he was not the man that he meant; I afterwards went to Hendon, and apprehended Stephens, and brought him to Bow-street; the prisoner knew him but said he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Ford.) Did he give you any better information where these men were to be found when they turned out not to be the men? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Fugion. When that Stephens was produced, he said there was another Stephens that lived with the same master before this Stephens came there, but upon inquiry, we learned that there had not lived any other Stephens in the family.</p>

             sworn. - In the year 1794, I lived at the Coach and Horses at Stratford; I had lived there seven years before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, did you happen to know him while you lived at Stratford? - A.Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he? - A. I never knew he had any constant employment; I took him to be a labourer with Mr. Atkinson, I did not understand him to be a yearly servant, he was among the coachmen.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have remembered the story of a person having been found apparently murdered in the corn-fields? - A. Yes, I do recollect the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. It was very notorious, was it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever frequent your house? - A. Sometimes he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Either before or after the time of this person being so found dead had the prisoner ever changed any note, with you? - A. No, never in his life.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever make any application to change any Bank-note, or other note? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible that you may have changed a note for him, and that it had escaped your memory at this time? - A. I do not think it possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Could such a thing, as changing a fifty pound note for him, have escaped your memory? - A. It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you regular in the accounts you kept of your cash? - A. Once in twenty-four hours I know to a penny, or thereabouts, what I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Have your referred to your memorandums, or accounts? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. And nothing of that kind appears? - A. Nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore, it is impossible that any thing of the kind can have happened to you? - A. Cer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140081"/>tainly; more especially as coming from such a man; such a thing as a fifty pound note does not very often come by me.</p>

               <p>Court. Prisoner. If it had not been that the laws of this country will not suffer the life of a man to be take away, even upon his own confession, without a close examination of all the circumstances of the case, in all probability your life might have been forfeited, and I don't know whether it would have been much to be lamented or not if that had so happened; you have been guilty of a gross falsehood, probably with a view of evading the service of your King and Country in that part of the world in which you happened to be; it is to be hoped, however, that your intentions will be frustrated, and that you will be sent back to the same, or a similar station, where you may be in a condition to serve your King and Country.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am foreman to Mr. Briant, the lighter-man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner employed by you? - A. He was employed to bring up three crast; he was not the man tath stowed them, nor the man that watched them; I lent him a hand up with one of them part of the way, up to Porter's-quay.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not he the care of the crast? - A. No; he always had another man with him.</p>

               <p>Q. You came up with him with the lighter, did you leave him with the lighter? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go away together? - A. I cannot rightly say, but I know I was pretty well the last man that left that crast, barring the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has be been engaged in unloading fur ships? - A. I cannot say he was engaged at all in unloading the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it his business to bring them up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he been employed to bring up the crast? - A. I cannot say, it may be two or three years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him? - A. Sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him engaged by Briant? - A.Eight or nine years.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he, during that time, been engaged in bringing up the crast from fur ships? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long have you been employed yourself? - A. Near ten years, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you continued in his employ all that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner has also been employed between eight and nine years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not the prisoner who was at all entrusted with the property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not Custom-house officers on board, to whom the care of the property is committed? - A. Yes, during the time they are on board.</p>
               <p>Q. There was also a watchman belonging to the merchants? - A. Belonging to the captain there was.</p>

               <p>Q. After you come up to the shore, is it not committed from the officers belonging to the ship, to officers belonging to the shore? - A. Yes; as soon as we were showed in shore, there was a watchman sat, but he seemed to be in liquor, and there were two watchmen of Mr. Briant's put into the lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the custody of the lighter was given to them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the duty of the prisoner, after the charge was given to these men? - A. To go home, if he pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not his duty to have gone on board? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But is it not the usual custom? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Whetever you took from the Uretta, was taken on the Surry side of the river. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, was there an opportunity, all the time the prisoner was on board, to have cut, untied, and tied up again those bales, without your observing him, or the Customhouse officers? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came on shore, were you not moored alongside other lighters, not belonging to Briant? - A. Yes, many empty lighters.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether this was a lighter that belonged to Briant, or one that was hired for that day for the purpose of carrying these goods? - A. It belonged to Mr. Briant.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you on your passage from the ship Uretta to the shore? - A. I look upon it to be about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was it from the ship to the Custom-house? - A. Best part of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on board from the first? - A. No, I came on shore about half way between the ship and where the lighter went to land; the tide ran very hard, that made me go to assist him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who was on board besides? - A. A Custom-house officer, and a watchman from the ship; I do not know the name of either.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140083"/>Q. How many lighters had the prisoner under his care that day? - A. No other that that lighter.</p>
               <p>Q.You told us he had three lighters under his care? - A. He brought three different lighters from that ship, during the time she was there, which might be seven or eight days.</p>
               <p>Q. But how many were there on the 5th of January? - A. I don't think there was more than that one came from there that day, that was the first lighter, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you landed? - A. It might be near three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your lighter? - A. I was in the lighter with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not assist in loading her? - A. No; nor the prisoner either.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that, if you were not there? - A. He was not there at the time, I am well convinced.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you? - A. I cannot rightly say, I was at all parts of the River looking after business.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came on shore, who went on shore first? - A. I went on shore first, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave on board then? - A. There was nobody left on board the lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to look after the watchman, to take charge of the lighter? - A. The captain's men, I believe, returned to the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the officer? - A. He went to the ship, I expect, I cannot tell, they must leave their note before they leav the lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. They must leave it with whom? - A. With the King's officer on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do so? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come away with you? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what became of him? - A. I cannot say what he went after.</p>

               <p>Q. What was Fenton charged with there? - A. On suspicion of stealing some skins.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the skins at Mr. Waldock's, on the subject of enquiry? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Were the skins there? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any promise of favour made, if he gave an account of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What was taken down was read over to him? - A. I believe it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - A. I will not be positive that it was read over to him; he looked over the book himself, as I had taken it down before he signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do more than sign it, without reading it? - A.He desired to look at what he signed before he signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who handed the book over to him? - A. He stood close to the table where I was.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time it was written, to the time he signed it, had he time to read it over? - A.He had; he was desired by the Magistrate to read it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was he not frequently cautioned, by the Magistrate, not to sign it till he had read it over? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sign it? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Magistrate sign it in your presence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the original examination? - A. It is.(Reads)."I took the skins to Redmaine, now present; I went to him first, and asked him to buy them; he said he could not say what he could give for them, till he saw them; Redmaine paid six guineas in part; he said they might be worth 30l. or 40l.; I had also 10l. of him, four guineas, and other smaller sums; I found the skins in a lighter, I saw something white under the edge of the lighter; it was not the lighter employed to bring the goods, but an empty one; I told Redmaine I found them in the lighter."</p>

               <p>Q. Was this man charged with stealing other skins that were present at the office, or only the skins that were taken from the ship Uretta? - A. I understood it was the skins taken from that ship.</p>
               <p>Q.The other skins were skins taken from a gentleman in the Borough, and with which some other person was charged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did not you understand the Uretta to be lying on the Surry side of the water? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner sworn to give evidence against any body else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140084"/>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mr. Rowe.) Q. You attended as a witness against the prisoner before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What skins might he be charged with stealing, before the Magistrate? - A. Beaver and otter skins.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he charged with stealing skins from the Uretta? - A. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as look at those skins? - A. These are new beaver skins.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they have been in the market that year? - A. I do not think they could, for they are exactly in the folds in which they came to us from abroad.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the bales of beaver that you received deficient? - A. Yes; we discovered, I believe, sixty or seventy skins, but there might be more, because I believe all our packages are not unpacked yet, but as far as I have examined the packages, there are sixty-seven beaver skins missing; they are worth about ten shillings a skin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How do you know there were so many missing? - A. By comparing the invoice with the quantity that I entered.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the invoice? - A.(Produces it.) It is a consignment to the merchants here.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know the hand-writing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it may or may not be a consignment from abroad for any thing you know? - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that invoices are very frequently incorrect? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you recollect when the prisoner was examined at the Police-office, that although he received frequent admonitious not to make a confession, yet the moment the confession was written, he signed it, without it being ever read to him? - A. No; I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was examined, were there any one of those skins there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore he could make no confession of these skins? - A.Certainly they were not there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Is that the invoice by which the goods are entered? - A. Yes; and the invoice by which we have paid the duties.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner charged with stealing any other skins than what were said to come from the ship Uretta? - A. No others.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there are such skins as these about the town? - A. Not in that state; there are certainly such skins about the town, but there were none came this year but that ship; the whole of last year's came into our possession also.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it is too much the case that goods of this sort are smuggled? - A. I have heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. They never go out of your possession in that state? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Saville.) Q. Are you servant to Mr. Waldock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These were brought by Redmaine's porter? - A. Yes; and Redmaine came the next day to agree for some other skins for one Mr. Fell; some of these beaver and otter skins were lying there, and he said they were remarkable fine skins.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I found them in an empty lighter.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. - I am a watchman employed by a lighterman at Porter's-quay.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time of the Uretta being discharged? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember having any skins given you in charge to take care of on board the lighters? - A. Yes; Bradshaw was with me, one watched the head, and the other the stern.</p>

               <p>Q. If there had been any skins untied or broke, or taken away, should you have observed the vacancy it would have occasioned? - A. No; I do not see how we could see that.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner never came on board the lighter after the things were delivered to you to watch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If any harm had taken place on board the lighter after that time, either you or Bradshaw must have known it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing of that sort did take place? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise of favour? - A.None in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Or any threat? - A. None in the world; I asked him how he came to take the stamps; he acknowledged having the Bank-note, and he acknowledged taking the stamps, but said he had lost them altogether.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Balmanno. Q. In what state were those stamps, had they been used? - A. Not to my knowledge; they were only bought the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not found? - A. He acknowledged having had them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search at the Stamp-office if they had been allowed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual for attorneys' clerks to get money for the purposes of business? - A. Yes; he asked me for some silver, I think it was to get a rule; I am sure there was nothing wanted that evening that could exceed twelve shillings; I believe, the whole that he had to do, was only four shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that business done? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Court. If you give a clerk a Bank-note for the purpose of doing business for you, and he takes the remainder of it for his own use, that is not stealing a Bank-note, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not frequently the case that attorneys' clerks take out stamps for the purpose of doing business? - A. Not in our office.</p>
               <p>Q. But is it not very frequently done? - A. I cannot say what is done in other offices.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LAMB sworn. - I am partner with Mr. Phillipson; I know no more of it than he does.</p>
               <p>Mr. Balmanno. Q. What character had you with the prisoner? - A. A very good one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at this confession that we have heard of? - A. Yes; he said he had taken the stamps, and lost them with the Bank-note.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not understand from that acknowledgment, that he meant to take this Bank-note and the stamps? - A. Yes, I did: I myself gave him the order to take out the rule, it was a rule for judgment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I left the employ of these gentlemen on the Friday evening, and the stamps might be in the office then, for any thing I know; these stamps I absolutely engrossed myself, and left them in the office.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. That poor fellow is one of the Tower-Hamlets Militia? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q.One man came into your shop under pretence of buying? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, that he only came in under pretence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the prisoner till you caught hold of him by the collar, with the umbrella in his hand? - A. Yes, I saw him come up to the door with the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you ever see them speak one to the other? - A. I cannot swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by swearing that they came together then, if you did not see them speak to each other? - A. They came together.</p>
               <p>Q. There is generally a croud about that time on a Saturday evening? - A. Yes, no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q.What you came back with the prisoner, was the other man in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you thought them both connected, why did not you take them both into custody? - A. I did, and he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been unlucky enough, the day after this offence was committed, to say a great number of other umbrellas were stolen from you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you unfortunately, the next day, an execution in your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's mother? - A. I have seen her.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not ask her to give you a guinea, and if she gave you a guinea, you would not appear before the Magistrate? - A. I will not answer that question.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are bound to answer that question, did you or not? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with her? - A. Yes, a few words.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not tell her, that if she gave you a guinea, you would not appear against him? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>You will swear that? - A.Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not accuse some other person, the next day, of stealing umbrellas? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many? - A. A dozen or fourteen; but it was not the next day, it was on Monday night, when the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the night before the execution? - A. Yes; there was a distress made, and my property was taken away out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go out of the way yourself the next day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not represent to the prisoner's mother, that you were in great distress, and if she would give you a guinea, you would make it up? - A. I told the prisoner's mother so the same night that he was committed; a man who was at the Public-office, in Marlborough-street, begged me to go and see him, and I would not; a day or two after, the mother came to me to beg mercy, I told her it was out of my power; what I said, was the consequence of your son's taking my property, it has brought down the devil's luck with it, for I am in trouble, and have lost all my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, that if she would give you a guinea, you would not appear against him? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say, when you took hold of him at your shop door, I was going to ask the price of it, and was only looking at it? - A. He said nothing, but trembled.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you, he only took it down to look at, to see if it was such an one as he wanted? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not going towards your shop door? - A. No, the contrary way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not searched, and a twenty-shilling note, and several shillings found upon him? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the search was made? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p> - KELLY sworn. I am a watchman: I was upon duty that night; I heard a noise, and hurried myself to the noise as fast as I could; I got to the door, and got charge of this man; I took him to the watch-house; he was just by the threshold of the door, there was another man in the shop, I did not see any umbrella on the man, I believe they had taken it from him; another man took the other man.</p>
               <p>VALENTINE ROMLEY sworn. - I am a watch-house keeper: I searched the prisoner, and the umbrella came into my hands to take care of,(produces it); he had not money about him, to the best of my knowledge; I received the umbrella from the prosecutor himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the other man any money? - A. I think not, but I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley Q.How did you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140089"/>serch the prisoner? - A. I searched him thoroughly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search his fob? - A. I do know that I did, I dare say that I did, but I cannot swear it. (The umbrella was deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my witnesses.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TOWNSEND sworn. - I belong to the Tower-Hamlets Militia: the prisoner had enlisted on the Thursday before, and received his bounty-money, which is five pounds; I have known him twelve years, he is a very honest man.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH CRESE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am the mother of the prisoner: I went to the prosecutor's house on the Tuesday evening after my son was taken up; he seemed quite severe upon it, and made a great many protestations, that he had been robbed the over-night of eleven umbrellas, and the man he had got, he would make answer for the whole; I begged him to be merciful, he said nobody had been to defend him, if he got a guinea, and was paid for his trouble, he would not appear against him; I said, if that had been all, I would have been glad to have given two, not to have brought him into this trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the solemn oath you have taken, the prosecutor made use of the expressions you have now stated? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Donahoo.) You have heard what this woman has sworn, is it true or false? - A. It is quite false.</p>

               <p>Q.Mind what you say, did you ever enquire for them? - A. I enquired for the Bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not talk about notes, I shall show you some of your own notes by-and-by that have not been paid - had you ever enquired for these things? - A.Out of delicacy, for fear they should think that I thought them thieves, I had not enquired for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note, that has not been paid, due at Lockhart's? - A. That is not my note, it is my brother's.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140090"/>Q.Your brother and you were partners, were not you? - A. Yes, formerly.</p>
               <p>Q.Were not you at the time this note is dated? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is dated the 27th of May, 1797? - A. I do not recollect exactly; I had the misfortune to to have my affairs given over to my creditors, and since that, my brother and I have not been partners; I cannot recollect whether it was before or after my misfortune.</p>
               <p>Q. You can say, whether it was before or after your bankruptcy? - A. No, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you pay that to the prisoner, in satisfaction of ten pounds due from you to him? - A. Upon my oath, I not only did not give that note, but it is after my misfortune I recollect, and it is my brother's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay that to the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never borrowed ten pounds of the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any sum of money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care, are you sure of that? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the Saturday night that you took these people up, by a warrant? - A. Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not expect to be arrested, on the Monday, for fifty-one pounds? - A.No, not at all; I did not owe it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not expect to be arrested at the suit of the prisoner on the Monday following the Sunday? - A. No, I did not; they could arrest me, but I did not owe them that money.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, had they not threatered you before you took them up by the warrant? - A. They had threatened, but I did not care a fig for it.</p>
               <p>Q. For how much? - A. For a false bill of fifty-one pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.And so you took them up by a warrant on the Sunday? - A. Not to prevent that, I assure you.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did take them up the very day before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you did not place these things, that were found in their trunk, in the hands of the woman yourself? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, had she not them to wash for you? - A.Several months before she washed for me; and as I missed my linen, and she happened to he ill, I told her not to wash any more for me, because she was ill; out of courtesy I would not tell her I thought her a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. A little before this there was a little dispute about a still, that they were afraid would set the house on fire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They told you they would not live in the house for fear of fire, from this private still? - A. I heard that they objected to it, but they did not do so to me.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe this house was a good deal furnished with these people's own furniture? - A. The kitchen and the front room, and six chairs besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the woman prisoner the entire care of your linen? - A. No, she never had; for I kept it locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, and I tell you now, there are several people who heard you say so - I am going to ask you, upon your oath, have you never said, that you would not have taken these people up, but they were going to arrest you? - A. I never did; I said, that they had acted so bad, and provoked me so often, that they obliged me to be severe with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said, and I tell you there are people who have heard you - have you never said, that you would not have taken these people up but they threatened to arrest you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never have said so? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any thing like that? - A. I said, if they had not provoked me so long, that I would certainly have let them have gone perfectly content.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you never said, that you would not have taken them up if they had not threatened to arrest you? - A. No. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Rivet, the officer, that you had given these things into the woman's possession? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he then ask you, if you had ever demanded the property? - A. I do not recollect that he did ask me that question.</p>
               <p>Q. It happened only last Sunday se'nnight - did not he ask you, whether you ever asked the woman for the things? - A. I cannot recollect positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not the officer say, then how could you charge the prisoner with robbing you? - A. I cannot recollect that, positively, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Though it passed only last Sunday se'nnight? - A. I cannot recollect, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have said so, and you forgot it? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, I ask you - did not the two prisoners at the bar demand of you fifty-one pounds, upon the very Saturday that you went to apply for a warrant? - A. They did not; but when my Solicitor asked them if they had any further demand, when I closed my bill, they said they had a demand of fifty-one pounds; I said it was a false demand, and they had no right to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not offer to give a note of hand for thirteen pounds, for money due to him, if he would give you a receipt in full? - A. I shall, upon that, candidly tell you the truth; I saw things going all wrong, and I thought best to get did of them in a quiet way without exposing them too much; I had a law-suit on account of property<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140091"/>lost from where I lived, which amounted to three pounds, or three guineas, and I had a note of my brother's for ten pounds, I thought best to get rid of them, and I said, I will give you that, I have no objection; and as this was my own brother, I would do any thing to serve him; I should be very glad to give them that, and if you like it I will give you a note of hand for thirteen pounds, in order not to expose them to the public, and to do them a favour; but I know very well that I have a right to arrest them, and expose them, which I have done now.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did offer to give him a note, at two months, for thirteen pounds? - A. A month, or two months; during my travels in Scotland, a man took a piece of wood from my premises, and charged the prisoner at the bar with stealing it from him, and the man was obliged to prosecute him to clear himself from having not stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. So you offered him your note for thirteen pounds to settle all disputes? - A. Yes; which I did not owe him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you not said, that if it had not been for the kindness of the prisoners in assisting you, you would not have had a bed to lie upon? - A. It is a great lie as can be told.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that gentleman there, Mr. Jarvis? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he will tell that lie? - A. It is completely false.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not often given them articles of wearing apparel to pledge for you in time of distress? - A. Not often, I suppose, it has been done four or five times.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it has not been done forty times; and remember Mr. Shannon is here? - A. I will swear it was not twenty times, nor ten times.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear positively? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Thomas? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's sister? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You have applied to borrow money of her, have not you? - A. I never made any proposal to her.</p>
               <p>Q.But to him, to borrow of her for you? - A. That, perhaps, has happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know that you made such a request to the prisoner, to borrow money of his sister for you for your sister? - A. I recollect something of it, I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Q.What sum was it? - A. It might be something of ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is that? - A. Four or five months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have not you repeatedly borrowed money from the prisoner himself from time to time? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you never said you would not have carried on this prosecution unless you had been persuaded to it; and if any harm came from it you would never forgive yourself? - A. No; I only said I would not have been severe upon them, but as they were so provoking, and used me so bad.</p>
               <p>Q.So provoking, for what - because they threatened to arrest you? - A.For four weeks they had been provoking.</p>
               <p>Q.They had been complaining for four weeks about this private still? - A. It was not a private still.</p>
               <p>Q.You never said you would not have arrested them if they had not been so provoking as to threaten to arrest you? - A. No; I said they were so provoking, and even spoke of arresting me, but he had no right, for I did not owe him a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q.And if they had not been provoking you would not have prosecuted them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.You have given them things to pawn for you? - A. Sometimes I have; and I say there is no harm in pawning if you want to make up a bill; I gave these things into their possession to take care of; I dressed myself always at my sister's house, and my linen was there.</p>
               <p>Q. And was not your linen washed there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not often been indulged, now, with a cravat, or a neckcloth, of her husband's - have you not been often indulged with wearing the prisoner's linen? - A. Only twice; and that only a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. They are the same things you have charged these people with stealing? - A. The same sort of things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How long has the woman prisoner been discontinued from washing for you? - A. I suppose she has not washed for me for five or six months.</p>
               <p>Q. The things you have missed has been since the time that she ceased to wash for you? - A. I can only say I missed, from time to time, things without knowing how.</p>
               <p>Q. You put on your clothes at your sister's? - A. Commonly; I sometimes put on a shirt, and may leave it at my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Those things that you left there, did you keep always locked up in your own press? - A. Yes; I took particular care of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any pretence in the prisoners at the bar for calling upon you for a debt of fifty-one pounds? - A. When I paid the prisoners, I paid them twenty-three pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, at the time they threatened you with an action for fifty-one pounds, was there any truth in that demand? - A. No truth at all.</p>
               <p>Q.How long a time do you suppose you had been missing this property? - A. I perceived that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140092"/>amongst my handkerchiefs and shirts that I found they diminished, for the course of six or eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you begin to suspect the prisoners were concerned in the taking of these things? - A. At the time she began to be ill, about six months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you wish, or had you any inclination to prosecute, till you could find you had no peace in your house? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that they threatened you with this action that you say is false? - A. The Saturday before the Sunday that I took out the warrant.</p>


               <p>Q. Was it not from the provocation that they made in the house, that you were induced to prosecute? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to say they never lent you any money, when you say you had paid them twenty-three pounds? - A. That was the amount of wages and the day-book.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had any of these articles that you now miss been missing during the last six months? - A. Some of them must have been stolen since that time, because one was a new handkerchief that I bought not long ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You paid her for washing your linen independent of what she had as a servant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What else has there been missing? - A. The linen of my sister and the linen of my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. That passed within the last six months? - A. I cannot say, it was a good while ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other article of your own that you can swear to have missed within these last six months? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe that all these articles were stolen before the time that she ceased to wash for you? - A. I cannot speak to any of them with certainty since.</p>
               <p>Court. These being all the articles of linen that she had to wash, and being paid separately for that, I cannot say that that is a felony.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There is a yard and a half of silk and a net purse. (Miller, the officer, produces it).</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you think this looks as if it had ever been washed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Eckbart.) Did you ever -</p>
               <p>Court. I think as to any property that was taken before the time that she ceased to work for him as a washerwoman, an action of Trover might be brought for not delivering it up, but it cannot be charged as a felony; therefore the case must be now reduced to these articles not delivered to her as a washerwoman.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present when these people insisted upon the demand of fifty-one pounds? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. On the Saturday, I believe, there was a settlement of the running account? - A. Yes, a weekly bill.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they not then insist upon his paying them fifty pounds? - A. Yes; and they moreover told him they would not quit his house till it was paid; and they behaved as indecently as I ever saw two people in my life; she struck me several times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.What were those suspicions? - A. That he had missed a number of articles out of his own house and custody.</p>

            's defence Ever since Mr. Eckhardt's failure, I have been in the constant habit of keeping his different things from different lodgings, and removing them, which has been for these two years; I was in possession of their property in Ely-place, St. George's-fields, some loose, some packed up, and others put together; I often told Mr. Eckhardt I had several of his things intermixed with mine, and when he wanted to borrow a cravat, my wife would lend him a clean cravat, and he would return and leave his dirty one; and as to the handkerchief and shirt that he speaks of finding in the bureau, they were in a bundle upon the table in the parlour, and when me and my wife were taken into custody, Mr. Miller put these things in the bureau off from the table, or else they were not in the drawers at all.</p>

I live at Knightsbridge: I know Mr. Eckhardt very well, and I know the prisoners at the bar, they are very honest industrious people: On the Tuesday, or Wednesday, after they were taken up, I was standing at my door, in the morning, he said to me, Mr. Thomas, I suppose that you have heard of what has happened; I said, yes, Sir, I have; but what can it all be about; why, says he, they have put it all wrong in the papers -</p>
               <p>Q. It had appeared in the newspapers? - A. Yes, but I have not seen it; says he, about the two 20l. notes; says he, a gentleman brought me a bill of 511. for chairs, and furniture, in Hatton-garden, but I did promise to pay them a note there, belonging to my brother, of 10l. I offered to give them a new note for 13l. at two months, to ged rid of them; I heard him also say, had I not taken this measure he would have arrested me for this false debt on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Eckhardt.) Q. You have heard what Mr. Jarvis stated just now; upon your oath, was what Mr. Jarvis stated, upon his oath, true? - A. I say it is a compleat untruth; I swear to God, that I never have said a single word, or a single letter, that I can say before God, and my conscience; I defy him to say I ever said so; as to these people that come to swear that I said I took them up because they threatened to arrest me, they accosted me to know how this business went on; and I had mentioned to them, that among other things, they had demanded a bill of 51l. and that I had taken them up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You know you have answered me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140095"/>some questions upon this - do you now admit, that their threatening was one of the reasons, mixed with others, that induced you to take them up? - A. To be sure; all the atrocity together.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did say that was one reason, amongst others? - A. Yes; I did when I told it to Mr. Stovin; he said, he would be bail for me immediately if they did arrest me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then tell these people that their threatening to arrest you for 51l. was one reason amongst others why you took them up? - A. All the atrocity together; they had behaved so bad, and so disrespectful to me, that they had even gone so far as to threaten to arrest me for it.</p>
               <p>Q.Then did you or not, say to these people, that their threatening to arrest you for 51l. was one of the reasons that induced you to take them up? - A. It was one of my reasons, of course.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I have seen him often, for a month before this transaction happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the 6th of November? - A. I cannot be particular to the 6th or 7th of November; I saw him at No. 3, Leicester-street, Leicester-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on that day receive any Bank-note from the prisoner? - A. A 30l. note.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the note you received from him? -(Showing him a note). - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards receive cash from any body for this note? - A. Yes; from a person of the name of King, who keeps the Red-lion in Jermyn-street, the same day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are not certain whether it was the 6th or 7th of November? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You are, perhaps, not certain at all as to the day of the month? - A. I am certain it was either the 6th or 7th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep a house which is, we understand, a gaming-house? - A. I do not; I do not say that I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did at that time? - A. Yes; but not at the house where the note was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. At whose house was that? - A. Cocksedge's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you playing there? - A. No; I attended for Mr. Maitland, who was out of town, to see that every thing was done right.</p>
               <p>Q. You took care of the bank, perhaps? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.This was not a Banking house, I believe, but a Rouge at Noir bank? - A. I cannot speak French.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a good deal of money played for? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive many notes for the bank that day? - A. Not of that description; I received a good many small notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep the account for the gentleman, whom you represented upon this occasion as keeper of the bank? - A. Not of the particular notes.</p>
               <p>Q.There is a good deal of hurry attending that sort of business? - A. Very little.</p>
               <p>Q. It is all coolly done, is it? - A. Very coolly.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides the notes that are paid into the bank, I mean the bank that we are talking of, not the Bank of England, are there not bets take place at the table? - A. None, but what are on the table, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean the bets between the different individual who are gambling and playing? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never know, in the course of your knowledge of transfactions of this fort, bets taking place between individuals, beside what is played for at the tables? - A. I do not recollect any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that that has not taken place within your knowledge? - A. I never knew a thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. My learned Friend asked you if you knew this note, you answered him, that you put your name upon it? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you put your name upon it? - A.In half an hour, or an hour; it was never out of my possession from the time of receiving it, till I got change for it.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you do with it when you first received it? - A. I laid it on the table under a lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not more than an hour? - A. I cannot take upon myself to swear the exact time, I think it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there in the room at play? - A. I cannot say; there might be twenty, or from that to forty.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that there were not fifty people there? - A. I will not take upon myself to swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the people that were in the room engaged in playing? - A. I should suppose not; there were frequently several lookers on.</p>
               <p>Q. Those that were lookers on were standing round the table, were they not? - A. Generally so.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they chiesly French, or were they English? - A. They were both.</p>
               <p>Q. Acting as agents for this worthy gentleman, Mr. Maitland; I take it for granted, your attention was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140096"/>pretty much taken up, in regarding his interest. taking care of the bank; and plundering the people? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not the person th whom Mr. King applied, respecting this note, and to know what were the circunstances attending it? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew, unless you could give an account of the possession of this note, you would be liable to be hanged before your time? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was a good thing, you know, to slip, your own neck out of the halrer, and charge somebody else? - A. I do not charge anybody but the person I took it from; the prisoner at the bar asked me to give him change for a 5l. note, and he gave me this 3ol. note; I returned it him back, and said, young man, you are mistaken, it is a 30l. note, and he took it back.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to that? - A. He said nothing more at that time.</p>
               <p> Q. At what other time did he say any thing? - A. In about a quarter of an hour after, or it might be less, he put down the note, and said he wanted five pounds on it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what profession of life are you besides being a gambler - what other means of livelihood have you? - A. I am agent to a gentleman in Birmingham, Mr. Betts, in the plared line.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides acting in the important character of agent in a gambling-house - did you not at this time keep a gambling-house youself? - A. I did for about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? - A. No. 34, Jermyn-street.</p>
               <p>Q. If it is not impertinent, I will ask you if you have visited any of the jails of this metropolis - have you been in any of them? - A. I have once, I do not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q.How often? - A. Never, but once.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the charge then against you? - A. As an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. What, you turned stag, you were evidence for the Crown, - in what case? - A. Against a person who had robbed the mail.</p>
               <p>Q.What, the Rotherham mail? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You have never been in any other jail yet? - A. No, nor I trust I never shall be.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You say you received no other 30l. note than this? - A. No other.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been passing a note that you thought was suspected, would you have put your own name to it? - A. No, I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner said he wanted 5l. upon this note, did he agress you in English or French? - A. He asked me to change it in English.</p>
               <p>Q. When he proposed his bets, was that done in French or English? - A. In broken English.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. I am clerk to the Solicitor of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you present when the prisoner was apprehended? - A. I first saw him at a public-house near Leicester-fields, I think it is called Sydney's-asley, I understood he had been taken about an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q.Who were then present? - A.Townsend and Carpmeal, two of the Bow-street officers, together with two men that Mr. Shaw had employed to taken him, who knew his person.</p>
               <p>Q.Were any questions asked him by you, or any person present, respecting this note? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he got it from? - A. He did not, till he got to the Magistrate's; I got a coach, and went with the officer to search his lodgings.</p>
               <p> Q. Did you hear him given any account of it at the Magistrate's -</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Was not the account that he gave at Bow-street, taken in in writing? - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, apply your mind to it, so as to be able afterwards to say that it was not? - A. I understood so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, observe the fact, with a view to give evidence of it hereafter? - A. I took no particular notice of it, for the purpose of giving evidence, but I did not observe that there was any examination taken in writing.</p>
               <p>Q. But whether it was or not, you cannot say? - A. I really believe it was not; when we came before the Magistrate, the note was produced to him, and he was asked how he came in possession of the note; the Magistrate asked him if he knew the note, he replied he did; the Magistrate asked him again the same question, two or three times over, and he said yes, he knew it perfectly well; he said he had found it, together with a 20l. note, one evening, I think, in Leicester-square, folded in a piece of paper; he was asked, what paper, and how was it folded, whether it was in a letter, or how, he took a piece of paper, that was then lying on the table, and folded it up, describing to the Magistrate how the notes were folded; he was asked, whether that was the fact that he had stated, he said it certainly was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever say what he had done with them? - A. He said that he had put them in his pocket, that he had never told any person that he had found-the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention how he had got rid of them? - A. He was asked If he had not produced it at Shaw's gaming-table, and put it off there, and he said, Yes; he was then asked, what he had done with the other 20l. note, he said he had passed it at a gaming-house kept by one Robinson, in Sussolk-street, Charing-cross; he was asked, how he got his livelihood, he said he received a daily allowance from one of the committee appointed by this government for the relief of Emigrant Frenchmen; I do not recollect that any thing else passed at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him there again? - A. I think it was the 27th of December he was brought up to Bow-street, for further examination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Was not that second examination taken in wtiting? - A. No; he was then questioned again how he came by that 30l. note, he said he had received it from his brother abroad, in a letter, I think he said from Altona, I am not certain; they were enclosed in a letter, which, he said, was amongst his papers that I took from his lodgings; the Magistrate asked him how he came to give a different account then to that which he gave upon the former examination, and he made no answer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. Q. Did you, amongst the papers found in his lodgings, discover any letter? - A. In consequence of his having said that, Mr. Winter directed me to take all his paper to him in Newgate, which I did, and desired him to point out, if he could, whether the letter that he had stated was amongst those papers; he looked them all over, and found the cover of a letter, a half-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140097"/>sheet of letter-paper, which I now hold in my hand, which he pointed out as enclosing the notes, (produces it); it is in the same state in which I found it. On the day he was brought up for a second examination, I think it was on the 27th of December, I produced to him a letter folded up, and I asked him if he knew the writing of the direction on the back, he said he did; he was asked if it was his brother's writing, he said yes; he opened it, and read a part of it, he looked at the latter part of the letter, and was asked if it was his brother's writing, a second time, and then he said, he did not know whose writing it was, and began to cry; he had read a part of it before that, he had not read the whole.</p>
               <p>Q.From whom did you receive that letter? - A. I received it from Mr. Winter open, and when I received it there was a 25l. note in it; I did not show the note to the prisoner, he knew nothing at all about the note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You say, when he was taken to the office at Bow-street, he was questioned whether he knew the 30l. note? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, I presume, he was standing at the bar? - A. We were in a private room up stairs, and he was sitting at the same table with the Magistrate, next to the clerk and Mr. Winter.</p>
               <p>Q. The note was shewn to him, and he instantly said, yes, he knew it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He answered that he knew it, before he had taken it into his own hand to examine? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, he had not at that time examined the number of the note, and all the particulars concerning it? - A. He had not then, but it was put into his hand, and he looked at it, and turned it two or three times over.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all these questions asked in English or in French? - A. In English, and he answered in English; he speaks English very well, or else I could not have understood him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time when he was first apprehended, and first examined, I need scarcely ask you, he being a foreigner, whether he was not under a considerable degree of agitation? - A. He certainly was when I first saw him in the public-house, when he was first apprehended, he was certainly agitated, but I did not perceive any agitation at all before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. Q. After he had turned it over and over again, did he afterwards give the same account of it? - A. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. And is that the letter that you gave into the hands of your clerk, Mr. Loaring? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. (To Loaring.) Q. You mentioned that you found some papers, which you afterwards shewed the prisoner, in Newgate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find those papers? - A. At his lodings, No. 10, Wardour-street; I went there, when he was first apprehended, with the officers; he took us into a room, and pointed out what things were his in the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. (To Rivett.) Q.Was that the house, No. 10, where you went to, and got this letter? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Now, my Lord, I mean to produce in evidence, this letter -(Here Mr. Knapp contended against the admissibility of the letter, the prisoner having been six weeks in custody before it was found, and there being no admission of the contents of the letter, though there was an admission of the superscription.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, (on the same side). My Lord, I remember there were papers offered in evidence in this Court upon the trials of Mr. Hardy, Mr. Tooke, and Mr. Thelwall, for high treason, which appeared to have been found some days subsequent to the apprehension of the prisoners, and though they were able to prove the handwriting of persons connected with the conspiracy charged. and whose hand-writing they had proved in the course of those trials, yet, as they were not discovered till after they were apprehended, those papers were rejected, for this reason, that papers not proved to have existed prior to their apprehension, could not be charged upon them. - To apply that to the present case, I ask how it is possible to say, that a letter that did not arrive till some weeks after the prisoner was apprehended, can affect him? Your Lordship fees this is not seeking to affect the prisoner, by any act of his own, or of any person in connection with him in the conspiracy, but the act of a person residing in a foreign country.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashburst. I look upon it it is not an impossible thing that a letter arriving after a man has been arrested, and in custody, may be good evidence, according to the snape in which it is put; as to what may be the case in the present instance, I know not what the defence of the prisoner is, but this I know, there is a letter comes addressed to him, which by possibility may throw light upon the subject; this letter comes to him by the post, it is shewn to him, and he says he knows the hand-writing; I cannot see why that should not be received.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140098"/>Mr. Justice Rooke. Supposing a letter sent after the man is in custody, and it is found upon his person, have you a doubt that that letter would not be good evidence; and where is the difference?(The letter and the Bank note produced.)</p>
               <p>ELIAS BUZAGLO sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. Look at that paper, is that your translation of the French letter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a faithful translation? - A. As far as I am competent; and I have sworn very frequently to my translations before the Lord-Mayor, and other Justices.(It is read).</p>
               <p>Addressed Mons. Huet, Wardour-street, No. 10, Oxford-Road, London, dated Altona. 22d Nov. 1797.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry for you and for myself that you have met with such bad success in the affair wherewith I charged you; I nevertheless hoped that it would procure me some succour - it is done, it is no more to be relied on. Tell me, then, why they have given 5l. sterling to your friend, having found effects of no value, and in which he had no right, he had nothing to claim; I confess to you that all this appears to me very extraordinary. I have no such goods as you require of me; I have now a pretty considerable quantity left of those, where of you have had samples; I believe that it is actually impossible to dispose of them now, it is only a few of the skilful, who, when they have good merchandize by them, can attempt to make a good stroke; besides, I shall not purchase them, but with money. I am pressed by wants without number, I have extansted all my resources, I am in want of every thing; I hear no news from any person; I know not how to act, or what will become of me. If Mr. Duberdour is in London, you will do well to take out of his hands what I have procured in your name at Brussels. Do you know a Mr. Bray, who is charged with the government of the police of foreigness? This gentleman is from Angolene; he is the son of a baker, he is the brother-in-law of Loton, the attorney; I have frequently seen him at Brussels; if you can see him, and inform yourself of his address; if he is in want of any person, and I can be employed in the Tennis Court, as my countryman, it may be useful to me, perhaps. I am in such misery, that there is nothing that I would not undertake; notwithstanding I am convinced you have not acted sincerely towards me; I still give way to a sentiment, of which I was always the dupe to you. You will find enclosed a bill of 25l. Remember, be very prudent and circumspect in your conduct; do not expose yourself, in making the most of them, whatever be your situation; but do not forget that I am very unhappy, and contrive to send me something. Prove to me that you have a desire to oblige me. I hope that you will not be indisposed at the receipt of my letter, and that you will answer me as speedily as possible."</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cullen. I am not perfect that the prisoner is the man, only he had red hair, a red waistcoat.</p>

                        targets="t17980214-72-off399 t17980214-72-crimeloc401"/>? - A. Yes; this day fortnight I was pasing through Fenchurch-street, there were three men with oranges, but I dealt with only two; one of the men (one with the dark hair) asked if I would buy any; I told him, no, I did not want any; they still kept reazing meen in the street; and I asked him, in a joke, what he would have for them all; he said 4s. I told him that was too much, I did not want any; then he asked me if I wanted a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. How many followed you? - A. Two men, they had both baskets; I asked him what he asked for a dozen; he told me one shilling; I said that was too dear; he asked me what I would give for a dozen and I told him sixpence; he said to me, my master, you shall have them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. I looked at him before the Lord-Mayor, and I said then if he was not the man he was very much like him.</p>
               <p>Court. We happen to know what you said before the Lord-Mayor, you told a very different story there to what you have told now; take care what you say.</p>
               <p>Witness. I pulled out four half crowns three shillings, and a seven shilling piece; I gave the young man with the red hair one shilling,</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner again? - A. It is very much like him; but it is a very dangerous piece of business.</p>
               <p>Q.What are you afraid of if you speak the truth? - A. I wish to speak the truth; I gave him one shilling, and he said it was a plain one, he did not like plain ones, and he gave me back one shilling, and I then gave him half-a-crown; he said it was a French one, he returned it to me, and then the oranges were paid for; he saw a seven shilling piece in my hand, he asked me if I would let him have it, and he would give me seven shillings for it; I asked him what made him so desirous of my seven shilling piece, I told him I had plenty of silver, I did not want any more; he still kept wanting my seven shilling piece, he held an argument with me about it, he said he would be obliged to me, for he hoarded them; I then gave him the seven shilling piece, and he gave me seven shillings back; I went on to whitechapel, to Mr. Garth's, a grocer's-shop; I told him I thought I had been desrauded; and he said he could not tell weather they were good ones or bad ones, they were very queer ones; I said, I would go back and see for the man; I went back to Fenchurch-street; I delivered all that money to Mr. Perrin, the constable, he put it up in a piece of paper, and sealed it up.</p>
               <p>Q. The shilling, the half-crowns, and the seven shilling piece, was that good money? - A. Yes; I am sure that was all good, I brought it from my own house.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had got to whitechapel, how much bad money did you find then? - A. None shillings and a half-crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had not any bad money before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140100"/>you saw these Jews? - A. No; I am sure I had all good money when I came from home, I had no French half-crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you received any money after you left home before you met with these Jews? - A. No, I had received no silver; I had received a seven shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take up one of the Jews when you returned to Fenchurch-street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the constable take up one of them? - A. No, they were taken up afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. At the first examination there were two young men examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar one of those men? - A. The prisoner was one that was examined before the Lord-Mayor the first time of examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Be correct, and recollect yourself, there were two examinations on account of this charge against the Jews for having given you bad money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the first examination, was the prisoner at the bar one of the persons charged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were then examined? - A. A man with black hair and a man with red hair. (The prisoner's hair was red).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you swear, upon that examination at the Magistrate's, that the prisoner was the man? - A. I said, to the Lord-Mayor, that if that was not the man, it was a man very much like him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure those were the words? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you mean to swear now, after the answer you gave to my Lord-Mayor, at the Mansion-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not, upon that occasion, swear that the prisoner was the man whom you charged with having given you the bad money? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your information taken in writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sign it? - A. Yes, with my cross; the Lord-Mayor's clerk read it over to me before I signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen either of the other two Jews since that time? - A. No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any body been with you since that examination, to talk to you about this charge that you have made? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell my Lord, and the Jury, what passed between you and these persons? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I object to that question.</p>
               <p>Court. You must connect them, certainly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand that you believe this to be the man, but whether it was or not, you do not mean to swear to him? - A. No other way than I have sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you safely swear that the prisoner was the man? - A. It is a heavy thing to swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself to swear that the prisoner is the man? - A. To the best of my knowledge, I am not acquainted with this business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this dark man taken up before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was discharged? - A. The Lord-Mayor asked me if I knew any thing about him; I said, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. That man was the man that you had all the conversation with in the street? - A. Yes, dealing for oranges.</p>
               <p>Q. That must have taken up some time? - A. Yes, I suppose five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet that man you would not swear to? - A. I did not look that man in the face.</p>
               <p>Q. The money that you brought from home, when did you receive it? - A. From my wife that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How much silver had you in the house? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had the ill luck to get a bad shilling into your possession before? - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. At Loughton, near Woodford, in Essex.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you attend Woodford-market? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The money that you received from the man with the red hair, you shewed to the grocer, and he could not tell whether they were good or not? - A. He said they were very queer, they certainly must be bad, but he could not see any brass.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cullen. I know the prisoner: This day fortnight I saw him with two men in Fenchurch-street; I saw Bartrup with them, the countryman, and I said to him in a joke, you have been dealing with the Jews; there were the prisoner and two other Jews, I know all of them by sight perfectly well; I saw the countryman come under the gate with one or two of the Jews, I cannot say which, I did not see any thing that passed between them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar one of them? - A. Yes, that I am clear of, he was one of the three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the complexion of the other persons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they black or red hair? - A. One was very black; this man is not so red as they represented to me, before I saw him; I saw the Jews standing together a good while after the countryman was gone, it might be a quarter of an hour; I saw the countryman when he returned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. - Q. You heard no conversation, and saw nothing particular pass between the countryman and the Jews? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They were selling fruit about the streets? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you sell fruit about the streets? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you sell oranges? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. Do you carry fruit about the streets, or do you stand in one place? - A. I stand in one place.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far do you stand from this gateway? A. About 20 yards, the gateway is No. 28, and I stand between No. 32 and 33; when the Jews passed me, I told them they had been in a good thing, and one of them pulled out a handful of silver, and a halfpenny amongst it, he asked me for a halfpenny-worth of apples, which I gave him, and he went away.</p>
