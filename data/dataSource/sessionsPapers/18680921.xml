                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Wyman, and have been so for some time—they have a printing establishment at Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, under the name of Wyman &amp; Son—I know Albert Henry Elworthy—he brought me the manuscript of this pamphlet to print—I afterwards sent it back to him—we at first printed 250 copies, and afterwards printed a second edition of 250 from a corrected copy which he brought—he took part with him, and the remainder we sent to him at 2, Crown Court—from the time of receiving the manuscript until the issue of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186809210004"/>
               <p>the second edition about three weeks elapsed—I did not look over this thing—I told Messrs. Wyman that Mr. Elworthy had brought a job to be done—Mr. Edward Wyman was present when he gave me the manuscript, so I had no occasion to tell him—he saw that I took the manuscript—I did not tell him the nature of the contents—I did not look to see—I saw the title, "Persecutions of a Solicitor," when I gave it out to the workmen to be composed—I did not even read the preface—neither of the defendants took the pamphlet into his hands—I said nothing to them about the second edition—there is no person specially appointed to see that the things going through the press are fit to be issued, we look to the reader to do that—he corrects the grammatical errors for the press, after the type is set up—we should expect him to draw attention to anything specially obscene or Libellous—the manuscript was returned to Mr. Elworthy—that was not for the purpose of his correcting the copy, we corrected the proofs before we sent it out—it was done by the reader—he is not now in the establishment—he has several times called attention to matters that were specially libellous and obscene—I made an entry in the books of the receipt of the manuscript—we have not received the money yet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Does Mr. Edward Wyman attend to the counting—house department? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they are very large printers—they print the "Builder," "Public Opinion," the "London Review," and a number of papers and books—it would be quite impossible for gentlemen conducting a printing establishment to read everything themselves—a good deal of printer's work is done at night, and under pressure—the price of printing this pamphlet would be about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the profit would be almost a question of shillings—we employ 150 hands and sometimes more—we had done some law printing for Mr. Elworthy about eighteen months previously—he was not a stranger—I knew he was a solicitor—these pamphlets were to be printed in a hurry—the manuscript was given into my hands on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Elworthy said it was in a great hurry, and I sent him a proof on the Saturday—there was about a fortnight between the two editions—I don't think either of the defendants ever saw the pamphlet while it was being printed, or were aware of its contents.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Charlotte Street, and keep the house—the prisoners were lodgers in that house just upon three months—they had five children, Barbara, the deceased child, was the youngest; Katie, the eldest, is seven years old; Mary Ann, the next, about five years; the next, William, four and a half years; Elizabeth two and a half years; and Barbara about a year—the prisoners used to go out continually of an evening, from 8 or 9 o'clock and return about 1 or 2 in the morning, leaving all the children, and locking them in—I used to hear them cry—I some<lb/>times went in—when I did so, I did not see anything in the way of necessaries for them—I saw an empty bottle lying on the bed, and noting else—I never saw the three younger children dressed or clothed, except one night when the female prisoner took the baby out with a hat and cloak—they were not clean, as they lay on the bed they lay in their own soil—on 7th July, the prisoners left home soon after 8 o'clock in the morning and did not return till between 10 and 11 o'clock at night—the witness, Alice Skeltham, fetched me up on that day, and I saw them—there was no food left for them—there were two or three pieces of dry crust, not eatable—I did not see a Mrs. Hyland there that day, no one but Alice Skeltham—she gave the children some food—I did not see them take it—they were in a very emaciated state—they were worse that day than they had been throughout—they had no covering upon them, they laid on the bed naked, no covering at all to speak about—I believe the youngest child had been ill, I heard Mrs. Brooks say so, with measles—I told her she ought to go to the workhouse or hospital, to have necessaries for the children—she said she had been to a hospital, and they would not take them in—on 23rd July, the prisoners left home at 8 o'clock at night and were away all night—Mrs. Brooks came in about 10 o'clock next morning, and Mr. Brooks about 10.13—at that time one of the parish officers had been there, and the police sent for.</p>

I took the five children to the workhouse.")—I was called to the house on the morning of 23rd July, I found the five chil<lb/>dren there, and the place full of people—the mother had the younger one in her arms—William, the one four and a half, was on the bed in a state of nudity, with only a shawl thrown over his shoulders; he was like a skeleton; Elizabeth sat on a stool by the stove, she only had a thin piece of linen in the shape of a shift; they seemed very weak indeed—I said to the prisoners "How can you account for the children being in this state?"—they said they were suffering from measles and diarrhoea—I said, "What medical advice did you have for them?"—he said they had been to the hospital, and he produced these certificates for July, 1867—I said, "Have you not had any advice since then?"—he said, "Yes, I have been to Ormond Street"—I said, "How long ago?"—he said, "About three or four months"—I said "Have they had any advice since then?"—he said, "We generally go out and purchase medicine for them when they require it"—I took the male prisoner into custody, and Dack took the children to the workhouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Kingsland Road, and am medical officer for the district in which the prisoners lived—I did not receive any instructions to visit them—on 23rd July, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning, one of the guardians called upon me and I went to this house, there were several persons in the room—my attention was called particularly to the three youngest children, who were in a very dreadfully filthy and emaciated condition—the youngest was on the bed naked, I think it had a little piece of rag or something or other over it—the prisoners were not there at that time; this was before the constables arrived—I took no further steps, because the parish officers were present, and the children were taken to the workhouse, and would there be under the charge of Mr. Forbes—I examined them, but I could not undertake to say whether there was any internal disease or not—the symptoms of disease were not prominent; it seemed to be chiefly a case of want of food, more especially with the two elder ones—the youngest was in an exceedingly emaciated condition, probably there was disease as well.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of the workhouse of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—on 23rd July, the prisoners' five children were brought to the workhouse, and came under my care—the three younger ones were in a very filthy emaciated condition, suffering from measles—the youngest one, a year old, weighed only between 8 and 9 lbs.; the one four and a half years, weighed 11 lbs. 6 ozs.; and the third weighed 12 lbs.—the average weight of a child at birth is 9 or 10 lbs.—they were good sized children, but there was no fat upon them, the bones were protruding from the skin—I attended to the deceased child, and did what I could, but it died on 29th July—I made a post mortem examination—the body was shrunk, and the skin shrivelled, the ribs protruding, the lungs were both inflamed and consolidated—the stomach was small, the intestines thin and opaque, the lower end containing feces—the omentum was shrunk, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186809210020"/>
               <p>there was no fat in the body—the blood was thin and watery, and the brain was slightly congested—the cause of death was inflammation of the lungs and bronchial tubes—deprivation of food, neglect, and filth would accelerate that—judging from the appearance of the body, I came to the conclusion that it did suffer from privation and neglect—I do not attribute the death to measles—the proximate cause of death was inflammation of the lungs, and the want of food accelerated the inflammation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>think I gave them all, I think I left a little—when I came again it was all gone—the children were not in a filthy state—I saw no filth whatever on the bed—I had never taken care of them before—their place is seven or ten minutes' walk from mine—Mrs. Brooks told me she was going away all day—she seemed most anxious for me to go and see to the children—she did not tell me they were ill—I did not think they were ill—I did not see them after that day, and I have not seen Mrs. Brooks since.</p>

I am a fancy cabinet maker, and live at 49, Little Sutton Street, Clerkenwell—on 22nd July, I was out with my wife, and met the prisoners about 9.55—they came into our house, and while they were there my wife was taken with a fit—she was very violent, and the prisoners stayed to help me—it was between 11 and 12 o'clock that my wife was taken ill, and the fit lasted till 4 o'clock in the morning—they stayed all night, and then left.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 16, Bath Place, City Road—I visit poor people—I was asked by Mr. Knowles to do so, not only to feed and clothe them, but to tell them of the Saviour that I love—I visited the two prisoners, both in Cowper Street and Charlotte Street—when I first visited them it was in the depth of winter, and the five children were on the bed with only a very thin sheet to cover them, and the father with hardly any clothes—they were in a very poor and wretched condition—they are greatly improved in appearance now to what they were when they were taken into custody—I think they did the best they could for their children—the man was so weak from living so badly in the winter, that I don't think he had the strength to do a day's work, he only had a cup of tea a day, and sometimes bread—they used not to have anything till about 1 o'clock in the day, and that served for break<lb/>fast, dinner and tea—I have relieved them with a quartern loaf, half hun<lb/>dred of coals, six-pennyworth of meat, and six-pennyworth of grocery—I have not relieved them since he worked for Mr. Corner, as our funds are so limited—in the winter they were starving, and if it had not been for the re<lb/>lief they had then, they would have gone the way of all flesh long before this—I asked why they did not go to the parish, and he said, "If I was to go there, they would give me a ticket for the stone-yard, and if a job of work came in while I was there, I could not do it; and if we went, we should be separated"—I have seen hundreds of cases quite as bad—I have had a good deal of experience in visiting—I last visited them on 14th July—the children were all sick and in bed at that time—the two eldest were ill with measles, and the three youngest had diarrhoea, but I found the room very nice and clean, and two bits of white calico on the bed to cover them: it was very hot weather then: they had little chemises on, and they looked nice and clean; the man was at work—I did not visit them at regular periods, but at all times—they used to come to our meetings about 8 o'clock of an evening, and leave about 10—I have visited them as late as 10.30 and 11 o'clock, and always found them at home.</p>

I think I saw them about a week or ten days before the excursion; the three youngest children were then ill with diarrhoea—they were always ill. I have seen medicine bottles there; they used to go to the hospital in Great Ormond Street; a lady in the country sent them a letter for the little boy to go into the hospital, but they refused to take him, as the case was incurable.</p>

I saw no more of the packet after he put his hand in—I am sure he did not put it back on the table—I saw his hand come from under his coat, without the packet—shortly after that Smee came up—I then saw the prisoner come across from his own table to another one opposite—he then had a slip of paper in his left hand—while he was at the second table he took up two or three packets in his hand, one by one, at if he was weighing them, which he put down again—he then took up another, and put it in his left hand, under the slip of paper, and turned to the stamping-table where he was at first—he carried the packet till he got to the table—he stood there a few seconds talking to someone—he then put his right hand up towards the paper, which was in his left hand, and with the left hand put the packet in the left-hand side of the skirt of his coat—Smee then went round into the office, and took him into a private room—I went into the superintendent's private room about five minutes after, and saw on the table two packets—this was one of the packets, addreesed to Miss Rosenbrock—these two packets resemble the ones I saw him take—at the time he went to the second stamping-table there was no one there.</p>

               <p>someone for a few seconds, and then took the paper from his left hand into the right, and dropped it down between the coat and the lining, and when he took his hand out there was no packet in it—I went up to him and told him I wished to speak to him in a private room—I then took him into Mr. Pawley's, the superintendent's office—I said, "I have reason to believe that this man has got something in his pocket which does not belong to him"—the prisoner said, "No, I have not, that I know of; if I have, it must have fallen there when I was collecting packets"—Mr. Pawley said, "You are not collecting any packets, your duty is a stamper"—the prisoner then said something I could not hear—I said, "Well, then, will you allow me to search you"—I searched him in Mr. Pawley's presence, and in the lining of the coat, between the lining and the cloth, I found these two packets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the coat—the pockets are outside—the lining is torn on both sides—I said, "How do you account for these being in your possession?"—he replied, "I don't know, unless they must have fallen in when I was col<lb/>lecting packets"—Mr. Pawley said, "Why, you had no business to collect any pockets, your duty is as a stamper, the packets would not pass through your hands, in any way, in the office"—he was then taken into custody—I afterwards saw the packets opened, one contained a pair of stone ear-drops, and the other a needle-case—there was nothing else in the lining but the two packets—the prisoner could not see us from where we were.</p>

Keller &amp; Sons of Stutgardt—the bill was paid by them under protest—two days after the prisoner came for the money—Jameson's had paid with a crossed cheque,—I handed the prisoner the cheque and he demurred at taking it—he said a few days previously he had received a crossed cheque which had been returned to him—I told him it was the custom, and I could not help him—I met him later in the day, in Gracechurch Street, and asked him if he had received the money, and he said he had—when he came on the Saturday he handed me Messrs. Pardo's card, and I handed him one of ours in return—I never knew him before—on the 2nd August I was fetched to the Bank of England and saw him there—I identified him as the person who brought me the bill—Foulger showed me the bill and asked me if the prisoner was the man who brought me the bill to do what was necessary with it—I said he was—the prisoner then said I had never seen him, and he had never seen me.</p>

I live at 18, St. Mary's Square, Paddington—on 21st August, between 8 and 9, I went into the Queen and Prince Albert public-house, at Knightsbridge—the prisoner came in, and I had some con<lb/>venation with him, and drank beer with him—I left about 8.30, and the prisoner left at the same time—I told him I was going across the Park, and he said he was going that way too, and we entered into conversation—soon after we got into the Park, he put his hand on my throat, and threw me backwards—he then took my chain—he struck me on the head, and I was insensible for some time—when I came to myself, I missed my chain, coat, and hat—I gave information to the first policeman I saw in the Park, and went with him to the station—I saw the prisoner about 11.30 the same evening at the station, and identified him—I have not the slightest doubt about him now—this is the chain I lost; I can swear to it—I have not seen my coat since—the prisoner said he was stationed at the Chelsea Barracks.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—I lived with him up to the time he was taken into custody, at 21, Bell Street, Marylebone—on the evening of 7th September, I went out with a female friend of his and mine—I returned home a few minutes before 10; my husband was not at home then—I waited up for him till after 1 o'clock, when, thinking he would not come home, I undressed and went to bed—about 2.30 he came home—he said to my little boy, "Is your mother here?"—he said, "Yes, father"—he then lighted a match, and began kicking me—I was in bed—I rose to get up, and as fast as I got up, he knocked me down, over boxes, and chairs, and different things, a great many times—at last, I sat down on a box, when he struck me down—he then went to the fireplace, and got the poker—I knew if he did that I should be seriously hurt, and I ran under the table, and kept bearing him not to do so—he broke the table to pieces over my head, and then went to the mantelpiece, where there was a set of paper trays, and knocked them to pieces on the floor, and took them up with his hand as well, and beat them up—I rushed to the door, to try to get out, and he rushed after me, and met me as I had my hand on the door, and brought me back, and immediately rose the window and put me outside—I screamed "Murder!" and held fast by his collar with both hands with all my might—I have no idea what the distance is from the window to the ground—we live on the first floor—when I screamed "Murder!" the witness Oliver came in from the front room—my husband has ill-treated me very much before this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. When I came in did not I ask you to get up and get me a light, and get me some supper? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, you struck a match, and began kicking me—that did not hurt me—you kicked me three or four times, and kept striking me—you never knew me to go public-houses and spend your money—you know you have ruined my business and brought me to poverty—I had been out with Mrs. Davis, an old friend, to a gentle<lb/>man's house at Lower Norwood—I did not say to you, "James, if you do not leave off breaking the things, I will throw myself out of the window"—you have cruelly ill-used me—six weeks before this I had a warrant against you, but I forgave you—I did not get out of the window myself, nor did you pull me in—you called me dreadful names, and while you held me out of the window, you said, "Now will you spend my money, and keep my child in the street till 10 and 11 o'clock"—of course I held you as hard as I could—it wag impossible for me to say whether I should fall or not if I let go of you—it is a large window, as wide as that in the Court.</p>

               <p>peace, I am really in danger with him—I don't think he is right in his head, he is half crazy at times—I think the window was partly open, but I know he rose it up to the full extent, and took me up and put me outside—I don't know that my head and shoulders were outside when he caught hold of me by the hips—I don't recollect when I was on the ledge his saying "Now will you spend my money"—I was so frightened I don't know what I did—I screamed "Murder!" a great many times—a person over my head was looking down at us, and I said to him, "There is a woman looking down at you"—I was attended by Dr. Kirby.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and lodge in the next room to the prisoner and his wife—their window is from twenty to twenty-five feet from the ground—on the morning of the 8th September, I heard the prisoner come home, about 2.15; he works up to 1 o'clock—I think he had been drinking a little—I heard him go into his own room, and heard him use dreadful language—he began knocking his wife about; she screamed—the landlady came up, and said she would send for a policeman—I had to go into his room to try and pacify him—he was then punching his wife with his fists by the fire-place—I asked him to be quiet at this time in the morning—he said, "If I did not go out of his room he would break my b——head—I thought it was time to go then, and I went back to bed—after that I heard the door locked, and then I heard the window open, and heard screams of "Murder!" from a female voice—I got up and put on my trousers, and went and burst open their room door—the prisoner said he would stab the first b——man that entered his room—when I entered the room I saw the prisoner having his wife in a sitting position on the window sill, with only her legs in the room—he was trying to push her out with all his might—there was no light in the room—I could see he was shoving her away from him as well as he could; and she had hold of the collar of his coat—he was trying with all his force to push her out—there was no curtain to the window, and I could see as I came into the room, and went towards him—directly he saw me he left his wife and made towards me, and I struck him a severe blow in the face—he struck at me, and we struck one another five or six different times—he overpowered me, and would have strangled me if assistance had not come—he had me by the throat on the floor—my foot got hurt very badly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. When you first entered my room, did you see me strike my wife? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did—I was asked that question at the Police Court—the second time I came into the room I was not there a minute and a half—I was more than half way in the room—I broke the door open, and the box of the lock was found on the floor afterwards, covered with blood from the cut on my instep—when I first saw your wife she was in a sitting position, outside the window ledge—I did not see you put her there, but you acknowledged at the Police Court that you did—when I struck you your wife ran out of the room—you caught me by my windpipe and gave me a sharp squeeze—I don't know how I got my foot cut, it was in the struggle—I believe it was done by the box of the lock—I lost at least half a gallon of blood—your room and mine was like a slaughter-house—if I had not interfered I believe you would have killed your wife, and you would have been in a worse position—I did not charge you with assaulting me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was going up Central Street, and saw Mr. Gee lay<lb/>ing down, very much intoxicated; a <hi rend="italic">Chap</hi> said to me "Give me a hand up with him." No sooner had I got hold of him, than someone said "Look at those two <hi rend="italic">Chaps</hi> with the man." I went about a dozen yards and they began to run, and I ran; I was caught and taken to the station; I know nothing about it.</p>

I am a cab proprietor, at Thanet Street, Burton Crescent—on the morning of the 4th September, I went down my yard—I noticed a rug lying against the stable door—it was not a proper place for it to be—I went a little further into the stable, and kicked against a horse collar—I then lit the gas, and the two prisoners rushed up the yard—I caught them getting through a little wicket, about thirty yards from the stable—I seized them, and called "Police!"—I succeeded in holding them both till someone came to my assistance, and then Berry got away—I left Allen with another man, and ran after Berry, and saw him stopped by a constable—there was about a cab load of things put outside the stable ready to take away—I had been to a midnight meeting about the cab strike, and came home late—they must have got over the yard gate—the stable doors were not locked—we do not lock them at this time of year.</p>

I reside at Gothic Villa, West Green Road, and am nurse to an invalid lady—my husband is a shoemaker—I had occasion to go to the Duke of Cambridge, between 10 and 11 o'clock one evening, I don't remember the date, and I saw a lot of men and women there, quarrelling—I looked inside to sec if my husband was there, but he was not—I saw the prisoner standing at the bar with others—they were all quarrelling and jangling together, and they came out and had a fight in the road—there were three <hi rend="italic">navvies</hi>, the prisoner, and his wife—the <hi rend="italic">navvies</hi> knocked his wife down, and she cried "Murder!" as loud as she could, and Mr. Seddon went out to her assistance—she was lying in the road—he tried to lift her up, and the prisoner came up and pushed him away, and hit him in the mouth, and knocked him down; and as he was getting up he kicked him three or four times behind in the lower part of his body—I said, "You vagabond, what did you kick the man like that for"—he made use of very bad language, and said he would serve me the same if I did not go about my business—he was in a dreadful passion—Mr. Seddon got up and went into the bar, and the prisoner ran after him—I did not go in, I stood at the door and saw Mr. Seddon go into the parlour—I heard Mrs. Seddon say, "You vagabond, what are you hitting him for, you shall not hit him, you shall hit me"—I saw no more.</p>

I reside at Canonbury Square, Islington—I knew the deceased about twelve years, and attended him professionally, previous to 14th July his general health was very good—six months ago Dr. Gibbon examined him with reference to a life assurance, and he was accepted as a first class life—I was called in to sec him on 28th July, a few weeks after this occurrence; he was then suffering from exhaustion and collapse, in consequence of a largo abscess; he complained of pain, it was a peroneal abscess, it was situated at the end of the spine, about an inch from the anus—there was a great deal of sloughing, the abscess had been opened by another doctor—it must have been caused by a good deal of violence—there was a great deal of bruising—the prostration was caused by the abscess, that would be the natural effect of it—he gradually sank, and died on 12th August, early in the morning—I attribute his death to the exhaustion consequent on the abscess.</p>

From information I received I went to Mr. Stephens' rick vard on the 9th, about 6 o'clock—I concealed myself behind a haystack—about 7.45 I saw the prisoner come up the field to the stack yard—he moved some straw on one side—he then stood for a minute and looked round—he caught sight of me, and began to move away—I went round the other side of the stack and apprehended him—after I had him about a minute and a half, he said, "I want a rope, there is a horse in the ditch"—I said, "It is u funny place to look for a rope, in that straw stack"—I took him to the stack and took out the property—it was exposed by his pulling the straw on one side—this is a portion of it, and some more was found on the following Friday.</p>

I am happy to state that your kind message has made me much happier than I was yesterday, for I scarcely ever remember spending so wretched a day. Just think, my love, how could it be otherwise, when, instead of our being in Paris, I am in these miserable lodgings, and you, my darling, are ill in bed? The old saying stands good, "True love never runs smoth;" however, as you assure me you will endeavour to leave town in a day or two, I will not, my dear, annoy you by telling you how grieved and disappointed I was at our journey being put off; but, my dear love, when you are convalescent we will make up for lost time. I received a note from my daughter this morning. I enclose it, and the one I have written in reply, which you can peruse before it is posted. Saturday evening that beastly Pike followed me into Madame Rachel's, and tempted me to purchase the diamonds. He wanted me to sign an I 0 U for 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with<lb/>out giving me the jewels, but I was not such a fool to sign without having value in return. My refusing to sign seemed to displease him rather. I trust, my dear love, that you will never put your pen to paper for anyone. Do not forget last Friday. I hope you will always remember that before you ever put your name to a bill. I thank you very much for sending the four letters to Wales as you promised. My dear love, you must not be angry at the little I send you. If yon want any more I will bring it myself. Will that please you, my darling? I have not heard from Mr. Cope or Mr. Moon, and I do not wish to hear from either of them. With my very fondest and dearest love, believe me, your affectionate and loving, Mary Tucker Borradaile." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is true, the daughter alluded to is my daughter Florence—I swear that I never enclosed her letter to Lord Ranelagh, but Madame Rachel dictated that; I trusted her—I think I have been a very great fool to write those letters by her dictation—this letter looks like mine—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "7, George Street, Hanover Square, September 19th, 1866.

               <p>there, and then went out to take a walk and look for you. The woman at 36 detained my luggage, as you are aware. Madame Rachel sent the money to pay my bill. The woman watched me from her house into the house nearly opposite, where I had taken apartments at the engraver's, and what she said to him goodness knows; but this much I do know, she told him I had a lover, had ordered shirts for him, and had not paid for them; that I wanted to remove my boxes without paying my bill; and, in fact, scandalized me that the engraver refused to admit me into his house at twelve o'clock at night. My luggage was detained in one house and I was left without a lodging, and all on your account. Do I deserve this from you, my love I Had we left town last Thursday this would not have occurred; but as you say you were ill, it would grieve me to doubt you. As you are well there is no cause for any further delay. I went to Madame Rachel's, and Mr. Swisson took for these apartments. I send you a copy of Haynes's bill, and you will compare them with the bills you have, as he has not given me credit for as much as I have paid him; but your solicitor cut see to that. I did intend to call upon him this morning; there will be no necessity for my doing so, as you have all my bills and receipts, and Rachels accounts, which you will see are correct. The one thousand pounds paid from the Funds and one from the Reversion is what I promised Madam Rachel, and you will agree with me that she ought to be paid if anyone is; and, my darling, if you are a good boy, and do as I wish you to do in future, I shall be able to pay every bill without anyone's interference or assistance. I love you still, with all your faults; but remember, my own darling, that you must never sign another bill before you consult me; or, my dear, it shall have no money to go about with, as our kind friends and relatives predicted With fond and dearest love, believe me, your very affectionate and loving, Mary Tucker Borradaile.")—I ordered the shirt fronts, and here is the bill of them—it is very likely Lord Ranelagh may have wanted them—they were sent to 28, George Street, but I would not take them in—the bill is from Regers &amp; Co.—(<hi rend="italic">Dated August</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi>)—I think it is in the Hay-market—I never paid it—I think it was in July—this letter looks rather different to my writing—it looks as if it had been written with a steel pen, but I suppose it is mine—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "7, George Street, Hanover Square, Sep<lb/>tember 22nd, 1866.

I do not wish to leave town on bad terms with Rachel: it would not be policy on our part; but Mr. Haynes sent her a letter, which he had no business to do, and which seems to have made her furious; but, however, we are on very good terms now. I have done all I promised her I would do, and I have just written to her.

You can come with me to Grindlay's on Monday, between one and two o'clock. Send me word what time will suit you best. And now, my own darling, I hope you will not give me any further cause to fret and grieve; for if you keep your promise with me on Monday night, and tear yourself away from the little lady with the golden hair—which Rachel says any lady can obtain for two guineas—I promise you never to refer to the past.

My dear William. Madame Rachel and myself had, as usual, some very high words to-day, indeed it was a serious quarrel, and all concerning you. Mr. Richards came in at the time Rachel was speaking of you not in very respectful terms. She wished Mr. Richards to write to you or to Mr. Haynes to compel you to return me my property and money at once, and I told Madame Rachel and Mr. Richards that they dare not do any such thing. How dare they take such a liberty? Therefore, my darling, whatever you hear from either of them, you will treat it with the greatest indifference. I will comply with your wishes to-morrow, but pray, my dear, do not let it be at that horrid place where the poor man was killed. If you keep me waiting I will scold you well, and you must remember, my love, it will not be the first time you have kept me waiting. With fond and dearest love, believe me, your affectionate and loving, Mary Tucker Borradaile."—I never quarelled with Madame Rachel about William—I never knew a William—the place where the poor man was killed was Richmond—the said that she met Lord Ranelagh at Richmond, it was by the Star and Garter where Mr. Lewis the lawyer was killed.

I am sorry you are ill Indeed I am myself very far from being well. One of your kind friends has informed me, and one of your bosom companions, that you have been and are now keeping a woman, and with my money. There is one consolation, what you have you are welcome to, but allow me to assure you that I shall not be duped any longer by you or by anyone belonging to you. Not one member of my family will hold any communica<lb/>tion with me for forming, as they say, such a degrading connection with you. When I receive a letter from my daughter it is full of insults, and it is well known in Pembrokeshire that I have been living with you for some mouths. You cannot be and are not surprised at this, considering the life</p>

               <p>we have been leading. You have not taken any trouble to connect our affairs, and I have been foolish enough to allow you to be my master and lead me like a child; but am I to believe that the woman you travelled with, and who you introduced to me as your sister, is your mistress? I am not surprised at your forgetting me, as I have forgotten myself; there is one thing you must remember, that I am the widow of a Colonel, and though I have degraded myself and family by having had anything to do with you, I am still more humiliated by being introduced to such people as you associate with. I have not one person in London to speak to, and I dare not return to Wales: but I can live at Paris upon my pension, and I would have shared a crust of bread with you. I ask you again, for the last time, to return me my letters and all my property; and although I am determined to have my letters returned, the longer I stay in town the more I am involved on your account. Allow me to sign myself the last time, M. Tucker Borradaile."—"7, George Street, Hanover Square. November 4, 1866. My own dear William. Your letter pains and shocks me. What has led you to suppose that I should press you so? Far from it. Had you been present at the interview at Haynes' on Friday, you would not have sent me such an unkind letter. It is cruel of you—I who have gone through so much for you. It was Rachel, who did what she had no business to do. She told Mr. Haynes that you had all my money, which was no secret; and, in consequence of my having given her authority to do so, she showed it to him; and what could I say?—what could I do? Mr. Haynes agreed with Rachel that what had been done had been sanctioned by myself. Rachel and myself had a terrible quarrel, but we are now friends. She has promised to place all the accounts before Mr. Haynes, and I will ask him to settle up all accounts between myself and Rachel, and he can arrange much better than we can. Rachel told him that you had the money I had in the Funds. I do not wish you to leave England without me, and I feel assured you could not be so heart<lb/>less as to do so. I did ask for my letters to be returned; and what then? it is no crime, I did not wish that vile woman to read my letters, and I think you are still corresponding with her; if so, it is cruel, but indeed I trust that you have given her up. I have just come from church. I wish I was with you. With my fondest and dearest love, believe me, your affec<lb/>tionate and devoted, Mary Tucker Borradaile. P.S.—I am glad to hear your sister is better. I will write to her to-morrow."—"Wednesday Evening: My own dear William. I thank you for the pretty little machine; it will pass the time away when we are free from intrusion. Whilst you are smoking or reading, I can be making a pair of slippers, a smoking cap, or pair of braces. You will spoil me, my darling, if you pet and flatter me so much. Granny has told me to-day of all the pretty and naughty little things you have been saying of me. Mr. Haynes has behaved exceedingly well in doing exactly as I desired him to do, and he has not annoyed me in any way. What I wished him most particularly to do was to settle Bayer's bill, pay my eldest brother 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., pay Cridland his bill, give Rachel the undertaking for 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>; and should not the reversion realize a sufficient sum to pay my debts, I told Mr. Haynes that my friend would make up the deficiency. My habit, my love, was sent home to<lb/>day. You must excuse all blots, and wishing fondest and dearest love, believe me, your affectionate and loving, Mary Tucker Borradaile."—"Monday, March, 1867.

You say nothing will change your love or unbounded confidence. Your letters are safe, and I have kissed them and read them very often. My darling, we are one. All my thoughts are bound up in you, and I have no one to care for me but you; and I love you all the more for it. I have given you all that woman holds dear; therefore you must not doubt me at the eleventh hour. Show your letters, indeed! What woman could go through such an ordeal? Did I not forsake my only child for you? And with all the threats that my family and the lawyers held out I never compromised you, my own love. Rachel called upon Mr. Haynes to-day. Mr. Robinson, his clerk, told her that he was ill in bed. Rachel assures me she took the mortgage with the intention of giving it to Mr. Haynes. Rachel told Mr. Robinson of the arrangement I had entered into with her. You are aware that I lose my pension if I marry. This, the enclosed, is the arrangement for Grindlay. I leave every<lb/>thing to you, my darling. I have no one else to guide me but you, and, situated as I am, I have done all for the best; therefore, my dear, you must not be angry with me. I thank you for the pretty comb which Rachel says she has, but which, like many other pretty things, I have not seen. She says the veil is a gem. So very kind of you, and thoughtful of you. For<lb/>give my suspicions of you. I want nothing but your love, and for what you have done for me to-day, I feel assured I have it. With my fondest and dearest love, believe me, your affectionate and loving, Mary Tucker Borradaile.")</p>

How could I have been such a fool to have allowed you to squander the money in such a hopeless cause! However, my love, I am very glad that you have given up all thoughts of ever joining them again, and that you will leave everything to me for the future, and, with economy, we shall manage to live independent of the world, as I consider our income a very good one.

My sister-in-law, Mrs. Edwardes, is staying at the Great Western, and has been there for two weeks.")—When I could not get rooms at the Great Western Hotel, one house I went to was a lodging-house and one a coffee-house—Love joy's is in London Street, and Dennis's is in Francis Street—Mr. Lovejoy did summon me that morning—I was told that the lodging-house in Francis Street was not the place for a lady—I brought this blotting case from Rhyl—I have written in it, "Elsie, with Mr. Borradaile's kind love"—I presented it, with these two books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to Madame Rachel's children—I think I wrote my own name in it to enhance the gift, one book I recollect writing in, and I may have written in both—(<hi rend="italic">The following letters were also put in</hi>: "2, George Street, Hanover Square, November 24, 1866. Dear Madame Rachel As you are so well acquainted with my private affairs, and, like many others of your ladies who depend upon your honour, I think it would be unwise of you, to say the least of it, to speak of what no one has a right to interfere with but myself. I have said so repeatedly to my own child and my relatives, I should not have been subjected to all the troubles and annoyances that I have endured, if Mr. Cope had not taken the liberty of exposing my affairs to Mr. Moon, and in a letter which I wrote to that gentleman I told him so. That I am mistress of my own actions, and if I thought proper to place my affections on a man who has not a shilling in the world, and if he wanted the hair of my head he should have it, I am at liberty to do so. My family are annoyed with me for my giving him money. Do you suppose that man, if he has one spark of honour, would keep my money or property. Dear Rachel, you are mistaken in thinking so, and so are my family. Be assured, Rachel, if you will be quiet for a day "or two, I shall have more money than I want, and it will be your own interest to say as little about it as possible, and I will see you are righted. I will keep my promise with you, for I never break my word. Dear Rachel, will you kindly give me the letters that my friend left at your house for me when I was in Whitecross Street, as I want them; and if I have said anything to offend you I am very sorry for it I will not compromise my friend, whatever may be the result It would be dangerous to tell you that I am going to Paris, but you have children of your own, and you have not the heart to injure me that people say you would do. You have been very unkind. If any one suffers by this affair it will be myself. I am glad to hear the bills are not in the market that I gave you. No doubt you will be glad to hear that the 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that my friend has will be returned to you on Tuesday. You say you have no money of mine. You must not be hard with me. I will pay you by instalments. Thank goodness, my affairs are in a little better state than I thought they were. Please send me my letters. Believe me, yours sincerely, Mary Tucker Borradaile."—"7, George Street, Hanover Square, September 26. Dear Rachel. I arrived here between six and seven o'clock yesterday evening. I called upon you to-day, but you were engaged. I left a pretty little album, with some photographs, for your dear little Elsie, and a nice little cross for Leontie. I cannot tell you how grieved I was to hear of your sad accident, and so was my friend William. He will call upon you to-morrow; pray be kind to him for my sake; you know how much I love him, dear Rachel, and I never thanked anyone who would wish to separate me from the only man I love. With kind regards, your sincere friend, Mary T. Borradaile."—"December 20, 1867. Dear Madame</p>

               <p>Rachel. I am sorry that when your grand children called upon me to-day that Mrs. Smith should say I was not at home, for it was untrue. I had not left the house. Will you, dear Madame Rachel, kindly give me the box of letter which was sent to your house and entrusted to your care for me, or will you tell me when I can call for them. If you are asked any questions about my affaire please say you know nothing about them. I send you a pretty little book for Harry, as he was disappointed of the cake I promised him. With kind regards, believe me, yours very truly, Mary T. Borradaile. P.S. If you will send the box with your own man, Harry, I will give him something for bringing it."—"February 8th, 1868. Dear Madame Rachel Let me implore of you to give me my letters. All that is in my power I will do for you in return. I would give you 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and indeed 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if I had it. Indeed, I scarcely know what to do. I received such letter this morning from Wales, I am nearly distracted. I have written to-day to Mr. Cridland and to Mr. Haynes. I have enclosed you the copies. It is to satisfy Mr. Cridland, who writes every day to my brother by the morning post. Mr. Cridland and Mr. Haynes are become very great friends. I thought it advisable to write to both. You understand the motive. You have children of your own. It is to save my daughter's name, that her mother may not be disgraced in the opinion of the world. You know it will not do to have my name mentioned with Capt. W. Edwardes. It would be ruin to myself and my daughter. I still feel assured you will not refuse giving me my letters. I will never give you cause to regret having done so. With kind regards, I am, very sincerely yours, M. Borradaile."—"7, George Street, Hanover Square, February 20, 1868. Dear Madame Rachel. I enclose you Mr. Cridland's letter, which I received this morning. You know the meaning of it. Give me the box of letters, and put an end to all my misery, which has been killing me. You shall not be made the victim to serve other people, as you have kept my confidence. I shall re-pay you as a lady ought to do, in consequence of the annoyances you have been subjected to through my unfortunate affair. I have written to Mr. Cridland, and told him about the cruel affair that took place between Lord Ranelagh and my dear husband, and you will see Mr. Cridland will keep it secret. I wrote it in haste. I only told him a part. You may remember that I told you some years past, when I returned from India, the unfortunate affair. If Lord Ranelagh had not mentioned William's name in the presence of Mr. Cridland, I should not have mentioned the sad affair. By referring to the card enclosed you will see that the dates are correct. With kind regards, yours very truly, Mary Tucker Borradaile. The brewer's daughter has sent to tell me that Lord Ranelagh is to give her away to-morrow."—"7, George Street, Hanover Square, February 21, 1868. Dear Madame Rachel. I sent you two letters yesterday, one in the morning and one in the evening, the latter containing a letter from Mr. Cridland. I now enclose you one which I received last night, and you will see the great importance of my receiving my letters. I would prefer that you would give them to me instead of Mr. Cridland. Yours, very truly, Mary Tucker Borradaile.') Madame Rachel had proposed giving the letters either to Mr. Cridland or me—I think Mr. Cridland asked her for them, but she never gave them—I did not know that they were my letters—she had my authority, and I wished her to give them up very much—that was two or three months before the criminal charge was made—(<hi rend="italic">Upon</hi>

               <p>to the door—I do not think I described him, there were several men there, and I did not go in—Madame Rachel never blamed me for spending money on a paramour—when I mentioned not seeing more of Lord Ranelagh, she said the marriage was to be by proxy, and the proper mode of doing it was by letter, as she had married two parties in the same way—there is not the shadow of foundation for the statement that I have been living with any man, the letters are those of a self-confessed idiot—I never should have written them, except for Madame Rachel—I have been a prudent, virtuous woman all my life, and I cannot account for these letters at all—I never lived with O'Keefe—I know no half-military, half-sporting man, with a moustache—I do not recollect the letter in which that reference is made—I know no such person at all—O'Keefe called on me in Paris to know where I was living—I don't know Stephens, I have seen an elderly man come into the shop, who Madame Rachel told me was Lord Ranelagh's servant—I took no interest in the Fenians—I know no one in Ireland—I don't remember writing, "I am sick of the name of Fenians"—I can't explain it, for I know nothing about it—I recollect this about leaving Charing Cross early to-morrow; it was Rachel's dictation; I asked her the meaning of it—I can't swear this letter is in my handwriting—I have no idea who wrote this letter with a monogram, as it was not Lord Ranelagh—the letter from Lord Ranelagh, as I thought, which urged me to sign the paper, referred to the 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bond—I wrote ten or twelve letters addressed to "Tom"—there are others than those pro<lb/>duced, some Mr. Cridland would not give up, because they only related to my late husband—Rachel got the last letters of my late husband; she asked me to read them to her; she got hold of about four—I wrote to "Tom," because Rachel said, "We have had enough of 'Dear William;' we will write to 'Dear Tom' now"—I can anly account for the allusions to "William," in the letters to "Dear Tom," by Rachel telling me it was either to create jealousy, or to screen Lord Ranelagh—Miss Leontie saw me writing some of those letters—I have seen her about the Court in some of the passages during this trial—I know no William, and can convey to the Jury no meaning in the allusion to "Dear William" losing money at horse-racing—I know nothing of the cough mixture in connection with Lord Ranelagh, except that he came to the shop one day, looking very ill, and Rachel said he had a cold—there were no accounts between me and the prisoner—I never owed her a penny—she once gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for my lodgings in Davies Street for a short time; beyond that I never had a farthing from her—the account produced at the last trial, which appeared to be in my handwriting, I don't remember at all (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can't swear to this being my writing; part of it is not like mine—I have no recollection of writing any of it—it says, "Received, 13th June, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that is an absolute falsehood: also the entry, "Received 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Sept. 1"—all the entries of my receiving 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., altogether amounting to 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., are false—if it is in my hand-writing, I can't account for it—Rachel said there was an account, but I never knew what it was until it was produced at the last trial—the figures in this account I can swear are not in my handwriting—not a sixpence have I re<lb/>ceived in any way, except the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., she lent me—Madame Rachel is not a per<lb/>son to give money—I solemnly swear I have not received a farthing of that money—it was produced by your friend on the other side, on the last occa<lb/>sion, to vouch that I owed the amount.</p>

It is my duty to inform you that after you left town yesterday I was given to understand by Mrs. Borradaile, who had taken her leave of you when in the cab to return to Wales, that she had given you her word of honour not to visit or hold further communication with me until she had consulted Mr. Haynes. She further added that it was your orders she should at once remove from George Street, and that you understood she would do so. I explained to her this morning the importance of her consulting her solicitor, for her own sake as well as for mine, after what she said about me in your presence yesterday; but she refused, and up to this time—my messenger from Mr. Haynes has just come to say she has not been there to-day. How far her assertions are to be relied on, after that, I leave you to judge. Please to remember that she said the people of the house</p>

               <p>and myself had formed a league against her. So far from that being so, I beg leave to assure you I don't know the people. Mrs. Borradaile requested a youth in my employment, last night, to obtain a lodging for her, and at her desire he got apartments in Davies Street, and she went there. She is aware that there is a judgment against her on a bill of ex<lb/>change which she gave to a dealer in lace in Oxford Street She asked the man on Saturday to renew the bill for a fortnight; but it appears he won't agree. Mrs. Borradaile called on me again this morning, when she asked me questions again concerning Lord Ranelagh; but my reply, as in your pre<lb/>sence, was that it was her own invention, and all false. I don't forget your kind remark that there are two sides to a question. Enclosed I send you a true copy of a letter sent by Mrs. Borradaile to her lover. It will be for you to judge and draw your own conclusions from it. The original you are quite welcome to, with others which have been sent back. Mrs. Borradaile has led me to suppose for six months that she was to be married to her cousin, Captain William Edwardes.—Believe me, yours truly, Rachel."</p>

Sutton well, and have known her for a very long time; she knew Mrs. Borradaile, and gave me a letter of introduction to her at Paris—I have heard that she made Mrs. Borradaile's acquaintance in Whitecross Street—I believe she was in London about the time this charge was made, and I think I saw her, but I have seen her so frequently, that I cannot say—I have no doubt of it; I saw her at various places, sometimes in my own house—she was not living in the same house, but she used to call once or twice a week on business. Mrs. Borradaile has been to my house once or twice, and I think Miss Sutton has been there once; when she has been there, I am not quite sure—I have no house in Paris, I had a house in Hans Place, London, for fifteen months—Miss Sutton took charge of it for eight days, while I was in Paris, and then I sent for my own servants; it was a furnished house—I know a Mrs. Donoghue, the widow of one of the proposed bail in this case; he was bail for a short time—he has died since he was proposed bail—the widow lives near the Olympic Theatre, Wych Street, I think—I went there to ascertain whether Mr. Donoghue was proper and good bail, and I</p>

Q.</hi> Who is the owner in fee of the land that went by the lease of 19th March? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe Mr. Sidney Smith—I believe no pre<lb/>mium was paid for the lease—I prepared the lease from Drake to Darling—I acted for both parties—it was a sub-lease for the residue of Drake's term—at that time there was no building upon it—I believe it was intended to have buildings, and market gardens in the rear—there is a covenant in the deed that Darling shall erect at least one tenement, to contain six rooms—I was solicitor to the building society, and acted for Darling as well, in the usual way—I don't recollect that monies had been advanced by Messrs. Ashby, the bankers, at that time to Darling; it is very possible—I don't know that the 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to the bankers, and not to Darling—there is a provision in the mortgage deed that upon failure of the payment of the instalments they shall have a right to sell—it was an absolute mortgage, but it was supposed to be paid off in ten years and a half, and the deed would then be endorsed receipted, and handed to him—they are monthly instal<lb/>ments—I don't know how much was in arrear—if they sold there would be no equity of redemption—Spearing, Darling, and Simpson, first instructed me as to the assignment of the equity of redemption on Wednesday, 15th October, 1867; that appears in my call-book—those were the first instruc<lb/>tions which I really, <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi>, received to prepare that deed, and on that and the following day they called again, and a day was fixed to settle, and they again called on 23rd October—it is possible that I may have said I could not tell who gave me instructions to prepare that deed, because I had not looked; at my books when I was asked that before the Magistrate I said I could not tell how long before its execution I had received instructions, I had not then looked at my books—I said there was a delay in making it out, because I was pressed for business; that did not mean delay between the original instructions and the actual execution—I saw Darling one evening in September, at Mr. Walker's, the bookseller, and he then said he should shortly want an assignment prepared—when the matter was first before the Magistrate, I was present only as Clerk to the Justices, not as a witness, and I was merely asked about the handwriting—I have no recollection of Spearing coming to me in September, and my then saying I would get it done as soon as possible—I knew Darling before—I don't recollect having acted for him before, or for Spearing; he is a publican at Staines, and a furniture broker—I don't know that he had a bill of sale—I do not know a Mr. Gristwood—I never heard of him till this matter came up—I have heard from the bankrupt's daughter that Gristwood advanced 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I know nothing of it—I don't know that I ever saw Anthony Simpson, jun., of Iver Heath, baker—Iver Heath is seven or eight miles from Staines—I know nothing of the Simpson family.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil and seed broker, and live at Mardon Villas, Ashley Road, Hornsey Rise—the prisoner was my housekeeper for eight months—she was under notice to leave on 11th September—between 9 and 10 that morning my wife asked her why she had not gone; she said she did not intend to go, and uttered some threat, that her doom was sealed if she was turned away, or something to that effect—I said to her "You must go, you ought not to speak to my wife in that way, I will give you five minutes to consider whether you will go peaceably or not"—this was in the garden—she went in doors, through the kitchen, and in less than ten minutes there was a ringing at the door bell and the servants next door said the house was on fire—I rushed into the house and up stairs to my bed<lb/>room—the window was open and smoke rushing out; there was so much smoke that I could not enter for a minute or two—the wardrobe in the bed<lb/>room was burning; there were clothes in it belonging to my wife and children—there was no fire in that room and had not been since we had been in the house—there were no persons in the house but my wife, my children, and the prisoner—I got some water, and with great difficulty suc<lb/>ceeded in putting out the fire—I then searched the house everywhere for the prisoner, and she was gone—about 7 o'clock in the evening she returned in a cab—she said she had come to see what mischief she had done, and to say good bye—I said "You old wretch, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, I will give you in charge at once," which I did—on examining the house there was a strong smell of gas, and I found the whole of the gas burners in the drawing-room turned fully on, and also in the bed-room, which was on fire.</p>

               <p>and lonely—I was very seldom at home—she was not intoxicated on this morning; but the previous day, when we came home we could not get in—I had to break in, and I found her in bed and under the influence of drink—when she came back in the cab she appeared in drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He gave me notice, and I said I would not go. Mrs. Rough has always been very kind. When she said I should go I felt vexed, and drank some more. I had no intention. I went up stairs to put up my clothes and it struck me at the moment to set fire to the wardrobe, and I did so, and then I went and got some laudanum to finish myself, but it did not take effect.</p>

On the evening of 11th Sep<lb/>tember, the prisoner was brought to the Highgate Station, charged with setting fire to Mr. Rough's house—I read the charge to her—she said, "It is all right, I did it through mischief"—the female searcher, in her presence, gave me two bottles, which she said she had found upon her, and a small mug—I smelt them—they had contained laudanum—I asked the prisoner what they contained—she said, "What I have been drinking"—I said, "It is laudanum"—she made no answer—one of the bottles contained pure opium—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I afterwards went to the prosecutor's house—I examined the wardrobe, it was burnt, and the ceiling was scorched—in the pri<lb/>soner's bedroom I found a bottle that had evidently contained laudanum.</p>

I am a waiter at the Bricklayers' Arms, Trafalgar Road, Greenwich—the prisoner is a police-constable stationed there—the deceased, Henry Pogmore, was in the habit of frequenting our house, and lately drank considerably—on Wednesday, 2nd September, he left the house, alone, a little after 12 o'clock—he had been there about two hours—he was then sober—a few minutes after, I went out and saw the prisoner there in uniform, on duty—Pogmore was next door, about four yards off—I heard him say to the constable, "What the hell is it to do with you how I get my living?"—the prisoner made no reply—Pogmore made use of very bad expressions, called him a "B——old thing," and said he was only creeping about for a pension; and he said, "I have fought for my country, and I have medals to prove it"—the prisoner said, "<hi rend="italic">You</hi> fought; go on!" and deliberately seized the man by the front of the breast, and pushed him from him—it was done very quickly—it was a very hard push indeed—the man fell backwards on the pavement, on his head and shoulders, and his heels came down after—I went and lifted him up, and told the prisoner he ought to be ashamed of himself to knock a man down in that way—he said, "Why did he insult me?"—I said, "You ought to have locked him up if he insulted you"—he said, "I will lock him up now"—I then had the man on my knee—he never spoke—he put his hand to the back of his head—the prisoner took him out of my hands—he could not walk, or rather, his feet dragged along the ground about twenty-five yards—he staggered, and dragged the best way he could—as the prisoner was dragging him along, Tester came up, and said, "You don't want to lock him up"—the prisoner said, "No, I don't"—I and the witness Shaw then took him from the prisoner—the prisoner said to him, "Are you satis<lb/>fied with what I have done to you; if not, I will take you to the station; or are you satisfied with what you have had off of me?"—the deceased said he had had enough about his head, and he put his hand to the back of his head—I and Shaw led him part of the way home—I left him in Shaw's hands, and went home—the deceased was not trying to strike the constable at the time he was pushed—I am certain of that—it was done deliberately, and very quickly.</p>

I am a boat-builder, and live at 10, Lower Chester Place, East Greenwich—I was at the Bricklayer's Arms, and saw the prisoner and deceased having an altercation, and just as I got to the door, I saw the pri<lb/>soner, with his hands up, saying to the deceased, either "Get on," or "Go on," and he fell backwards—he was picked up by the prisoner and Mills, I believe.</p>

I live at 10, Conduit Terrace, Green Lane, Green<lb/>wich, and am the widow of the deceased, Henry Pogmore—on 2nd Septem<lb/>ber, my husband was brought home about midnight—he complained of his head, and he said he had been cruelly used, and had got his death blow—I bathed his head, and did what I could—about 4 o'clock in the morning I went to fetch Dr. Ryder, but before he came he was dead—he was thirty-three years of age—he took a little drink, but he had not taken any for a fortnight before this—he was quite sober when he came home; but after asking me to bathe his head, he could not speak another word—he had been in the 1st Dragoons, but was doing nothing at that time—he had no pension—I had had some money left me lately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Greenwich—I knew the de<lb/>ceased and have attended him—I was called to him, between 4 and 5 o'clock, on the morning of September 2nd—he was dead when I got there—I live about five minutes' walk from his house—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination next day, by order of the Coroner—there were no external marks of violence—there was a contusion inside the scalp, on the right side, and there was a certain amount of effusion between the scalp and skull—the bones on the right side of the head appeared to be dislocated, and there were two fractures—on removing the skull cap there was a large clot of blood between the skull and the dura mater, pressing on the brain, and on reflecting the dura mater there was another large clot of blood underneath, in the same posi<lb/>tion; the brain itself was healthy—the cause of death was compression of the brain, caused by the clot of blood; that was evidently occasioned by external violence—I have heard the evidence—if a man was knocked violently backwards, and his head came in contact with the pavement, it would have caused what I saw—he had been drinking—he was in the first state of de<lb/>lirium tremens—there must have been considerable violence to produce the appearances I saw—it is sometimes the case that there is no external mark,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186809210114"/>

I am a labourer—I lodged with the prisoner, at Levy's, in Disney Street—on the night in question, a little before 8 o'clock, I was in Levy's kitchen, with some others—Mrs. Hall, the prisoner's wife, was there—she managed the house—Johnson came in intoxicated—he sat down at the table and said, "Take my lodging money"—he had a clay pipe in his hand, which he heaved at Mrs. Hall—Mr. Levy was sent for—Johnson called him bad names, and said he would break the window—the prisoner was in the kitchen at the time—Mr. Levy said to Johnson, "Don't make a fool of yourself;" and he called out, saying he would have protection—Johnson <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> Over a round table before Mr. Levy's face, and then booked another table over with some crockery on it—there was a wire in the kitchen that is used to toast the meat with, and he took that up and said, "This is my property, it is not Mr. Levy's, and broke it"—he then went out, and took the broken wire with him—about two minutes afterwards I heard a scream, I ran out against Levy the greengrocer's, and saw Johnson lying in the road, about thirty or forty yards off—his nose and mouth were bleeding—he got up, I did not see which way he went—I went indoors, and looked at Charley Levy, who was sitting in the parlour, and they were giving him some water—he had been fighting with Johnson—the prisoner was not in the kitchen when Johnson was throwing the things about: Mrs Hall was—the prisoner had gone out before Johnson came in—I saw no quarrel between them.</p>

                  </hi>. In September last, I was house surgeon at Guy's Hospital—on the evening of the 8th, about 9 o'clock, Johnson was brought there—he had a wound on the lower part of the abdomen, about three-quarters of an inch in extent—the bowels were wounded, and a portion of it was protruding—it was on the left side, and below the level of the navel—he died on the 10th, of inflammation resulting from that wound—he was otherwise in a healthy state—the wound must have been caused by some sharp instrument—I examined the clothes he had on, and they had cuts corresponding to the wound—a knife like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) might have done it—the man was conscious, but he had been drinking.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>threatened me—she said, "You wretched woman, this night you die!" or words to that effect—she pointed the revolver direct at me—I was standing in the door-way of my sitting room, which was nearly opposite her bed room—there was a light in the sitting room, and also in her room—I had just time to run on to the second or third step of the stairs when the bullet passed me—I heard it strike the cornice of my sitting room, just above my had—I heard the report—the bullet struck the cornice, and lodged in a chair beneath—I rushed up stairs, and screamed "Police!" and "Murder!" from my top room window—the police came, and I asked them to break in at the door, for a woman was shooting at me—the door was burst open, and a witness with the policeman rushed in—the prisoner rushed down stairs with the revolver in her hand, declaring she was a desperate woman, and she would blow out the brains of the first who approached her—I rushed down behind her, put my hand on her shoulder, and pushed her into the street, and screamed to the policeman to secure her, as she had a pistol—the policeman had gone outside, and stood behind the door, so as to catch her as she came out—he took her into custody—I found the bullet next day in the padding of the chair.</p>
