                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 55, Brenton Street, Limehouse—on December 9th, about 12.20 a.m. I was in Commercial Street—I met the prisoner Nagle—I was sober—she asked me to have connection with her—we went into George Yard, Mile End Road, which is about 12 yards from where I met her—I do not know how far up the yard we went, but before I knew anything I was set upon by the two male prisoners; they caught hold of me and rifled my pockets, and they both seized me by the throat; they threw me to the ground, and I lay there while they were rifling my pockets—I heard one of them say, "Look out, the police," and he gave me a blow on the nose—they gave me a good hiding as well, I have been suffering from it ever since—I lost 4d. out of my pocket, and a handkerchief—I had three half-crowns in my hand, which they could not get, although they tried—the woman assisted them—Crawley was arrested on top of me—the other two ran away—I have no doubt that the woman is the woman who took me down George Yard, and that Cootes is the man who struck me.</p>

I am a builder, of 75, Favershed Road, Hornsey—I was introduced to the prisoner last July, and asked him if he could get five bills discounted for me—they were drawn by me and accepted by Mr. Holt—he said that he thought he could, and I handed him two bills in July for ₤75 each and one for ₤150—on August 10th I had another interview with him, when he said that he could get a solicitor to advance ₤300 on the bills for ₤500, and he, the prisoner, would advance the rest in building materials—I handed the five bills to him, and he asked me to endorse them, that he might get a cheque that afternoon—these (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are four of the bills—I saw him write this receipt—(<hi rend="italic">Dated August</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi>)—I frequently saw him afterwards, but he kept putting it off, he said that the solicitor was away for a holiday—I have never received any money for these bills, but on September 26th, he gave me five cheques amounting to ₤15 15s. 6d—these (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are four of them; they were dishonoured—I have received no building materials.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not know the prisoner as a surveyor—I did not go to him for advice on my building operations; we never mentioned them—I did not on July 18th call at his office and ask him to examine the plans—there was a surveyor engaged on the estate—I showed him the draft building agreement because he was going to a solicitor about it—I did not think there was any difficulty in negotiating these bills—I never received a letter from him stating "I shall be at your office at 2 o'clock; you shall have the bills, of course, if you will hand me the money and pay me for time"—"Avondale" is a house he spoke to me about—I saw it—he</p>

               <p>did not take the trouble to find it for me, but he was looking out for a furnished house for himself—I have not received any money—the cheque for ₤3 was dishonoured. I had no banking account—"Falcoln" is another house—I did not take it, but he introduced it to me, and several other houses—the houses he did not take, he passed over to me—I was building on the Oak<lb/>wood estate—he did not give me ₤55 10s. 6d. in cheques and cash—I deny that he lent me money at any time—I have not tried to recover my money in the ordinary way through the Civil Courts, I have tried to recover the bills—no date is mentioned in the receipt as to the time the bills were to be negotiated—a month afterwards I was still waiting for the money—he negotiated one bill on August 15th without telling me, and put the money in his pocket—I did not apply to the Lord Mayor or to a Magistrate for a warrant or a summons, but I did to the clerk at the Mansion House—he did not tell me that I could not obtain a warrant—when I could not get the money I commenced to try another source—I should have been satisfied if he had given up the bills—I did not owe the prisoner money, but he alleged that there was an account—my assistant wrote and asked what the account was, but there was no account between us.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He has never rendered an account to me—there is no money due to him—this is a letter to him from Gore and Thomas, my solicitors—(<hi rend="italic">Dated October 17 th, asking for the return of the bills by the next post. A letter from the prisoner to Messrs. Gore stated that Mr. Cooper deposited the bills for advances made to him, to which they replied, asking for an account, and a statement whether the advances were made by cheque, bills or cash; and a letter from the prisoner declining to say anything, as the Magistrate had called Cooper a lia✗r</hi>)—Wood never suggested that I was in his debt—he said that the solicitor was away for a holiday—when I was unable to obtain the bills I instructed my solicitor to take proceedings, and an action was brought in the Queen's Bench—I did not then know that the prisoner had negotiated this bill for ₤75, but as soon as I discovered that I went to the Mansion House and saw the clerk, and the prisoner was given in charge—I have never received any money from him except cheques which were dishonoured—I knew him as a timber merchant, not as a surveyor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a financial agent, of Tokenhouse Buildings—I met the prisoner in July, 1900, and he handed me these bills for ₤150 and ₤75—I borrowed ₤25 from Mr. Sedgwick on the ₤75 bill, gave Wood ₤20, and kept ₤5—I kept no memorandum, but I have ascertained from the bank that the cheque was drawn on August 15th.</p>

               <p>pressed me on many occasions for money on the bills, and told me that he was being pressed by the drawer of them—the ₤150 bill, which I returned, was handed to Mr. Roland, and he asked me if Mr. Roland could be trusted—I believe Mr. Sedgwick destroyed one bill accidentally.</p>

I was not to discount the two bills; I was to get them discounted—I went to Mr. Sedgwick on August 18th, and got a cheque for ₤25—I borrowed the ₤25 on it because he said that he required at least ₤50, and having destroyed one bill, I said, "You must make some advance to enable Wood to go on," and Wood undertook to pay back that ₤20 and per 60 cent, interest when the bill was met—Mr. Holt was to receive the ₤75 bill back—he was not to pretend to pay it; he was to pay it—Mr. Sedgwick failed to discount it, but I got him to give me ₤25 on it, on the understanding that Wood was to pay 60 per cent on the ₤20—Sedgwick was to give me ₤5, which was not to be returned, and Wood was to get ₤20 for the time being at 60 per cent.—Wood did not say, "I want ₤20 for it"; he told me to do what I could—the amount I took was left to my discretion—I thought Wood was connected with Mr. Cooper, and that the money was wanted to go on with the operations—I got what I could—I reported to Mr. Wood before I let the ₤150 bill go out of my hands—the same thing took place about the ₤75 bill—I asked Wood if ₤20 would do; he said, "Yes," and took it.</p>

I am clerk to an auctioneer, and live at 15, Lambs Conduit Street—on December 1st I went into the Prince Albert public-house, West Street, St. Martin's Lane—it was before 9.15—I there saw the deceased, Mr. Fisher, whom I know—Heritage and Edmundson then came in together—I knew Heritage, but not Edmundson—they had some drink—Fisher was sitting down dozing, and Edmundson took him by his shoulders and shook him up and said something about a horse—Fisher said that he would bet Edmundson he was wrong, and called him a liar—there had been a dispute about the amount which a horse had been sold for—Edmundson asked Fisher if he had any money—he said, "Yes, 5s."—he said, "Make it a sovereign and bet," and Fisher put a sovereign by the side of it, which Heritage picked up and put in his pocket, and said that he was a liar: and everybody who was brought before him, he tried to make a liar; he said, "If I was such a b—liar as you are, I would cut my throat"—Heritage then came forward as if to strike him; the deceased stood up, and I put my hands on his shoulders and put him down—Mr. Parker, the landlord, entered the bar, and induced Heritage to go outside—I walked outside, and he was on the door-step; I heard him say, "Send him out, as he is fighting"—his coat was off then, but it was on when he left the public-house—Fisher came out behind me, and turned to the left, towards the urinal, which is flush with the house—he did not go into the road, he only</p>

               <p>got half way—Heritage came into the middle of the road and said, "Come on"; Fisher walked into the middle of the road, and was about to take his coat off, when Heritage struck him a blow, I cannot say where, as I was behind him, but he fell backwards—he got up again on his legs, and Heritage knocked him down a second time, and he came in contact with the kerb—Edmundson got on his box and drove away just as the man fell the second time—Gilbert and Ray were there; Gilbert was in a cab, and a constable called him out of it, and got in himself—I went to the hospital—I did not see the deceased fighting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe the landlord said to Heritage, "If I were you I would go away"—when I got outside I saw Heritage standing right opposite—Fisher came out, and when he got to the middle of the road he took off his coat—I believe he had two coats, and they both came off at the same time, and he threw them towards the bar door—the two men were close to each other, each with his coat off, but they did not close—they got close together, and then a blow was delivered, and Fisher fell—he got up again, and was standing when the second blow was delivered; he was not stumbling—I do not know whether it was a greasy night, but it was wet—the road at that point does not fall in the direction of the kerb, the slant is the other way—the whole thing occurred very quickly.</p>

I am potman at the Prince Albert, and assist in holding horses and carriages—on December 1st, about 9 p.m., I saw Heritage and Edmundson go into the house, and took charge of Edmundson's brougham—I heard wrangling going on inside, and the landlord came out and advised Heritage to go home to his own house—his wife was looking out at the door, and she sent a servant to bring him over—he took his coat off and gave it to his servant to take it over the way—Edmundson was then standing outside; he took the horse out of my hands and wheeled it over to the other side without paying me—I stood at the door and heard Edmundson say, "If you do not go over and fight him, I will; you are a cur"—Heritage came out and challenged him—he said, "Come out; I will do to you as I have done to others"—Fisher came out, meeting him half way to the urinal—Heritage stopped him, and said, "Fight me now"—Fisher took off his coat, and Heritage struck him, and he went down backwards on the pavement, and got up staggering—after that Fisher lay on the kerb, and I went and picked him up, and called two cabs, and put him in one, and he was taken away—the prisoner was not there at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Heritage was swearing and taking off his coat when he left the public-house—I said before the Magistrate, "He came out peaceably"; that is true—he was on the public-house side when Fisher came out—I saw the witness Elliott standing outside the public-house door—I suppose he could see as well as me—that was the second time he came over—Fisher only said, "What do you want of me?"—I did not hear him say, "If you want I will fight," and I do not remember saying so before the Coroner—he took off both his coats while he was talking, and threw them on the ground, and then turned and faced Heritage, and he struck him—there is a small hill there; it is always greasy, and horses slip down sometimes, and it would be so with a blow—I told the Magistrate that it was easy to slip down—the whole</p>

I am landlord of the Prince Albert, at the corner of St. Martin's Lane—I was there on December 1st, and about 9 p.m. I was called to the bar, and found the prisoner and Fisher wrangling about the price of a horse, and calling one another liars—I asked Heritage not to make himself a public fool, but go out, which he did—I have known him as a customer ever since I have been there—I followed him to the door, and did not see what happened after he went out—I heard some<lb/>thing, and went out and found Fisher lying on the kerbstone.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am house surgeon to the Royal Free Hospital—on December 9th Timms was brought in, in a collapsed condition; he had an incised punctured wound in his back between the shoulder blades—this knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) was brought to the hospital—a knife like this might have inflicted the wound—I did not think it dangerous, but a small variation in the place might have been dangerous;</p>

               <p>it was close to the spine, and if it had struck the spine it would have gone on one side or the other—it was an inch and a-half long in the opening, oblique and downwards—one of my colleagues probed it—it was an inch and a half deep, and penetrated into the chest cavity—I let him go on that Sunday night, but he was brought back ill on the following Tuesday—he was lying on his stomach in the hospital, and gradually developed epileptic fits, which I attributed to the shock of the wound.</p>

               <p>the other man slipped round a potatoe car and struck the policeman on the left side of his head with his left hand—the policeman fell down, and the man ran down the hill—the policeman left his hat on the hill and ran after him; I ran as fast as I could, and the policeman turned three corners, and the man lay on his back—the prisoner was behind the policeman when I saw him—I said, "Look out," and the prisoner took his right hand out of his pocket and gave the policeman an awful blow in the back—the policeman jumped up, and had a knife in his back—the prisoner ran, and the policeman said, "Hi!" and blew his whistle—he made a grab at him, and held him by the collar, but the prisoner dragged him two or three yards up Baker's Row and got away in the crowd—I offered my services to the policeman, and he said, "All right; take it out of me, please"—I was a little nervous, and made three attempts to get the knife out—I got it out, and two policemen came up and took him to the hospital—I next saw the prisoner at the station, and said if I had not seen him for 10 years I should know him just the same—he was with seven or eight others, and I picked him out at once; I had previously given a description of him and the other man to the police.</p>

               <p>the firm of Deloitte, Dever, Griffiths &amp; Co.—in October, 1899, my firm was instructed by the Leadenhall Cold Storage Company to make an investigation of such books as were in their possession—I have, with the assistance of clerks, personally made the investigation—I found that there were many most important books of the Cold Storage Company missing—I found no journal of the company prior to June, 1899; the only one I found commenced after that—during my investigation I had no books of Brooke &amp; Co.—I waited some time to see if they were forthcoming, and on December 5th, 1899, I made my report to the Cold Storage Company—I also sent in a number of schedules, the matters of which, I suggested, required explanation—the letters which the defendant wrote to Messrs. Beale were, shown to me—the defendant has offered no satisfactory explanation of the four charges contained in the indictment—they are Tabor, Tate, Appleyard and Middleton—where there were deficiencies—there were a great number of other items without any explanation—the books were absolutely incomplete—there was no balance-sheet, and no means of proving the accounts to be accurate in any sense—the only proof I had was their inaccuracies in many places—since the adjournment of this case in December last a ledger purporting to be the ledger of Brooke &amp; Co. has been produced, that was on January 3rd, for the first time—it appears to have been all written up at one time—there are 163 folios, but only about 20 of them have been written on—they extend from July 1st, 1896, to January, 1898—there is now no ledger prior to that date—there is an account in the ledger between the defendant and the Cold Storage Company; it is headed "The Leadenhall Market Cold Storage Company, Limited," and in brackets "&amp; G. Shead, Esq."—in that account the defendant from time to time takes credit for his salary and office rent, to which he was entitled, and also for sums paid by him from time to time on account of the company—my attention has been drawn to a bundle of cheques which are said to have been paid by the defendant for rent and other things out of his own banking account, amounting to about ₤7,000—I find that in every instance the defendant has either taken credit for those cheques, or has previously drawn the money out of the Leadenhall Company, and although the amounts are not the same in the total, I find he has drawn out more than is represented by those cheques—I find a number of debts written off as bad, as of June 30th, 1898—they have been put to a suspense account—in Schedule D, sent to the defendant, there is an item of ₤23 16s., a debt due from Mr. G. B. Tate—that ₤23 16s. forms part, of an amount of ₤30 13s. 3d., which all relates to Mr. Tate—he paid the ₤23 16s. in June, 1899—this was written off in June, 1898—there is no entry in the cash-book showing a payment of ₤23 10s. in June, or at any time, or an entry in Mr. Tate's account crediting him with that amount—I found that a number of debts were written off in June, 1899, by carrying them to a suspense account—I selected a number of items from those debts which were written off, and included them in Schedule E, which was sent to the defendant, and in that schedule there is an item which appears in the indictment, Tabor's ₤100, that was paid on December 3rd, 1895, and there is an entry in the cash-book showing the receipt of ₤100 from G. Shead on December 3rd, 1895</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190101070054"/>
               <p>to the company—the payment of that ₤100 is carried to the credit of the defendant's account in the ledger—my impression is that the entry "G. Shead" is in the defendant's writing—in his ledger account with the company I find under the same date that amount is credited to him—it succeeds two entries of June 30th, 1896, crediting him with rent and his remuneration—there is no credit given in Mr. Tabor's account for that ₤100—I find no entry in the books at all in 1898 correcting what had been previously entered there, and. in June, 1899, it is carried to suspense account; it is written off, and I should include it in other sums amounting to ₤115 17s. 1d.—I also sent to the defendant the schedule marked "M," headed "List of items in the manager's cash-book not accounted for by the secretary between July 1st, 1896, and August, 1899"—the manager was Mr. Russell—it shows Middleton's ₤20 0s. 10d., dated August 4th, 1899, and Appleyard's ₤5 5s. under the flame date—they both appear as amounts accounted for by the manager and not accounted for by the secretary—in the manager's cash-book I find that Middleton's cheque for ₤20 0s. 10s. and Appleyard's cheque for ₤5 5s. are accounted for to the defendant by Mr. Russell, and I find the defendant's receipt to Russell, dated August 5th, for ₤110 5s. 2d., which includes both those amounts as detailed by the books—there is no entry in the cash book of the receipt ₤20 0s. 10d., or in Middleton's account, giving him credit for the payment—the same applies to Appleyard's ₤5 5s.; there is no entry in Appleyard's account except transferring it to suspense account—Middleton's account was left open; it has been closed since—the suspense account was closed before the defendant was dismissed—closing the suspense account comes to much the same thing as calling the items in it bad debts—I got from the London, City &amp; Midland Bank a copy of the defendant's account from July, 1897—I find in it a number of drawings out of Brooke &amp; Co.'s account, which apparently had gone to the Leadenhall Storage Company—I extracted amounts from July, 1894, to February, 1898, amounting to ₤7, 286 15s. 7d.—that is the amount of cheques drawn payable to the Storage Company—in addition to them I find a cheque for income tax, drawn on February 1st, 1898, for ₤250—yesterday was the first time I had even seen that cheque, when it was produced by the defence—in December, 1900, a heap of cheques reached me, and this cheque was looked for, but was not there—I had the preceding and succeeding numbers—there is no entry debiting the defendant with that ₤250 in his account with the Storage Company—in the new ledger I find it in an account headed "Rent, rates and taxes, etc."—the entry is "1898, February 1st, income tax ₤250"; in pencil below it there ig, "To be adjusted"—it appears to be in the writing of the same clerk who wrote up the whole of the ledger—on the counterfoil there is "In. tax," and no amount filled in—I think the counterfoil is in the defendant's writing—I find by the banking account that a cheque for ₤212 10s. was drawn out of Brooke &amp; Co., payable to Chapman, on February 9th, 1898—1 find that cheque among the cheques which have been produced—Mr. Chapman is a director of the Leadenhall Storage Company—that amount is a half-year's interest pay<lb/>able to Mr. Chapman, on a loan he had made to the company—in the jour<lb/>nal of the Storage Company I find, under date of June 30th, 1899, "Henry</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190101070055"/>
               <p>Chapman debtor to G. Shead, ₤212 10s., amount paid him on February 9th, 1898"—that is posted in the ledger to his credit—the defendant has taken credit for it as having paid it out of his own pocket—on the top of the counterfoil of the series 56501 I find there is pencilled "G. 8. to 10," which I take means that the defendant used the cheques 56501 to 56510 for himself; except for that, they are all blank—I find that ₤600 was drawn out of Brooke &amp; Co., on February 5th, 1895, by cheque in favour of the Leadenhall Company—turning to the Leadenhall Company's books, I find on February 28th, "G. Shead, ₤600," as if he had paid the ₤600, and that amount is carried to his credit in the ledger—on May 6th, 1896, I find another ₤250 is drawn out of Brooke &amp; Co., and on May 11th ₤200, and by the banking account they appear to be drawn in favour of the Leadenhall Company—in the cash-book of the Leadenhall Company I find on May 11th, "G. Shead, ₤450," which is the amount of those two cheques, as if paid by him personally, and the ₤450 is carried to his credit in the ledger—I should think the entry in the cash-book is in the defendant's writing—the entry in his ledger account with the company is credited to him, and is dated May 6th instead of the 11th, and immediately precedes an entry of December 11th, 1895, which is Tabor's ₤100—on July 8th, 1897, I find ₤100 drawn out of the banking account of Brooke &amp; Co. in favour of the Leadenhall Company—there is no entry in the Leadenhall Company's cash-book of that sum being received by them under that date. A separate banking account was kept for Waller &amp; Co.—(<hi rend="italic">Counts</hi> 18, 19, 20)—I have examined their accounts—on July 28th, 1898, I find ₤200 was drawn out by the defendant—I have traced it to the account of the Leadenhall Company, and it should have been entered in their books as a receipt from Waller &amp; Co.; it is entered as received from Brooke &amp; Co.—at that date Brooke &amp; Co. had ceased to belong to the Leadenhall Company, but they still had an account with Mr. Brooke, the purchaser—in the ledger it is entered to the credit of an account called "Bills, etc.," and is entered "By cash," without any other description—I can give no explanation of that account; it is quite incomprehensible to me—altogether ₤2, 458 18s. 9d. is disposed of in that way—it does not appear in the books as a payment out of Waller &amp; Co.—by the bank account, and by this cheque now produced, I find that ₤50 is drawn out of Waller &amp; Co. on August 17th, 1898—in the cash-book of the Leadenhall Company it is entered "Received from Waller &amp; Co."—in the ledger it is passed to the credit of G. F. Brooke &amp; Co.—on January 5th, 1899, I find another sum of ₤200 drawn out of Waller &amp; Co., by cheque (Ex. 9) in favour of the Leadenhall Company—in the cash-book and in the ledger of the Leadenhall Company, it appears as if it had been paid by Brooke &amp; Co.—so far as the books of Waller &amp; Co. are concerned, there is nothing to show why those amounts should have been paid to the Leadenhall Company. The rent of the Leadenhall Company and of Brooke &amp; Co.'s premises were payable to the Imperial Life Assurance Company as landlords—the amount of rent due from the Leadenhall Company in 1897 was ₤1,725, and from Brooke &amp; Co, ₤212 10s. a quarter, which is ₤850 a year—from the books I have prepared an account showing the amount of rent that was due, and the cheques</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190101070056"/>
               <p>which were drawn purporting to be in payment of rent from 1894 to 1899—it appears that many cheques were drawn by the defendant on his own banking account, some on the Leadenhall Company, and some on Brooke &amp; Co. accounts—some of them are drawn in the name of Lewis, who was the Insurance Company agent, and some in the name of Bates, who was his clerk, and sometimes in the name of rent—from July 2nd, 1897, to February, 1898, I find cheques drawn in one of those ways amounting to ₤1,675, and among them on July 2nd, 1897, there is one for ₤431 5s., and another on October 11th, 1897, for ₤231 5s.—₤231 5s. is not the amount of a quarter's rent from either business—₤567 10s. too much had been drawn for rent on July 2nd, excluding the ₤431 5s.—Waller's rent was paid quite separately—in October, 1897, if the ₤431 5s. was a genuine payment, then the amount was still overdrawn—up to January, 1899, I find altogether ₤1,392 10s. has been overdrawn in the name of rent—the defendant has taken credit for each amount—a great many of the cheques which were drawn by him, and which ought to have been entered in the books of the Leadenhall Company, were altogether omitted, but the result of giving him credit for all the payments he has made is that in the end he has had all that back, and ₤1,392 besides—by an entry in the cash-book dated May, 12th, 1899, the defendant enters as a payment made by him out of the Storage Company's funds, "By G. B. Tate, ₤203 14s. lid."; so he drew the cash out of the company some weeks before he paid Mr. Tate—among the payments made by the banking account of Brooke and Co., I find two in the name of Gardener, one on October 6th, 1897, ₤250, and another on December 16th, 1897, ₤100—I think Gardener was a clerk of the defendant's, but there is no account of his in the books of the Leadenhall Company, but in the ledger which was given me last Thursday I find those two amounts charged against the Leadenhall Company "or G. Shead, Esq."—there is no entry in the cash-book of the Leadenhall Company of their having received those sums.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not come in contact with this company till October, 1899—I have not had the assistance of any particular director—I should not venture to name any of the directors who had a knowledge of the business—I do not know that steps were taken to avoid its becoming known that the Storage Company and Brooke &amp; Co. were the same—there was no account in the Storage Company's books of any monetary transactions between them and Brooke &amp; Co.—I know Brooke &amp; Co. was in liquidation—it was a very large business—I do not think there would be a large number of books needed in it; I should not think they would need more than 10 or 15 at a time—I should not think that there would have been hundreds of books since 1888—I cannot say how many I received—some of Brooke's books were kept at the market, and some at the defendant's offices—I have not the slightest idea how many counterfoil cheque books there are; there is a considerable number—I have no know<lb/>ledge of the defendant's gross payments—I ought to find them in the ledger, but they are not there—so far as the evidence of the books informs me, these three businesses were being run apart—I find a cheque of the defendant of June 30th going to Mr. Lewis for rent, and also one for ₤431 5s.—on June 25th there is no entry in Brooke &amp; Co.'s books with</p>

               <p>regard to it—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is drawn on October 4th to Mr. Lewis for ₤431 5s. with regard to the Leadenhall Company—I do not know if there was any dispute between Brooke &amp; Co. and the Inland Revenue officers—the indictment says the ₤23 16s. from Mr. Tate was carried to a suspense account on June 30th, 1899; as a matter of fact, it should be June 30th, 1898; it was not paid till June, 1899—the books ought to have been written up by August, 1899—(<hi rend="italic">The Third Count of the indictment was amended to "June, 1898,' and the Fourth and Fifth Counts to "August 4th, 1899," instead of July 5th, 1899, by the</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not find that the defendant has made any payment to Mr. Chapman for which he has not taken credit in the books, and the ₤212 10s. is a case in which he took credit, although the money came out of Brooke &amp; Co.—the ledger which has been produced of Brooke &amp; Co. contains an account with the Storage Company, and there ought to have been an account in the books of the Leadenhall Company—I find no account corresponding with the account in the new ledger—I find that the ₤600 was paid to the credit of the Leadenhall Company on February 6th, 1895—the cheque drawn out of Brooke &amp; Co. for ₤600 on the same day is missing—if it was produced we might find out whose bank it went into; it is quite clear that two sums of ₤600 were not received by the Storage Company—if they received this one, the other one is not accounted for—I cannot suggest why the ₤23 16s. should have been carried to a suspense account; if it had been applied for a great many times and not received, then it could be—I recognise Mr. Tate as the son of Sir Henry Tate a millionaire—I know now the cheque for income tax went into the defendant's account—it purports to have been paid for income tax—at the time the cheque for ₤431 5s. for rent was drawn there was no such sum due then—the defendant's cheque is dated June 30th, 1897, but the payment is charged as having been made on June 25th—assuming the amount to be correct, it had come out of the coffers of the Leadenhall Company—the 16 cases in the indictment are selected out of a large number of others—I should say there are hun<lb/>dreds of items which require explanation—these are the particular items to which special attention has been directed in the schedules—Nos.

I am clerk to Mr. Swanson, surveyor of taxes, of Telegraph Street, City—his district includes the office of the Storage Company—I cannot say if any return was made for income tax in 1898, because the offices of the company were not where they are now—Mr. White would have the income tax return form if one was sent in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">J. G. WHITE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>) I do not think any return was made to me from the Leadenhall Company, so far as I recollect the return was made at a loss—in 1897 or 1898 the surveyor estimated it at a profit of ₤400—they appealed, and the appeal was allowed—in 1897 and 1898 a loss was again returned, and an amount of ₤600 was charged—I cannot say if they appealed again, but I never got a penny from them—in 1898 and 1899 no charge was made, and a loss was returned—the papers then left my hands and went to Mr. Swanson—they would eventually go to Somerset House—if they were found now they would be blank.</p>

A letter from the defendant, dated September 22nd, 1891, was put in, stating that he enclosed a copy of the profit and loss account, arid saying that the loss was ₤2,257; also a letter of September 19th, stating that no accounts had been issued yet, but that the loss was over ₤2,200; a second return showed a loss of ₤3,400 in 1890, and at a date subsequent to 1898, the return not being dated, a loss of</hi> ₤6,373).</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Whitehall Court—in 1897 and 1898 I received the rents of the Storage Company and Brooke &amp; Co. for the Imperial Assurance Company—in 1897 and 1898 the rent of the Leadenhall Company was ₤1,725 per annum, and of Brooke &amp; Co. ₤850—I never had more rent than was 'due; it was payable quarterly—I believe the payments were sometimes made by a cheque of the defendant's, sometimes by one of the Storage Company, and sometimes by one of Brooke &amp; Co.—on July 2nd, 1897, I received ₤431 5s. rent for the Storage Company—they were generally three months behind<lb/>hand—that was the Lady-day rent—on October 7th, 1897, I received</p>

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer, of 69, Victoria Street, West<lb/>minster—I have been one of the directors of the Cold Storage Company since its registration in 1887; I have always been the principal share<lb/>holder, and I have increased my holdings; the shares have been held by only a few people—the defendant was appointed financial and general manager and secretary to the company on December 17th, 1888—the minute of December 18th, 1888, which was signed on December 24th, appointed him—a short time after his appointment he introduced the question of the purchase of Brooke &amp; Co., of which he said he was liquidator—ultimately, in my own name, I purchased Brooke &amp; Co., the profits of which were to go to the Storage Company—the company paid the money, but I advanced it—I do not remember when the whole of the amount was paid, but I advanced money from time to time; altogether I advanced between ₤14,000 and ₤15,000—I was credited in the books with the money I advanced—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) purports to be the cash-book of the Storage Company; I have never seen it before—I see here there is a payment to the liquidator of G. F. Brooke &amp; Co. of ₤2,250 on November 9th, 1889—I have no idea what was paid for Brooke &amp; Co. now—the defendant was paid out of the funds of the Storage Company—the receipts of Brooke &amp; Co. went to the Storage Company; I did not have them—in the autumn of 1889 I became a partner in the firm of Waller &amp; Co., and afterwards I became sole proprietor—by the agreement of July 10th, 1890, the salary of the defendant was increased to ₤400 per annum, and an allowance of ₤200 per annum for offices and clerks, and he was also to manage Waller &amp; Co.—from that date the receipts of Waller &amp; Co. should have gone to the Storage Company—we had board meetings occasionally, generally when we were called by the defendant—speaking generally, the defendant managed the business and affairs of the company—he was the only person who had authority to draw cheques—interest was payable to me on my advance—in 1897 and 1898 the interest payable to me was ₤212 10s. half-yearly—I can remember three occasions on which the defendant paid me that interest with his own cheque—on July 15th, 1890, I received a cheque from him, and this letter with it—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he enclosed his own cheque for ₤1,500 15s. 6d., so as not to open the eyes of the City Bank.</hi>)—that was the repayment of a short loan—I do not think I ever asked him what he meant by "So as not to open the eyes of the bank"—I received this letter from him, dated September 16th, 1897—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he again enclosed his own cheque for the balance owing, and hoped the figures would be found correct; that he sent his own cheque, as he did not wish the bank, in the present circumstances, to see that the witness was receiving moneys from the concern.</hi>)—with those two exceptions, I was not aware that he was paying accounts of the company with his own cheques—I continued to make advances to the company</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190101070061"/>
               <p>up to July 10th, 1890, when I advanced ₤1,500—we did not have a balance-sheet every year—I remember calling the defendant's attention to the book debts, and asking him if they were good—this balance-sheet of June 30th, 1896, shows debtors to the company of ₤20,605 7s. 2d.—I called the defendant's attention to it, and he said that they were recoverable debts, and worth 20s. in the pound, and that they were in regard to shipping companies who paid at long credit—I was satisfied with that—we had two auditors, one after the other; the second one's mime was Gordon; I cannot remember the other's name—they were appointed by the shareholders—this balance-sheet was produced by the defendant for the year ending June 30th, 1898—on the liability Ride I find "Less provision for bad and doubtful debts, etc., ₤9,515 0s. 6d."—it is dated February 15th, 1899, for January, 1898—upon seeing that the directors appointed me and another director to look into these accounts, we obtained from the defendant a schedule showing all the debts, and with his assistance we divided them into three categories: good, doubtful, bad—we then instructed the defendant to put certain of the bad debts that we thought might be recoverable, into the hands of some firm. I think we suggested Stubbs, to try and recover them—we could not obtain all the books we required—we asked the defendant; he said either they were wanted for other purposes, or for his office—ultimately we gave him notice, I cannot remember the date; the minute is dated August 11th, 1899—we wrote to the Midland Bank, giving them notice of the termination of the defendant's engagement, and put the matter into the hands of our solicitors and the accountants, for investigation, the result of which was reported to us, and we took legal advice and instituted this prosecution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was other money in the Storage business besides ours—all the shareholders were not friends of ours—I began lending money in 1888—I did not get tired of doing so; I ceased doing so in 1890—I parted with about ₤14,000 in the two years—I cannot say if there were any articles of association—neither Mr. Abbott, Mr. Bsale, nor myself had any practical knowledge of carrying on the business of game dealers—there must have been a secretary before the defendant came, but I cannot remember who he was—there was no committee of directors formed, so all the directors acted as committee—the defendant was to exercise his supervision over the business in the markets—he was to be permitted to carry, on his own business as well as manage ours, if he gave sufficient time to ours—it did not come to my knowledge that there was continual trouble with regard to the over<lb/>draft at the bank, because they had our guarantee and probably interest—money was raised on bills of which Mr. Abbott, myself and the defendant were acceptors—this is a bill for ₤1,200, of July 30th, 1892; the defendant's name appears on it, but not as secretary of the company—there were two bills; I do not know if there were any others—I may have been asked to advance more money, and may have said, it was impossible, as my account was overdrawn—this is my letter to the defendant, dated June 21st, 1891—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that having already overdrawn his account at the bank to the full extent of his tether, he was unable to advance any more money for the present.</hi>)—I did not know that the defendant was to be a</p>

               <p>party to the guarantee of the overdraft of the Storage Company—this is my letter to the defendant, dated November 12th, 1891—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he was very pleased to hear that Mr. Beale had succeeded in making such a good arrangement with the London &amp; Midland Bank, and that it ought to make the City Bank sit up.</hi>)—I suppose the City Bank would not make the same terms, and would lose our business—part of the defendant's duty was to goand see people and try and get them to send goods to the Stores—this is a letter of mine, of February 28th, 1894, to the defendant—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he did not see how Mr. Thomas could have more interest than the other debenture holders.</hi>)—Mr. Thomas had some old debentures at 6 per cent., which were renewed at 5 per cent., but he expected to get 6 per cent.—there was an endeavour at that time to raise money to keep the business going—I said in that letter also, "Unfortunately the heavy calls made in the other companies of which I am a director have entirely crippled my resources, and so I am unable to assist in any way"—I meant to assist in redeeming the debentures that were all run out—I remember the Midland Bank refusing to cash cheques in consequence of the overdraft, unless they had a further guarantee—at that time we were desirous of turning Brooke &amp; Co. into an independent company, of which the public were to have the benefit—that would be about 1897; that was what was contemplated if any profits had been shown—on June 14th, 1897, I wrote this letter to the defendant—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had been pressing Mr. Beale to get out a prospectus, and that he, Mr. Beale, was only waiting for some figures and particulars, and asking the defendant to forward them at once, as he was desirous of having matters settled; besides which, the bank was becoming impatient</hi>).—that refers to Brooke &amp; Co.—the auditor from 1891 to 1899 was Mr. Gordon; I believe he is alive still; he discontinued because we were not satisfied with the way things went on—before 1897 Mr. Allott was auditor; he had been selected by the directors—I do not remember Mr. Wright—Mr. Harrower succeeded Mr. Gordon; Messrs. Carnaber, Harrober &amp; Co. are the present auditors—I wrote this to the defendant on August 23rd, 1897—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had hoped ere this that Brooke &amp; Co. would have been a limited company.</hi>)—I think the defendant was away some time from ill-health—I was never aware that he was paying any money from his own private account for the businesses—if any difficulties arose with regard to finance, he ought to have called a meeting of directors—we met very irregularly, in one year we only met once, I think—we generally met at the defendant's office—there was a manager in Leadenhall Market—it was not kept secret that the three businesses were being run by the same people—we did not prepare a statement ourselves; we took the defendant's statement and figures—when I and the other directors went through the accounts we had the schedule drawn up by the defendant and certain of the ledgers—we spent three afternoons at it—until 1898 we never made any provision for bad debts—we had one interview with the auditors, and asked them if they had any remarks to make—we complained that we could not get all the books when we went through the accounts—I remember I received a cheque for ₤212 10s. on February 9th, 1898, and another on February 18th—I wanted an</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190101070063"/>
               <p>explanation, and as I could not get it, I passed the second cheque on to the interest of the account—I did not see the defendant about it; I did not see much of him—the information regarding the debts of Brooke &amp; Co., Waller &amp; Co. and the Storage Company would be got from the people immediately conducting the business, but through the defendant—we could always call a meeting of the directors when we wanted one—I do not know if there is a letter to the defendant complaining that we could not get all the books we wanted, but I certainly informed him of it, and Mr. Harro wer complained—when we were examining the books Mr. Weston complained that we could not get all we wanted—I have not got the guarantees given to the banks—I know I advised Mr. Beale to have them cancelled</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The first intimation I had that the defendant was paying the accounts of the company with his own cheques was when he paid me—apart from those cheques to me, I never heard until after the commence<lb/>ment of this prosecution that he had been in the habit of doing that, or that he was personally financing the company—he never claimed any interest when the directors ordered my cheques to be drawn for interest—he never suggested that he had a right to something himself—at the meeting of June 30th, 1898, there were 11 shareholders present and three by proxy—at that meeting Mr. Gordon offered himself for re-election, but the shareholders elected the new firm in<lb/>stead—at the meeting of April 20th the directors had all cheques put before them for approval; that had never been done before—I did not know the defendant was paying the company's money into his own account; he had no authority to do so; if it had been known it would have been stopped at once—there was no meeting of directors between August 20th, 1891, and August 25th, 1892—in the cash-book on July 18th, 1898, I find a cheque for,₤212 10s. drawn out of the company in the name of Henry Chapman, and another on July 25th, for the same sum—both those cheques came out of the company's cash—in 1897 we should have turned Brooke &amp; Co.'s business into a limited company, if there had been any profits—we could not get the books to see if there was any profit, but the defendant pretended that there were very large profits—we asked him for facts, but we never could obtain them—I do not remember hearing anything from him about the income tax of Brooke &amp; Co.</p>

Shead—there is a difference between that entry and the other entries there—it was filled in afterwards; it is not in my writing; I thought at first that it was—the name of the gentleman who paid the ₤100 was not put into the paying-in book, but a blank was left till it could be filled up—I should not have asked the defendant for the name over and overagain, because I should have filled it up myself—I see under date of May, 1896, an entry of ₤450 paid by the defendant; that is in my writing—the "G. Shead" was entered at a subsequent date to the rest; it is in different ink; the ₤450 has evidently been put in pencil first—I did not post the ledger—the books were generally made up on June 30th in every year—the "G.

I am a solicitor, of Great George Street, West<lb/>minster, and am now acting for Miss Colthurst—she is mistaken in saying that the deed of gift was prepared by the prisoner—I prepared it—I have seen the list of investments and particulars of the estate, amounting to ₤10,647 in Consols—it is not correct—it should be ₤9,647—since the bankruptcy I have received all the securities belonging 10 Miss Colthurst, and among them the mortgage deed, dated January 5th, 1898, by a Mrs. Burns-Hartropp, and another to Miss Colthurst, to secure the sum of ₤8,000—that is the only security that I have received representing the sum of Consols belonging to the estate; I have received no security for the balance of ₤1,000.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The ₤4,800 mentioned in the list of securities I understood was part of a contributory mortgage for ₤40,000—the ₤850 on property at Limehouse was of no value at the date of the testator's decease—there was an outstanding claim for duty on an annuity of ₤400 belonging to the deceased; the annuity was charged on the Colthurst Estate in County Cork—there was at the time likely to be costs incurred with regard to the estate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at Child's Bank—prior to his death, Mr. St. John George Jefferyes had an account at the bank, and after his death it was continued by the defendant as executor, and he alone operated on it—at the time of Mr. Jefferyes' death the bank held ₤12,000 in Consols belonging to him—by the prisoner's direction on June 30th, 1897, we sold ₤2,352 3s. 3d.; on July 19th, ₤700; on July 26th another ₤700—on October 20th, 1897, we received from the prisoner the following letter: "Dear Sirs—St. John Jefferyes, deceased: Will you kindly instruct your brokers to act on power of attorney they hold to sell ₤9,000 Consols, and place the proceeds to the credit of the account of the executors of the above.—<hi rend="smallCaps">BENJAMIN G. LAKE"</hi>—acting on that letter, we sold Consols realising ₤9,000, and informed the prisoner that we had done so—on October 30th he instructed us to sell the balance of Consols in our hands, which was done, and they realised a further sum of ₤181 9s. 3d.—the sums realised were placed to the credit of the executor's account—I produce a certified copy of the account—on July 28tb, 1898, ₤1,000 was placed to the credit of Miss Colthurst—on November 10th the prisoner drew on that account a cheque for ₤9,000 in favour of the firm of Lake &amp; Lake, and the proceeds were placed to the credit of that firm at our bank—on the same day five cheques for ₤3,000 each and one of ₤1,000 were drawn on the account of Lake &amp; Lake to various firms—there was also at the bank an account called "Lake &amp; Lake Cavendish</p>

               <p>Account," which both the prisoner and George Lake drew upon—on January 28th, 1898, a cheque for ₤9,000 was drawn on the Cavendish account and crossed to the firm's account, to which it was credited on that day; and on January 31st ₤8,000 was paid out to Parr's Bank.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The ₤12,000 Consols appeared in the account in Mr. Jefferyes' time, and he received the dividends for them—June 26th was the date of the first sale of Consols Certificates, and June 30th the Consols; there had been sales of Consols before November 10th—of the six cheques I have referred to, there is only one signed by the prisoner; the other five are signed by George Lake—on the morning of November 10th, excluding the cheque for ₤9,000 odd, there was a balance to the credit of Lake &amp; Lake at the bank of ₤12.250 2s. 9d.</p>

I am a clerk at Child's Bank—we had an account there called "Benjamin Greene Lake, Frederick Cavendish account"—the prisoner was the only person who drew on that account—it was opened on November 3rd, 1898, by a payment of ₤3,208 odd, made by a draft on the other Cavendish account, called "Lake &amp; Lake Caven<lb/>dish account"—there was another payment in to the Frederick Cavendish account on November 26th, 1898, of ₤3,100—I do not know if that was by a draft on Lake &amp; Lake—the next credit to the Frederick Cavendish account was on December 1st, 1898, of ₤850, by a draft on Lake &amp; Lake; the next on December 9th, 1898, of ₤290 by a draft on Lake &amp; Lake; the next on December 21st, 1898, of ₤2,500 by the draft on Lake &amp; Lake, making a total of ₤9,948 2s. 8d. paid into the credit of the account—by December 22nd, 1898, ₤6,655 18s. 7d. had been drawn out of that account—on November 5th I find that ₤1,522 10s. had been drawn out in favour of H. R. Cox by this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), signed "B. G. Lake," and crossed "Selves"—the word "order" is crossed out, and initialled "B. G. L."—I should say the writing is the prisoner's—the same day the cheque was paid into the account which George Lake and his wife kept at our bank, paid in in consequence of our receiving this letter: "November 4th, 1898. Dear Sirs. Please place the enclosed cheque for ₤1,522 10s. to the credit of G.E.and A. E.

F. H. Cavendish, the brother—it is an "order" cheque, which has been altered to "bearer," which alteration is initialled "B. G. L."—in my opinion the writing is the prisoner's—it was paid into the Cavendish account; it is crossed to our bank—I cannot say whose writing the crossing is in—on November 28th, 1898, I find that ₤3,000 was drawn out of the Frederick Cavendish account by this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it is drawn in favour of H.W. Marley, and altered from "order" to "bearer," and initialled "B. G. L."—I should think the initials are in the prisoner's writing—it is crossed "to the credit of Lake &amp; Lake," and was paid in to the credit of the firm—on January 31st, 1899, ₤600 was drawn out of the Frederick Cavendish account by this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), altered in the same way, but not crossed—it was paid in to the account of Lake &amp; Lake—on February 21st, 1899, I find a further sum of ₤150 drawn out of</p>

               <p>the Frederich Cavendish account by this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) in favour of H. W.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The Lightning Express Syndicate never did any business—so far as we know, it was an abortive company—I do not know if in 1897 a Bill was introduced into Parliament for the purpose of making a railway between Manchester and Liverpool—I do not know if it was supported by gentlemen of influence in Manchester and Liverpool, or that it was thrown out of Parliament because the brake power was not sufficiently powerful—I do not know if it is going to be introduced again.</p>

The ₤15,000 of Mr. Frederick Cavendish was all received out of the moneys of Harry Cavendish—I cannot give the dates, but it was made up by, firstly, the bill for ₤360 which has been mentioned—the next amount was ₤6,000, received from H. S. Cavendish in the Cavendish account on October 8th, 1898—the next is ₤4,300, received on October 19th, paid out of the Harry Cavendish account at Child's Bank, into the account of Lake &amp; Lake—it is brought to the credit of Frederick Cavendish in Lake's books—the next item is on October 27th, ₤1,113 17s. 4d., which represents the purchase money of the Rathkeale stock—the balance of the ₤15,000 is made up by by the ₤3,208 2s. 8d. with which the account at Child's is opened; that was part of Harry Cavendish's account.</p>

               <p>remains—the ₤1,522 cheque does not come into the firm's account till the final balancing—the total amount paid out in debts was ₤888; that does not include the money paid to Cox &amp; Co.—there was altogether some<lb/>thing like ₤14,000 invested, I think—the advance of ₤5,500 to Burr is still in existence—Lord Donnington's is all paid off except ₤60—of the ₤4,300, ₤3,950 has been paid off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I believe the ₤5,500 was advanced in cash—I have seen no security given to Mr. Frederick Cavendish for it—it was trans<lb/>ferred on December 16th to Howard's trustees, which was some other estate for which Lake &amp; Lake were solicitors, and for which I think the prisoner was a trustee—I have not the papers in my custody; they are in the custody, of the new firm, and I have not seen them—a new firm was con<lb/>stituted in March last, before the bankruptcy, to whom the papers were assigned—the ledger of the firm shows the transfer charged to Howard's trustees—the ₤4,300 was an advance actually made, and was repaid by three instalments—in the list of temporary advances which have been made, the ₤500 to the Kent Colliery Corporation does not appear—it ought to, because subsequently there is an alleged repayment of the amount—it ought to appear in the Frederick Cavendish ledger, but it does not—the securities which Messrs. Bumpus, Bishop &amp; Co. have received include the Waltham mortgage, representing ₤2,300, and the ₤600 the Highgate charge—there is ₤65 in respect to Lord Donnington's mortgage—there is no security in respect to that; altogether about ₤4,096, which leaves a balance of over ₤10,000 to be accounted for—I have been through Mr. Cavendish's accounts, giving credit for all payments—I find there is still a balance of nearly ₤9,000 unaccounted for.</p>

I am a solicitor, and a son of the prisoner—I was articled to his firm—I know the mortgage of April 6th—the signature to the attestation clause is mine, but I have no recollection of signing it—on April 6th, the day on which the deed was executed, I was engaged in the afternoon with my father in going through a number of tenants' accounts and agreements relating to Mrs. Cavendish's estate, as he and I were going over a portion of the estate in Buckinghamshire—I first heard of the existence of the deed on December 4th or 5th—Mr. Cox brought it to me in the afternoon, in an envelope containing the mortgage, the draft, and the notices affecting the policies—the notices were drawn, but not signed; they were all in duplicate—in November, 1899, my father discussed the question of my going into the partnership; that was shortly after the death of George Lake—my father drew the articles, and gave them to me to read over and see if I could make any suggestions—I made some alterations and additions, and gave them back to him—I believed he was going to submit them to the third partner—the date of signing the articles was December 12th; on that day my father postponed the appointment; he did not give me any reason until the evening.</p>

E. Lake," and marked "Private"—Mr. Cox told me they were found behind a box, but I do not know if they were.</p>

I did live at 23, Venour Road—I now live at 24, Canal Road—the deceased was my wife; her name was Lucy—the prisoner was her first cousin—he came to live at 23, Venour Road, last April, when I was occupying the house with my wife and my little daughter Minnie, and there was occasionally there a child cousin,</p>

               <p>named Billings—when the prisoner first came we had lodgers on the first floor, Mr. and Mrs. Bennett; they only stayed a short time after the prisoner came—they were succeeded on the first floor by Mr. and Mrs. Baker—the prisoner came in May, I believe—the arrangement was for him to live there, he was not in work then, but he got work after that, but not continuously—he went away in September, I believe, to Tanbury North, to seek work—my relations with him were of a very friendly character—my wife and I and the little girl slept in one room on the ground floor, and the prisoner slept on the same floor—behind the kitchen ran the yard, and there were two or three steps leading to the prisoner's bedroom—you get to his bedroom by a passage, at one end of which is the front door, and the yard door at the other—my wife's relations with the prisoner were affectionate and friendly, and mine also—there was no quarrel of any kind—the prisoner drank lemonade, and, as far as I know, up to September he did not take any alcohol, and I never saw any sign of it—this letter is in my wife's writing, and is addressed to the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">Dated October 11th, 1900, stating that she was glad that he had arrived safely, but sorry he had not obtained work, and that they were quite willing that he should come back, and requested him to let them know when to expect him—Signed. "Your loving cousin, Lucy Smith"</hi>)—that represents our feeling towards him—he returned after that, and took up his residence—I think he was in work till November with the exception of two or three days—we never took any notice if he did not meet his payments—things went on so down to Monday, December 10th. Up to that morning there was the utmost affection and confidence between my wife and him—I went out to work on that day as usual, and came back about dinner time, about noon—as I entered I saw the prisoner coming downstairs, as though from the Bakers' room—he looked so strange that I said, "What does this mean?"—I cannot remember his answer, but he called me a miserable old b—; I had gone into the kitchen, and he took up a knife and held it over my head, and said that he would take one of our lives—he said that more than once—he gave no reason—he did not say that I had taken a cup of tea to Mrs. Burdett when she was a lodger in the house, but I have done so—he did not draw any inference from that—he did not mention anybody's name, that I am aware of—there was nothing in the smallest degree improper in my relations with Mrs. Burdett—he said to me, "I want a cup of tea"—I said, "I will make it for you"—he said, "Lucy shall make it," and called up to my wife to come downstairs—she was in Mrs. Baker's room—she came down at once, and put some water on the fire—I think I went out then, leaving them alone; I went back in two or three minutes, and she told him that if he did not leave off talking she would not make it—a short time afterwards she left the kitchen and went up to the Bakers' room, and the prisoner and I were left in the kitchen—he commenced making words again, but I do not remember what he said—he pushed me by the arm with his hands, and gave me a slap in the face, but said nothing—he took a knife again and lifted it up over my head, and said that he would have one of our lives—that second scene lasted up to dinner-time—he did not have <hi rend="italic">no</hi> dinner—there was no dinner through the upset—I did not go back to my work; I kept at home for my wife's protection—it struck me that he was very strange, and I</p>

"What does this mean?" pointing to the bottle with the spirit in it—I turned the key upon the outside of the door—I believe I took it out—he remained there that night, and was quiet—on the 11th I rose about 5.15 a.m.—as I passed his room door he asked for a drink of water—I took him some, unlocking the door—he wanted to know where Lucy was—I said that she was not in—as a fact, she did not stop there that night. She went to sleep at a cousin's in the Canal Road—that had been arranged after the prisoner had come back to the house—the prisoner only said he felt bad—I left him and went back to the room about 7 a.m.—I think I asked him if he would like a cup of tea, and he said, "Yes"—I fetched him a cup and gave it to him—then he said, "You had better bring Lucy round," or something to that effect, "and let us have it out, and bring all the witnesses you like"—I told him I did not want any witnesses—I said, "I will go and fetch her," and I went, to Canal Road, made some commu<lb/>nication to her, and we returned to Venour Road—she followed me into</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. &amp; F.R.C.P. I am senior physician to the Hospital for Paralysis and Epilepsy—I was asked by the Director of Public Prosecutions, to report what my opinion was of the state of the prisoner's sanity—I made myself acquainted with the history of the case; I also conferred with Dr. Scott, the medical officer of Holloway Gaol—I saw the prisoner on January 4th and 7th—I discovered no evidence what ever of insanity; he seemed to be suffering from no delusion; there was no history of epilepsy—my opinion was that his mind on December 15th was perverted from the effects of drink after a long abstinence and trouble combined—I think he would know the quality of any acts that he did—I saw nothing to make me think that he would not know that the act he had committed was wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first time I saw him was about three weeks after the crime—the only direct evidence I can give is from what I saw of him on January 4th and 7th—I looked out for any possibilities indicating insanity, not especially for delusions—I talked to him about his act—if there are any delusions they generally come out—I should say the act was the act of a man whose mind was perverted by insanity or by drink and trouble combined—I know the prisoner was accusing the husband of having improper relations with a Mrs. Burdett—I have seen the letter from the prisoner; I consider it unreasonable to a certain extent—I see that it does not make sense, but that bears out my supposition that his mind was confused by drink—I think he was under the influence of drink when the act was done to a certain extent—I do not mean he was drunk in the ordinary sense of the word, but that his mind had been altered and warped by the effects of drink; I think that, looking at his history and his mental condition, on the 15th his mind was not in its normal condition—there is insanity, quite apart from any delusions at all, which may take a homicidal course—it may come on and go off very suddenly—I do not know Dr. Luff's book on Medical Jurisprudence—I agree that changes take place—I do not understand what he means by "The first alteration is the change of temperament"—I agree that emotions change, and persons may acquire a dislike or hatred for persons they were formerly attached to, especially when the insanity comes on slowly—impulsive insanity is implied in cases where the patent is driven to acts of violence, he being for the time overpowered—the characteristic feature of that form of insanity is an uncontrollable impulse to take life, and the impulse is frequently directed to those who are dearest, but they do the act through some delusions; there must be insanity in the minds of persons doing acts like that, but I think there must be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190101070102"/>
               <p>delusions at the back of it, and there must be a motive—if a person has a bad disposition, that must be taken into consideration, and it was so by me—I think that the majority of cases in which the persons give them<lb/>selves up and confess to the crime are cases in which the act has been committed by an insane person—syphilis may be the cause of insanity if it affects the brain—I know the prisoner has been complaining of pains in his head, and I know he was discharged from the Marines suffering from syphilis, which had not been cured—syphilis was apparently the cause of the insanity of his uncle—if a man with a tendency to insanity in his family leads a sober and quite life, he may get through life without it developing—there have been cases in which people undoubtedly insane have committed crimes, although no trace of delusions has been found—I remember the case of Dr. Powell—I saw him at Broadmoor—no trace of insanity was found in him—I know Dr. Savage's book—I agree that in impulsive insanity there is oftentimes very little to be found wrong with the patient before or after a crime has been committed, but I believe careful investigation would always show that there was a change.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have made a special study of insanity for something like 35 years, three years at Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum, where I was assistant medical superintendent—I always make an absolutely impartial inquiry—I should be unwilling to accept an act as an insane act in which no trace of insanity could be found either before or after.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said in my report, "His impulsive nature"—I meant that he has a strong and violent temper—I have heard what sort of life he has led and of his family history; that would all tend to his impulsiveness—I have heard Dr. Bastian's evidence—I agree that an attack of insanity may come on and go without leaving any marked symptoms—I agree in the main with Dr. Bastian—I do not think that impulsive insanity has frequently a homicidal tendency—I should expect to find the prisoner with a bad family history—unusual violence in a crime like this would lead me to look very carefully for insanity; the presumption would be in favour of it, and assuming that there is an absence of motive, it would raise a similar presumption.</p>

                  </hi>(<hi rend="italic">Detective, V</hi>). On November 17th I went with Sergeant Gough to arrest the prisoners—I took charge of Maloney—outside the door Maloney's wife called across to Mrs. Barley, who lives opposite "What time did my husband come home on Thursday night?"—she said "About seven, to the best of my memory"—then Mrs. Maloney drew her attention to the fact that he was at home about five—at the Police Court Mrs. Barley said it was 5 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When Maloney was told the charge he said, "I had a drink with his brother Jim in the Spread Eagle"—he did not say what time he got home—I signed my deposition, which says in it, "I was at home at 5 o'clock"—I know there is an order issued by the Commissioner that police officers should make a note of what prisoners say—I did not comply with that order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Maloney, in his defence, on oath, said that he was in the Spread Eagle with the prosecutors brother, Battershell and Vicars; that they had all had too much drink; that he came out of the public-house, having the prosecutor inside, and went home, where he arrived about 4.50; and that he knew nothing about the assault and robbery.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Battershell, in his defence, on oath, said that he was in the public-house with the prosecutor, who was very drunk; that they came out, when Maloney went home; that he and the prosecutor went into the Ram public-house, and from there to the Prince Alfred; that the landlord would not serve them, and asked him to take the prosecutor outside; that he took him about 20 yards down the street, but, as he kept stumbling, he left him lying on the ground 40 or 50 yards from North Place; that he did not go to North Place with the prosecutor, or rob him.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Battershell and the prosecutor went in the direction of Wharf Road—I was first asked anything about this case on the Saturday night following—I knew the prosecutor had bad an accident to his leg—he was not lame when he came into my place—he was more intoxicated than Battershell.</p>
