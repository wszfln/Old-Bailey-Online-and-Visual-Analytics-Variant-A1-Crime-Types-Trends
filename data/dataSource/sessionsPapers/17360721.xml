             and Mr. Green were sitting in her Chariot. I stop'd to look at her, and in a very few Minutes, I found my Sword was taken from my side. I don't know the Prisoner, nor can I swear he took it; but missing my Sword, I cry'd out - Sword lost - stop Thief; the Mob set out and run beyond Temple-Bar, I run after them, and the Prisoner was taken at the Ship Tavern. I asked him if he had got my Sword, he said no. Sir, says I, have you given it any Body? No, says he. What made you run away then? He said he did not run away. It was pretty late and we could not find a Magistrate; so I charged a Constable with him, and carried him to the Compter. The next Day I carried him before the Lord Mayor. John Smith will give you farther Evidence.</p>

               <p>The Night the Fact was committed, the Dutchess of Marlborough was in her Coach at the middle Temple Gate: I stood by the Prosecutor to see her, and observed the Prisoner draw the Sword from his side, and could have detected him before he had quite drawn it out; but a Man (one of his Gang I suppose) clapp'd me on the Shoulder, and asked me whose Coach that was; I told him whose it was, and before I could turn again, the Prisoner was gone, and the Mob was running after him. He ran thro' the Bar, and was taken at a Chymist's Door, one of the Houses that was burnt down. This was on Friday, July 9. about 10 o'Clock at Night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baugh. I should have told your Lordship, that the Sunday following, I was informed a Person came, while I was at Church, to offer me my Sword again.</p>

               <p>Mr. Baugh. I did ask, when the Prisoner was taken, if any Body could tell who took my Sword, and Smith only said, he saw the Prisoner run without the Bar; he did not inform me that he saw him take it, 'till next Morning.</p>
               <p>Smith. I live by St. George's Church in Southwark, and having so far to go home that Night, I was afraid, if I discovered the whole Matter that Night, that I should be mis-used in my way Home by some of his Gang; this was the Reason I did not tell the Gentleman till next Morning: He laid hold of me at Sir William Billers's Office that Night.</p>

I pursued her, and took her in the Little Minories Gate way, and brought her back; then we got a Constable and carry'd her before a Justice, and at the Bull Head in Bread street, she said, if my Master would be favourable, she would tell us where the Ribbon was, and according to her Directions, we found it hid behind some Shutters, which stand under that Gate-way.

               <p>Thomas Wiseham. The Prisoner came to my Shop, on Monday, April 5, between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon. I was full of Customers, so she told me she would stay till I had served the Ladies. After they were gone, she came up to the Compter, and said she wanted some printed Borders and printed Linnen; she bid me a Trifle for what I shewed her, and asked me for a little Beer. As she appeared well dress, I took a glass Mug, and went down my self to draw her some Beer; she met me at the Top of the Cellar stairs, drank the Beer and I asked her if she would have any more she curt'sied and said, if I pleased she would. I went down again, and gave her Beer the second time, which she drank, and then went out of the Shop as fast as she could, without buying any thing, but before she went, she told me if I thought she had robbed me I might search her. I told her she appeared to me to be another sort of a Woman. As soon as she was gone I missed the Borders. They are particular Things which none in England have besides myself D - her says I to my Brother, the Bitch has stollen them; I looked out after her, but she was gone.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday she came again, I was not at Home, but my Brother came to fetch me Home. Madam, says I, your humble Servant. You are mistaken Sir says she, I have not been at your Shop before, it was my Sister, we are very much alike. She said she wanted half a yard of Linnen, but she had left the Pattern at Home, and would fetch it. Three of us followed her that we might see where she lived, but we lost her. On the Friday the Week following, she came again for some Borders, and two Women were with her, she bid me a Price, which she said she had given me for the same things before. Then she asked me, what was become of the Borders that hung up when she was there before; Madam, says I, I will make you know you have robbed me of them, and sent for a Constable; she fell on her Knees, and begged me for God's Sake not to prosecute her, if I did, I should ruin an honest Man, who had been her Husband sixteen years. Some of my Borders she had sold to Mrs. Drake of Bow, who shew'd me them, and told me, she bought them of Mrs. Nutton.</p>
               <p>The Roll I lost came from the Printer's but the Saturday before; the Cambrick was worth 4 l. 10s. - and this I never found.</p>

               <p>Mahon. Don't say so my Dear, - don't tell that Lye.</p>
               <p>Gould. I was pretty merry, and though I never saw her before, I went up one pair of Stairs, at one Mrs. Maxwell's, and says I, I have got no Money to satisfy you; well, well, says she, no matter for that I was not so much in Liquor as she thought me to be; she thought I suppose, I could not miss my Watch.</p>
               <p>We went into a Room where there was a Bed, and she fell immediately to opening the Waistband of my Breeches. I asked her what she meant by that? O says she my Dear, nothing, - I will please you, I'll please you; and she picked the Watch out of my Fob, and run down Stairs as fast as she could. I cried out to the Woman below, who was with her Daughters in the Passage to stop her, for I had lost my Watch, but she got off; and I waited in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173607210005"/> House from that Time 'till Eight the next Morning.

               <p>Q. Had you ever been at this House before?</p>
               <p>Gould. Yes, my Lord, I had been there once before.</p>
               <p>Q. What, is it a Publick House?</p>
               <p>Gould. No, 'tis not a Publick House; 'tis a House where they keep such Women.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a Bawdy House?</p>
               <p>Gould. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you say you have been there before, don't you?</p>
               <p>Gould. Yes, once before.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew what the House was, yet you must go there.</p>
               <p>Gould. I did. So when Shepperd came in, the Woman of the House told him his Wife had done a fine Thing; she has pick'd this Gentleman's Pocket of a Gold Watch; and, says Shepperd, what Business had he with my Wife, I did not meddle with your Wife, says I, only she has been so good as to run away with my Watch; if you'll let me have it again I'll give you half a Guinea. He said, he would go and see if he could find her, and in a little Time he return'd with a Butcher of St. James's Market, and said, she was not to be found; then they went out again, and returned no more that Night.</p>
               <p>Mahon. I beg my Lord he may turn his Face to me. I would ask you on the Vertue of your Oath, whether you did not insist upon going up into my Chamber? Whether, as I was standing at the Door you did not ask me what it was a Clock? Whether I did not tell you, it was Time for you to be at Home, and whether you did not say, my Dear I'll not go Home 'till I've seen your Apartment? I told you, I did not live there; you said I did; why, said you, is not this Rosy? I stepp'd up, and he follow'd me.</p>
               <p>Gould. My Lord, she ask'd me to go up Stairs.</p>
               <p>Council. I would ask you, Sir, whether you never declared to any one, that you gave her the Watch?</p>
               <p>Gould. No. I never gave it her, nor did she ever ask for it, she was not so good as to ask me, she took it without asking I thank God I never was in such a Scrape as this before.</p>
               <p>Mahon. I desire he may be asked, if he did not tell me he had no more than 9d in his Pocket, and whether he did not give that to my Maid?</p>
               <p>Gould. She took the 9 d. herself.</p>
               <p>Mahon. But I gave my Maid your 9 d.</p>

Sheppard took the Lodging in my House in Coventry Court for him and his Wife, and he never lay out of the House 'till this 28th of June; then Sheppard came in while the Gentleman was in my House, and he said, if his Wife had done such a Thing he would cut her Nose off, and that he would go and see for her; but he went up to his Room, and carried off all the Goods.</p>
               <p>Council. Had you any Discourse with Mr Gould that Night?</p>
               <p>Maxwell. He sat all Night in my Room, we must say something to be sure. As to the Watch, I have nothing to do with it: he told me, she had run away with it. He came to my House about 9 a Clock.</p>
               <p>- Council He says it was 10.</p>
               <p>Maxwell. God bless me; - then the Bells don't go right about; it must be but 9, because when he cry'd out upon the Stairs, Watch, Watch, I answer'd, what, Watch call'd at 9 a Clock!

I had cut out a Suit for Mr. Gordon, and delivered it to the Prisoner to finish, and went out about some Business, and when I came Home again, English was gone out; I went to look for him, that my Work might be finish'd in Time, but could not find him. I returned Home, and my Wife told me my Man was come to work again. I went up Stairs into my Work Room, and my other Man told me that English had carried out the Cloaths he was about. On Saturday Morning he sent me Word where the Goods were pawn'd: I got a Search-Warrant, and found all the Things at Mr. Yarp's in Hounsditch; and took the Prisoner at Globe-Stairs by Ratcliffe-Cross, and carried him before Justice Priestly, where he owned he took the Things.</p>

            . I went with a Search-Warrant to the House where Wilson said I might find the Prisoner, and there we found a Chest which he and another Man had brought, but they were gone to the other side of the Water: Wilson's Wife was with them, and they were all going to New-England together. We went over the Water and took them; and before the Justice he owned he took the Goods for Money that the Prosecutor owed him, and the Justice committed him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Master owed me 20 s. for Wages, and I could not get the Money; I thought it hard as I was going to Boston, to leave so much Money behind me, so I pawn'd these Things and sent him Word next Day where they were. I have not any Witnesses, for I gave all my Money to one Mac - something, a Newgate Solicitor, to manage my Cause, and he is run away with the Money and has done nothing.</p>

            . The 24th of June I had been out, and when I returned I found Seymour standing at my Door; he told me he was robb'd by these Irish Villains, and bid me see if I had not been robb'd too. I went up Stairs and found my Door fast, but he perswaded me to break it open, (for my Wife had carried away the Key) and we did so, and found the Things all gone, and my Wife too The Things mentioned in the Indictment, were in a Chest, and were brought some Time before, as a Pledge for four Guineas which my Wife had made me lend the Prisoner. We had heard of their Design of running away together to New England, so we went to the New England Coffee-House and got Intelligence where to take them there we found the Chest, but they were gone over the Water: We got a Waterman who said he'd give us leave to crop him if he did not take them; we followed his Advice, and took them, but the Justice let two of them go. He own'd the Chest was in his Custody, but he said he did not take it out of my Room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That very Day, he had sold his Wife at the George on Tower Hill, for a Pot of Beer, to the Man she ran away with, and I was present. He half starved her, and turned her out of Doors, so we agreed to go to New England, and she took her Cloaths with her, and this Chest of mine that was at their House; for the Man she ran away with, was a Friend of mine. He swore the Robbery against his Wife.</p>

            . My Master's House was robbed the 19th of June: In the Morning I went into the Laundry and miss'd two Handkerchiefs. When my Master and Mistress went to Breakfast, I miss'd 2 Tea Spoons. When he was taken up we miss'd the Knives and Forks, and a large Spoon, and a Cane out of the little Parlour. The Prisoner using to go of Errands and clean Knives we suspected him, and before the Justice he owned the Fact, and that he came over the Wall into the Yard. I went up with the Former Witness, (our House-keeper) to Bed that Night, and am sure the Kitchen Door was latch'd. The Study Door I lock'd myself, and left the Key in the Door.</p>

               <p>Edward Berry. I had taken 100 l. and clapped it down in a great Chair in the Chamber, about the 10th or 11th of June I think it was. I thought my Wife would have look'd it up, but she forgot it. Some Time after, the Monday after (I believe) she said she did not remember she had lock'd up the 100 l. up Stairs we went, and saw the Bag in the Chair, but there was seven Guineas taken out. We had heard where the Prisoner had been merry-making, and where she had spent a great deal of Money; so my Wife challenged her with taking these Guineas; she told us several different Stories, and we concluded to take her up. At first she denied the Fact, then she confest she took six Guineas, but would not tell what became of the other. She owned at another Time, that my Wife was going to pay a Chapman, and her Hands being grease, while she went into the Yard to wash them, she took ten Guineas, and two Guineas out of a Closet, while the Bed was making. I asked her, if none of her Acquaintance had been in my House, she said yes; and that they had tried by a pick Lock Key to open my Drawers; but it not doing, if she had not been found out, she was to have had a whole Bunch the next Day, and then they should have taken all they found.</p>
               <p>The Constable. Her Mistress said she would not hurt her if she would confess, and she owned in my Hearing she took six Guineas.</p>
               <p>Defence. I am innocent; my Master and Mistress said they would not hurt me, if I would confess I took the Money. <rs id="t17360721-22-verdict114" type="verdictDescription">

After this, they talked of taking us out of the Coach, I said they had got all we had, and away they went. I told the Watch and the Neighbourhood we had been robbed, and they pursued them, and that Man at the Bar was taken. Next Morning he was carried before the Lord Carpenter and Justice Ray, at Hanover-Square, and they bound him over. I can't take on me to say he was one of the three, for it was past 11 o'Clock at Night. He was taken by the Description we gave of the Robbers, that they were little Fellows, young, and unused to that Way. They were very civil, no Oaths nor Swearing, but, Gentlemen if you don't deliver, we must take you out of the Coach.</p>

We were attack'd by three Foot pads, one held a Pistol to my Breast and demanded my Money; I gave him a Guinea and some Silver, I cannot be positive how much, nor can I swear to the Prisoner. He who took the Money from us, went a little Distance and made a Speech, telling us, as they had not done us an Injury, and a Necessity obliged them to do what they did, he hoped we would not pursue them: but his Companions call'd him away, and bid the Coachman drive on. By the Description we gave to the Watchmen, the Prisoner was taken, and carried next Morning before the Lord Carpenter, at the Vestry-Room, in Hanover Square, and sent from thence to Prison.</p>

            . I was going past 11 o'Clock, and a Gentleman came up, and sud, he was afraid of being robbed, there were three Foot-pads had stopped a Coach in the Road. He said one of them had on a Checquer'd Shirt, dark brown Cloaths, and a flapped Hat. I ordered the other Watchman to put out his Light, thinking if they saw our Lights, they would not come near us. In about a quarter of an Hour they came down the Road, I stooped down, that they might not see me; so, says I, they are coming, to my Companion, and as soon as the Prisoner came up to us, I seized him fast by the Breast; but while we were attacking him, the other two got off. We went up to the Turn-pike to see what Coach it was that had been robbed, and we found it was the Sissiter ( Cirencester ) Coach, so we went to the Bell-Savage Inn, and found out Mr. Hussey. I did not see the Coach attack'd, for it was not near the Houses, but so much as it was described upon him ( according to the Description) he must be the Man. He had these Surgeon's Instruments about him, and this Stock.</p>

            . I am a Watchman. We had an Account of this Coach being robbed by three Foot Pads; two of them were described very plainly, by a Man who jumped down from behind it, when the Fact was committed; so we stopped the Prisoner at the Bar, and the others ran away. He was searched at the Lodge at the Park Gate; we found some Money upon him, but not much, and two or three Shagreen Cases to hold Lancers, and this Stock, but I did not see any Gold about him. The Robbery was committed about half a Mile beyond my Stand.</p>

            . The Prisoner used to bring things to pawn, and fetched them out again; I thought she had been entrusted by Adderson with the things, and that it could not be a Felony. She pawned them with me in her own Name; here's a List of them. April 12, an Apron for 1 s. April 22, a Cap for 1 s. May 24, an Apron for 1 s. March 4, a Cloak for 4 s. April 16, an Apron for 1 s. The 17th or 18th of May, a Suit of Pinners for half a Crown. February 7, an Apron half a Crown. May 19, a Cap 4 d. May 15, a Petticoat 8 d. May 1, a Handkerchief 8 d. April 28, five Napkins 3 s. May 12, a Handkerchief 6 d. May 13, a piece of Stuff 4 d. The same Day a Mob 8 d. May 5, a pair of Stays 9 s. May 20, a Petticoat 7 s. 6 d. May 24, a Quilt 14 s. 9 d. and with this 14 s. 9 d. she redeemed two Spoons of Mrs. Adderson's; so by that I took it she was entrusted with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you entrust the Prisoner to pawn Goods for you?</p>
               <p>Adderson. No.</p>

               <p>Adderson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the Pawn-broker is mistaken in his Law. You ought not to have received these Goods, without knowing what Authority she had to pawn them, and you are very faulty in taking them in.</p>
               <p>Dorman. Here are other Things in the List of Mrs. Addersons, which the Prisoner brought to our House. She always pawn'd them in her own Name; and when I asked her any Questions, she always said she was sent.</p>

            . Between one and two o'Clock in the Morning, July 6, the Prisoner came with the Mare to my Master's House: He called me up, and ordered her a Feed of Corn; I live at the Barley Mow, near Kent street Turnpike. I unlocked the Stable Door, and turn'd her in. He told me he had rid 60 Miles since 10 o'Clock last Night: I felt under the Saddle, and the Mare was but just warm; she was not heated at all, so I thought it impossible he should have come so far. He asked me to let him go to bed, and I let him lie in my Bed with my two little Children. In the Morning, when the Children got up, he sent them down Stairs to order another Feed of Corn; and while they were gone, he opened my Box, which was in the Chamber, robbed me of my Money and Watch, and then he went away with the Mare.</p>

I and several of our People made all the search we could after him, in order to retake him. On the Saturday before, he was brought down to this Court to receive fresh Judgment. After several Enquiries, I was informed, that one Germane a Smith, was sent for, to take his Fetters off, by Shelton: she confessed before my Lord-Mayor, that she harboured him, and she set her Name or her Mark to her Confession.</p>

She saith, that while she was in the Room, his Wife enquired how he made his Escape; he told her that pulling out a Knife, he loosened a Stone, and raised it with a Link of his Fetters; that he then went through into the Funnel, and let the Stone fall; that he stuck fast in the Funnel, and with Difficulty fell into the Common Shore; that when he got out of the Shore, he hid himself in an Engine, while the People that pursued passed by.</p>

            . On Whitsun-Monday at Night, my Servant had been out of an Errand, and he came home, and said, he had seen Malden. You Blockhead, says I, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173607210014"/> have heard an old Woman's Story: No Master, say, he, I have really seen him, and another said he had seen him. Lord bless me, says I, if so many People have seen him, I will go see him my self. I went to Malden's Wife's Room and there I saw a Man sitting, with three or four Women round about him: and while I was there he put up his Legs, and pulled up, (as I thought) his Trowsers; but it seems they were the sleeves of his striped Jacket. This was in White's Yard, in Rosemary Lane: I cannot say whose House it was; I believe it was the Lodging of one of his Wive's: The Woman they call Malden's Wife, lives in that Room where I saw him. I did not know him, nor should I know him again if I was to see him; but I believe it was he, because I saw the Fetters upon his Legs, and the Rivets of a prodigious Bigness, and the great Links of the Chain, and the great Rivets. I cannot say I saw Shelton the Prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston. You told me this very Day, that she was there.</p>
               <p>Cooper. Well, I believe she was there. I knew the Woman before; I knew her vastly well; I live just by her in White's Yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Women were in the Room when you went in?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I cannot be positive how many.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any of them?</p>
               <p>Cooper. Yes, this Woman (the Prisoner) was in the Room; she was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why do you say, you do not know that she was there?</p>
               <p>Cooper. My Lord, I am cautious of hurting any Body.</p>
               <p>Q. But won't you take care not to hurt your self? now you say she was there.</p>
               <p>Cooper. Yes; My Lord, she was there indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasion'd his taking up his Trowsers?</p>
               <p>Cooper. He took them up in a Bravado, and laugh'd. I am sure I should know him again, because I saw two of his Teeth in the upper Part of his Mouth broke out.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be admitted into the House?</p>
               <p>Cooper. Several People told me they had seen him, and thinks I, this is an idle Fellow, I will go see him too. And they omitted ( admitted ) me into the House, and into the very Room where he was Mrs. Humphries, who lives there sometimes, said, I might go in, and see him, she knocked at the Door, and said - here is Mr. Cooper, so they let me in, and he shewed the Irons on his Legs in a Bravado, and laugh'd and said, he had more about him here, (putting his Hands on his Wast) a great many more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nichols. Please to ask Mr. Cooper, if he has not seen Malden in the Prisoner's Apartment; he has told the same thing to me.</p>
               <p>Cooper. It was the Wife's Room, that I saw him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the Prisoner live?</p>
               <p>Cooper. In the same House, I believe; but I won't be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever in any Room with the Prisoner Shelton?</p>
               <p>Cooper. Once or twice, I have been in a Room of hers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her Room in the same House?</p>
               <p>Cooper. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston. My Lord, he owned to me, that he had seen Malden, in the Prisoner's Room.</p>
               <p>Cooper. Yes, my Lord, I have been informed, it was Shelton's Room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Shelton live?</p>
               <p>Cooper. Next Door to where I saw Malden, the Houses communicate, only there is a little Row of Pales between.</p>
               <p>Germane. On Whitsun-Monday, I was drinking at the Corner of White's Yard, at 12 o'Clock at Night; the prisoner Shelton came and called me out privately. She asked me, if she might put her Life into my Hands? I was shocked, and asked her what she meant? Can I trust you, says she? I do not know, says I; why then, says she, Malden has made his Escape out of Jayl, will you come and take his Fetters off? No, says I, not for an hundred Pounds; I won't wrong my Conscience, my King, nor my Country. She found I would not answer her Ends; and she desired,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173607210015"/> if I would not do it, I would not betray him. I told her, I would not be concerned with any of them; and away I went home to bed, and came not out again, till next Morning.</p>
               <p>Temperance Germane, confirm'd the above Evidence</p>
               <p>Defence. The 14th of June, at Night, I was a Bed, and a Woman who uses Newgate-Market came up and said there was a sad Up roar; for Malden was got out again. Pshaw says I, 'tis impossible, but a Woman that I give 12 d. a Week to, to look after my Children while I am out, comes and says to me, there's Malden gone up Stairs: with that, says I, if God gives me Leave, I'll go and see him; when I came up, he was eating Pig, and he asked me to eat with him, - No, no, says I, eat it yourself. His Wife said, Oh! Daniel, how did you get out? and he put his Hand to his Pocket, and pulled out a Knife, by means of which he loosened a Stone, and put his Fetters in, to take it up; then he went down the Funnel, and there he said he stuck; but God brought him through it. How will you get your Irons off, says his Wife? I will go, says I, to Germane's and get him to take them off; but he refused, and I went back and told them he would not do it: G - d d - n you all says he, you want me to stay and be taken; with that he went down Stairs, with his Irons on, and I have never seen him since <rs id="t17360721-34-verdict161" type="verdictDescription">

We shall produce a Clergyman, who married two People in the Names of Robert Hussey and Sarah Seaton, and shall prove that they co-habited together some Years, and the Children were looked on as the legitimate Issue of this Marriage.</p>
               <p>Dr. Gainham. The 9th of September, 1733. I married a Couple at the Rainbow-Coffee-house the Corner of Fleet-Ditch, and entered the Marriage in my Register. As fair a Register as any Church in England can produce. I shewed it last Night to the Fore-man of the Jury, and my Lord Mayor's Clerk, at the London Punch-House.</p>
               <p>Reads.</p>
               <p>Robert Hussey, of St. James's Westminster, Batchelor; and Sarah Setyon of St. Martin's in the Fields, Spinster. - As fair a Register as any Church can produce, and 'tis all my own Hand-writing. The Persons I won't swear to. This Certificate is all my Writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you the Names of these People?</p>
               <p>Dr. Gainham. The Man gives always the Names of both, and the Parishes where they live. A Spinster, is as much as to say a single Woman.</p>
               <p>Council. Are not you ashamed to come and own a clandestine Marriage in the Face of a Court of Justice?</p>
               <p>Dr. Gainham. (Bowing) Video meliora, deteriora sequor.</p>
               <p>Council. Do you know any Thing of it, But by that Paper?</p>
               <p>Dr. Gainbam. Yes, I'll swear to my Register: 'tis as fair a Register as any Church in England can show you. This Paper is a Copy from my Register, and I examined it by my Register.</p>
               <p>Q. You are on your Oath: I ask you whether you never enter Marriages in that Book, when there's no Marriage at all?</p>
               <p>Gainbam. I never did in my Life. I page my Book so, that it cannot be altered, and all Marriages are put down Alphabetically, that I can very readily find them.</p>
               <p>Council. Pray who directed you, to shew that Paper to the Fore-man of the Jury?</p>
               <p>Gainham. My own common Judgment, Sir: because I thought I could not be here to Day.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever question them about it? Had you ever any Doubt of it?</p>
               <p>Whittle. He was about to leave her, and I perswaded him to stay; and told him, it was the Part of every honest Man to stay with his Wife and Children; then he said he was not married. I told him then he should not live in my House; I would go and see whether he was or not. I went, and this Gentleman (Dr. Gainham) remembered the Marriage, and I saw the Register fair and clear; I came home and told him I had seen the Register, and he said he knew that before I went. I was God-father to his Children, and with his own Mouth, he ordered one of them to be registered.</p>

            . I was the Mother of the first Wife; her Name was Elenor Brothers; she was married to the Prisoner at St. Martin's Tabernacle: I saw them married, and her Father gave her away; she died, March was two Years ago. I do not remember who married them, for I have been out of my Senses since that Time.</p>
               <p>The 16th Day of September, she was in the 10th Year of her Marriage, and she has been dead above two Years. I think she died in March.</p>
               <p>Council. And their Marriage was in September 1733, then she must have been alive at the same Time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she live with this Man?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brothers. Yes, 8 Years, but at last they did not agree, and so they parted. I went and carried my Daughter to her, and told her, (Seaton) that this was Mr. Hussey's Wife. This second Marriage broke my poor Daughter's Heart, and made me run out of my Senses.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you hear the Prisoner at the Bar was married to this Girl, (Seaton) before your Daughter's Death?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brothers. Yes, yes, this Girl told me she was married to him; and my Daughter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173607210018"/> liv'd 2 Years after that. My Daughter and I went twice to her; the first Time she did not tell me she was married; but the second she did, and that she was married at St. Brides.</p>
               <p>Council. We have prov'd he was married to these 2 Women, in Court; now the Proof they would set up, is, that he was married before, and antecedent to each of these Marriages; that he had a Wife when he married the Woman first mentioned in the indictment, and therefore that this Marriage was void.</p>
               <p>Council. I did object that here was no positive Evidence of the first Marriage mentioned in the Indictment; and I do say, I don't remember any Case, where on this Act of Parliament, circumstantial Proof was ever given in Evidence, without there was some positive Evidence likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. If the Prisoner confess'd his Marriage, is that circumstantial Evidence?</p>
               <p>Council. I objected it was not sufficient for this Reason: It has been too licentious a Custom for People to live together, who have never been married; and they call one another my Dear and my Wife, and if you ask whether they are married, yes to be sure, they'll tell you; they would not expose, and bring a scandal upon themselves. But on this Act, it being a Felony, what I submit to the Court is, whether there ought not to be some solid Proof in this Case. This was not a Marriage Facie Eclesia, but a Fleet Marriage, and should be prov'd either by some Body who gave her away, or who saw the Book opened and read, 'tis not sufficient I think without some solid Proof of this Kind; but your Lordship thinks it sufficient Evidence to be left to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Council. The first Marriage (in the Indictment) if it is to be made void, must be annulled by an Ecclesiastical Censure; this has not been done, it has not been voided by an Ecclesiastical Censure, therefore the Marriage is good.</p>

            . I made my self a voluntary Evidence against the Prisoners, intending to go to Sea, and get away from them. A pretty while after Christmas, Pritchard asked me to take a walk with him, and he and I, and Morris went to Hoxton, about 12 o'Clock at noon; we viewed Allen's House, and Pritchard said, this is a proper House, we can get in here. Then we went to the Farthing Pye-house, and drank two Full Pots; about 11 o'Clock at night we went to Allen's again, and staid about the House 'till 12. We found the Doors lock'd and fast, but with a ripping Chissel and a Knife, I made way to open the Pin of the Window; then we wrenched the Shutter down, and finding the Sashes nailed, I forced one of them up my self. Then says Pritchard, D - n me, who will go in; one was afraid, and t'other was afraid; keep a good look out, says I, and I will go in: They said, if any body came by, they would cry, Hyp. I got in, and unbolted the Door, then I handed out three Porridge Pots, one of them had three Feet on the bottom; six Sauce-pans, they were Copper, I believe, and as soon as we had got them, we carried them to the Prisoner Eades, three Pewter Dishes, a Velvet Cap, and a Natural Wig; we put them into a Flower-bag, and thinking we heard a Noise, we got out, and went off. I put the Cap and Wig in my Pocket; Pritchard and Morris put the rest of the Things into the Bag, as I handed them out. Then we made the best of our way, and took spell and spell, turn and turn to carry them to Rag-Fair, and we got there between two and three; from thence we went to Salt-Peter Bank, to a Glass-house, which is tumbled down, and we hid the Things under the Rubbish, and stow'd Bricks upon them.

I asked her, if she would sell them for us, and told her, we had stole them; she said, she knew a Case, where she could dispose of such Things; so I gave her the three Porridge-pots, and the six Sauce-pans, to another Woman who was with her. They went away together, and came back for the Dishes; we gave them the Dishes directly, and then they went away, and brought us 25 s. G - d d - m your Blood, you B - ch, says, Pritchard to Eades, have you brought us no more? she said, no, she could not get any more. About two o'Clock that Afternoon, I sold the Wig, and the Cap for half a Crown each, which made just 30 s. together, and Eades had 4 s. for her Trouble; 2 s. we spent upon her, and divided 8 s. a piece. The 2 s. we spent at an Irish Man's at Salt-Peter Bank, at the Sign of the Hoop: After this, I did not see them for a matter of four Months.</p>
