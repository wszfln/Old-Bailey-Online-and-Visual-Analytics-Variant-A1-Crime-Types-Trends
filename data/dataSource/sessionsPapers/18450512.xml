I kept the house at the time this happened, and occupied it—the prisoner came into my service about the 7th of May, and left on the 27th of March, she came for her keys about ten o'clock in the morning of the 29th of March—I and my wife were then going out—we left her in the passage with her things, and told her to take them, and shut the door after she came out—we left her in the house alone—two boys were waiting outside to assist her with her boxes, as she said—I and my wife returned about half-past eleven at night—the house had been left above twelve hours—I found a candle in the passage—I trod on</p>

               <p>–it—it corresponded with the candles in my kitchen—I struck a light, went down stairs, and found the back door merely on the latch—I had left it barred and bolted—the prisoner had no occasion to undo it to go out, she should merely draw the front door to after her—I went up stairs, and found a bunch of keys hanging in my bed-room door—they did not belong to the house—the drawers were open, some linen turned out, and some articles stolen—I misted a quantity of plate and other articles—I have found several knives, a coat, two rings, a necklace, and two or three other articles—the bed-room is the only room I found open—the other rooms were locked, as I had left them—I had left the bed-room door locked, and put the key in the clock, and had the key of the clock in my pocket—the plate was taken from the bed-room drawers—everything was taken from the bed-room—I have seen a pair of stockings which were found on the prisoner's legs—I do Dot know when I had seen them last, as I only wore them in the summer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney of the Four Courts, Dublin, but practising in London, as a parliamentary and Irish agent; I came to England for that purpose about three years ago; I was admitted an attorney at Dublin; I live at No. 9, Pall-mall East. On the 26th of March last, I was in possession of two pro<lb/>missory notes, one for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and another for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received them from Mr. Thomas Holbrook Coyle—I gave 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at two notes produced by Mr. Mytton</hi>)—these are the two promissory notes upon which I advanced the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—while they were in my possession, I was informed that Willis had called on me—I then called on him—I think it was on the afternoon of the 26th or 27th of March—I met him coming out of his door—he said, "I was just going to call upon you, Mr. Hearne"—he said, "I understand you have got some bills of Mr. Myt<lb/>ton's; I have got a friend who is desirous to invest 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the discount of Mr. Mytton's paper;" and he added, "If you wish to have those bills</p>

               <p>discounted, I shall be glad to get them done for you"—I tben told him that I held two bills, amounting to 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which I had given valuable consideration, and I produced to him this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—directed Edmund L. Hearn, Esq., 9, Pall-mall East—"16, Great Marlborough-street, 15th March, 1845: Sir, Mr. Coyle has this day handed us the proceeds, less discount, as agreed upon, of two promissory notes, of John Mytton, Esq., of Aston, Warwickshire, dated 10th March; amount 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. We remain, sir, your obedient servants, <hi rend="smallCaps">SMITH</hi> and Co.")—I had before that done business with those persons on account of Coyle—I asked Willis the terms—he said he would see his friend—I then intrusted him with the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, in consequence of the representation he made, that he had a friend who was anxious to have Mr. Mytton's paper—he appointed to call at my residence next morning at eleven o'clock—he did not come till the afternoon—he then said that his friend would give 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the two bills—I asked, did that include his commission—he said, "No"—I asked what he would expect—he said he would leave that to myself—I then said I would give him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his commission—he said, "No, you must make it 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Very well"—he then said, "Well, I shall bring you the money to<lb/>morrow morning, between eleven and twelve"—I handed him the second bill at that interview, for the purpose of his friend advancing the money on it, as he stated—I was at home next morning—Willis never came, or anybody on his behalf, with the money—I have never been able since to get possession of the bills—I have endeavoured to do so—next day I saw Willis at his own chambers—I asked why he had not called on me—he said he was waiting, expecting his friend every moment with the money, and the very moment he brought the money, he would bring it down to my chambers to me—on the following" day I received a communication from Dr. Ryan—I then called on Willis again—he repeated the same story, that he was waiting for his friend, and I said I thought it was rather strange there should be any delay, inasmuch as his friend, as he had repre<lb/>sented to me, had agreed to the terms before he had the bills—he replied, people did not like to part with so large a sum of money as 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a moment—on the following Monday I went again—I did not get back the bills.</p>

Green, and Mr. M'Grath, of Lower Mount-street, Dublin—I have transmitted them a great deal of business, and they have done business with English clients through me—I have been acquainted with Mr. Coyle about six or eight months—I have had transactions with him before this with respect to bills—I should say, previous to this, to the amount of about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think more—I kept no book for bill transactions—I should say I have had about half a dozen bills from Mr. Coyle altogether, or perhaps eight or ten—I should say under a dozen, and over half a dozen—they have not been purchases of bills by me of Coyle—I got them discounted through my</p>

               <p>connexions, and handed over the money to Mr. Coyle—t did not buy these two bills for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I merely made advances on them to that extent, and when I found I could not get them discounted, in consequence of some transactions, I was obliged, of course, to take the bills for my advances—I advanced 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of hard money—not a shilling of it was my own—Coyle first lodged with me a 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, on which I advanced him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and finding I could not get that bill discounted, when he brought me Mr. Mytton't bills, I returned him the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and held Mr. Mytton's bills as against that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave Willis into custody for stealing these bills from me—I appeared against him before the Magistrate at Marl borough'Street, and was examined on oath in support of that charge—I stated that the first advance J made to Coyle for these bills was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. check of a Mr. Brown's, which Mr. Brown lent me—I believe I was asked before the Magistrate when I began to make advances on these bills—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. fitzpatrick here produced the notes of the examination, which the witness was desired to look at.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in New-road, Fitzroy-square, and am an engineer—I saw the boiler of a steam-engine which had been bunt on Messrs. Samuda's premises, at Blackwall, on the morning of the explosion—it was manufactured by Fair burn, of Milwall, Poplar—it was shown to me on the premises about an hour after the explosion—the amount of pres<lb/>sure that boiler was built for, I believe, was 20lbs.—I should say it was capable of sustaining a pressure of 40lbs. on the square inch, without the probability of bursting—the workable pressure was 20lbs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there anything about an engine to inform the person the amount it is to be worked at? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The general strength of the plates and the form of the boiler—the overlapping will show the substance of the plates—a skilful person could judge of that—the amount of pressure ought to be marked outside, but was not—it was between a high and low pressure—it is difficult to tell now where high pressure begins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would a safety valve to a boiler of this kind, if properly constructed,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120028"/>
               <p>let out the extra pressure in the boiler? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, if properly con<lb/>structed and worked, it would allow the steam to escape so as to keep a proper pressure in the boiler—the valve is always so constructed—I made this plan of the boiler after the explosion—there was not sufficient left for me to say it is accurate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell the difference be<lb/>tween a high and low pressure boiler? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say a low pressure boiler is constructed to bear steam at low pressure, and a high pressure at high—the extremes of the pressure are the only distinction—I cannot say where you would begin with high pressure, or leave off with low pressure—a tubular boiler may be applied to a high or low pressure engine—they are not all high pressure—there are several not high pressure—at present they are very much introduced in working low pressure engines, as they go into a smaller space—I have brought the original drawings made when the engine was made—I got them from Mr. Fairburn—I should say the plates of the shell of the boiler were not three-eighths of an inch thick—it is marked five-sixteenths on the plan—I should not wish to swear it was not three-eighths—I did not examine it accurately to ascertain the thickness—the boiler would, very likely, bear very considerable pressure of cold water—I do not say that it would bear 200lbs. to an inch—I do not say it would not—a vessel that would bear 200lbs. cold might be worked at 50lbs. hot water—I was not present the day before the accident—I have heard Messrs. Samuda are experienced gentlemen—I never saw the prisoner—I have heard they placed great confidence in him, and he has been with Na<lb/>piers, very considerable engineers—I have heard them speak of him as having very great ability—the upper row of tubes of the boiler were brass and the lower iron—I should think the expansive power of brass just dou<lb/>ble that of iron, but I have not gone into the calculation—it exceeds that of iron—some of the iron tubes were blown out at the ends by the explo<lb/>sion, and the brass ones were blown over the side, liberated at one end and blown over—it is unusual for the upper row to be brass—it is a very pro<lb/>per precaution—I have not seen it before—they are generally all of brass or all of iron—the prisoner could not know whether the whole tubes were brass or iron without being informed of it, unless he had gone into the boiler to see it, or been present at the manufacture—it would be his duty to obey the directions of his superiors—it is important that the tubes should be all of the same strength and power of expansion, capable of resisting the power applied—I have known engineers on railways refuse to use brass tubes made by different makers in the same boiler, as there are some very bad tubes and some very good ones—they should all be of the same power of expan<lb/>sion—all the engine makers and railway companies pay very great attention to the construction of their tubes—the question is not as to the quality of the tubes but the equality—if they were all of good quality, but of different powers, it would be dangerous—every portion of a tubular boiler should be equally strong or equally weak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Take this model in your hand, supposing it to be a faithful representation of that portion of the boiler, there is a piece of wood placed there, if a hook was attached, if the wood was made fast at the bottom, then the handle of the valve drawn down and the loop put into the hook, would that have the effect of opening the valve and keeping it open, instead of shutting it and keeping it shut? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If drawn down and fastened to the hook it would keep it open—if the steam was coming</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120029"/>
               <p>out at the top it would show the valve was open—by lifting this lever the valve would open and the steam blow out—looking at the construction of the I valve I should say an obstruction of steam in the pipe might cause increased pressure of steam.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is tne reason of the tubes being partly iron? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the event of the water being low in the boiler, the brass tubes, yielding to a lower pressure than the iron, they would melt first and prevent an accident—I should always make a boiler so—I do not think it would make any difference in the party working the engine, know<lb/>ing it was partly brass tubes and partly iron—in my opinion the explosion could not have taken place with 50lbs. pressure, or anything near it—it must be a much greater pressure—I should say above 100lbs. to a square inch would be the minimum—it is quite a matter of opinion—a 50lbs. pressure would not be a proper amount to apply to it—I think it excessive, and not safe. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could an engineer, acquainted with matters of this kind, be informed of that by observation of the boiler? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The boiler had the appearance, by its form, of being very strong, and I do not know, unless his attention was called to it—he might be mistaken as to it, within 10lbs. or 15lbs. to a square inch—there is no use in this piece of wood in this model that I am aware of—it would be very improper to apply it to the boiler—if the safety valve had been open, It think the explosion could not have taken place—but there is one peculiarity in the construction of the valve, that although the steam might have been blowing off partly, there might have been too rapid a generation of steam—the relative dimensions of the valve-box are improperly constructed—al<lb/>though the valve might be open, the passage round the door of the box is not sufficient—the safety-valve is ill constructed, I think—if the valve was open, I think the explosion could not be of the nature I observed—not so great in extent, if open at all—part of the boiler was blown to a very great distance—except for closing the valve, I cannot see any use of that piece of wood—if it was placed in the position it is in this plan, with the Bail across it, it would close the valve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the safety-valve was not judiciously constructed; in what respect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The area of the safety-valve is twelve or fourteen square inches, and the passage would only allow an escape of three square inches—it should have been considerably more than equal to the area.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could it be steam<lb/>tight if more than the valve itself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would only allow the steam to escape when the valve was open—although the valve was open ever so wide, if the steam generated in the boiler to a great extent, I think it would produce danger—I do not think a person working the engine, uninformed of the construction, could perceive that the safety-valve was so improperly constructed—the accumulation of steam in a boiler is very rapid indeed—it is regulated by the heat by the fires below—any increase of heat produces a more rapid generation of steam—if the water gets rather low, there is a greater heat, and the water which remains generates steam more rapidly—that would be another cause—the heat of steam, when worked at a pressure of 50lbs., I believe would be nearly 300 degrees—that would increase the heat of the steam, as well as the pressure, and make it very apt to have a sudden increase, make the steam evolved more dangerous, and it would not be known to the person working the engine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How would a person managing an engine be made acquainted with the degree of pressure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The general indication</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120030"/>
               <p>is the diameter of the valve, the length of the lever, and the weight applied, in the absence of a mercurial guage, which I did not see to this engine—there ought to be one to every engine—the fulcrum of the lever is the extreme point—the number of square inches of the safety-valve would tell how many square inches there are—if the expanding place was only three, you ought to employ that—it was an improper construction alto<lb/>gether—by the construction of the outer box it would appear a very small valve, but in fact it was a very large one—that would not appear unless pointed out—he would know the pressure he was working at, but not the difficulty of getting rid of the over pressure, as the orifice has nothing to do with the amount of pressure—the means of letting out the steam might be dangerous and yet unknown to the engineer—it would be very difficult to know at what rate the steam was going off—he could not know it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the iron rod lifted the weight, and regulated the pressure, and the steam was blowing off from the safety-valve, would he know what quantity of pressure there was on the boiler? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He could not—by the limited space allowed there might be an increased pressure going On in the boiler—he could not know what proportion was escaping—if the cylinder worked sluggishly, it would indicate there was some obstruction in the steam-pipe from the boiler to the engine, or some valve or cock shut—I believe the cause of the accident was the difficulty created by the passage of the steam up the pipe—the cylinder working slowly would indicate that the steam was passing slowly—if the escape through the valve, or the other way, was stopped, it would increase the pressure—if the cylinder moved slowly, I should judge something intercepted the progress of the steam from the pipe to the engine.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed at Samuda's when this occurred. I had been there about six weeks—I saw the boiler when it came there—it had been there a fortnight when this happened—I saw it on the day of the accident, when the steam was up, a quarter or half an hour before the accident—Mr. Low was there, and he was the manager—there were other men in the engine-room—I then observed the steam blowing from the safety-valve—this model represents something like the safety-valve—by pulling this handle you can raise the valve—I saw a piece of wood, as it is here on the model, and a nail in it, lying against the side of the boiler—there was room for'it to work—the nail was not fastened to the handle when I saw it—it did not impede the motion of the handle in any way—it did not touch the nail when I saw it—it did not go past it—as I came by I did not know what the wood was for—I put my foot against it, and put it up—Mr. Low saw me, and told me to let it be, and he put it back, so as to let it play more freely—what I did to it made it more likely to interfere with the handle—I pushed it at the bottom accidentally with my foot, which raised it at the top—Burnand works there—he was not there just at the time—the explosion happened perhaps a quarter of an hour after I went out—this was Wednesday morning when I went into the yard after breakfast, before the explosion—I saw Mr. Low by the side of the boiler—I said, "This is a bad job, Mr. Low" (as the engine would not</p>

                  </hi>. I live'in George-street, Bromley, and am a mill-wright; at the time of the accident I was in Messrs. Samuda's employ. I recollect the boiler in question coming on the premises—I was on the premises on the morning of the accident, and saw Mr. Low there, superintending about the place—I was working at the boiler the night before, attaching the steam pipes from the boiler to the engine, under Low's superintendence—I believe there was no obstruction unless there was water in the pipes—I consider there was water in the pipes—it was very cold, and snow and frost during the night—the bore of the pipe conveying the steam was about three inches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the pipes on a level, so that water would remain in them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the cold night might convert the water into ice—this was the 5th of March.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From your experience in such matters, would that impede the working of the engine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An obstruction in the pipes would certainly stop the steam going into the engine—the pipe was between thirty and forty feet long—Mr. Low could not see inside that pipe—the fires were lighted next morning about six or seven o'clock I should say—part of the pipe was out in the air all night, and part in the engine-room—it was all exposed to the air—the boiler was in the open air—I was up on the boiler several times that night—I never saw Low on the top of it—at the time the fires were lighted in the morning there was a piece of wood attached to the boiler—I placed it there, by Low's direction—it was a piece of scaffold pole, four or five feet long—it was there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I left the boiler when I put it there—the fires were lighted at that time, and the steam up—the explosion took place between nine and ten—the steam was getting up at the time I put the prop—I cannot say</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120032"/>
               <p>what pressure there was on the boiler—the engine went by men <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> the fly-wheel round—I do not consider it went by the boiler—the pole being there would keep the valve entirely useless—there was a nail in it, with the point broken off—I put the nail in by Low's order—by propping the handle up it kept the valve shut.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any play between the handle and nail? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say what was the case at the time of the explosion, but when I put it there there was no play at all—the explosion was a quarter of an hour after—steam was blowing off rather violently while I was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the prop kept the valve closed how could you account for the steam blowing off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The handle pressing the nail might make a space, and let it escape—I should say the valve was pretty well closed, but a pressure of steam forced it up—the higher the steam and smaller the vent, the more noise it makes—I cannot say whether Cockayne was there—I know I saw him on the premises—I went from the boiler to the engine-house directly I put the prop up—the explosion took place ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you had any quarrel with Mr. Low? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As to quarrel, I cannot say we had one, nothing at all; it is a great while ago—you very likely know what it was about better than I do—it was about a candle—I had some hammer-handles—he did not say I had no business with them—he asked what business I had with a candle in my drawer—it was not locked up—I had business with it—I know Charles Taylor—I did not tell him, when I came out of the Coroner's room, that I had done for the Scotch b----at the Town<lb/>hall, and would do for him again when I got to Newgate—I never said any such thing, I will swear—I do not believe I ever used such an expression, but Taylor met me one morning, and Cole, the foreman of the labourers, told me he knew nothing about it, and wanted to go up, and did not know what to swear to—I do not remember saying anything to Taylor, or seeing him when I came out from the Coroner—I will swear I had no conversation with him on that point—I do not believe he said, "How did you get on at the inquest?" but I will not swear it—I said I had spoken the truth, and would speak it again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you call the prisoner Scotch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not swear that; I might; I do not believe I did; but they are capable of coming forward and swearing anything for the sake of their own situations—I never said I would do for him again when I got to Newgate—I should be sorry to do anything to anybody—I never followed Taylor about and entreated him not to repeat what I had said—I said I was coming up to speak the truth in defiance of anybody—I never said I could trust him, but could not trust Hubbard and. Hill—I never spoke to Hubbard and Hill, they are too low to have anything to do with—I know Hollingsworth, who deals in tools—I had some tools from him—I put down 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him my name was Guiver—I have not paid for them all yet—I do not believe I was to pay for them on the following Saturday—I do not believe it is twelve months ago—I have not paid a farthing since—I did not tell him I worked for Pitcher—I said it was Pitcher's yard—I was working close to Pitcher's yard, at the East India Dock, for Hunter and English—I cannot tell whether I said I was working for Pitcher—I gave my name as Burnand to the people I worked for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer, and have been so eleven years. I have been eighteen years in the profession—on the Monday following the accident I examined the fragments of the boiler—they had been removed—some parts of it were driven a considerable distance, and some buried in brick work by the force of the explosion—judging from the appearance, I should have felt myself safe by the side of that boiler at a 25lbs. or 30lbs. pressure—I examined the safety valve—I believe the valve would not admit of sufficient space to relieve the boiler, if it had acted as freely as it could at the pressure the boiler was able to bear; but if it was able to sustain a greater pressure, a smaller valve would have done—there was only a sufficient escape of three inches—I cannot say whether when the explosion occurred the safety-valve was in action or not—when I saw the box of the valve, it had been blown some distance, and the lever was bent by being thrown against something—part of the valve was attached to the box—if the space round the valve had been acting freely, it could not have happened, but a three inch valve at the pressure the boiler was able to bear was not sufficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You saw the effect of the explosion; now, having regard to the imperfection, in point of size, of the valve, can you form a judgment whether an explosion of that intensity could have happened if the valve had been acting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, if the valve had been acting, I think not—I believe if the valve was high enough to admit of three inches to escape, it would have escaped—the explosion was so terrific, I should say it was impossible for the pressure to be less than 100lbs.—I never saw anything to equal it—the boiler was not capable of bearing that—if it had been, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120035"/>
               <p>the valve was acting freely, it might have relieved itself—I consider it a low-pressure boiler; and it is the practice to put a safety-valve an inch in area, to every foot of fire-grate, every superficial foot of fire—this was rather below that, but I consider the valve quite big enough to admit of the escape—I infer from what I have stated, that the valve could not have been acting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the difference between a high and low-pressure boiler? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on the form—high-pressures are gener<lb/>ally made circular—it depends on the strength—a circular form is the strongest—the steam could not escape if the valve was down—I do not know how the witnesses could tell that the steam was blowing off freely—if there was no fire, the valve would let the steam off freely—it all de<lb/>pends on the heat of the fire.</p>

                  </hi>. In March last I lived at No. 11, George-street, St. Giles's, as charwoman. On Monday night, the 31st of March, I recollect a man and woman coming there about a quarter to eleven o'clock, to the best of my opinion—I never saw the man before—the woman went by the name of Mrs. Tape—she asked for a threepenny room, and the man gave me the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of his hand—he was dressed in a cap and a velveteen jacket—I did not show them to a room—I gave the light to the woman—she found her own way, and the man went with her into the back parlour—after they had gone I stopped a bit in the front parlour—I then came out and sat down on the stairs for a few minutes—after they had been in the back parlour a short time, it might be a little better than five minutes, I heard the cries of murder—it was the cry of a woman—she repeated it three times after the first cry, "Murder! murder!" Justin one breath—I got up and knocked at the door of the back parlour—I knocked twice without receiving an answer—I then put my back to the door and forced it open—I then saw the woman sitting on the bedstead, and the man stand<lb/>ing over her with his hand up over her neck—his hand was not stirring at all—I thought he was beating the woman—I said, "For God's sake do not beat the woman"—he turned round and faced me—there was a glim<lb/>mering light in the room—there was not much candle—a little bit—he did not say a word—he came from the bed and came out at the door—I was close against the door—I caught him by the outside pocket of the coat as he was coming out at the door to run away—he forced his coat out of my hand, caught me round, and threw me up by the fire-place—in doing so he took hold of the front part of my shawl, and left marks of blood upon it—he succeeded in getting out—the woman got up off of the bedstead and walked to the fire-place, just as I was getting up—she had her hands up to her face so that I could not see any blood—she never spoke—she gave a bit of a stagger, and down she fell against the fire-place—I called out to the landlady of the house, "Mrs. Hall, stop that man"—he was out of the passage before I had time to get out of the room—I saw him in the passage at the street-door—Mrs. Hall had hold of him—he forced himself away from her, opened the door, and went away—I returned to the back parlour immediately along with Mrs. Hall—she brought a candle—I found the woman lying, making a great noise, but she could not speak—there was a knife sticking in the side of her neck—I then went for an officer, and found Allen down by the station, standing at the corner—he came immediately, and he pulled the knife out—I after<lb/>wards</p>

I was on duty on Monday night, the 31st of March, at a little before eleven o'clock, standing at the corner of Clark's-mews and George-street—I know No. 11 very well—I was on the same side of the street as No. 11, and fifty-two feet from it—I have measured it—a little before eleven o'clock I observed a man come from No. 11 towards me—before he came up to me he crossed over the way, when he was from nineteen to twenty feet from me, and passed on on the other side of the street—he had on a dark coat, I believe a velveteen coat, and a cap—I believe there was a peak to the cap—I would not swear positively whether there was a peak or not—about five or six minutes after that man crossed over I was fetched to No. 11—I had remained all that time at the corner of the street—I did not observe any one else come out of No. 11 before Mrs. Palmer came to me—no one could well do so without my observation, because the door went on a creak, and I heard the door close when the man ran out—I heard the noise, and also when Mrs. Palmer came out—I heard no such noise in the interval—on hearing what Mrs. Palmer said I went directly to No. 11 with another constable—I found the deceased in the back room lying on her side, with a knife sticking in her neck behind the ear, with the handle upwards—she made a sort of smile, and moved her eyelids—there was some motion of her muscles as I drew out the knife—I produce the knife—she did not speak—I cannot say whether she died immediately, for directly I drew out the knife I ran for a surgeon—I was gone a very short time—when I returned she was dead—I have preserved the knife ever since—I afterwards saw Mr. Brothers at the inquest—he saw the body of the woman that I found in the back parlour—I have no doubt who the man that passed me was, but I would not swear positively—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man, but I would not swear it positively—I have a strong belief that he is the man—I knew him before, I should say for about three or four years—I am in the habit of seeing him frequently as I cross Seven-dials, and the neighbourhood—I did not know where he lived—I never spoke to him that I am aware of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cutler, residing in High-street, St. Giles. My shop is about 300 yards from No. 11, George-street, or hardly so much, in one direction—I know Endle-street—that is about the same dis<lb/>tance from my shop—on the night of the 31st of March I waa in my shop, and sold the knife produced—I know the person to whom I sold it—it was the prisoner—he came into my shop about ten minutes to ten o'clock, as near as I can judge—when he came into the shop he said, "What is the cheapest small carving-knife you have?"—I said, "I will show you some directly, I believe I have some second<lb/>hand ones"—after I had finished what I was about, which was in the space of half a minute, I went round to the other side of the counter, and took three carving-knives out of a drawer—I was on one side of the counter, and he on the other—there was a very good light in the shop, three gas burners—he spoke to me across the counter—the counter runs in two directions—I went round to another part, still keeping inside the counter—he accompanied me round on the outside, and stood opposite me there the same as before—I took the three carving-knives out of the drawer, and placed them on the counter before him—I said, "These are a shilling each"—he examined them—he took all three together into his hand, and examined each of them—no observa<lb/>tion whatever passed from him—he put down a shilling, and was about to take one of the knives which he had selected away—he kept one in his hand, and put the other two down, and was about to leave the shop—I said, "I will wrap it up for you"—he came back, and gave the knife back into my hand—I went round the counter, and set the edge of it on a stone that we have for the purpose, then wrapped it up in paper, and gave it to him—nothing more passed—he then left the shop—I did not notice his dress particularly—he had a hat on, I am certain, and a dark coat, but what kind I do not know—I had no recollection of having seen him before—he was quite a stranger to me—I saw him again on the following Friday, I think—he was then in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On Friday evening before you saw him, you had not heard I that a man was in custody who had been threatening the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nothing of the sort—my great certainty was not till after I had finished my one examination before the Magistrate—the chief reports that I heard were from I one and another of the witnesses in the waiting-room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you had heard there were reports of that sort before you were examined before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Precisely so, I had—the man was in I my shop altogether, I should say, two or three minutes—he had his hat on all the time—the only words he made use of while he was in my shop was asking me whether I had the knives—that was the first question he put to line—he said nothing after that—I was more sure of him when I heard him I put a question to me before the Magistrate—that was the second time I heard his voice—he did not speak in the station-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was there remarkable in his voice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot describe pre<lb/>cisely as to the tone of voice, but my impression was as to his age more than anything else, that he was from nineteen to twenty, that he was a man who had not reached manhood—it was not a set voice—it was from his voice that I judged more particularly as to his age, that it was the voice of a person in some degree changing its tone from boy to man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What opportunity had you of seeing his face during the time he was in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He directly faced me when he came in at the door—the breadth of my counter is about thirty inches—he stood directly in front of</p>

               <p>me when he came in, and when I went round to the other side he stood directly in front of me again—I saw his face—one gas light was directly over his head—that would throw the shadow of his hat over his face—the other gas lights were in the window, about two yards from where he was standing—they gave a very good light indeed in the shop.</p>

I worked at Mr. Garratt's, the silversmith's in March last—the prisoner also worked there—about six or seven weeks before I heard of the murder he said he had the bad disorder from a woman, and he said he would serve her out—I said, "You had better not interfere with the woman at all; if you come to strike the woman she will very likely take out a warrant for you"—he said she was a young woman, fresh coloured, and fat—he said he should have got married to his cousin at Easter, had it not been for this complaint, but his intention was to be married at Whitsuntide—he did not tell me anything that his cousin had said to him—he merely said that they had got vent of it—I recollect the morning after the murder—the prisoner came to work as usual, a little after six o'clock, and breakfasted along with me—he ate two eggs for his breakfast, and made a hearty breakfast—he went away about half-past eleven o'clock—he never came to work again—I did not know where he lived—he used to come to work in a kind of velveteen shooting-jacket—he did not work in it—he pulled it off, and likewise his waistcoat, and put on another one, and when he went away he put oa his velveteen coat again—it was a coat very much resembling the one produced—he came to work in a hat.</p>

I have been acquainted with the prisoner a good many years, I should say, five, six, or seven years—I have been on friendly terms with him, and continued so down to the time when the death of this woman happened—on the night of the 31st of March I saw Connor—I did not notice the time exactly—it was about seven o'clock—it might be just about dark—it was on the Seven Dials, near the Crown public-house—he was in the habit of going there, and I too, and it was there that I saw him—in the course of conversation he told me that he was suffering under a certain disease—I did not notice bow long he remained with me—he might have remained half an hour—I did not notice him going away, but he did go—I missed him—about eleven o'clock that night I was at the same spot, outside the door of the Crown, and Connor came up to me—I think be came up from Queen-street—I think it was in that direction—Queen-street leads from Broad-street towards St. Giles's—I know George-street—it would lead to George-street—it is only two or three streets from George-street, and almost in a direct line—I should say it would take a person five or eight minutes to walk or run from George-street to the Crown.</p>

I am the sexton of the parish of St. George's, Bloomsbury—it is my duty to keep the keys of the church—I know no<lb/>thing of this key found in the western door—on Sunday night, the 13th of April, I locked the southern and western doors after service—there was no one in the church to my knowledge when I secured the doors—service was over at half-past eight o'clock, within a few minutes—the candlestick pro<lb/>duced is the one by which we lighted ourselves out—before I went out I left it in the western porch, between the outer and inner doors—I am sure I did not leave it under or near the communion-table—the plale is kept in an oak chest by the side of the font, in the eastern aisle, about fifty fret from the communion-table, which is on the northern side of the church—I saw the candlestick found underneath the kneeling-cushions round the communion-table—I quitted the church about nine o'clock that night—about eleven o'clock I was called by Simpkin—I proceeded to the westers door of the church and found I could not put my key into the lock, something prevented me—I put my finger in and found there was a key—I went round to the front door, and on opening it we went in and found the prisoners outside the communion rails—I saw this key taken from the western door—tltere was a candle in the candlestick when I left—I had extinguished it—I cannot say how long it was when I left it, or whe<lb/>ther it had been lighted sines—there are a good many prayer-books left in the church—the parish plate is valuable—nothing was taken away—I knew Nicholas as the son of the late beadle—he used to be frequently about the church with his father—I should think he knew where the plate was kept—I cannot say.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been sexton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly two years and a half—I have frequently been in the habit of locking up the church at night—I can positively swear that all the doors were locked on this night—I locked most of them myself and looked at all—there are six outer doors—I locked four and tried the other two—they are fastened with iron bars, and I put my hand to the bars to feel that they were secured—I recollect that distinctly—there are no means of getting in except by the doors—I believe all the windows are barred—air is let in by means of case-ments which open a few inches.</p>

                  </hi>. I am vestry-woman of the parish church of St. Marylebone. On the morning of the 13th of Feb. I heard of the robbery, and went to the church—there was a box in the vestry-room, in which I kept the wax candles—I found the lock of that box broken right off—I missed two wash-leathers from the cupboard in the vestry-room, also a bag, containing a hood and scarf belonging to the Rev. Mr. Wood, the curate—when I lost the wash-leathers, there was no seal with a T on it on them—I cannot speak to the two pieces produced—they are rather disfigured—they have formed one piece—I have examined them—they are the tame size as one of the pieces I lost, but neither of those I lost had any teal on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am deputy-clerk and sexton of St. Marylebone. I was in the church during the performance of the baptism on the 12th of Feb.—there are five outer doors to the church—it is not usual, on baptismal services to have more than two doors open, the side door, front<lb/>ing the New-road, and the High-street door—sometimes the vestry-door is open, as the clergyman frequently comes in at that door—I cannot remem<lb/>ber whether he did that day—I left at a quarter past four o'clock, leaving the pew-opener closing the church—it is her custom to lock the doors—I merely locked up the strong room, and the desks in the vestry, not the outer doors—on the following day I went to the church, in consequence of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120056"/>
               <p>information—I found the middle door, looking into the New-road, open, and the lock, which had evidently been wrenched off, lying on the ground—it could not have been wrenched off from the outside—the screws were drawn, a part of the lock, through which the bolt passes, was screwed on for more security to the side of the door—it comes round the door, and fixes down with a plate—that plate was left on, showing that the lock must have been forced off with considerable violence, and from within—I went to the High-street door and found a screw taken from the lock, and placed in the keyhole—I found a chisel by the side of the lock that was taken off the front entrance—on entering the church I went to the vestry, and found the inner vestry-room door, opening from the church, forced open—I found the outer vestry-room door perfectly safe, and locked—there were marks of a chisel on the inner door—I saw the inspector compare the chisel found with the marks, and they appeared to agree—two desks had been forced—I missed from a wooden box in my desk about eight half-crowns, belonging to the rector, the Rev. John Hume Spry, and about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of copper-money of my own from a wooden-bowl—a small seal was taken from my desk, with the initial T engraved on it—five brass candlesticks were also taken, and some wash-leather, but I know nothing about that—the impression upon this wash-leather appears to be an impression from my seal, but it was not put there by me—there are many seals alike—I know the seal now produced from a piece of blotting paper between the handle and the brass part, which I put there to make it tight, as it was loose—it was there when I lost it—I told the officer of it before he produced it to me, and when it was produced it had the blotting paper in it—these five keys belong to Marylebone church—one is the key of the money-box, from which the half-crowns were stolen, and one of the entrance to the vaults, one of the church-door, and one of the church gates—they were taken from the bunch which were on a brass chain—the chain was cut, and these taken from it, except the key of the money-box.</p>

I keep the Feathers, at Old Brentford—I have been in the habit of cashing small checks for King and Son from time to to time—the prisoner always brought them—I was in the habit of paying to Mr. Baker, of Chiswick, the checks I received from the prisoner, except one which I paid to Mr. John Dicker, of Cooper's-row, Tower-hill—this check, dated the 24th of Jan., I paid to some of the collectors, but whether</p>

               <p>discharge from the navy—he said he had not got it, that he had lost it—I said, "Have you anything to prove you are the person you represent?" and on that he produced the ticket I have in my hand—I read it, and asked him on what ship he claimed the share for the batta-money—after hesitating, he said he did not know the name of the ship—that excited my suspicion—I said, "What! say you are entitled to batta-money and do not know in what ship you served? can you tell me anything about it? do you know the name of the officer you served under, or any of the officers, the Cap<lb/>tain, lieutenant, carpenter, boatswain, or any of them?"—he said he did not know—I then desired the attendant to take him outside, that I might investigate the case, and send for the batta-book, which happened not to be in the room at the time—I told the attendant before he took him out I thought there, was something wrong in his application, and not to let him go—I did not hear him say anything to that—I examined the books—there was a John Foley, a second class boy, on board the <hi rend="italic">Conway</hi>—I found he bad been paid already—when I was examining the books the prisoner was brought in, and said his name was not John Foley—I asked him where he, got this certificate from—he said he got it from some person or other in Rat<lb/>cliff-highway who he had never seen before—he was then given into custody.</p>

The deceased Jane Thrussell lodged with me—on Friday morning, the 11th of April, between eight and nine o'clock, I was in bed with her—we were lying alongside each other—she lay inside me—the prisoner came into the room, drunk, with a man named Scott—the prisoner said to me, "Are you there, old woman?"—I said, "I am"—he asked would I have some money—I said I would rather see it than hear it—there was a counterpane at the foot of the bed, to serve as a curtain—I got up in the bed to look for my clothes, to put on—he took up a chair, and threw it out of his hand towards the bed—the counterpane fell, and a piece of the chair came inside the bed—whether it hit the deceased I cannot say, as I was confused—the deceased turned towards the wall, and began to cry—I sent for a policeman—the deceased got up, and was putting her clothes on, when the policeman came—the prisoner was then sitting at the table to have his breakfast—he lodged in the house—I told the deceased if he bad hurt her to give him in charge—she said, "No, I will not"—she put on her things, and sat by the fire—she had been sick from the time she came to the house, which was five weeks before—she was always ill and ailing—she vomited five or six minutes after the man threw the chair—I had often seen her vomit before—the policeman went away—she sat by the fire for about three hours, and went into the yard—she stopped a long time there—the prisoner brought her back from the privy in six or ten minutes, leading her by the hand—she then laid on the bed—I saw she was very ill, and went for the parish doctor—his man came and saw her—when the parish doctor came he said she was dead.</p>

At the time of the robbery I lived in High-street, Poplar—on the 22nd of April, about two o'clock in the afternoon, Harriet Patman spoke to me, and pointed out the prisoner to me—he was going across Grundy-street, which crosses Catherine-street, carrying a black bag—I followed him, and called "Stop thief!"—I did not come up with him then—on turning the corner of a street, I saw him running away—he was the same man I had seen with the black bag—the bag was then lying in the middle of</p>

Mr. Graham, at the office said, he had two boxes of the very same description, but only one was missing, and at the time the young gentleman saw the box it was not the one the pin was in, but the other.

I live at No. 46, Devonshire-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone; Bracey had been in my service, as footman, for three months before this occurred; he had the care of my plate, and had access to my wearing-apparel and property. I was aroused on Thursday morning, the 17th of April, about seven o'clock—I went dowa stairs to the lower part of the house, found the plate-chest open, the trays lying about, and the plate gone—I missed the plate stated in the indict<lb/>ment, and from my dressing-room a dress-coat, a large blue cloak, and a variety of articles of apparel—Bracey was also gone—the value of the whole property was about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I missed from a writing-table two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-notes and five sovereigns, which were. Quite safe, and the house ap<lb/>parently fast, the night before—Bracey slept in the pantry below—there was a strange coat and hat found in the house, which the police took pos<lb/>session of.</p>

               <p>—it was usual to do so when any clerk went for money—it has been usual for some years—we went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and received the money—the prisoner took it from Mr. Nicholson, and put it into a sheet of cartridge paper—I held up the blue bag, and he put it into it—we went back in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Dock-house—I held the bag in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> until we got to the Dock-house—I there delivered it to the prisoner, and saw him deliver it to Mr. Dixson—I afterwards accompanied him to the West India Docks, in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—on the way we called at the Fenchurch-street warehouse—the prisoner took the bag in his hand, and I believe be delivered a parcel to Mr. Williams there—he had a parcel for him—I stopped in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he was not absent two minutes—he took the bag with him—we then went on in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the West India Docks, and the prisoner delivered the parcel to Mr. Hunter, in my presence.</p>

I am a private in the Scotch Fusileer Guards—I was passing by the prisoner's shop on the evening in question, and law him dragging a woman by the arms in a very savage manner—when he, got to the shop door she fell down with his violence—he was striking her—a crowd began to gather, and cried shame on him—he tried to drag her into the back apartment by the hair of her head and her arm—she cried out "Murder!" repeatedly—in consequence of that I went and merely put out my hand to protect her, and said, "Don't hurt the poor woman"—he struck me a violent blow on the left temple, and struck me repeatedly after that with his fist before the officer came—the blow on the temple was so</p>

On the 3rd of April, about three o'clock, I was sent with a van load of boxes to the Eastern Counties Railway—I went through Charles-street—in con<lb/>sequence of what Mr. Hughes told me, there I looked into the van, and missed a box—I ran in the direction Mr. Hughes pointed, and afterwards saw the prisoner in Princes-street with the box on his shoulder—I ran up to him and took it from him—Mr. Hughes was with me—I held the pri<lb/>soner till I was knocked down by some one, and the prisoner got away—I got up again in about half a minute, and called, "Stop thief!"—a policeman came up, and I told him what had happened—I saw no more of the prisoner till I saw him at the station, about a fortnight after—I am quite sure he is the same person—this is the box—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it by the different marks—I had seen it many times before that day—I had placed it in the van myself.</p>

               <p>about half-past three o'clock, I was standing at my master's shop win<lb/>dow, and saw the van go by full of packin-cases—I saw three persons walking on the pavement together—the prisoner is one of them—I can swear to him—I had seen him before—I saw one of them, not the pri<lb/>soner, go into the road and take a box from behind the wagon—the pri<lb/>soner was on the pavement at the time—I ran down stairs directly after the wagoner—I came up with him and told him, and we went in pursuit—I afterwards saw the prisoner with a box on his shoulder, of the same shape and size as that which had been taken from the van—I came up with him—I staid a minute or two, and Crasher told me to take the box towards the van, which I did—I had not got to the van when I heard them halloo out, "Stop thief!"—I afterwards saw Crusher in Baker's-row, bleeding from the back of the head—I afterwards saw the prisoner at the station—I am sure he is the man.</p>

About three o'clock in the afternoon of the 3rd of April I sent Crusher with a van-load of luggage—I after saw him return bleeding—in conse<lb/>quence of what he told me I went to the station-house and gave informa<lb/>tion—I found the box at the railway station—this now produced is it—it is constantly in transit—it came from Mr. Topham, of St. Al ban's, and was to go to Messrs. Betts, of Ipswich—it was then under the care of the carriers, Henry, Robert, and John Smith—Mr. Tophara, the consignor, opened the box in my presence—it contained prepared horse-hair, and bundles of prepared platted straw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 27, Harcourt-street, Maryle-bone. In 1844, I was living in a house in Newoham-street. Viner and his wife were living in the same house—some time afterwards he took a coal<lb/>shed in White Hart-street, Drury-lane—I had told him that I had property which I was desirous to invest, and went with him to look at several different houses—I received a letter from him about a fortnight before the 30th of Sept., which I unfortunately destroyed—before that Gruby had spokes to me about a house, and Viner also—they both jointly recommended the house to me, saying it would pay me very good interest for my money—I declined it, it being in a very dilapidated state, and I thought the money a good deal for the time—the letter I received from Viner stated, "I have come to some agreement with Gruby; he is willing to let you a lease of this house for nine yean for 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; will you come down to-morrow morning yourself?"—the words, "Nine years;" were in writing, not in figures—I went next morning—Viner and Gruby were both there—Viner recommended it very highly, and so did Gruby, laying it would bring me very good interest for the money—Gruby said he was very sorry he was obliged to sell k, but he was so much in want of money, or otherwise he would not make soch a sacrifice—I considered from what they said, that Gruby was in possession of the house—Viner said, "Now I should recommend you to have it; if you make up your mind, I will do all the business for you, and see it properly executed, and done pro<lb/>perly, see all the rent paid, and all the taxes, up to the time"—I said to Gruby, "Mr. Gruby, I think it seems such a very curious time, your saying nine years, why not say ten?"—Gruby said, "The reason I say nine is, it being about half my term unexpired"—I then agreed to take it for nine years—I gave Viner a sovereign for his trouble—I said, "Mr. Viner, I must entirely trust to you to do it for me, because my eyesight it so very bad"—Viner knew that I had had three successive inflammations in<lb/>my eye, that summer, so as to weaken my sight very much—the prisoners appointed me to meet them on Saturday, the 28th; but I was too late fag the Savings' Bank—I went to the house in White Hart-street, and Viner accompanied me back to the Savings Bank, and solicited them to pay it at an unusual time, to which they agreed, and I got it on the 30th—I received it myself, I went to the house in White Hart-street, and there saw the pri<lb/>sohers in a part of the shop selected from the shop which they used as a sort of little counter-place—there was a round table—the shop was very dark—it was candlelight—Viner brought out this paper, and told me it was the lease of the house—Gruby was there at the time—Viner read it over to me, and he distinctly read over "Nine years"—Gruby must have hoard that—he sat close by—this is the document that was read over to me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—and which I had in ray possession afterwards—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120090"/>
               <p>have no doubt about it—when it was read over to me, I signed it, Gru<lb/>by signed it, and Viner signed it, and then Viner, with a pen in his hand, took it to a man named John Newman, who was in the shop, and asked him to put his name to it—I then gave the money, 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., into Viner's hands—I it was in notes—I think all in 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Viner said, "Will you have the receipt for the money, or shall I seal it up in the lease?"—I said, "Seal it in, if you please"—the lease, receipt, and all was got ready be<lb/>fore I went there—Viner folded up the receipt before me in the lease, sealed it up, and handed it over to me, saying, "Now I know you are very close-minded person, it is not worth while to say anything at all about it, put it at the bottom of your box, and leave it there till the ex<lb/>piration of the nine years, till it is called for"—this is the paper in which it was wrapped—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—and here is what he wrote on the out<lb/>side—I thought it was ail right, and put it in my box, where it remained until the end of Nov., when a relation of mine called upon me—in con<lb/>sequence of something he said to me, I told him I had purchased the lease of a house, and showed this to him, and that was the first time I disco<lb/>vered the fraud—(<hi rend="italic">this was a lease for a term of three years instead of nine</hi>)—I went in search of the prisoners, but could not find either—(I went first to an attorney, who wrote to them)—I saw Viner's wife, who told me he was out of town—I never found him until he was taken into custody—Gruby called on me in the beginning of Jan., to know the rea<lb/>son why I did not pay the rent to him, and why I paid it to Sir Herbert Jenner's agent—I asked him where they resided, but he would not give me any answer, and I said, "Anything you have to say, you had better say it to my attorney"—I never saw him again till I gave him into cus<lb/>tody in White Hart-street—I then took a newspaper with me, and showed him what account I had heard—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a piece of newspaper</hi>)—this is a portion of the paper—it is what I showed him—I took the whole paper—I did not cut this out—I gave the whole paper to my attorney'! clerk, Mr. Lassiter.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gruby's Defence, written:</hi>—"I never knew viner till a short time before he introduced me to Miss Price, and then only at a customer, I being then in the coal-trade. About last April Viner told me Miss Price wished him to take a business for her, which he did, a chandler's shop, in Eagle-court, about thirty yards from my house; he used to super<lb/>intend the business for her; he then told me she wanted him to live close by her, as she was afraid, it being a basinets she did not understand, she should require his services; be then made me an offer for my business; and said she was going to lend him the money to take it; he ultimatelytook it; soon after that he said she wished him to take the house for twelve months, and to lend him the money to purchase it. Viner then took the house for twelve months; he then let the shop he had previously taken for her in Eagle-court to Mrs. Hands, who let lodgings to gay women; a short time after that Viner told me Miss Price wanted him to purchase the house for three years; he said it was for him, but it was to be in Miss Price's name. I declined at first, but after repeated applications on Viner's part I agreed for the sum of 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. subject to my paying back the money I had previously received from Viner. The documents were drawn up according to Miss Price's directions; Viner then read both over to Miss Price in the presence of Newman, and she also read them herself and was quite satisfied with them; all this was not in my presence, neither, when Viner told her to nut the document in her box, as Viner told me it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120094"/>
               <p>was Miss Price's wish that I should be present; knowing that they had been very intimate I did not think anything of it, and she always said she was quite satisfied with what Viner did; he then brought me the money, and I gave a receipt for it, at the same time agreeing to lay out some mo<lb/>ney in painting and repairing the house, which I did according to my pro<lb/>mise; all this was under the superintendence of Viner. Miss Price then agreed to let Newman the shop for three years, as a weekly tenant. On the 1st of March, 1845, Miss Price gave me in charge for obtaining the money under false pretences, a charge the Magistrate would not entertain; she then gave Viner in charge, much against her will, for the sake of pu<lb/>nishing me, and preferred a charge against us both for attempting to defraud her of the money. She states in her depositions that she could not find me from November, 1844, till she gave me in charge, when, at the same time, I had left my address for my rent about the 18th of January, 1845; after that I went with Newman to her lodgings in Crawford-street, and saw her there; since then she has been in the house and seen me. I sub<lb/>mit that the charge of obtaining the money under false pretences cannot stand, insomuch as both Miss Price and Viner know the profits of the house is worth the money given, together with the business. I distinctly deny the statement made by Hands, but I have every reason to believe she was influenced by Miss Price to appear against me that she might be allowed to reside in the house to look after the lodgers; likewise Mrs. Hands owes Miss Price money; Miss Price has received the benefits of the house since September, 1844, till the present time, and is still doing so. I laid out 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to obtain a new lease under Sir H. Jenner for twenty-one years; the house will bring in with lodgers one pound per week, besides the business, which is worth more than the original rent. I have been a tenant of Sir H. Jenner's seven years next September, and I sincerely de<lb/>clare what I have done was with no intention of defrauding any person."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Collins—he is a drum-major in to Royal Artillery. About five or six o'clock in the evening of the 17th of April I was on Blackfriars-bridge, looking at some tumbling—I had six half-crowns and a shilling in my pocket, which was in front of me—I saw a boy near me, in a fustian dress, and I felt his hand in my pocket—I missed my money—he then went to the prisoner, who was about two yards off, and gave something into his hand, which he put into his right-hand pocket—the boy ran away, and I called out that he had picked my pocket—I charged the prisoner with being one of them, and I took hold of his coat—he got off, and was taken by the officer—I saw him throw some, money away.</p>

The prisoner Percell came into the shop for some low-priced figs—I stooped under the counter to get them—when I got them up he said he would not have them, he would have some better—I looked out some of the best we had—after some words, he refused them, and said he would have some better—I said we had not any better—he then leaned over the counter, laughed, and asked how much those were which I had showed him first—I said 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he would have them—he then went away—my master came, and missed the coffee.</p>

On the 15th of April I had been to London for a load of coals—I got at far as the Hare and Hounds at Newington on my return, about two o'clock—I saw the prisoners sitting by the side of each other at the Hare and Hounds, having bread and cheese and porter—I left there about three o'clock—they had left before I did—when I got on to Stone Lee I saw Wright by herself—I went on about a hundred yards further to Bruce-grove, and then taw them together—Hall left, and went into a grocer's shop—Wright went on ahead—she was about twenty yards from the shop—when Hall came out they joined together—Hall took something from bis pocket and handed to Wright out of a paper—they went on together, and when I got to Tottenham I informed the police, who accompanied me down the road to the White Horse, where Wright was taken—I know Mrs. Bourne's shop at Stone Lee, and I suspect Hall was in that shop when I saw Wright standing about twenty yards from it by herself—when Wright was taken she was alone, but she screamed "Murder!" and Hall came up to her assistance, and he was taken at the tame time—we could not ascertain whether he came from the public-house or the stationer's shop.</p>

About five o'clock in the evening, on the 5th of April, the prisoners came there—one of them asked for two three halfpenny-worths of gin—Harman gave me a good sovereign—I showed it to a person who was standing by—I then put it into a box behind the bar—I took a half-sove<lb/>reign out of the box, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the till—there was no other half-sovereign in the box, and that was a good one—I had taken it a few mi<lb/>nutes previously, and had shown it to George London—when we are alone we show the gold to each other—I laid that half-sovereign on the counter with the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was then standing at the counter, getting the half-pence, when Nicholson said, "You need not change, I have halfpence enough to pay"—Harman asked me if it would make any difference—I said, "Not any"—I turned back to give the sovereign to him again, and while I turned the prisoners had an opportunity of taking up the half-sove<lb/>reign, and putting another down—I expect that it then must have been done—I gave the sovereign back to Harman, and took the half-sovereign and silver off the counter—I put the half-sovereign back into the same box, thinking it was the one I had given him—I did not examine it—they then went away—they left part of their gin—when Nicholson got to the door he said, "I have given you the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., have not I, ma'am?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "All right"—in a few minutes after they were gone I had sus<lb/>picion, and was induced to look into the box—I found the half-sovereign was a bad one—it was not the one I gave to Harman, but another—I marked it and gave it to Mr. Scarfe, my master.</p>

The prisoners came there about five o'clock in the evening on the 5th of April, and were served by Gurling—I did not see the sovereign put down nor taken up, but Gurling brought it to me to see if it was a good one—I found it was good—Gurling placed it in the bowl, and at the time she did so she took out a half-sovereign—it was the only half-sovereign that was in the bowl—I had been asked to look at it a few minutes before, and had ascertained that it was a good one, and of the reign of William IV—when Gurling took out the half-sovereign, and put it down with the silver on the counter, I still remained there—I saw her take the change up again—I saw her put the half-sovereign into the same bowl she took the half-sovereign from—the prisoners then went away—in a very few minutes afterwards I examined the half-sovereign in the bowl—I found it was a bad one, of the reign of Queen Victoria.</p>

On the 16th of April, I directed him to take a wagon to London—he told me the evening before that the horses had been in the stable, and had eaten up all the hay in the course of the day—I ordered him to take some chaff and com with him to London in the nose-bags, instead of bay—he started at eleven o'clock at night—I have seen some hay since—I believe it to be Mr. Bur<lb/>rell's—it corresponds with his hay—Chittock had no business with it.</p>

I was on duty at half-past five o'clock in the morning, on the 16th of April—I saw the wagon loaded with hay coming down Hackney-road, and apparently a truss of hay on the fore ladder—Chittock drew the wagon over to a court called Baxter's Court—it stopped opposite a cow-keeper's yard, where Cashford lives ser<lb/>vant—I watched the hay for half an hour, and then saw it taken from the ladder, and carried in the direction of the stable—the prisoners were then both together, and which of them took the hay I am unable to tell—I went round to the fore part of the wagon, and asked Chittock what had become of the truss of hay that was lying on the ladder—he said, "I had no truss"—I said, "You had a truss, and it will be no hard job for me to find it; you both come with me to the stable"—I took them both</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Sir William Magnay, who has one partner. The prisoner was in their employ as out-door clerk—it was his duty to collect orders and to receive money, which it was his duty to enter in his own book, and pay it over to me the same day that he received it—the book he kept was one in which he ought to enter the goods he sold, and the money he received; and in the evening he would say what monies he had received, and pay them to me—he did not pay me a check for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nor the proceeds of it—he did not at any time pay me a check of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor the proceeds of it—if he had paid me the checks they would have gone through our bankers—these checks have not been through my hands at all—he never paid me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash on account of Mr. Watson—it was his duty to pay checks and money to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What are you, the cashier? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was hit duty to pay it over to me as soon as he received it—that was the rule of the house—it is very likely I might have told him it was his duty to do to—I have no knowledge that Mr. Magnay has done so in my hearing—a month has not intervened between the times of his accounting to me—when I receive money I enter it in a book in which I enter money for the bankers—on Saturday, or any other day, the prisoner comes about five o'clock and pays me, and I enter the sums—he has never brought in large sums which have been collected during several days—this if the cash-book—I enter in this book from whom I receive the money—it agrees with the bankers'-book—I do not put down the prisoners name in this book—I put down the money as received from Mr. Watson, if it was received from him—this book would not tell from whose hands I received it—I sign the prisoner's own book as having received the money—this is it—the whole of this book, I believe, is the prisoner's writing—here is the month of Nov.—here is no entry of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the 16th, the 18th, or the 19th—he enters in this book the goods he sells, and gives credit for the cash he receives—they are entries of orders from different persons, and of cash—here is one entry, "Donnison, by cash, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and some others—these are goods sold by him—some of them have a credit entry under them, and some have not—those which have no credit under them would not be paid at the time—if he receives the money he enters it, gives me the money, and I sign this book—the ledger will show all the money I received from him, but the entries are not in his name; it will only indi<lb/>cate</p>

               <p>that I received the money from Watson, or from any other customer—the prisoner had no access to the ledger—the ledger and cash-book con<lb/>tain the amounts of all the money I receive from all the clerks—this book of the prisoner's contains my signatures for what money he paid—the largest sum he has paid me is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for one individual—he never paid any sum in gross, composed of more than one debt—I would not have taken it so—if in the course of his business he re<lb/>ceived 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he would pay it when he came in at night—he was there every night, and I was there, and this pass-book passed between us every night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Sir William Magnay. The prisoner was in our service—it was his duty to receive money, and to account for it the day he received it—he had to collect orders in London only, not in the country—there is a country traveller and a town clerk-about two months ago I spoke to the prisoner about 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due from Teape and Son—I said, "It is very strange that Mr. Teape has not paid his account, being so wealthy a man"—he said, "It will be paid next Saturday"—that had reference to the 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

Magnay, and on the 18th of April I saw one of their wagons at their warehouse about two o'clock—it remained there about half an hour before it left—I then saw it drive off—Corduroy accompanied it as wagoner—I saw him driving it, he was by the side of the horses—I did not see Ell at the warehouse—I followed the wagon to the Stationery-office in James-street, Buckingham-gate—I did not see anything delivered, as the wagon went up a gateway—I saw it return, and it was driven to the Coach and Horses public-house in York-street—Corduroy went in there—whilst he was in there£Ell drove up in a cab—he got out and went into the public-house—I did not see him come out again, but I saw Corduroy come out in about a quarter of an hour—he then took the wagon to the Duke of Ormond's Head public-house in Princes-street—Corduroy went in there, and stopped about a quarter of an hour—he then came out in company with Ell—the wagon then went on towards Storey's-gate—Ell and Corduroy accompanied it, walking—when they got near to Storey's-gate, I saw the tilt of the wagon move, and Ell got in—it was an ordinary wagon-tilt—a person inside would not be perceived by persons outside while the tilt was over it—Ell's hat came off as he was getting in—Corduroy stopped the wagon, and Ell got his hat again—the wagon then went on to a beer-shop at Lambeth, and stopped at the door, and Ell got out—he and Corduroy went into the beer-shop—I saw them come out—the wagon then went on, and Ell and Corduroy accompanied it—it stopped at the corner of the Waterloo-road—I then saw Corduroy unfasten the tail-board of the wagon—(before he did that, he and Ell stood talking together for about two minutes)—he took out of it two bundles in brown paper wrappers, and placed them at the door of a shop which is a receiving-house for the London Parcels Delivery Company—Ell was by him to see what he did—Ell then carried the parcels into the shop, and Corduroy drove on with the wagon—Ell remained in the shop four or five minutes—he then left, but I cannot tell which way he went—I then went into the shop and saw the parcels which had been taken from the wagon—they have since been examined and found to contain each three reams of paper—they were addressed to "Mr. Dodge, No. 25, Ashley-terrace, City-road"—I cut off one of the directions—(this is it)—I made a communication to Messrs. Magnay on the subject—I then went with the inspector to the receiving-house—I made a com<lb/>munication to the persons there, and brought away the parcels—between eight and nine o'clock the same evening I went, by desire of my inspector, dressed as a porter, and took the two parcels to Dodge's house—I knocked at the door—Dodge came—I said I had two parcels for Mr. Dodge—he said "My name is Dodge; it is all right"—he then took the parcels off my shoulder and put them down in the passage—I asked him if he</p>

               <p>would have the kindness to give me a receipt for them—he said, "Did Ell tell you to ask for a receipt"—I had not at that time mentioned Ell's name—I said, "No, he did not, but I should be better pleased if you would give me one"—he then said, "Did Ell pay you?"—I said, "No, he has not, sir"—he said, "Then I will give you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you can tell Ell that I have paid you, and that will be as good as an acknowledgment for the receipt of the paper"—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and offered me some gin—I then left, and joined Mr. Magnay and Mr. Todhunter, who were waiting some yards from the house—I returned with them, and took Dodge into custody—I told him I was an officer, and took the paper which I had already delivered—I afterwards took Ell in custody—I found a portion of a card in his pocket, which I produce, also another half of a card which I got from Gibbs at the receiving-house—when I was following the wagon I was in plain clothes—I had seen the wagon loaded at Messrs. Magnay's with the bulk of the paper—it was in open reams, that is, the sides of the paper were open—the paper that went to Dodge's was covered altogether.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of Sir William Magnay, and am in partnership with him in the house in College-hill—we sup<lb/>ply her Majesty's Stationery-office with paper—we never permit any persons in our employ to have any perquisites, or to dispose of any outside paper, or outside covering, or wrappers—in consequence of what I ob<lb/>served relative to our stock, I employed the police to watdh our servants—on the 11th of April Haydon brought me this direction, which is Ell's writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Mr. Dodge, No. 25, Ashley-terraoe, City-road"—I was afterwards shown another address on another paper, which was in the same handwriting—there were two parcels of paper brought to our place by Haydon—this is one of them, and on the wrapper of it is u Mr. Dodge, No. 25, Ashley-terrace, City-road"—there were about six iearns of paper in the two parcels—they are worth about six guineas'—that is what we should sell them for if we sold them—it is called blue-wove double foolscap—to the best of my belief it has not been sold—it is paper we do not generally sell in the trade, it is made expressly for Government—in consequence of this paper being shown to me, I went with the officer to Dodge's house, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening—the officer was dressed as a porter—he took the paper there—when I got there I found Dodge there, and the paper which had been delivered by the officer—on my going in I asked if Mr. Dodge was at home—he said, "What is your pleasure, Sir?"—I said, "Is your name Dodge?"—he said, "Yes, Sir"—I said, "I give you into custody for receiving stolen property; this paper is mine; where did you get it from?"—he said, "I bought it of John Ell"—I said, "What did you give for it?"—he said, "10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per ream"I said, "You know you must have been doing wrong in buying that paper for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, "If I have done wrong I am a ruined man; what shall I do! I will confess all"—I said, "Whatever you say will go in evidence against you"—he said, "My wife advised me to have no transaction with Nicholson, for it would be the ruin of me if I did," or words to that effect—we then took the paper into his front room, and retired to his work-shop, which is the back room—he is a working book binder—it is a private house—I there examined his stock—we found on the counter three more reams of the same sort of paper, blue-wove double foolscap—I said, "Here is some more of my paper"—he said, "I received that from John Ell yesterday, and likewise five reams more that I have sent to Mr. Yarranton, the ruler"—I searched further and found several reams of yellow-wove double foolscap, ruled—I said, "This is also mine; how came you to have it ruled?"—it is not customary to rule printing paper in this way—on looking further I found a considerable quantity of books made from the same yellow-wove foolscap paper that was ruled, on the counter—it is not usual for printing paper to be ruled in that way for books, as it is a paper that has no size in it, and the ink sinks—it is expressly prepared for printing—I looked further and found a considerable quantity of wrappers, some under one counter and some under another, under other paper, and, on looking at</p>

               <p>the wrappers, I found the direction "Mr. Dodge, 25, Ashley-terrace, City-road, by the Parcels Delivery Company," in John Ell's handwriting—after I found these, Dodge's remark was, "What shall I do? I bought the paper of Ell"—when he said he had no idea he was doing wrong, I said, "You must know you were doing wrong; you could not have bought this paper, 26lbs., (which was the weight of it) for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that is not 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound: it ought to have been from 9 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said, "I bought a ream of paper of Mr. Evans, in Budge-row, for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "What was the weight of that?"—he said, "14lbs."—I said, "Surely you cannot compare this with what you bought at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; you have been a long time in the trade, and ought to have known better; show me your invoices."—but on searching I cottld not find any, neither could he show me any—he said, "I have got none"—he then said, "I shall be ruined, I have respectable connexions who were going to put me into business; my sister promised me assistance as well as a friend; I have first-rate characters from the Bank of England; what shall I do? I will confess all"—I said, "Whatever you confess will go against you"—he said, "Shall I be locked up to-night"—I said, "Yes, you will be locked up, but I will speak to the officer to get you a comfortable cell"—he said, "Will you prosecute me?"—I said, "I will"—he was then taken to the station—he made use of these sort of expressions frequently—Ell was under-warehouseman in our establishment—he was acquainted with the regulations of our house as to the Stationery-office and the mode of supply for it, as to inspection-notes, and so on—an inspection-note and receipt-note are the same thing, except that one is kept and the other is returned to us—the receipt-note is the acknowledgment from the office that the quantity of paper purporting to have been delivered has been received—at the Stationery-office, on their receipt of the paper, they give the receipt-note back and retain the inspection-note, and give us an ac<lb/>cepted notice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it Ell's business or not to see the wagon loaded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The clerk gave Ell instruction to load the wagon with a certain quantity of paper—it was Ell's business, with the assistance of the porters and wagoner, to put that in the wagon, and nothing but what he was desired to put in, no more—it was within the scope of Ell's duty occasionally to go to the Stationery-office, either with or without the wagon—it would excite no suspicion for him to go to the Stationery-office, but I am not aware of any business that he had which would take him to a public-house in York-street, or elsewhere, and most decidedly not to the Parcels Delivery Company-Dodge was not a customer of ours—I did not know him at all—when I had given him in charge the officer addressed me as Mr. Magnay—up to that time I am not aware that Dodge knew who I was—the officer named me first.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said Dodge said, "I will confess all;" were not the words he used, "I will tell you all that I know about it?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my belief he said, "I will confess all"—I had as vivid a recollection of what he said when I was first examined as I have now—he said, "If I have done wrong I am a ruined man; I will tell you all I know about it, and will confess all"—he said he had got five reams at Yarranton's—I have never said it was four reams, to my knowledge—I am sufficiently positive to swear that he said five, and five were found at Yarranton's—I have always said no—I told him, in the first instance, without any inquiry, that he had been commit<lb/>ting a felony—I believe this yellow-wove double foolscap paper is ours—it is precisely similar to some we have a great quantity of, and he said he bought it of John Ell—it is a peculiar make—it is made for printing, and of a description and quality that we have had an immense quantity of—it is very stout for double foolscap—I do not believe there are thousands of reams of this weight in London—it is not often made so heavy—this is the paper that I say it is unusual to rule—Dodge offered to bring a light to show us over his house—it was the officer he offered the light to, and the officer went over the house—he brought the light—he did not offer it to me—it was a light out of the back room—he said to the officer, "Here is a light, I will go with you, and show you over the house"—he pointed out some;' books to me himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not tell you he had purchased the paper of which those books were made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He only mentioned having bought some paper of John Ell—he directed my attention to some books—I was looking over his place, and I think I had seen the books before he mentioned them—I am not aware whether I had said anything about them before he mentioned them to me—I will not swear that I had.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By what do you identify any part of the paper that has been pro<lb/>duced; what enables you to say any part of it is yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a paper</p>

               <p>exactly similar to paper that was in the warehouse when this paper was found—we had a great quantity of it in the warehouse of the same make—we send to the Stationery-office, perhaps 250 reams in a fortnight, sometimes 500—we do not generally sell that description of paper to other parties—we do not in the course of a year sell a considerable quantity of it, except to the Office—we may have sold a few reams, ten or twenty reams—we have not sold more—to the best of my belief we have not sold more than twenty reams of it in a year.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Corduroy know enough of your business to know that nothing was to go out without an invoice, or a note from some one of the clerks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he has been in the service of the family ever since he was thirteen years old—he has been in our service with the wagon and other servitude, for twenty-six years, I think—he knew that it was the practice of our trade, not to send out any goods without an invoice, or note from some clerk of the establishment—a note or invoice would, in due course of business, have been delivered to him, to deliver with the goods—we have missed a great quantity of the blue-wove fools-cap, as well as the yellow-wove foolscap—we sell to Government by con<lb/>tract, and on competition with other wholesale persons in the trade—perhapi twenty different contracts go in, and generally to the extent of 100,000 reams—I told Dodge he had committed a felony, before I entered into con<lb/>versation with him—I had seen the officer go to his house, and seen the direction on the paper—Ell never purchased any of this blue double-wove foolscap of us, nor printing paper of any kind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the City police. Inconsequence of some communication from Messrs. Magnay, I gave directions to Hay<lb/>don—he was acting under my directions some time before this occurred—on the 18th of April I accompanied Mr. Magnay and Haydon with the two parcels of paper, to the neighbourhood of Ashley-terrace—Haydon was directed to take the two parcels of paper to Dodge's house—he then returned to us—Mr. Magnay and myself went to Dodge's house—we were at the door together, I cannot say whether he or I went in first—after we had been there some little time, I was in the back parlour with Dodge—Mr. Magnay had left the room, and I believe was in the front parlour—Dodge said, "This is a bad job, I am afraid my character is lost; do you think I can do anything with Mr. Magnay?"—I said, "I do not know, you may try if you like"—I had not mentioned the name of Mr. Magnay to him before he made that observation—he had before that been in conversation with Mr. Magnay—before that, something was said about his having bought paper at a sale, and a catalogue was handed to me—I handed the catalogue to Haydon—I did not notice what sale it was—I asked Dodge if he had any invoice of the goods we found there—he said no, he had not—he did not point to any paper, or speak of any particular paper when he spoke of a sale—he said he had bought paper at a sale, and he had a catalogue.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an examiner of paper at her Majesty's Stationery-office. Messrs. Magnay supply us with paper—it is my duty to count the paper at the time it is delivered, and examine it afterwards—on the 18th of April we received 160 reams of paper from Messrs. Magnay's—I believe Corduroy was the person who brought it—I counted the paper, and put my initials to it, and then handed over a note to the person who brought it—this is the note I handed to Corduroy on that occasion—I was present during the whole time the wagon was there—Corduroy did not receive any paper of any kind from me, or in my pre<lb/>sence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the house of Sir William Magnay and Co. I produce the note which I prepared on the 18th of April, before these goods were delivered—I prepared this inspection-note at the same time, which was returned to me with the initials of Mr. Diggins on it—it was brought to the counting-house by Corduroy—I gave instruc<lb/>tions to Corduroy, on the 18th of April, to go to the Stationery-office—Ell was in the warehouse—it was bis duty to load the paper—he prepared it, and loaded it, and Corduroy received it into the wagon—I saw Ell there—it would be his duty to sort out the paper, and put it into the wagon—I saw him at work at the paper—he would have no authority to put any<lb/>thing into the wagon, except that for which I had given him directions in writing, or some other document—he knew that that was the custom of the house—he has been in the employ more than twenty years—Corduroy took the receipt-note to the place where the goods were delivered, and it was his duty to bring it back from the office—Ell occasionally accompanied the wagon to the Stationery-office—he is sent to assist in unloading it—if there were not a wagon load of goods going to the Stationery-office, and we had any other orders to execute, they would never be sent without a receipt-note or an invoice—Ell and Corduroy knew that perfectly well, from the periods they had been in the establishment—I was not aware that any paper had been put into the wagon, nor did I authorize either of them, or direct any other person to put any other paper into the wagon that morning except that going to the Stationery-office—I had re<lb/>ceived instructions from Sir William Magnay with reference to what was put into the wagon that morning, as to my watchfulness and care of it—I did not give directions to anybody to put more or less into it than what was to go to the Stationery-office—it was to have that, and that only—I gave that direction to Ell, to load the wagon with the double fools-cap—the wagon is drawn up opposite a window to be loaded—there is a</p>

We live in Gillingham-street, Westminster—the prisoner came to do the servant's work—she did not live in the house—she left on Sunday, the 27th of April—she had been working at my house about a month—on the evening she left I found a Joaf wrapped in her cloak—I then looked about and missed two shirts and a petticoat, aad next day I missed two or three sheets, some pillow-cases, and a towel—I afterwards missed other things named in the indictment—on the Thursday night following she came to my house, and I asked her for what she could have the impudence to come—she said to see if I did not think there was something due to her—I then gave her in charge—I went with the policeman to her lodging—she said at the station that it was her lodging—I there found a sheet, a pillow-case, and a quantity of calico, which I had not missed, but knowing that I had some, I suspected it was mine—I also found a flat-iron, an iron-hanger, two tea-spoons, the kitchen-towel, a little handkerchief, and two old pairs of stockings, which I knew all to be mine—these are the articles—she had no right to take these things to her lodging—I have brought the rest of the calico here to identify this piece.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Clare-street, Clare-market; I have a slaughter-house in Sheffield-street, near my dwelling. I have a foreman named Kibot—the prisoner was in my service—it is the custom of the butchers to send various beasts to that slaughter-house to be slaughtered—on the 6th of May twelve beasts were killed—the prisoner and Kibot, my foreman, were there—it is the duty of my men to take a</p>

               <p>portion of the internal fat to the owners of the beasts after they are killed—they have no right to an ounce of it for themselves—I am responsible for every part of the beast—when the work of the day is ended it is the duty of the foreman to come to my house, and to book the number of the boasts that have been killed, and to whom they belonged—Kibot came and booked them, about nine o'clock at night, on the 6th of May—he had the keys of the slaughter-house then in his hand—they had then done work, and he had no occasion to go to the slaughter-house again that night on any business of mine—in consequence of my suspicions, I had got the policeman to watch, and in the course of that night I heard that somebody was in custody at the station—I went—I found the prisoner there—I said, <hi rend="italic">"Joe</hi>, I am very sorry to see you in this situation; you had no occasion to do this from the wages I paid you"—he said, "I have been linked into this"—I said, "What do you mean by being linked in?"—he said a man had given him the fat in Wild-street, close to the tallow-chandler's; he did not know the man, and had never seen him before—there was about 96lbs. weight of fat—amongst the beasts which had been slaughtered that day, there was one the fat of which was of an unusually high colour—I examined the sack of fat slightly that night, and more fully afterwards—it corresponded with the fat of the beasts that had been killed that day, and part of it cor<lb/>responded with that of one bullock that belonged to Mr. Johnson—I went down to my slaughter-house about one o'clock, and found the back door was fastened inside, which I thought could not have been done by a person outside; but I understand since that they had a method of fastening it through a hole, so that the prisoner might have fastened it behind him when he came out.</p>

In consequence of instruc<lb/>tions, I stationed myself in Bear-street, Clare-market, on the evening of tht 6th of May—there is a narrow passage there which leads to the back entrance of Mr. Wood's slaughter-house—I waited till about nine o'clock—I then saw the prisoner leave the slaughter-house, with a sack—he car<lb/>ried it into Wild-street—I followed him—he went into No. 20, which is a shop kept by the witness Mitchell—he put down the sack, and opened a flap in the floor of the shop, put the sack down below, and he followed it—I immediately went into the shop, and slipped down the flap, and saw the prisoner standing by the side of the sack—I saw him take two pieces of fat from his left-hand pocket, and put them into the copper, where the fat was hot—Mitchell then came down the flap—he stirred up the fat in the copper with a stick—the prisoner said, "He will be here directly"—Mitchell said, "Will he?" and he returned to the shop again—soon after, Mitchell came down again, and the prisoner said, "I suppose I can go now?"—Mitchell said, Oh, yes, you can go"—the prisoner was then going away—I stopped him, and told him I was a police-officer, and</p>

I had three bullocks killed at Mr. Wood's slaughter-house on the 6th of May, and one of them was a peculiarly high-coloured fat—none of the others were of that colour—I was at the slaughter-house the whole of the day, and saw the prisoner engaged in dressing that very bullock—I have since been shown a piece of dark-coloured fat, which I compared with my own—it corresponds precisely in colour and quality—I think I can swear safely to it as mine—it ought to have been brought to me by the prisoner, or some one—the moment the fat is cleaned it is brought immediately—I have examined the interior of the bullocks, and have missed a portion of the fat of the three beasts which were killed that day.</p>

I have known Catherine Hayes for thirty-nine years—she lives in a room in Marchmont-street, and it confined to her bed—I go to her once a week, and manage her affairs—the prisoner was in her service—I engaged her, and before she came, which, was on the 28th of Nov., I looked over Mrs. Hayes's drawers—I have not since then observed her things—I was sent for by the landlady of the house on the 22nd of March—the prisoner was then gone away—I found the drawers locked, but when I opened them they were all empty—I missed a blanket and all the other things stated—this is the gown—these are the silver spoons—I swear they are Catherine Hayes's property, and were in the house when the prisoner came—I missed them on the 22nd of March.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the City police. For some time previous to the 18th of April, I had been attending to what was sup<lb/>posed to be going on at the premises of Messrs. Magnay—I understood Ell was their warehouseman—I took him into custody on Friday, the 18th of April, about twelve o'clock at night, at a public-house opposite Messrs. Magnays, at the corner of College-hill—he had been told by the constable, Hay don, what he was taken for—I took him at once to the station—he was examined on the Saturday, at Guildhall, on a charge of robbing his employers—on Monday, the 21st, I went with a warrant to the house of the prisoner Nicholson, in St. Thomas the Apostle—he keeps a stationer's and bookbinder's shop—it is an open shop, about two mi<lb/>nutes' walk from Messrs. Magnay's place of business—I got there about two o'clock—he was out—I found his wife there—I told her I was an officer, and had come to search the premises—I produced the warrant—Mr. George Magnay was with me—I found a great deal of paper about, on shelves and other places—Mr. Magnay examined it, and I took some which he claimed—I have it here—we might have been in the house about two hours—I saw Nicholson at the station two or three hours after I had been at his house, about five or six o'clock—he had been taken by another officer—I showed him the paper which I had brought away—he looked at it, and said, "Mr. Magnay will find himself in the wrong"—I had before that told him where I got the paper—Mr. Magnay was with me, and I told him to state the charge I had against the prisoner, and the charge was entered accordingly, in the police-book, of having in his possession a portion of paper which Mr.</p>

               <p>Magnay claimed as his, and which had been stolen—that was stated in Nicholson's hearing, and on that I produced the paper, and showed it to Nicholson, and said something to the effect that it was but fair that he should see it—he took it up, looked at it, and said, "Ah! Mr. Magnay will find himself in the wrong, I had this paper from so and so,"mentioning two names which I had not heard before, and do not recollect—I will not say whether he mentioned the name of Price—there is some handwriting on some of this paper—Nicholson had not seen the handwriting when he said "Mr. Magnay will find himself wrong," and mentioned the two names—his attention was not directed to the writing during the conversation.</p>

Turner, Thick Laid"—Ell wrote it—this was a discarded wrapper—we sell brown paper wrappers, but these are perfectly, useless, except to light fires—we are—not retail dealers, in the common acceptation of die word—if a customer wants a ream we sell it, but not a sheet of paper—we sell a quire of vellum paper, or half a ream of post paper—on looking through our ledger, I see Ell had two reams of post, and one of yellow-wove foolscap which came to 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., about four months ago, and previous to that some more, making, within the last twelvemonth, about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the clerks in our establishment sell—I take the out-door department, and am out front eleven o'clock in the morning—I am out about half my time—I should think there are not hundreds of these covers in our warehouse—there ought not to be any—they generally go out again on the outside of the paper—it would not be in due course for this to have gone on inside writing paper—this would be put on outside paper—it might have gone out with tome. sort of paper in due course, but it would have been very irregular to have put "Turner Thick Laid Post" on Turner's superfine demy—this would have been a proper description for some kind of paper—this wrapper has no date on it—it is certainly dirty—a dirty wrapper I should call it—it is quite evident it is not a new one—our books are not here—it is only from them that I know what was sold to Ell—there would be nothing irregular in his buying paper of our clerks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything said about a police-officer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said a police-officer had been in the room where Ell and I had been on the 18th, and overheard all our conversation, and to be careful what I said—I had been in a public-house with Ell on the 18th, about half-past twelve o'clock in the morning—he was in company with some one—I waited till they had drank what they were drinking—I then told him I had come down about some out<lb/>sides—he said, "Come along"—he beckoned me outside the house and said, "Follow me"—I said I had been over the way to look at the outsides, and I thought of buying 2 cwt.—he said, "I see you mean business"—I said, "I do," and then we went into a public-house, which I think is Tyler's—(he had showed me a sample sheet of blue-wove foolscap on the previous evening, which I was to have twelve reams of)—when Nicholson called on me on the Monday, he said he was round at Ell's house on the evening that I gave Ell the money for the bill, and he heard all our conversation—I had been at Ell's house at half-past eight o'clock in the evening of the 18th, and had some conversation with him about a bill, and I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not observe that Nicholson was there when I was—I never told Nicholson of my having been at Ell's house on the 18th, or of my having had conversation with him at the public-house—he must have learned that from some other source.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 24, Windsor-street, Islington. I am in the employ of Mr. Paradise, a stationer—I was formerly in the employ of Nicholson for about six months—I left him about two months ago—he then carried on business in the same place, in St. Thomas the Apostle—he had a pretty fair trade—I know Ell by having seen him at Nicholson's—he was there once every day all the while I was there—when he came he gene<lb/>rally spoke to Mr. Nicholson—I had not an opportunity of hearing what they conversed about—it was generally in whispers—he used not to stop very long—there was no particular time when he was in the habit of coming, different hours—I do not know of any dealings between Mr. Nicholson and him—Nicholson kept books of the things he purchased—I heard of Mr. Nicholson being taken into custody the day afterwards—I went to his house on Friday, the 2nd of May, because Mrs. Nichohon wanted to see me—I saw her, and in consequence of what she said I went to Giltspur-street Compter—I there saw Mr. Nicholson, and he asked me if I remembered going to a sale and fetching some things away—I said I did—he then said that the paper Mr. Magnay had seized I had brought from the sale, and he wanted me to go on the following Tuesday to Guildhall to swear to that paper—I said I would—I had no paper at that time shown to me, nor had I seen any—I meant I would go, not that I would swear to the paper—he asked me if I would go on the Monday and help Mrs. Nicholson's brother take the stock of what was in the shop, and he would pay me for my time—the sale which I remember fetching the paper from was at Price's, in Chancery-lane—I had left Nicholson six or seven weeks when he sent for me—the sale took place nearly two months before I left him, nearly three months before I had this conversation with him—I fetched the paper from Price's by desire of Mr. Nicholson—he was at home when I brought it home—I did not examine it at all—I do not know that he knew whether I examined it or not—it was tied up in par<lb/>cels—I did not open it in his presence—it was put away with other papers—I cannot say who put it away, I think it was Mr. Nicholson—the paper that I brought had a common wrapper on it—I think it was demy—it was either post or demy—post would not be letter paper in the folio—this paper is demy—post is rather smaller—I do not think they were brown paper wrappers round the paper I brought—I have no distinct recollection about the paper or wrappers—I went up to Guildhall on the following Tuesday, but I was not examined.</p>

Magnay's was medium, and not demy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Mount-place, White<lb/>chapel-road. On Wednesday evening, the 23rd of April, I was called on to attend a person named Bates, at his own house, in Black Lion-yard—I found him in bed—I examined his leg, which I found had been dislocated at the ancle, also a fracture of the small-bone of the leg, between two and three inches below the knee, a contusion, another contusion behind the right ear, and another under the left eye—they appeared to have been recently done—I saw him again the following morning, and made a further examination—I found contusions about his chest—he continued in that state—there was a considerable change on Saturday evening—he became quite violent and delirious, <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—we could hardly keep him in bed—he died on the Monday morning—in my judgment, the primary cause of death was the accident he had received, from the injury which was done to the ancle-joint, and the constitutional consequences arising from it, the effect produced on the system—I think the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> was the consequence of the injuries he received—he died from the effect of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There was nothing in the contusions you have mentioned of a serious nature? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the small outer bone of the ancle was broken, and the foot turned right out, even the ligaments—dislocation of the ancle-joint is not, generally speaking, a mortal injury—the proximate cause of death was <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—that is a description of insanity generally produced in persons that drink freely—it is sometimes brought on by abstinence from liquor, by persons who have been accustomed to a profuse use of it—we are obliged to give such persons stimulating drinks, which we gradually reduce till we can safely leave them off—I knew nothing of the deceased's habits before fait death—I could judge, from the fact of his having <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, that he must have been given to drink—unless he had been brought to a particular state of health by drinking, I should say a wound of that kind would never have superinduced <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—I gave him stimulants to avoid <hi rend="italic">deli<lb/>rium tremens</hi>—he first exhibited symptoms of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> on Saturday morning—he was allowed a small quantity of stimulant before that—with a wound of that kind, there is a liability to inflammation—we should be obliged to watch the local symptoms, and it would be a reason for not applying stimulants at all unguardedly—he bad quite sufficient stimulant to prevent the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—a wound would not produce <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, under any circumstances—it need not be produced by abstinence from liquor—even from the first instance there was a twitching, a spasmodic affection of the muscles, from the injury to the foot—he died from the exhaustion produced by the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—we could not produce sleep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you the least doubt that that <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> mighthave come on in the event of his having not had that wound, from abstinence from stimulants for five or six days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it might, but it would not have been fatal—I never lost a patient with <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> before—I have had several cases without accident, and never lost one, when taken immediately—the de<lb/>ceased, in his struggles, displaced the ancle-bone again—that would create considerable irritation—I do not consider it had a material tendency to<lb/>wards the fatal result—at that time it did not cause any bad effects—the involuntary spasmodic action of the muscles, actnally drew the joint out of its place again—and during the last day it required a person to keep his hand on the parts, to keep them in apposition—the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> was not the result of abstinence, nor comparatively so, because I allowed him what I thought was right—I can undertake to say that the wound was the proximate cause of the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, by producing irritation of the nervous system.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q. Delirium tremens</hi> is the result of a derangement of the nervous system? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—drinking has a tendency to produce it—any injury would increase the excitement, and bring about that sort of crisis which resulted in <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—the injury was the immediately exciting cause.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Black Lion-yard, Whitechapel. On Wed<lb/>nesday, the 23rd of April, I was in the yard of the Rabbits, at Ilford—I saw the prisoner and the deceased there, sitting on a settle by the side of the window—the deceased was about forty years of age—they were chatting to each other—I did not hear what they were talking about—they had some words—the prisoner got up and threw the beer in the deceased's face, and as he was rising up, the prisoner hit him with his left hand first, and then with his right—Bates rose up again, and they flew at each other—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120170"/>
               <p>they went on to the gravel together—I went to pick Bates up, and his leg was broken—there was a table between them, which was upset and broken before they flew at each other, and the glasses on it—I had seen no act of violence on Bates's part, before the prisoner threw the beer in his face—I do not know whether the table fell on the deceased—he rolled somewhere about the table.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Church-street, Mile-end New Town. I was at the Babbits on the 23rd of April—I did not see the prisoner come in—he and Bates were there when I got there—I called for a pint of beer, and sat down at the end of the table—the prisoner and the deceased sat along side of each other—something arose about Ireland—I heard Bates say, "Oh, I know you never were in Ireland in your life"—he said, "Yes, I have been, many a time"—Bates said, "I would not mind laying you a sovereign you never were in Ireland"—the prisoner pulled out two or three sovereigni, and threw them on the table—I said "Nonsense, what are you throwing your sovereigns about in that manner for? you will lose them"—I do not know that the prisoner was either sober or tipsy, he could walk about very well—I think he had been drinking—he had been riding—he put the sovereigns into his pocket—Sacker came and said to me,"Do you know that man?" (meaning Bates)—I said "Yes, I do, he rode down along with me, and he rode back along with me"—Sacker said, "I wish you would take him away, or lie will knock his head through the window"—before I could out with the words, the prisoner threw the beer in his face—Bates rose from his seat, and was rubbing his face—the prisoner hit him two tremendous blows, and sent him on to the table—a struggle then took place which broke the table—they both fell down right against the carts—Bates was undermost—they both got up together, and rushed at one another, and I could not see anything more, the people all surrounding them—I saw no blow struck by Bates, they were both struggling together over the table—I cannot say whether there was any blow or not—I saw no blow struck before the beer was thrown in his face.</p>

               <p>him—I only know the prisoner by his carrying things for me to the Dock—I knew the deceased as well as the prisoner, and better too—I asked Baylis whether Bates was a friend of his, and if so, it would be much better to tell him to desist or take him away, as I saw the prisoner was so irritated, there might be a quarrel, and he might strike him—almost at the moment I said that, the prisoner threw the beer in the deceased's face, part of it came over me—I had a lad with me, and seeing the prisoner so exasperated I was afraid he would throw the pot, as be stood with it in his hand—I went to push the lad away, and when I turned round they were fighting—the table was knocked down—they fought from that place about three yards before they fell—I saw no blow or attempt at one on the part of Bates till the beer was thrown in his face—they both stood up to fight after the beer was thrown, till they fell against the carts—the table was broken and turned over—they said the deceased had broken his leg—there was no chance of interfering without getting a knock either from one side or the other—Mr. Cleary and Mr. Morgan were, there—I do not think Mr. Othen was outside at the time—he came out afterwards—I saw Bates lifted up from the ground, and I remarked at the time that I thought his ancle was out.</p>

                  </hi> I am a solicitor, and live at Greenwich—I had an infant named Robert Barry Ffinch born on the 21st of Aug.—on Sunday morning, the 4th of May, while in my dining-room with my wife and Mr. Traill, as near as possible at a quarter before ten, the prisoner entered the room in a very excited state, and said, addressing me, as I was facing the door, "Oh, sir, what have I done! what have I done! will you forgive me?" repeating that also—I said, "What?" and immediately rote, as we all did—she said, "Oh, sir, I am a murderer! I hare murdered the baby, I have cut the baby's throat!"—I instantly ran from the room, proceeded to the nursery, and on going into the back nursery, the sleeping nursery, I saw my child in the cot with his head very nearly off—there was one of the ordinary table-knives lying across the child, covered with blood, and I saw, my child was dead—I left the room, and on the landing met Mr. Traill—I called his attention to what had happened, and went down stairs—shortly after I saw the prisoner in what is called my room—she there again addressed me, "Oh, sir, will you forgive me? what have I done! what will become of me?"—I replied, thrusting her from me, as she was going to take hold of me, "You wretch, you have murdered my poor child, who never could have injured you, and you will be hung for it, that is what will become of you," and I thrust her from me—she then went down on her knees and prayed to God to forgive her—a police-officer was sent for, and I gave her in charge—one of her fellow-servants brought her bonnet and shawl down, which she put on—I desired the policeman to take her away—she said, "Oh, Sir, let me stop to change my boots"—I said there was no occasion for that, but the boots were brought down by the servant—she changed</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you notice a change, and that she had become dull and ap<lb/>parently restless within a fortnight or three weeks of this transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had noticed that she was dull, certainly, and remarked it to Mrs. Ffinch, and she was looking unwell—Mrs. Ffinch had applied to the medical man for the usual remedies for her, and that gentleman is in attendance—her mother had been sent for shortly before in consequence of something, and it had been suggested that she should leave—she at first suggested it herself, and afterwards prayed she might be allowed to stay, as I understood from my wife—the servants had had mourning pro<lb/>vided on the death of my father—I heard the prisoner's mother in the boate on Thursday evening, the 1st of May—I have observed the prisoner on her knees at family prayer, but on no other occasion—I do not know of her complaining of her head—I had seen her in the nursery on the morning in question, with the child in her arms about a quarter before nine o'clock—the deceased was not entrusted to her—the upper nurse had the entire charge of the infant, but that morning I saw it in the prisoner's arms—there was not any vindictiveness on her part towards Mrs. Ffinch or the child—she was always treated with kindness, and I believe up to this time was disposed in every way to do what was right towards us—I really think she was fully sensible of the kindness she received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I mean long after she was aware she was about to leave, and Mrs. Ffinch had engaged another person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I think so—when I saw her with the child at a quarter to Dine o'clock she appeared fondling it as a fond woman would do—she bad it in her arms while the nurse got breakfast for the children—I believe her mother is a laundress.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Magistrate of the Southwark police-court. I happened to be at Mr. Ffinch's house on this Sunday morning—I was in the room with Mr. and Mrs. Ffinch when the prisoner entered, and after Mr. Ffinch went up stairs, I followed him, but met him coming out of the inner nursery door—I went forward to the side of the cot, and immediately perceived the child must be dead—it was a sight too horrible for the mother to see, and I went down to prevent her coming up—I afterwards saw the prisoner in Mr. Ffinch's room—I took hold of her hands, and was anxious to have her put in charge of a constable immediately, not knowing what she might do to herself and others—she addressed me by name, and said, "What will become of me! what will be done to me! do you think God will forgive me if I ask pardon, and if I repent?"—she repeatedly used the expression, "I am a murderer! I am a murderer!"—that was when she first came down stairs—I do not recollect her saying anything else but to the same import, repeatedly expressing what would becalled distress of mind,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120175"/>
               <p>from her manner in repeating those expressions, "Oh, what will be done to me! what have I done! what shall I do?"—once or twice she said so to me, addressing me by name—the first time she spoke to me, I think I said, "Poor, miserable wretch!" but did not express any opinion—a policeman came soon after, aud I put her into his hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Her expressions denoted distress of mind; did her actions and manner exhibit great distress? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, greatly so—I should say on her first appearance in the room, notwithstanding her ex<lb/>pression, "Iam a murderer!" my opinion was she had had an accident, and the child had dropped from the window or something, or that it might be the conduct of a person who had merely witnessed such a thing—I heard her say, "What have I done! how could I do it?" and I think her saying "How could I do it?" was what induced me to think it was not a wilful act, but some great carelessness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was her general manner and language that of a person who had become conscious of her act after it was done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a question I hardly dare answer—I had seen her ever since she was in the service—she knew me perfectly—I always observed her to be a very respectable servant—I have seen her with the children, but I thought her a dispirited girl from the very beginning of her being there—that was merely from her counten<lb/>ance—I had no further opportunity of observing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am upper nurse in Mr. Ffinch's family—I have been there two years on the 8th of June—I came after the prisoner. On Sun<lb/>day morning, the 8th of May, I attended to the infant as usual, and placed it asleep in the cot, about half-past nine o'clock—the prisoner had nursed it before that, while I did something else in the nursery—she did not often have it in the morning—she had it at other times in the day, and always appeared to treat that and the other children with great kindness—after I placed the child asleep in the cot, the prisoner assisted me in making a bed in that room, and, while doing so, she asked me if I thought Mrs. Ffinch would forgive her, and allow her to stop there—I said, "Martha, Mrs. Ffinch will not let you stop, and you had better be quiet, it will be much better for you to be quiet"—she said nothing, but stood for a moment, as if she was in a study, biting her nails—I had occasion immediately after to go down stairs—she had then left off biting her nails, and was doing the back nursery, when I went away—that is the room the infant was in, and the bed which we were making—three elder children were in the other nursery, and the door between them wide open—I went down into the back yard, and there I heard a screaming in the house—I had not seen the prisoner after leaving her up stairs—she was the only person left there when I came down, and had the care of the children there—while she was in the service I considered her of a very kind disposition—the children were very fond of her—there had been a death in the family, and we were all put into mourning, about a month, or rather more, before this—Mrs. Ffinch went to Dover about three weeks before—the prisoner had the same</p>

               <p>mourning given her as the other servants—she complained of one of the dresses not fitting her, and had it altered many times—she was then not satisfied with it—I did not see anything the matter with it myself—it fitted her very nicely indeed—I noticed about the time the mourning was given that she did not look so well, and was rather low in spirits at times, but I did notice anything else—after Mrs. Ffinch went to Dover, she ripped the body off the skirt of the dress, and said she would burn it—I said, "No, Martha, you never intend to burn it?"—she said, "Yes"—she took the whalebone out, and ripped the body right up, and out the body into the middle of the flame, poked it in with the poker, and quite destroyed the body, but did not destroy the skirt—I said I would inform Mrs. Ffinch, for she was a wicked girl to do so—Mrs. Ffinch returned on the 25th of April—I told her the next day—I was present when Mrs. Ffinch told her she was very sorry to hear the account I had given about her; she certainly could not put up with it; it was very wrong, and she certainly must leave her; that she must be in a great passion to do such a thing, and if she did such things she must leave her service—her mother was sent for in consequence of this—she came on Thursday, the 1st of May—Mrs. Ffinch then promised to overlook this, and she was to stay—Mrs. Ffinch told her mother and her, that if she ever heard anything more about the dress, or its going to the dressmaker to be altered again, she should leave her service.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner appear to you at that time to have a great desire to remain in the service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, she did not—she then seemed to have a wish to leave, to be a housemaid—the next day (Friday, the 2nd of May) the pri<lb/>soner was sent out to fetch the children from school—I did not see her take the dress out with her, but she was gone a long time, and when she came back Mrs. Ffinch inquired the cause of her staying—she came in with the drew in her hand, and said she had been to the dressmaker's again—Mrs. Ffinch said, "You remember, Martha, what I said to you last night, that if I heard anything more about the dress you must leave, and now you must leave"—the prisoner began to cry, and said she was very sorry, and she hoped she should not leave—she asked her mistress to allow her to stop several times, and next day, Saturday, she again asked to be allowed to stay—I have heard her say many times she should never be happy again if she went away—Mrs. Ffinch told her on the Saturday that she had been to Deptford to see for a young woman to come and take her place in the nursery—the prisoner said she was very sorry indeed, she hoped Mrs. Ffinch would forgive her, and let her stop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner say anything more on that Saturday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not notice—she appeared very comfortable indeed all the Saturday afternoon, and more cheerful; indeed I heard her singing a song in the afternoon—on the Sunday morning, at breakfast-time, she said, did I know when mistress was going about the young woman—I said, "I believe to<lb/>morrow, Martha"—she said she did not like another one to come in her place, and she would not go—she had been for some weeks before taking medicine—she complained of her head about a month before Mrs. Ffinch went to Dover—she said she had a very curious aching pain in her head—she had been taking medicine for some weeks before this Sunday, and said her head was better—I had not heard her complain of her head for some time—she was very much liked in the family, and treated with great kindness—I do not remember any conversation with her on the Saturday night before this—but I noticed her being very sleepy—she sat down and went to sleep after the children went to bed—on that Saturday (I think</p>

               <p>some time in the morning) I was in the nursery with her, and some of the children were there—she said "I need not make myself so unhappy as I do, anybody would think I have committed a murder, but I have not done so"—I said, "Martha, don't talk in that way, I hope you will never be guilty of such a crime as that"—she made answer, "Did you ever know of a woman being hung? I never heard of a woman being hung"—I answered, "Why, Martha, if they commit murder they are hung as well as men are hung"—she said she would rather be hung than transported or put into a madhouse—that was all that passed then—I said nothing to introduce this conversation, she began it herself—she was continually talking about leaving, she was very sorry she was going to leave—the idea of leaving was always on her mind after Mrs. Ffinch was firm and told her she should leave—it seemed to be uppermost in her thoughts—from that time it was her constant talk—she did not say anything about Georgians, the next youngest child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> She had herself expresed a wish to leave some time before this happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and to go as housemaid—she said Greenwich did not agree with her, and her health was bad—she told her mistress so—that was full a fortnight or three weeks before this—the dress, in my judgment, fitted her very well indeed—she said it did not fit her, and she would not wear it—she wished the dress at the very devil—after that she went out and bought some stuff of the same kind, and made another body to it—the family were very kind indeed to her—she wanted for nothing, either money or anything else—I afterwards found she had been to the pawnbroker's and pawned the dress she had made the new body to—on her return from fetching the children from school she came in with the dress in her hand, and on seeing it, Mrs. Ffinch told her she must leave—from that time she appeared in a state of melancholy and wretchedness.</p>

On the Sunday morning I opened the door to Mr. Traill, about twenty minutes to ten o'clock, then returned to the kitchen, and saw Sarah May, the nurse, with the little girl—I left the kitchen for a short time—on my return I saw the prisoner—she went into the pantry—I followed her there, and saw her take a large knife out of the box—she held it in her hand—I asked her what she was going to do with. it—she said she was going to cut a pencil for Miss Mary—I told her I thought the small one would do better—she said she would take the large one too, as that would do to cut the bread and butter in the afternoon—she was feeling the blade of the large knife—she went up stairs with both knives in her hand—a short time after this I heard screams, and went np into the hall, saw the prisoner there, and heard Mr. Ffinch, in a very ex<lb/>cited state, say, "Oh, my dear baby, my dear baby!"—I saw the prisoner there, and said, "Martha, what on earth is the matter with the baby?"—she said, "Good God, I have cut the dear baby's throat!"—I had no<lb/>ticed</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Greenwich. I attend the prosecutor's family—I was desired to send the prisoner some medicine on the 31st of March, which I did—she had admitted me that day at the house, but I did not see her to put any professional questions to her—Mrs. Ffinch mentioned to me that there bad been irregularities, or rather a suspension of the constitutional functions for some months—the medicine I gave her was intended to counteract that.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that one of the acts of violence exhibited under such circumstances, likely to have arisen remotely from the disease under which she was la<lb/>bouring? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I so considered it—it was an act of caution on my part—she had taken medicine I believe up to the very day of this melancholy aifair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We have heard the waywardness, or inconsistency of design; first thinking Greenwich did not agree with her, and she should leave, then being quite melancholy at the idea of leaving, and agree to stay: are these symptoms such as you would naturally expect to find in a person labouring under this complaint? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are just the symptoms I should expect to find.</p>

On Sunday, the 20th of April, between one and two o'clock, I saw the prisoners Blundell and Jemima Wilson at the station-house, and, while there, I saw Blundell put something into his mouth, which he appeared to swallow with great diffi<lb/>culty—I said they should be searched—the female prisoner was taken to the back of the station-house by the female searcher, who after<lb/>wards returned, and said Jemima Wilson had two keys which she refused to give up—I said they would be taken from her if she did not—she then produced them—I went to No. 10, Eaton-street, New-cut, Black-friars-road, with Romain, a constable, and there found the prisoner Ann lying on the floor between the bedstead and cupboard—as we went into the room Romain turned his light on—she looked up, and said, "I thought it was my sister come," and asked where she was—I said, "She is locked up at the station, you had better get up and dress your<lb/>self"—Romain took a candle off the bedstead, and lighted it—I saw something white in the cupboard, and found a mould there, which I produce—I found a file on the same shelf, five counterfeit penny pieces, and this bag, with "Robson, plaster-of-Paris manufacturer, Mount-pleasant," on it—I found some pieces of metal in the cupboard called <hi rend="italic">gets</hi>, which fit the mould, and some pieces of run metal among the cinders under the fire-place—I found some more pieces of plaster-of-Paris between the stove and the wall—there were small splashes of white metal in the front of the stove, and about the bars—I said to Ann Wilson, "I have found a mould and several counterfeit coins here, you must go to the station"—she said,</p>

               <p>"I do not live here, it is my sister's room; I live at No. 12, and will show you"—I tried the keys to the door, and found both of them locked and un<lb/>locked the room door—it was not fastened when I went in—I asked Ann how she got in—she said she burst the door open to lie down, as her sister was out—I went with her to No. 12—she pointed out the back, parlour on the ground floor as her room—as we went in she said something I did not understand, but she seemed surprised that there was no furniture there—the room was empty—I examined the fire-place, and behind it and under it, in the ashes, I found these pieces of plaster-of-Paris, which appear like broken moulds—the floor before the hearth was loose—I took up four boards, went under the flooring, and found this broken pipkin, which appears to have burst on the fire, as the metal appears to have flown from it—there are portions of metal in it—I found other pieces of plaster-of-Paris under the floor—as I was tying them up, Ann said, "I know nothing of them"—I found one key locked and unlocked the door of No. 12, but not the other.</p>

               <p>eight o'clock in the morning, a woman came to my shop and asked for some tobacco—about two hours after she was gone, the prisoner came in—he asked me if I was a buyer of soap and candles—I said, "No"—I asked him to show me a list, which he produced—I asked if he was a traveller for that party, which was James Hibbald, whose name appeared on the list—I knew that house—the prisoner represented that he came from James Hibbald—he said so—he mentioned the name of James Hibbald, of No. 119, Bishopsgate-street—I gave him an order for a pound of rotten stone, and a pound of black lead, as a sample, to be supplied from James Hibbald's bouse—he brought the goods himself about three o'clock in the afternoon, with this paper marked A—the writing was all there with the exception of the receipt, which he wrote before me, "Settled same time, J. H."—I paid the money, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he wrote that as the receipt—he put the "J. H." in my presence—those goods were genuine—he left a sack, and said he would call again at seven o'clock in the after<lb/>noon—about an hour after he left, the same female who had been before came in again—the prisoner called again at seven o'clock—I asked him if he could bring me 141bs. of each, the same as the sample—he said he would—he brought 14lbs. of each—I did not undo those goods till I went to Worship-street—I then undid one parcel which he had represented as 14lbs. of black lead, and there was only 4lbs. of black lead, the rest was coal—that bill came to 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid him, and he signed that bill before me the same as the other—he affected to have authority to sign Hibbald's name—I was surprised at his signing "J. H."—I asked him how it was he brought me a bill, not a printed bill head—he said he was so late that night, he merely wrote it out in a hurry—when he went away, I asked him to leave me one of those lists—he refused, saying he had only one—he said he would send me one with the goods—as fast as I bought these goods a woman came to buy them again—she said she would pay me directly, but I did not let her have them—I have never seen her since—I have the goods and the bills here—I went to Mr. Hibbald's next morning, on discovering rubbish instead of the things I had ordered—he represented himself as a seller of soap and candles, and produced this list, which I looked over—I asked the price of the black lead and rotten stone—I asked if I could have 1lb. of each as a sample—he said decidedly so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot<lb/>man to Mr. Airth Mungo, who keeps the George public-house in the Camberwell-road, in the parish of Camberwell. I fastened up the house on Sunday night, the 4th of May, about twelve o'clock, or twenty minutes after—I fastened the front door with an iron bar and a prop, and the back door in the same way—there is an inner door near the bar, leading to the private part of the house, that fastens with I bolt only, nearest to the bar—I bolted it—about ten minutes after one I was called by the police—I went down stairs, and found the till taken out of its place, and put on the counter—I had left it in its place under the counter, and a little copper money in it—I believe none was taken—the doors were all three unfastened and open—about eleven o'clock on the Sunday night I had seen three persons in the tap-room—I believe the prisoner to be one of them—I saw them come in and out—the last time I saw them was coming in—I did not go into the tap-room after that, and did not see them go out—when called by the police I observed some soot on the counter, and likewise about the stove in the tap-room—I saw a cap and a pair of shoes lying there—they were also sooty—a person could get from the back of the house over the garden fence, and so get away over an open piece of ground—the policeman has the shoes.</p>

About nine o'clock, on Saturday morning, the 3rd of May, I saw the prisoner come into my shop, take a piece of calico, put it under his arm, and walk off with it—I followed him, and called," Stop thief!"—I saw him drop it, and picked it up—it is my property.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bridge-road, Battersea, and am a carpenter. I was in the crowd, and saw the prisoner draw a handkerchief between me and Mr. Gray—I am sure it was the prisoner—he stood behind me and Mr. Gray—I saw his hand draw from between me and Mr. Gray—the prisoner turned round, and Mr. Gray turned and laid hold of him by the cuff of his coat—I saw the handkerchief drop from the prisoner—I am sure it dropped from him, and he ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Salisbury-crescent, Walworth. On the 30th of April, about ten or eleven o'clock at night, I was in the Dover-road, on my way home—the prisoner addressed me, and asked me to give her a glass of ale—in order to get rid of her I consented, as I had been annoyed on similar occasions—she wished me to go to a public-house which I did not like the appearance of—I said I would give it her at another house—we crossed the road for that purpose, and she was leading me a way I did not like, and wished to get away—I turned and saw two men who were following us, the prisoner being close to me, and speaking vociferously tome—one of the men then passed very close, and thrust the prisoner against me—the men then went off, one one way, and the other the other—immediately after I said, "I must go," and the prisoner let go of my arm—I put my hand to feel for my purse and watch, and I missed my purse which contained three sovereigns and some silver, which I had seen safe about two hours before.</p>

In 1843 I carried on the business of a baker—I ceased to do so on the 31st of Dec. 1844.—I was brought up a farmer—the prisoner came into my service in 1843—he was to bake bread for me—it was part of his duty to carry out bread to my customers, but not without my leave—he had a guinea a-week, and a quartern of bread a-day, and a quartern of flour on Saturday nights—he continued in my service till the 25th of April, 1844—he never had his</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When an article was delivered out of your warehouse on an order of this kind, did you book the order to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We book it to the party we deliver it to, not to the prisoner—we did not hold the prisoner responsible for the amount in any way—he did not receive any commission on sales—we took him on com<lb/>mission in May, but in Nov., from some circumstances, we found it right to alter the plan, and to give him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week instead of commission—he received his 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. every Saturday night—we began that in the early part of Dec.—we have paid him nothing in commission since that—the commis<lb/>sion he had from May to Nov. was fifteen per cent.—I will swear he was not to have ten per cent after that—the arrangement was made by myself and partner—there was an arrangement that if the commission on his sales would have exceeded 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per year he was to have it made up in commis<lb/>sion, but his sales were far less than that—there was no time named when we were to ascertain whether his sales had or had not exceeded 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we did not contemplate any time, considering that he would hardly make it to the amount—if he had, he would have been entitled to a commission of fifteen per cent on the excess of sales—this order was for Thomas East, Goldsmith-row, Hackney-road, and I presume our carman found Mr. East at that direction—I was at the police-court—Mr. Price attended from Messrs. Potter and Collingridge as our solicitor—he called Mr. East, on the part of the prosecution, but he varied much from what he stated to me in the first instance—there have repeatedly been complaints made of orden having been obtained by the prisoner, and the persons afterwards refusing to take the goods—I have blamed the prisoner for it exceedingly—we never told him to the effect that if it happened again he should be at the cost of the articles, nor conveyed that to him—we blamed him for getting fictitious orders when the people would not take them in, and he had not seen the people—we took him last May—we exacted security from him to the amount of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you receive securities from him to the amount of at least 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly, from inquiry they are not worth that—I should think 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the outside of the value of them—I believe they were papers connected with his wife's property, but I have not seen them—they are in the possession of Potter and Collingridge—they made out the deed—I cannot say personally that I have ever seen that deed—my partner has—I have been told he has been obliged to effect a life assurance to the amount of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not seen it—very likely my partner has it—I know the prisoner pays an insurance, which is to keep us secure against any defalcation of his—we have been applied to by the prisoner or his solicitor for a statement of our account, <hi rend="italic">pro</hi> and <hi rend="italic">con.</hi>—we have not given it, and I can give you a reason why—after the charge was made against the prisoner, East went at nine o'clock one night to our foreman's wife—I did not see him, but I received a communication from our foreman, who is not here—I have not the least doubt that East offered the money—when we took the prisoner, he had a connexion—he has done a very good trade</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120217"/>
               <p>for us, and has increased our business considerably—he brought his con<lb/>nexion with him, and may have obtained us sales to the amount of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—that is quite the outside—I state that from recollection—we know all his connexions now—we have employed a party in his stead, and at the same salary—we do not mean to give up his connexion now we have got it—six months is the usual credit we give to our customers.</p>
