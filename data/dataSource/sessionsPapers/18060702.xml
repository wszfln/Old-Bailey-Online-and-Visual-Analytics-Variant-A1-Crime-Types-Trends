             sworn. I attend at Mr. Williams' as one of his clerks; I was going into Mr. Williams' back gate, I met a woman coming out, I perceived she had something bulky under her cloak; Mr. Young, another clerk, came up, we asked her what she had got there, she said nothing, she had been speaking to the lady; I said there was no lady, she then said the young woman; we let the prisoner go, and asked the servants if they had seen such a person; they said no; they went to see if any thing was missing, and as soon as they found any thing was missing, four of us went in pursuit of her different ways, I went the wrong way.</p>

I do; I saw the prisoner pass by the door as I was sitting in the counting-house, and as she was going out I went and asked her what she wanted, she said nothing, she had been speaking with the lady; I asked her what lady, she said the young woman, and from something that I saw projecting under her cloak I had some suspicions; I went and enquired of the servants if they had seen such a person, they said no; the first witness then went into the room to see if there was any thing missing; he immediately missed the tea caddy; we then went in pursuit of her, she was brought back to the house, I saw the tea caddy and the writing desk in her possession, and I went with her to the officer.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer. On the 30th of May I was sent for; Bishop and I went to Mr. William's house, I found the prisoner in the yard, and received charge of her and took her to the office; I received the tea chest and the desk at the office from Mr. Mackenna, they were tied up in this apron, which the prisoner said was hers.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mackenna) Did you know them before you saw them in the possession of the woman. - A. Yes, I can swear that they belong to Mr. Williams, they were taken from the back parlour; I missed the tea caddy immediately the alarm was given, I had seen them she morning before, one of the seals in the desk was marked with a W, the other is a wafer stamp; I have no doubt but the whole is Mr. Williams' property.</p>

             said to you, did you go to the shop of Bastin. - A. I did; she came to me that morning, I believe, about nine o'clock; when I went to his shop Bastin was not at home, I searched his shop, and I found five heads of Dutch flax behind the counter, placed in a corner; Bastin came into the shop; as soon as I had found the flax I said to him, Mr. Bastin I am looking for some property that does not belong to you, and here is something here that does not belong to you; he replied I have been to the barber's shop to be shaved, and since I have been gone somebody has thrown this into the shop, I know nothing about it, if it is your property take it away; no, says I, I cannot take it away, I will tell my son of it; I went and told my son of it, leaving the flax with Bastin in his shop: my son and his partner went.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer of Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner. - A. About four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on this day that we have been speaking of, see the prisoner any where. - A. In Portland-street, St. James's, Westminster, about twelve o'clock in the day; I suspected her, and followed her into Poland-street, she stopped at the corner of Poland-street, in Oxford-street, and put something in her pocket and took something out.</p>
               <p>Court. She was putting her hands in her pocket. - A. Yes, for about half a minute, and then walked on again, she turned into the sign of the King's Arms, in Poland-street, at Mr. Brown's, I staid out till she came out, and then I went in and enquired what she had changed there. Mrs. Brown produced this sixpence, she said this sixpence was the sixpence that she had paid her. I produce the sixpence. I rubbed the sixpence on the stairs with my foot, to ascertain whether it was a bad one, and marked it, and desired her to keep it by itself; I then followed the prisoner, and took her in custody, in Marlborough-street, close by the office; she immediately put her hand and took out this brown paper, I suspected she was going to throw it away, I immediately seized both her hands, and took her into the office, where after some time struggling, we got the paper out of her hand, I found it contained two more sixpences, which I now produce, I have had them ever since; I searched her, and found a red pocket book, a new tooth brush, and about thirteen pennyworth of new halfpence, here is six pennyworth of them, and Jackson has got the rest, they were all good copper; we had some discourse who gave charge of her, she said if I liked she need not be prosecuted, I told her it did not rest with me, it was with the gentlemen who conducted the mint, I should take her before the magistrate; at the office I received that sixpence of Mrs. Brown, I have had it ever since; I was in court at Clerkenwell when sentence was passed upon her.</p>

               <p>Q. And these trowsers you put under your head. A.Yes, I had them under my head when they came on me; these three prisoners were along with the man that held me; the prisoner that stands outside took the trowsers away from me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020006"/>Q. What were the others doing there. - A. The young one, when they talked of one another's name, desired no name to be expressed.</p>
               <p>Q. When they got the trowsers what did they do next. - A. They went away from where I said and left them, after they had been there a good piece of time.</p>
               <p>Q. They took the money and the purse, and left the trowsers, how long had they been doing this. - A. They were about fifteen minutes as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you talking to them. - A. No, the man that held me was hurting me, I struggled to get from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a quarter of an hour kneeling upon you. - A. He was near a quarter of an hour, he used very odious expressions.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it star light or moon light. - A. It was not moon light, it was very bright.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see their faces. - A. Yes, and the man who held me had a smock frock on, the others were dressed much as they are now, only one of them had not a white jacket on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen either of them before. - A. I might have seen them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had or not. - A. I cannot say, because I was in that place a year before.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did they go when they left you. - A. They went out of the yard over into another yard of the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do. - A. I was gathering up the things I had laying in the hay, they came into the back yard again and went over the meadows, they did not speak a word to me the second time, nor I to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow them. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you give any alarm. - A. As soon as the public house was open in the morning, I told the waiter how I had been used.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any of the men again. - A. That very morning, at six o'clock, I saw the man that held me.</p>
               <p>Q. I am asking of them three men at the bar. - A. I saw them in the back yard the next day, and one of them struck me, that big man; I saw them all four together in the hay yard of the public house where I had been sleeping.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they drinking in the house. - A. I saw them there, it was in the yard where they abused me, they came to me and asked me if they had robbed me, I said to the man that held me, these three men robbed me while you held me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they taken into custody at that time. - A. No, they went away to work, they wrought at Mr. Small's that lives just by the side of this place, I went to their master that they wrought with, and they abused me again, that was in the afternoon; I had not a farthing to go to any justice's on the day they robbed me, which was Thursday, but on Monday I went to Bow-street, and got an officer to take them up; one was taken in the same public house, one in his master's-yard, in the same place, and the other between the public house and his master's yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your money again. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. I presume that you (from your dialect) are an Irish labourer, and when you cannot get work at one place you go to another. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You understand that these men are tried for their lives. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you understand there is a reward. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not you told that. - A. I was told that I would get for my loss of time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this hay yard a place where Irish labourers sleep. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Who slept there besides yourself. - A. There was another man that slept in the hay that saw every thing they did to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him to assist you in taking up these persons that had robbed you. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. These men were on the spot from the Thursday to the Monday at work there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take any thing from the other man. - A. No, they spoke to him, he told him there were women enough if they would go to the other yard.</p>
               <p>- COX sworn. I am one of the conductors of the patrole at Bow-street. I apprehended Baxter in the tap room, I apprehended Jarrard in Mr. Small's yard, and Althorpe I apprehended in a foot path opposite Mr Small's gate; the prosecutor pointed them out to me.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable belonging to the police office, Shadwell. On Friday the 30th of May Mrs. Bedford applied to me between the hours of eight and nine in the morning, she told me her place had been broken open and she had been robbed; I went to her house with her, I met the woman prisoner in the alley, she was very much in liquor; I told her I was come after her, she said she was very glad of it, I told her to go up stairs and shew me her room; Mrs. Bedford, me, and the woman prisoner went up stairs together; in searching the room, at the foot of the bedstead I perceived some dirty linen, under which was this hammer, there was a large jar stood in the room with a small top to it; in that jar I perceived there was a pair of drawers and some other foul linen; it smelled in such a manner we could not take it out, I kept the hammer in my hand, I told the woman prisoner and Mrs. Bedford to go up stairs before me, that I might see in what manner the room was broken open; I then found the box was broken open with the claws of a hammer; and with the hammer that I have got in my hand; I fitted the claws to the marks on the box, it corresponded exactly in two different places, I then examined the door post, and there was the print of the claws of the hammer there; I brought the box and the woman down stairs: Mrs. Bedford followed us. A gentleman of the name of Palmer came over, he said that is my hammer, he said the woman prisoner borrowed the hammer of him about five o'clock; I told him that hammer had broken open this box. (The box, hammer, and shift, produced.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this conversation in the presence of the prisoner. - A. It was, Mrs. Bedford said she had a shift in such a state she could not well make away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020008"/>with; the next morning I went down to the premises again at her desire, and I searched the premises, and in this jar where the soul linen was, I found this shift in the right thigh of a pair of flannel drawers; Mrs. Webb took the shift out, and Mr. Rogers took out his knife and cut it across the bosom, and gave it to Mrs. Webb in the presence of me and Mrs. Bedford, and after it was clean she returned it to Mr. Rogers again.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I understand you right, the shift was in the thigh of the prisoner's trowsers; where did you find the pitcher when you saw it a second time. - A. I saw it in the same place where I had seen it the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the day before there was a shift lost. - A. Yes, but it was in a very awkward situation for me to search for it; there was an Irish woman there, she put her hands in, it smelt so I turned my head round and went to the other part of the room.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer. On the evening of the 30th the prosecutrix came up to the office and enquired for Mr. Brown, I told her he was not in the way, and whatever was necessary I would do for her; I went to the pawnbroker's, where I found a big Irish woman with the key of her room, I examined the bundle she had got, they appeared to belong to the prisoner; I went with the prosecutrix to the prisoner's room, I opened the prisoner's room door with the key I received of the Irishwoman who had gone to pawn the things, I searched the room and looked into this pan as described by the other evidence, I saw something that looked like drawers, it smelt so bad I went away; the next morning Brown and I went down with a search warrant, Brown went-up stairs, and the prosecutrix and the last witness; the prosecutrix shewed me a dirty shift they had brought down stairs, it was in a very wet disagreeable state (I produce the shift), I took a knife and cut this mark in it, I told the prosecutrix to mark it; she stitched some yellow thread in the breast of it, I told them to put it in a clean state and return it to me, which they did in about half an hour; I have had them in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that mark you find there correspond with the mark you made. - A. Exactly, and here is also the yellow thread.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. The Irishwoman was stopped in the pawnbroker's shop. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The shift when you found it you cut a mark in it, and the prosecutrix made a mark on it, I take it for granted there was no mark before. - A. It was for my satisfaction that she put a mark on it.</p>

            's Defence. When I came in there was a great alarm, Mrs. Bedford said she had been robbed and I well knew it, she had lost every thing; I said we had been out ever since seven or eight o'clock, it is now twelve o'clock; she had a pint of gin on the table, and there were four or five people sitting with her; she said they left her nothing, what says I, have they left you nothing, why the green gown that you pulled off is there hanging up; yes, says she, they have left me that to change. On the morning that Mr. Brown came I had borrowed a washing tub, and Mr. Brown took the things out, and the girl that stood there put them in one by one, the tub belonged to her; as to the things that were put in this jar I know nothing of, nor do I know of Mrs. Bedford's room being broken open; there were two foreigners that slept in that room.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she purchase the one you shewed her. - A. She did not; when I was down stairs I heard a noise, I came up stairs, my lad was gone after her, my wife accused her of taking away something that did not belong to her; when she was brought back I sent for Mr. Littlewood, she was searched, and these gold keys were found upon her; my wife had taken the parasol from her before.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner. - A. Yes, I knew her a good while, she had lodged with me, but not of late; I missed the property last Sunday was a week, I missed a ten pound bank note, three one pound notes, three guineas in gold, these two pieces of flannel, and the napkin; the purse was wrapped up in the flannel, the purse had the three guineas at one end, and the bank notes at the other end, it was in a deal box under my bed on Thursday before the twelfth of June, I had it in my hand and told it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lives in your family besides yourself. - A. Nobody; I heard something which made me suspect her, I went to her room and examined her, she said she knew nothing at all about it, I insisted upon breaking open her box except she would give me the key; with great persuasion she gave me the key, and the first thing that I saw was these two pieces of flannel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body with you when you found it. - A. Yes, the man of the house, she said it had been there for a month; I asked her what was become of the money that was in it, she said that I had not a farthing of money in my box; then I insisted upon searching her pocket, she said she would not be searched without I had a search warrant; I can swear to the flannel, I wore it about my legs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been living with this man four years as his wife, these flannels were hanging on the line in the passage, he got up in a passion, and told me he would kick me down stairs: I tore my clothes from off the line and these flannels; they have been in my trunk ever since last May; he was mad and jealous because I was going to marry a Frenchman.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

             sworn. I am constable of Queenhithe ward. On the 31st of May, about the hour of twelve o'clock, this woman was brought into the watchhouse; I produce the basket and the two pots that were in it; I produce an iron pot found in the fire place in the prisoner's room, with solder at the bottom, by which we believe her to be in the habit of melting pots down.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Wright) Is that the basket she had in her hand. - A. Yes; the iron pot is mine; the prisoner rented a ready furnished room of me, I cleaned that pot out when she came into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it the appearance of metal at the bottom of it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It has the appearance of metal in it now. - A. It has.</p>

             sworn. I am a pawnbroker, I live at No. 15. Church street, Bethnal Green. On Saturday the 24th of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar brought a table spoon broken in three parts to sell, I asked him how he came by it, he said he found it in the road in Shoreditch, I asked him where he lived and his employer's name; he said his master lived in Hackney, his name was Brown; I told him I would go with him to his master's, he said very well, and we went down the street together; going along he said his master lived some distance farther. I told him if he would go with me to Worship street, I had a friend there who knew most of the gentlemen there; he went with me very quietly to the Northumberland Arms in Worship street; there I gave him and the spoon to Mr. Armstrong.</p>

             sworn. On Saturday the 24th of May I was at the Northumberland Arms, next door to the office: I received charge of the prisoner with Vickery, and this broken spoon I heard the lad say that he found it in the street.</p>
               <p>- VICKERY sworn. After the prisoner was committed, he said he wished he had told the magistrate the truth, he wished me to let him have pen, ink, and paper, and he would write it; I said you had better tell me, because if you write it, I must see it before it goes; then he said his master's name was Young, he lived at Lamb farm, and this spoon was in the hog tub; he took it away and was going to buy his master a new one.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is not any mark on the spoon, I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I worked with this gentleman above a twelvemonth with my own tools; his tools and my tools I carried all in one in my apron sometimes to my apartment, and as we wanted them we fetched them. we used each other's tools, his tools were nothing to me, I did not want to sell them; he called me from the shop, and this gentleman took me; he said, he had found some tools in my room; he knew at the same time some must be in my apartment; I have done very imprudent, owing to his not lending me the one pound note.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever find your property. - A. Yes, I went to this woman's house, I accused her of taking the gown, she after denying it a long time. she opened her drawers and produced the gown; I took possession of the gown and gave her in charge of an officer; I produce the gown, it is mine, there is my private mark on it.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable of Hackney. The prisoner and the prosecutor were sitting together on the bench in the tap room, I saw the prisoner take a seven shilling piece out of his pocket and lay it on the bench, he took it up again and put it in his mouth; I had charged him with picking the man's pocket, and the people in the tap room threatened him, he took it out of his mouth; then Tom Stevenson took the money and gave it to me, some of the money was on the ground; as we were coming to town the next day, he said he did not think of doing what he had done five minutes before; he said that as he was going to have his hearing.</p>

             sworn. I am a hair-dresser by trade, I live with my mother at Hackney; I was down in the cellar, I heard somebody say there was a man picking another man's pocket; I came up and found a seven shilling piece lay on the bench, there was some silver and halfpence on the floor, I sent for a constable, and I delivered it to Mr. Carr. (The money produced).</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot swear to money.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you about you. - A. I had a seven shilling piece, three shillings, two sixpences, and fifteen halfpence, that is exactly the sum I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q.(to Stevenson) Was not the man in liquor. - A.No, he had only two pints of beer.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him drop any money on the floor. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am not guilty of the charge that is alledged against me; instead of the prosecutor putting the money in his pocket, he kept it in his hands and dropped asleep, then it dropped out of his hands, I picked it up and put the seven shilling piece in my mouth while I put the other money in his pocket.</p>

Yes, about a quarter past two I saw two of them come along, the wooden legged man, the prisoner, was behind with his coat off, following the other man with the box; I followed them down to my partner, and I called out stop them; immediately we took them to the watchhouse, the prisoner said he was the owner of the box; in the watch-house he said his name was Williams, at the watch-house he again claimed the box to be his; the other man run away; I looked at the direction of the box after he said his name was Williams; I went down to Darkhouse-lane, and that is the way we found where the box came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Do know this man. - A. I have seen him several times before.</p>

               <p>Q. When the box was brought in did the prisoner claim the box as his. - A. Yes; I asked him what the box contained, he only said it was his box and I might open it.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did he give at that time. - 
               <persName id="t18060702-28-person279">A. Joseph Williams</persName>
             was the name that he gave at the watch-house, No. 22, Essex street, Whitechapel; in consequence of the direction on the box not agreeing, I told him I must take him to the Counter unless he could give a better account of himself; he said he could not help it; I went down immediately to the Darkhouse and found where it had been taken from about three quarters of an hour before; I have had the box in my possession ever since; I and the officer went to his house and found the prisoner lived, there but not by that name.</p>

Fishers and Wells' in Fleet street; I paid for these articles in a five pound note, I received a two pound note in exchange.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing remarkable in the two pound note. - A. There was a shilling difference between the shopwoman and me, I cast it up outside of the note; when I returned home I put the note in a bag, which I generally put the money that I take of Mr. Hall, I placed the bag in a closet in the ware room, I locked the closet door, and put the key on the corner of a shelf (there was other money in the bag which I had received of him); I then went to market; this was about eleven or twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Had he access to that closet. - A. Yes, he sold medicine when I was out of the way, he was my clerk, in short he was every thing to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. How long were you absent. - A. I suppose not more than half an hour; in about half an hour after my return I went to my closet, I went to my bag, I observed the notes that I had put in very tight together were shook loose; I then said to Mr. Hall who has been here, have you sold any thing, he said nobody has been here; I then was very warm on losing my two pound note out of the bag.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure that the two pound note you received at Fisher and Wells' you put in that bag. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the two pound note that was missing. A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether any thing material passed between you and the prisoner. - A. I do not know any thing particular than I saw he was frightened, Mr. Swinton being there at the time I mentioned it to him; I went to the Mansion house about half past one, I had a coach and I went there very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was the prisoner taken up. - A. Not on that day, it was the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned from the Mansion house to your own house was the prisoner there. - A. He was, not knowing where I had been; on the next day I applied to Weatherfield, I sent him to my house, I told him that was his prisoner, Weatherfield, with Kimber, another officer, searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing found upon the prisoner. - A. I saw the note directly it was found.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not actually see them find the note. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner Hall live. - A.I do not exactly know the number, in the Borough; I attended the search of his house in company with the same two officers, and in a chest of drawers on the first floor I found a silver spoon which belonged to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a dealer in medicines are you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of medicines. - A. Dr. Brodum's nervous cordial.</p>
               <p>Q. And all Mr Swinton's medicines. - A. I did not come here about that.</p>
               <p>Q. I must question you about that although you do not like it, you succeeded Mr. Swinton in business. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You sell Dr. Brodum's cordial, and all Mr. Mr. Swinton's medicines. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the misfortune to become a bankrupt lately. - A. Yes, the commission took place after Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in the house before that. - A. Last March was a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you lived there nine or ten months before you commenced business. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A partner in the business. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Never a partner, were you housekeeper to him. A. No, nothing to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Only in the same house - A. No, in the adjoining house, he lived at 45 and 1 at 46; I lived three years before that with Mr. Swinton, I was his housekeeper six months.</p>
               <p>Q. When you missed this two pound note you were very angry. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him you had lost a two pound note, and we were told while you were out of court that he absconded, whoever said that told a falsity. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. No fault of yours; you went to the lord-mayor that day. - A. Yes, I did not see the lord-mayor, here was nobody at the mansion house nor at Guildhall, the next day I got an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. When the officer came in the room where was the hat laying. - A. It was laying very close to where he was, I cannot say that I saw it there, it was not found till some minutes after the officers came.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mr. Swinton there. - A. He was there when the officer was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you happen to know that Mr. Hall is a principal witness in support of Mr. Swinton's commission of bankruptcy. - A. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that as true as all that you have told us. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there no communication from a door between the two houses. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a communication between the two yards. - A. There was not at the time Mr. Swinton lived there, but since December last there has been a communication; I have the use of the yard since Mr. Swinton left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not Mr. Swinton live in one of the houses now. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you kept out of the way to avoid appearing before the commissioners of bankrupts respecting Mr. Swinton's debts. - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that the young man has given information to the assignees of Mr. Swinton's concealing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020019"/>his effects, and of your assisting him. - A. I know nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you never heard that he gave information of that. - A. I have heard it about a week or a fortnight back, I believe it came from his own mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. No, it came from better mouths than either his or yours; this young man was your clerk at Christmas, and from then you would have us believe that Mr. Swinton had nothing to do with the business; upon your oath did not Mr. Swinton settle the accounts with him from Christmas last. - A. No, never, except it might be a week or two I was out of town, and then Mr. Swinton gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You have given a large sum of money for this situation, what situation have you been in before this. - A. I have been a housekeeper to Mr. Swinton, not because I was obliged to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you pay the rent to. - A. To Mr. Emden of Furnival's inn.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner went away from his business on the Tuesday and came again on the Wednesday. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At which time the officer took him, was Mr. Swinton there when the note was found. - A. Not exactly, he was as near as me.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been in the room with the officer. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it. - A. I suppose about half past nine in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Had Mr. Swinton been in the room before the note was found in the hat. - A. No, I was the first person that went into the room when the officer came, Mr. Swinton was in the house at that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Hall had left your house on the Tuesday night, at his usual time he came again the next day and brought the note which you charge him with taking in his hat. - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a sheriff's officer. On the 10th of June Mr. Swinton desired me to assist Kimber in taking the prisoner into custody; we apprehended him in Mr. Swinton's house in Salisbury square.</p>
               <p>Court. You say at Mr. Swinton's house. - A. That is where they fell the Daffy's elixir.</p>

I did, there was a two pound bank note found in his hat, the hat was upon a box about two yards from where the prisoner sat, Mr. Swinton called me out of the room and told me to search him closer, for he was sure he had not time enough to make away with it, he had not time enough to pass the note away.</p>
               <p>Q. You have got a paper in your hand, is that the note you found in the hat. - A. It is.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was it that fetched you on Tuesday evening. - A. Mr. Swinton came on the Tuesday, I was out, he came again on the Wednesday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Kimber proceeded to search the prisoner. - A. Yes, we found him in the parlour and Mr. Swinton, we searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say when Kimber and you were searching him, you were very attentive to what you were about. - A. We were.</p>
               <p>Q. And being attentive to what you were about, you did not keep your eye upon the hat. - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out of the room before you found the note in the hat; while you and Kimber were searching who was attending the hat. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not stand watching the hat as I stand watching my bag. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was searched Mr. Swinton took you out of the room, and said, I know he has not had time to pass it away. - A. Yes, and he said he suspected it was about the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he came with you, who was it that suggested first upon looking into the hat. - A. It was me, the hat was laying with the open part upwards, I searched the hat first of all between the hat and the lining, then I saw the leather which is over the lining, I put my finger there and the note came out.</p>
               <p>Q. It would not take long putting in there you know. - A. I cannot say nothing about that.</p>
               <p>Q. It was put snug there, so that it could not be perceived by the wearer. - A. It could not he perceived by any body.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KIMBER sworn. Examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. What are you. - A. I am constable of the city of London.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time that you began searching the prisoner what persons were in the room. - A.Mr. Swinton, Mrs. Kerslake, Weatherfield, myself, and the servant maid; I was present when the hat was searched, I saw the note pulled out by Weatherfield; the same persons were present when the hat was searched; I took the prisoner to the Counter, I then went to the prisoner's house 250, Bermondsey-street, Mr. Swinton, Mrs. Kerslake, and Weatherfield went with me, we searched his house, and in a room up stairs in a chest of drawers we found a silver table spoon, I presented the spoon to the lady, and afterwards I gave it to Weatherfield.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Weatherfield) Did you receive the spoon from the last witness. - A. I did, I produce it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my spoon, we had a careless servant, she used my spoons in the kitchen in the common way, she notched the edge of it; and this is the note I received at Messrs. Fishers's and Wells, I observe here is some casting up at the back of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There is no mark on the spoon, there is no cyphers nor crest, you cannot swear to the spoon, because your cook stirred the pot with it you are not the only person that has had a careless servant that used a spoon in that way, how long had you missed this spoon. - A.

               <p>Q.Upon your oath did not you give it to Mr. Swinton or to Mrs. Kerslake. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Weatherfield. He gave it to me, I gave it back to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you take out all the memorandums, and give them to Mr. Swinton. - A. I gave two memorandums to Mr. Swinton, he said it was his weekly accounts; Mr. Swinton took them.</p>

               <p>Q. During the time that you was there was any thing produced by either of the officers as being found upon him elsewhere. - A. There was a paper containing a copy of weekly accounts in red ink of Mrs. Kerslake's, I gave it to Mrs. Kerslake.</p>
               <p>Court. (to Mrs. Kerslake) Have you got it here. - A. No, I believe I have destroyed it; it was only figures in red ink.</p>
               <p>Mr. Swinton. He has been in the habit of keeping the same account with me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you desire the constable to take up the hat. - A. I did not to my recollection, nor any body else in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a note produced. - A. There was a note produced in the parlour; I do not recollect seeing it found; it was shewn to me after it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath had you ever seen that note before it was produced to you by the constable. - A. I never had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When did this happen. - A. I am not quite perfect as to the day, it was on the 11th I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been in the house on the 10th. - A. I believe I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that you had. - A. I am not certain, I must have been there.</p>
               <p>Q. I know you must have been there. - A. I had been there because I went over the water with Mrs. Kerslake to the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. What time were you there. - A. I was there in the morning, at noon, and in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. And by accident you was there the next morning. - A. I was there expressly for the purpose the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was not by accident you were there the next morning. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you told the officer to search, and you, and Mrs. Kerslake retired to another room. - A. I called them out and told them to be particular in searching, for one grand reason, because I knew him to be a very artful man.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it Mr. Swinton that you had the misfortune to become a bankrupt. - A. It was sometime in March that the commission was issued.</p>
               <p>Q. You were anxious to get the commission superseded. - A. I do not know whether I am obliged to give you an answer, if his lordship orders it I shall.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you not know that Hall had given an unfavourable account of you on the 10th of June. - A. I knew it on the 11th when his house was searched.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Perhaps you do not know that Mr. Hall had given any information of your concealing your property. - A. I did not at that time; I knew it on the 11th, I traced it by a letter to Mr. Hindman, and also a letter to the solicitor of the stamp office, wherein Mr. Hall had given information of Mrs. Kerslake selling medicines without stamps, whereas he had concealed these stamps.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has this been Mrs. Kerslake's house. - A. I think she took it of Mrs. Steele, who was a tenant of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You have visited this young man in Newgate. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In the Counter then I suppose - A. I did, twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Swinton, I ask you this question, attend to the question, and give a deliberate answer, did you upon either of the occasions upon your visiting him in the Counter, tell him that you would forbear prosecuting him, provided he would sign a paper tendered by you to him, respecting all that he had sworn, denying what he had sworn before the commissioners. - A. I never said any thing to him, he put the question to me, he asked me to forfeit my recognizance, I said how can you expect that of me when you have acted so unjustifiable; I never did tender a paper to him, I sent my son with a paper for him to sign, but without any conditions annexed to it, my counsel has the paper at this moment, my son brought it back unsigned. (A paper handed to the witness.) That is the paper. (The paper read, in court, and two letters sent by the prisoner to the witness.)</p>
               <p>Q. Then you wanted this man to sign a paper that he had been guilty of perjury, without holding out any promise whatever. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that Mrs. Kerslake took this house last May twelvemonth, of Mrs. Steele, who was a tenant of your's, who paid the rent of that house. - A. The two last half years she has paid the rent to Mr. Emden of Furnival's-inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell me, upon your oath, that Mrs. Kerslake has ever paid you any rent for that house, to you bona fide payment, aye or no; I am asking about the rent of that house she took of Mrs. Steel, whom you say was your tenant, while Mrs. Steel was your tenant she was to pay it to you; has Mrs. Kerslake paid you any rent. - A. No, she has paid it to Mr. Emden, who purchased the house of me, I did not wish it to he known, I disposed of it to Mr. Emden, about two years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you direct Weatherfield to search the hat. - A. I desired him to search his hat, his neckcloth, and every where else.</p>

            , JUNIOR, sworn. Examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. You are the son of Mr. Swinton, do you know the hand writing of Mr. Hall. - A. I have frequently wrote at the same table with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany your father to the Counter. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner Hall there. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said by your father to induce Hall to make the communication, whatever it might be, that was made. - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020021"/>Q. Was that communication, whatever it might be, afterwards reduced to writing. - A. It was, I heard the communication made by Hall, and what was reduced to writing was the communication made by Hall in my presence, as near as possible, word for word.</p>
               <p>Q Is this the paper. - A. It is, I took it to Mr. Hall, I asked him whether he would swear to the contents of this paper; he read it over and said he had no objection, except at the beginning something about Mrs. Kerslake, he said my father ought to come himself, and then he would have done it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. Without any sort of promise made by your father, he opened his mouth and said all this. - A. No, he began crying when my father went in, and said how good a master he had been to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not ask him to sign it. - A. No, I only asked him to swear to it, I wanted him to write it down, I did not want him to copy that, but to write it out of his own head.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he would swear to it if your father came. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell your father that he had refused to sign it. - A. No, I told my father if he would go he would do it, I never asked him to sign it, but to swear it when he had writ it over.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My observation to that is, that it is all false. When I was in the Poultry Counter I wrote to Mr. Swinton to come there, that was only to know from him what he had put me there for; at that time I never knew what it was for. On Tuesday morning Mrs. Kerslake had been out twice, once she went out to market, she put some money in a canvas bag, which Mr. Swinton bought for the purpose during the whole time I settled the books with him, and she was put out of the way that she should not be subpoena'd; I said to Mrs. Kerslake I do not think you have lost the two pound note, Mr. Swinton said, no d - n her, she has not lost the two pound note no more than you have; about half an hour after that he said, will you go up and look for Dr. Brodum's day book, he said you had better take off your coat you will dirty it; I thought he was making fun of me, it was an old coat, I would not, I was going up, he said stop till my son Anthony comes in; then he sent me down to fill some bottles with Dr. Brodum's medicines, when Mr. Swinton said I might go home early that evening if I liked, as he had some gen-men coming there, consequently I went home about six o'clock that evening; the next morning I went in at the back gates (there is a communication made backwards to convey the goods from one house to the other, neither is the business at this time Mrs. Kerslake's no more than it is mine; Mrs. Kerslake keeps false books to shew the commissioners, which she has shewed me), when I went in that morning I laid my hat down, he (Swinton) said, Mr. Hall you had better go down and fill some nervous; before I had done that, he said to me, have you written out these false accounts to give the assignees, I said I have not, he said will you be so good as to write them out now, I made half a dozen pens out of some quills, I said to Mrs. Kerslake will you have the goodness now to let me have the writings to copy, she said I should have them presently, she walked out again, I sat down for about twenty minutes or half an hour, she came to the door herself with two constables, she says there is your prisoner, I give you charge of him; they searched me, and while I took off my coat Mr. Swinton tapped the officer on the shoulder, took him out in the passage and came back again, he says where is your pocket book, I gave them the pocket book, they took out a paper containing an account of what I I had received and paid, after that he tapped the man on the shoulder again, and took him out, and when he came in he said where is your hat, I said that is my hat, with that he took hold of my hat, takes out a paper, he says this is it, and took and gave it to her, he then asked Mrs. Kerslake what the note was.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you tried here yesterday. - A. I was for a rape, and I was acquitted.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you see your own door when you stood there. - A. Yes, all the time; the prisoner returned and went into the shop while I was over there, and before I crossed the road he came out of the door, tucking something under his coat, and he was buttoning it; I knew he had robbed the shop, I ran round the corner of St. James'-street after him, but seeing I could not overtake him, and my having left the shop, I returned back again.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not taken then. - A. No, a very few minutes after that Mr. Trayner came in, I told him the shop had been robbed, he looked about to see what he had lost, he missed the cloth and the nankeen; after that, in the afternoon the prisoner came again, I wished very much to accuse him of the robbery, Mr. Trayner prevented me, he said he wished to speak to the gentleman about it, sir

               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the effect of this wax, or whatever it is, that is put upon the surface of them. - A. It takes off the bright appearance from the silver, and makes it appear to be in a state of circulation; I particularly noticed it on them when they were first examined, and there is some on them now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (read in court) My lord, I humbly beg your lordship will take these few lines into your kind consideration, of the hardships of an unfortunate orphan, for so I may call myself, having no mother, and my father having left me to God and the wide world, for when I went to him thinking to find a home, he cruelly told to go on the town and to get my living as I could; unfortunately for me, when I was turned from his door I met with a gentleman who gave me twelve shillings, which to my misfortune were bad; having no gown but one I had borrowed, I thought I would buy one with the money he had given me; I bought the gown of the shopman, the master was not there, after I gave him the money he took it to some gentlemen that were in the back parlour, and after that he took it to the others that were at the door; I hopeyour lordship will take pity on my tender age, and my being entirely inexperienced in the world, and my great distress, being entirely without friends; upon my bended knees I humbly beg you will shew me mercy, and save me from utter ruin.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 4, Red Lion-street, Holborn, I am a cooper; on the 24th of May as I was in my shop, I noticed a cart going past, about eleven in the morning, as the cart was going along I saw a person behind it removing a package, he was on foot, reaching over into the cart, I saw him take the parcel out.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a parcel was it. - A. It appeared like a roll of cloth, I went out and laid hold of the prisoner, the cloth was then in his possession, I believe it was resting on the ground with his hand upon it; when I laid hold of him he did not resist, he said he was very much in distress, his wife had lain in lately, he never did any thing of that sort before; I took him to the watchhouse, I beleive the boy took the package to the watchhouse, I sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Court. The same man that you saw take the cloth out of the cart you gave into the hands of the constable. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 27th of May last did you go with the waggon on its passage from Leeds to London. - A. From the Bull and Mouth, London, to Hertford, is my stage.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you besides. - 
               <persName id="t18060702-34-person341">A. William Low</persName>
             the waggoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your waggon loaded with. - A. There was some packs of wool on the outside; as we were going on a little further than the Cock at Houndsfield, just before we came to the Two Brewers, I saw the prisoner at the bar wiping his boots as he walked along; when I went up to the Two Brewers he asked me if I would have something to drink, I told him no, we were going to stop at the White Hart to water our horses; when we got to the White Hart at Ponder's End he was there, he gave me a glass of ale and the waggoner another, I told the waggoner that man was going to Hodsdon, he had told me so, the waggoner said do not let him ride; we went into the public house, then he gave us part of another pint of ale, the waggoner then was a tankard because he was two pints, he asked him whether he might have a mouthful of meat with us for his supper, he had some; then it was my turn to ride a little way.</p>
               <p>Court. You had been on foot before. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he came out of the public house had he told you what he was going to Hodsdon for. - A. Yes, he enquired of Mrs. Littlechild to lend him a bag, she lent him one, he gave her sixpence for it, he said he wanted the bag to put a couple of game cocks in that he was going to fetch at Hodsdon; then I got up and rid, the waggoner told me not to go to sleep, I came from the hind part of the waggon into the hay bag at the front of tht waggon, the waggoner said he would mind the near side if I would look out on the off side; in rather better than a quarter of a mile from the Red Hart he was on the off side filling his bag with wool, I saw him do it, he was pulling out the wool from the side of the pack as the waggon went on, I told my partner to go round and he would catch him at it; he went round and catched hold of him and called me, and I went to him and catched hold of the other side of him, we took him back to Mrs. Littlechild's, the White Hart; I stopped by him there till they sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went back to the waggon did you see the place from whence he took the wool. - A. I searched it directly I caught him, I put my arm ever so far, there had been a great deal of wool gone by the vacancy.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner dressed at this time. - A. He was dressed in black, and a pair of boots on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed before you came out whether your packs were safe, whether there was any hole in them before. - A. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you got from London before the prisoner overtook you. - A. I saw him this side of the Cock first, I suppose about seven mile, it was not dark nor light then, with the dust and every thing I could not rightly see him. I only knew he was a man dressed in black.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath had not he the appearance of being in liquor when you first saw him. - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you drunk yourself. - A. No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LOW sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were the waggoner of the Leeds waggon on the 28th of May. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were called to by the last witness when he was in the hay bag, to go round the waggon to the prisoner, and you would catch him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was that. - A. About twelve minutes past twelve, we started about twelve o'clock from Ponder's End, this was about a quarter of a mile further, when I went round the waggon and came up to him, he had a bag under his arm, I took hold of his shoulder, I asked him whether he knew what he had been doing of, he said he had not been doing any thing as he knew of, I said I will tell you what you have been doing of, you have been robbing the waggon; he begged and prayed for me to let him go, I took him to the White Hart, Ponder's End, and the bag too, I delivered him into the bar and the bag too to Mrs. Littlechild, and Holton my guard was with him, I went back to my team immediately, I left the bag in Holton's care, I went back to the pack, and I saw it was cut and a great quantity of wool was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner appear to you to be drunk. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner applying to Mrs. Littlechild for the bag. - A. Yes, I heard him ask for the bag to put the fighting cocks in.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see her give the bag. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in it or was it quite empty. - A. Quite empty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was this. - A. It was moon light.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the waggon was this hay bag. A. At the fore part.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in a place that he must have known that he must be seen by the guard if he had attempted to have robbed the waggon. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Could he see the guard in the hay bag. - A. Perhaps he did not know that he was there.</p>
               <p>- LITTLECHILD sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You keep the White Hart at Ponder's End. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in the county of Middlesex. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the Leeds waggon coming to your house with Holton the guard and the last witness Low. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner at your house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before. - A.No, he asked me if I had a bag of any description, he was going to Hodsdon for a couple of fighting cocks, I told him that I did not know that I had one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020026"/>of that description, he pressed me very much, he said he had brought one from home and he had left it at Newington, I told him there was a bag with a hole in it, I supposed it would hold the fighting cocks, he might give me sixpence for it, and if he returned it I would give him the sixpence again.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not let him have any wool in it. - A. There was not any thing in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that waggon left your house. A. It might be past twelve, they returned back in about a quarter of an hour, when Low brought him back, he said this is what the rascal wanted the bag for, I said I am very sorry I lent him the bag; Mr. Low sent Crossingham the constable; the bag and the prisoner were left in my bar, and the same bag was delivered to Crossingham; the bag had two handfuls of wool in it, and two handfuls were taken out of his pocket during the time he sat in the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see these persons come in. - A. Yes; when they first came up to the door the prisoner came in by himself, and asked for a pint of ale to take out to the waggoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the appearance of being in liquor. - A. No, they had two pints, and one pot of ale together.</p>

Yes, I did not see him come out of the gate exactly, we stopped him, and desired him to come back when he was just out of the gate, he returned readily; when we all came together to Mr. Yellop's dwelling house the carman, whose business it was to let him out, was standing at the door; he was taken into the house, I told him he was suspected of being dishonest,

             the constable immediately searched him, in each coat pocket he found a parcel of yellow colour, called king's yellow, the two parcels together weighed two pounds and a half, and within his waistcoat and breeches were laid flat and round his body. fourteen pounds weight of verdigrease, it was tied up in a long paper bag.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the clerk, was there such a commodity as yellow colour and verdigrease there. - A. There positively was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say he came back very readily. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose from the nature of your trade it was impossible to prove any loss. - A. No, he might have taken twenty pounds, we could not miss any, the quantity is too large.</p>

On the 4th of May, when my wife was put to bed I missed nine pounds out of the box; previous to the 28th I moved the remainder of my money to a writing desk in order to secure it; on the 28th, when I was at breakfast, my wife communicated to me that she had lost a great deal of wearing apparel, both of my own and hers, I immediately went to my writing desk to see if any of my bank notes were gone, I perceived there was eight or ten; I went to Marlborough-street, and took a search warrant out,

             the officer found two or three shawls, a petticoat, and there were some gloves and gaiters found among her clothes; there were three false keys found in her pocket, the officer tried these keys to my drawers, writing desk, and my cupboard, these three keys corresponded with those three locks; in consequence of her being found out in the theft she took a quantity of laudanum, which she said was six shillingsworth, and she said she had destroyed herself; in consequence of that I took the bottle to Mr. Lomax, he said it was laudanum, he brought another gentleman, and they gave her every assistance, he brought three drafts, she had not taken any, I told her if she would take a draft I would do every thing to save her from justice I could; they took her to Mary-le-bone infirmary, and the next day she was taken before a magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge in your house. - A. Yes; I cannot tell the day he came to lodge, he lodged with me about four or five weeks, he was to pay eighteen pence a-week for the room, there was a bed in the room and bedding, he lodged with me till the Monday after Whitsun week; at night he went to bed, I locked the door, and in the morning I missed the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he gone in the morning before you got up. - A. Yes, the first thing that I missed was my two tea spoons from the one pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not in his room. - A. No; on the morning before I made the prisoner a bason of tea, and the tea spoons were there safe then; I went up stairs and missed my bed in his room; about three weeks afterwards I saw him at the Royal Oak public house door; when he saw me he got up and walked round the corner of the house, and then he ran, I ran after him and cried out Stop thief; when he had got half way down the street he returned back to me and asked me what I had lost, he told me to hold my tongue and go with him into the public house and he would give me any thing for my loss; he asked me what I had lost, I told him he knew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any thing for your loss. - A. No, he went into the public house and called for a pot of porter and asked me to drink, but I did not drink with him; I sent for an officer and gave him in charge; I have seen the spoons since, but not the bed; I am sure that is the man.</p>

             sworn. I have lodged at the prosecutrix' house five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar lodging at the same house. - A. I do, I lodged there at the same time, I recollect the things being missing.</p>
               <p>- CLARK sworn. I am a watchmaker; the prisoner brought me two spoons to sell about three or four weeks before he was taken up, I bought them of him, I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I can swear to these being my spoons, I have had them years, they are family spoons.</p>
               <p>- ELLIS sworn. The prisoner sold me a bed about the beginning of June; about four months before that I bought all his furniture; on the beginning of June he knocked me up about five or six o'clock in the morning, I did not get up till breakfast time, he said he had got a bed at the public house, I asked him if it was his own, he said he bought it of his shopmate, I bought the bed, it was tied up with something like a table cloth or a sheet; I sold it, but to whom I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I should not have carried that bed to Mr. Ellis's if my wife had come home; may it please your lordship, I bought that bed in Spital Fields, with a view of going to housekeeping again; I went to my wife and asked her if she liked to come and live with me again; she told me she would go to service, for if we came together again we should not agree; I sold the bed to Mr. Ellis for one pound seventeen shillings; as for any of her things, I never touched them, nor did I go away with any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to your cutting-room frequently. - A. Yes, he applied for a situation; he has been in the habit of coming two or three months. On the 3d of June he was in the cutting-room, as I thought, with a piece of nankeen under his coat. I was talking to a gentleman that came in on business; as the gentleman was going out I turned round, and I saw him take up a small end of linen. I asked him what he was going to do with that? he replied, he wanted a little piece to face a waistcoat. I told him I was surprised at his doing such a thing in that house, for if he had asked for such a thing, I was sure he would have it given him. I then asked him what he had got under his coat, for I saw it below the lappel; he told me that was a piece of nankeen he had bought coming along, upon which I took it from him, and I looked at it. I saw it was the property of a gentleman who had sent it to be made up. I told him I could swear to the property. He then told me he was very sorry he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020029"/>had taken it, and begged me to let him go in consideration of his family. I told him I should acquaint Mr. Williams of it; he offered to come by me; I stopped him, and locked him in the room. I took the nankeen in my hand, and went up to Mr. Williams and shewed it him; an officer was then sent for.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner was apprehended. - A. On the 3d of June, between ten and eleven o'clock I let the prisoner in at the street door; about an hour afterwards hearing a noise in the cutting-room I went in there, I saw the witness Cook coming out of the cutting-room with a piece of nankeen in his hand, I entered the cutting-room, and I perceived a pound of thread sticking up in the prisoner's coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it visible to the eye before you searched him. - A. Yes, it was about two inches out of his pocket; suspecting that he had something else about him I watched him narrowly, he turned his back to the table and took out the pound of thread and a gross of buttons and laid them on the table; I was sent to Marlborough street for an officer.</p>

            . - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Had you lost stamps before Mrs. Kerslake succeeded you. - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they stamps for the medicines. - A. Yes, I am obliged to have the stamps from the stamp office with my own name on them.</p>
               <p>Q. For your quack medicines; when you parted with the medicines, did not you give up likewise the stamp business. - A. No, I never parted with the patent at all, nor the order at the stamp office.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say this, that she was to sell Dr. Brodum's medicine, and that she was to come to you for every stamp of the nervous cordial and the botanical syrup. - A. She was to have six of each.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you trust her with more than six. - A. If there was an order for more she asked me for them.</p>
               <p>Q. A very odd way of parting with business. - A. I never parted with the patent right.</p>
               <p>Q. If you parted with the sale of these goods, you surely put her in the best way you could, but the fun of this business of yours was to give her the medicine and to keep the stamps. - A. She never had them, not to this moment.</p>
               <p>Q. It seems to me to be a nominal succession, supposing a thousand are ordered and she has only got six stamps, how was she to sell them, she must sell them without stamps. - A. She has had no more than six at a time since she has sold the medicine.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. What are you. - A. I am a constable, I live at No. 25, Holiday yard, Ludgate street; I went to the prisoner's house, Bermondsey street, Mrs. Hall let us in; when we went into the parlour I saw Mrs. Hall take some paper from out of the buffet, and she endeavoured to conceal it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there in this room. - A. Only the lady and me and Mrs. Hall; she had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020030"/>got them in her hand, and she endeavoured to conceal them under her clothes, I immediately says, Ma'am that will not do, I insist upon seeing what you have got there, I took from her hands this parcel of stamps, which I now produce; we went up into her bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you. - A. The lady, and Mr. Kerslake, and Weatherfield.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean Mrs. Kerslake, Mr. Swinton, and Weatherfield. - A. Yes, when I went into the bedroom I found in one drawer sixteen one-shilling stamps, and a spoon that we had here last night, a mustard pot, and three seals, and a case of instruments and a lamp, these were all found in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come away in one coach or two. - A. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. You brought away two coach loads. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And these are all the things that you put in the indictment. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were four full boxes taken away by Mr. Swinton in a separate coach. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the contents of them. - A. No, they were taken away tied up and all packed.</p>
               <p>Q. What, did Mr. Swinton claim these four boxes as his property. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they taken before the sitting alderman. - A. They were not, he told me they contained Dr. Brodum's medicine.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you happen to see whether that was true or not. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not seize them as stolen goods. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. They were worth a great deal more than the things charged in the indictment. - A. I cannot say they-were in boxes, they were carried to Mr. Swinton's house.</p>
               <p>Court. They may be brick bats for what you know. - A. I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You rather think they were brick bats. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you suffer a man to go with you to search for stolen goods, to take away boxes without your searching and examining them, you as an officer have a right to take every thing that is stolen. - A. They did not say they were stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. What size boxes were they. - A. They were about nine inches in depth and fifteen inches in length; the boxes are now in Salisbury court, Mrs. Hall desired they might be left because they were going in a ship; I know not who took them there.</p>
               <p>Q. But what is in them you do not know. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The assignees shall know, and what is in them, when did you see them last. - A. This morning.</p>
               <p>Court. When you search a man's house for stolen property and they are claimed, why did not you take them with you, there would be no harm in that. - A. I should have thought it improper after leaving him in the Counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he apprehended. - A. In Salisbury court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. There was never any pretence that these four boxes were stolen. - A. No, they were claimed by the prosecutor's wife.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a serjeant at mace.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you with Kimber the constable proceed to search the prisoner's house. - A. Yes, I fetched him on the 11th of June, I went with Kimber, Mrs. Kerslake, and Mr. Swinton, to the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who opened the door to you. - A. The prisoner's wife; we went into the parlour, I saw the prisoner's wife at the buffet, she was very much alarmed and frightened, she took some papers from under a bason, she held them in her left hand, Kimber observed there was something, he catched hold of her right hand, I stood behind, he says what have you got here, I thought she would have fainted she was so much affected, he then laid hold of her left hand and found the stamps, I believe them to be the same stamps; I went up stairs, Mrs. Hall accompanied us, we went into the one pair of stairs bedroom, where the drawers were, I pulled out the drawers and Kimber searched them, we found in the drawers some stamps.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them stamps and tell me whether they are the stamps. - A. I believe them to be the same; we found a mustard pot and some paper, and there was a lamp found below in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you find in the one pair of stairs room. - A. Some stamps, some paper, and some memorandum books, they were, I believe Dr. Brodum's books.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by Dr. Brodum's books. - A. They were printed pamphlets; then we went down stairs again and found this tobacco box, this lamp we found in the shop, Mr. Swinton said it was his, and in the drawer we found these three seals and these patent locks, the mustard pot and this case of instruments.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, good Mr. Weatherfield, although you are not a constable, you are a very useful servant called a serjeant at mace, you and Mr. Swinton are friends. - A. Yes, as neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known him a long while, where does he live. - A. At No. 46, in Salisbury square.</p>
               <p>Q. If I had enquired of you where Mr. Swinton lived, you would have told me No. 46, Salisbury square. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a constable. - A. I was a city constable for a number of years, and I was beadle to the parish of St. Bride, but I found myself ill treated.</p>
               <p>Q. That ill treating was, some wicked people charged you with stealing coals. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath was not you discharged upon that charge of stealing three sacks of coals. - A. No, I deny it; the parish had an information from a spiteful man, to whom I would not pay a bill of twenty-eight pounds, I had paid it once, and because he could not have his ends of me, he told the parish officers that I wanted to embezzle coals, which I never did, and I will prove it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in point of fact you was charged with embezzling coals. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You voluntarily resigned. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you did not voluntarily resign, you went out without voluntarily resigning. - A. I might have had that situation then and might now, I was very ill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020031"/>treated, and I would not serve it.</p>
               <p>Court. If they did not turn you out and you did not resign, how did you get out, you puzzle me. - A. The reason was because I would not solicit among my friends, I told them I had paid the twenty-eight pounds, I shewed all my account, and because I would not pay the money again, they brought forward that which turned me out.</p>
               <p>Q. They turned you out then. - A. No, they chused another man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Then they did not turn you out, they chused another man; on the night of the 10th of June Mr. Swinton came to you and desired you to get an officer the next morning. - A. He asked me to come and take the prisoner, I told him that I was a sheriff's officer, I was no constable, but I would get him an able man that would find out the thief, I fetched Kimber, and he said he would do his endeavour to find out the thief.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say that Mr. Swinton came to you, as being a cunning man, to find out the thief. A. No, not as a cunning man, but because the parish officers did not know how to go about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You, Mr. Swinton, and Mrs. Kerslake took Kimber, what was the room that you went into first. A. To the best of my remembrance we went along the passage into the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you all stay in that room or go out of it. A.We were all in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the room in which the stamps were found. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into the room in which the stamps were found and Mr. Swinton. - A. He was there or in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say he was in the house, I am asking of you whether he was in that room or not; (witness pausing) I will take the answer that you do not know whether he was or not. - A. He was in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if any body said he was not in the room that is incorrect. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in the room. - Q. I was in the room, we next went into the one pair of stairs, a bed room, then we went below.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Swinton go with you into every room at the same time that you went in. - A. I believe not at the same time, because there was one kept below for fear any thing should be carried out.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is, did he accompany you into every room at the time that you went. - A. I do not think he did, he was in and out.</p>
               <p>Q. Your attention was not so much directed to him, as it was for looking after the things, you have been an officer a great many years, do you remember some boxes being found there. - A. I saw Kimber find some boxes, he brought them out from under a dark place under the stairs, they were brought into the shop, and there was some boxes found in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they taken to the sitting alderman. - A. Not all, that was only one coach load that Mr. Swinton said was stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. This was one coach load, and the other went to Salisbury square. - A. I believe they did, I did not go with them.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not go to the alderman. - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know whether they did or did not. - A. Upon my honour I tell you the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not tell me of your honour, you are upon your oath, did those boxes that were put in the other coach go to the sitting alderman. - A. Upon my oath I cannot say whether they did or not, I know these did.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not ask you about these, upon your oath do not you know that they did not go. - A. I cannot say, I only had them in my custody, I was not with the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did both the coaches go to Guildhall. - A. I believe they followed one after the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see both the coaches at Guildhall. - A. I do not charge my memory that I saw them both at Guildhall, I verily believe that the other coach went Mr. Swinton's or elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Q. You found some boxes that were corded, and they were taken to Mr. Swinton's. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the contents of them. - A. No, they were not opened, there was five or six of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You have been asked whether you was not charged with stealing coals, upon your oath did you ever commit that offence. - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether you was not accused. - A. I was overseer and beadle; there was a poor woman with a large family, I gave her three sacks of coals.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to examine thoroughly below stairs, before you went up stairs. - A. When the things were found Mr. Swinton put himself in a very great passion, we hardly knew what to do with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went up stairs and left him below. - A. I believe we did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you returned you found all these things; now let me give you one piece of advice, when you go to examine a place let the persons be with you, now it appears either negligence of you or great wickedness in somebody else; the first thing that you found in the parlour were these papers, you then went up stairs, and when you came down again all the other things were found. - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gleed. I am a single woman, I live at No. 46, Salisbury square, I am a vendor of medicines.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom did you succeed in that business. - A. I succeeded Mr. Swinton the first of January, the beginning of this year, the prisoner at the bar was my servant, (my clerk) he was in the same situation with Mr. Swinton.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 10th or 11th of June had you any reason to suspect his honesty. - A. I had; in consequence of that the prisoner Hall was taken into custody by Weatherfield and Kimber at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to the house of the prisoner, with Weatherfield, Kimber, and Mr. Swinton. - A. Yes, Mrs. Hall let us in; the first room that we searched was the first floor, Weatherfield and Kimber went up with me, Mr. Swinton staid below, he came up afterwards; the first drawer we opened I saw some stamps with Dr. Brodum's name on them, I put my hand on them and said they are our stamps, the officer took them immediately; we found a table cloth, we then proceeded to search below stairs, and in the kitchen drawer there were found three seals and some bottles of embrocation, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020032"/>lamp, and a mustard pot; I should have told you the wife took some stamps when we first went in from under a bason in the cupboard, which she held in her hand: the officer took them from her when she got up stairs. We went into the cellar, and under the stairs I saw some medicine boxes, they were all marked 1, 2, 3, 4, and in the passage there were four boxes belonging to myself, they were an order, I sent them there for conveniency, being by the water side, I was to let the gentleman have medicine, and he was to send me a pipe of wine; Mr. Hall took these boxes to his house, as being more convenient, the boxes were not quite packed; I took them home to my house; the other four boxes found in the cellar, Kimber I believe had them, they were taken to Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. You commenced business the beginning of this year, and succeeded Mr. Swinton, when did you go into the house. - A. I have been in the house a twelve month last March, I took it of a tenant of Mr. Swinton's, not knowing it was not Mr. Swinton's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Swinton occupy both houses formerly. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You were his housekeeper. - A. I was, about three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You succeeded him in the business about the beginning of this year, and he became a bankrupt shortly after you succeeded him, you had all the stock and the right of making the medicines, had you all the stock transferred to you. - A. I had not all the stock, I had as much as I thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you pay for what he did transfer to you. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>(The property identified by Mr. Swinton.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (to prosecutor) I ask you whether you have always gone by the name of Swinton. - A. No, I have gone by the name of Moore and of Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you gone to prison. - A. Three or four times to see Hall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Upon your oath, did not you swear last night you had been only twice; I will now produce the key to these two locks found at the prisoner's house, which the prisoner sent to me since he has been in confinement.</p>
               <p>Court. It struck me very odd that a man should steal two locks, and leave the keys behind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These articles were sent to my house to keep them from the assignees; the four boxes that they have made the excuse of sending them to my house was that they were to be sent by water; he never put any direction on the boxes, they were for a gentleman in Wood street, that order was countermanded; after he found a messenger was to be sent into his house, he ordered me to go to the inn in Fleet market to get some porters, which porters were to be none that I knew, nor should they be followed to see where the articles went; there were some small articles besides, he desired them to be taken to my house for fear the assignees should have them; since which time he has been carrying on the business, he receives the profits of the business, I settled the books with him every Saturday; once or twice he brought in Mrs. Kerslake, that I might swear that I settled the account with Mrs. Kerslake; he has sworn to a tobacco dish that I had three years before I knew him; last night Mrs. Kerslake swore to a table spoon that was my own; there is Mr. Chapman that drawed the beer, he is in court, he came into the charge room with me, he knows that when he offered me the change of the seven shilling piece I first of all pushed it from me; the next day he came to me and said, if I would sign the commission of bankruptcy he would not appear against me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go with her willingly. - A. No, she took me up there, long enough to accomplish that purpose, I did not perceive the loss till I had come out again; in a few minutes, and before I had got twenty or thirty paces, I perceived that I had lost my money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose. - A. A brown silk purse, thirteen guineas in gold, and four half guineas; a ten pound bank of England note, and three five pound bank of England notes; there were two other promissory notes that had been taken out, and kept at home as memorandums; I had gone a few paces towards Lincoln's Inn fields, I returned, and fortunately looked down Fetter lane, where I saw the prisoner in conversation with two watchmen; she was making her escape, and I fancied they had stopped her, I desired them to hold her and to take her to the watchhouse, I said she had robbed me of near fifty pound; she denied it till she was taken to the watchhouse and searched; the inspector of the night searched her, and found the money about her, it was inside of her clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. You were late in the city, or rather early this morning, you had been drinking. - A. I was a little tipsey, I had been to a dinner party.</p>
               <p>Q. We all of us in our turn are agreeable with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020033"/>our friends, and when a man has been drinking plentifully and comes out in the air, sometimes he is so tipsy he does not know what he is about; when a man has had a little wine he is more gallant than usual. - A. I was shocked at her.</p>
               <p>Q. When she dragged you into the court were you in the attitude of falling. - A. I was struggling to get away.</p>
               <p>Q. With your struggling might not the purse fall out. - A. I will not be so severe against her as to say it might not happen, the purse was in my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. You were tipsy a little. - A. I was a little tipsy, but I recollect every circumstance that happened.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not perfectly sober. - A. In fact I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no suspicions of it, you were not alive to it at that moment. - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ASBURY sworn. I am a watchman in Bartlett's buildings, Holborn; when I called the time of half past three in the morning this gentleman appeared to me to be just at the watering house, and the woman at the bar came immediately after him and catched him by the breast, he pushed her off, he went strait on again, and she followed him again and laid hold of him by the left arm and his breast, and dragged him into the court immediately; no watchman being at King's head court, I ran up Bartlett's buildings, there is a door that leads into Fetter lane, a watchman was sitting there, I says to him, Cary come out of your box, there's a gentleman been robbed by an old whore in Holborn; I had seen her in the street before at different times; I had told the watchman to come after me, I said, I dare say she has robbed him, and just opposite us we saw the gentleman pass Fetter lane in Holborn, I says there he goes, I suppose she is gone, we will go no farther, with that she appeared at the top of the lane in Holborn, she came down to us, I said you have made a fine job this morning, she said what job, I told her I supposed she had robbed him; she replied, the scaly b - r had only gave her a shilling; we took her into the gate at Bartlett's buildings, the gentleman appeared at the top of Fetter lane, I said here he is, she attempted to go away, we stopped her, and when he came close to us, he says, watchman I give you charge of that woman, she has robbed me of fifty pounds; she said search me, no, says we, we shall take you to the watchhouse, we did, and the inspector searched her, and found the property on her.</p>

I am, I searched this woman, I found this purse, which contained thirteen guineas, four half guineas, one ten pound note, and three five pound notes; she strongly denied having it; while I was searching the right side of her I heard the gold chink; as soon as I got hold of the purse, she put her mouth to my ear and said smash it, he cannot swear that I have got it; I took the purse and I asked the gentleman what it contained, I found every thing right that he said was in the purse; here are two promissory notes in the purse now of his own hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Is that your purse. - A. Yes, and these were the memorandums that were in it.</p>

            , one pound, and there was a cross to the last figure 1, I observed it when I took the number; the other number is 37291, 29th April 1806. 1 l. I marked that with a cross at the corner of it; the third number is 37300, 29th April 1806, 1 l.</p>
               <p>Court. When had you last seen all these notes. - A. I missed 37291 on the 26th of May, 37300 I missed on the 28th of May, 38101 I missed on the 27th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time on the 27th of June had you last seen that. - A. I believe it was about a quarter past four o'clock in the morning, it was then in that cabinet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. When did your ladyship miss it. - A. About half after six the same morning; upon missing the notes I went up stairs into my maid's room to see if they were all asleep, my suspicion rested upon three, the servant maid who undressed me, and the servant who let me in, and the servant who came home with me; I called up my housekeeper and requested her to come to me immediately, which she did. The men servants room were searched first, nothing was found; I then with my housekeeper went up into the prisoner's room, I found her in bed, I told her I had missed two notes since I came home that morning, and that they must be in the house, she told me I was welcome to search her pockets, there were nothing in them but her own property; my housekeeper lifted up her bed, found her pockets and searched them, we found nothing there; on lifting up the mattress my housekeeper found another pocket, which she gave to me, the prisoner then said it was her pocket, there was nothing in it but what was her own and nobody should see it; she attempted to snatch it, I took the pocket down stairs, and desired her to follow as soon as she had got her clothes on; I did not open it till the prisoner came down stairs; it was opened first in her presence, and various articles of mine were found in it, and among them the two notes I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020034"/>lost, one of which is 38101.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say or do upon your finding the notes. - A. She said she had taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present at the time the pocket was searched. - A. Mr. and Mrs. Markham, my housekeeper, and colonel - .</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that this is one of the notes that you saw at one o'clock. - A. I am sure it is.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner and you had agreed to part. - A. We had, she was to have gone away that very morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you discover these other notes. - A. They were in her breast, she took ten notes from her breast herself and held them in her hand, they were taken out of her hand, and the other two notes in the indictment were among that number; there was the 37291 that is marked with a cross, I made it myself, and 37300, I have no hesitation to say that they are my notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any thing during the time that she lived with you that appeared that she was deranged. - A. No, she was sometimes confused and melancholy, but I had no notion that she was deranged, I recommended her to a lady, I only took it to be a stupidity.</p>

               <p>Q. During that time in your judgment, has her mind been found all that time. - A. By no means in my opinion, from her incoherent manner of asking of questions, and before you could answer she would go into some other subject, she would jump up and go out, and after wandering up and down, she would return home.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you. - A. My husband is a turner in Mount street.</p>

               <p>Q. Down to what time has she so conducted herself that you thought her deranged. - A. Within these six or seven months she lodged with me, she frequently shaved her head, she said it relieved her, and she would cut her head, she said the more she cut it the more service it was to her; I was so alarmed at it once that I called out, and I took the razor and hid it; she got it after that and used it frequently.</p>

Yes, I have known the prisoner twenty-four years; about fifteen or sixteen years ago she lodged in Jermyn street, and during the time I went to her she was as insane as could be, she would have died on the bed at one time if it had not been for me; an apothecary was called in, we hauled her about the bed all night to prevent her going to sleep; and during the time she was out of place she used to become so wild and unpleasant, she said she certainly must make away with herself if she could not get a place.</p>

               <p>Q. No charge or thought of any charge being made against the prisoner at the bar until he was in Newgate, not for any criminal charge, but unfortunately for debt. - A. O yes, we discovered it before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any charge of a criminal nature laid against him until he was in Newgate for debt. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you found him in Newgate for debt you made this charge against him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was after you made application to him to pay or give security for it. - A. I never made any application to him to settle it, I had no authority for that, I called upon him for nothing more than for him to relate to me what number of bills he had settled, supposing he would give me the account, entirely for saving the trouble of going about to receive it; I told him a number of names.</p>
               <p>Q. You never told him of Longman's. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he would endeavour to settle his accounts. - A. Not at that time, that was when I took the books away he said he would settle the accounts.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time that you said anything to him about the books being incorrect. - Q. The first time I went to him, I said Mrs. Rainsdon insisted upon his giving the books up; he then said he would make them up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after that when you saw him in Newgate. - A. A fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you saw him in Newgate did you institute this prosecution. - A. About a week, I am not prepared to say the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any right to receive checks for your mistress. - A. Yes, and he used to get the money from the bankers, or pay the checks in, which he thought proper.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am clerk to Messrs. Down and Co. I produce a check drawn by Mr. Longman and Dickenson upon Messrs. Down and Co. the check I paid, I cannot say to whom (the check read in court), I placed it to Mr. Longman's account I suppose.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If I understand Mr. Sharp right, he says I left Mrs. Rainsdon's service without making up my accounts; I made up my accounts to the last day of April, sometimes I made up my account in one month, sometimes two, and sometimes it was three months; I made up my account last April to the amount of sixty-three pound odd.</p>
               <p>Court. That you made up the account there is no doubt, but the question is whether you brought to account the sum received of Mr. Longman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharp. He delivered in an account with the names of the people he had received from, but not with the name of Longman, I had no return of the money he had received from Longman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When Mr. Sharp and Mrs. Rainsdon came to Newgate, I said I would rectify the mistake.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharp. Mr. Gammon did ask me for the books and the account again, I had no authority from Mrs. Rainsdon to give them back nor to answer him; on Saturday night the 26th of April, when I went to him by Mrs. Rainsdon's orders, I went to him at his own house, I told him I came by Mrs. Rainsdon's order for him to give up all his books or bills, he then said his accounts were not made up, but they would in two or three days; he then delivered me a book and part of a book that he had and some bills, and he said in two or three days he would give a final account; on the Wednesday after he gave in the account and what monies he had paid me, which was eight shillings in cash; I then supposed the accounts would balance, until I went to collect the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards, - A. Never till I saw him in prison.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him in prison did he then say he wished to have an opportunity to correct them. - A. No, the answer made me was, that if he was out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020037"/>of prison he could go to sea-port towns and earn a great deal of money; I had no more talk with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was the deficiency in his accounts. - A. I discovered a deficiency of one hundred and seventy odd pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the habit of receiving to a large amount. - A. To the amount of an hundred pounds at different times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I should think a mistake in a hundred pounds, as it is in various sums, might easily happen in the best books that ever were kept. - A. I am happy to say I never had such a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. To a man not so correct as you it might happen. - A. It might be possible.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called thirteen witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer; on Sunday the 29th of June about half past eleven o'clock I was going down Diot street, I was informed there was a man that had been used ill, I searched the prisoners in the watchhouse; under the arm pit of Kite I found this key and thimble, and under the arm pit of Gogan I found this shilling and three halfpence, I suppose they had no pockets, it is their plant, as they call it; I went to the prosecutor's house, and the key fitted his drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. And the thimble fitted his finger. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- BELL sworn. I was passing the end of Bembridge street on Sunday the 29th of June; I saw a great number of people ghting, which is no uncommon thing there, I went up to make peace if it was in my power; the prosecutor was certainly ill used, he was bleeding, the prosecutor gave me charge of these two prisoners for robbing him; there were a a great many of them fighting, the prosecutor had knocked them down and they were bleeding; I took them to the watchhouse, Blackman came in and searched them; I saw the property found on them exactly as he has described.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) You had rather a bit of a bustle there had not you, they struck you and you struck them again, or was some of them taking your part now was it, there was some of the women beat. - A. I cannot tell whether some of them took my part or not.</p>
               <p>Kite's Defence. When I came to the end of Diot street I saw a great many people, I saw him fall over the girls he was with, and some of the people lifted him up, the girl got up and ran up the street, I stood against the side of the Maidenhead, I saw the key and thimble lay on the ground, I picked them up; he said that us two girls had robbed him of fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mr. Bell) Did he charge the prisoners with having robbed him of fourteen shillings. - A. He did mention having lost fourteen shillings; there was only this one shilling found.</p>
               <p>Gogan's Defence. I was in Diot street, and as I was standing there this man was quarrelling with several girls, he said they had robbed him of fourteen shillings, he said I was one of the girls; Mr. Blackman found a shilling in my bosom, which was my own, he then said he had lost fourteen shillings, and when he was at Bow street he said he lost only one shilling.</p>

             sworn. I am a schoolmaster, I live in Tuston street, Westminster; on the 10th of April I bought some goods of Mr. Richards, the prisoner brought them and a bill and receipt, I paid him five pounds, nine shillings, and nine pence.</p>
               <p>(The bill and receipt produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (read in court) May it please you, my lord, the defendant was employed by Mr. Richards to deliver for him as porter, certain goods and articles, and on the delivering of the same to give a bill and receipt for the same, for five pounds nine shillings and ninepence, which he the said defendant did receive in cash of Mr. Harvey, and the said defendant returned home in order to return the cash to Mr. Richards, when to his great astonishment he could not find the money he had received, but by some accident found he had lost the same, which misfortune prevented him from returning, but the plaintiff immediately procured a warrant and had the defendant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020039"/>taken into custody, the said defendant on account of his confinement was unable to support his family or of paying the said money, and wishing to make some compensation to the defendant for the loss he had sussained, wrote the plaintiff a letter, desiring him to grant him his liberation, and he would repay him by instalments, but instead of that the plaintist has proceded to the utmost rigour of the law; the defendant therefore humbly prays that his innocence will appear in not making away or disposing of the said money, but having lost it by accident, and not with intent of any fraud, or to wrong him of it by any means whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) What was his character before this happened. - A. I had only been six weeks in business, I saw many people employ him, I had employed him and entrusted him with money before, but not to that amount; he says he lost the money, they said at his lodgings he had not done a stroke of work since.</p>

               <p>Q. I think you said the prisoner was sitting with you some part of the time the night before, in what room. - A. The back parlour.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had he been there. - A. I think the goalor told us three weeks or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know of any other lodger having gone out that morning. - A. No, they were all in bed.</p>

               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix) How came you to take this man without a character. - A. I had no character with him, he said he was a ship owner, he was a stranger, he would give me a reference in two or three days when he had cleared the ship; it was the first time I suffered a person to come into my house without a character; he did give me a reference to a banker's, but I did not go.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Macbride) Now young woman you got up at seven o'clock in the morning, you found the door open, you looked in the parlour and found the things were gone. - A. Yes, when I went down I found the adjoining room open, I went down into the kitchen, and the kitchen window was open, I went up stairs and alarmed the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you find at home. - A.All the family, the lady and gentlemen were in bed, and Mr. Reynolds the other gentleman, he was in bed, the servant came down at the same time with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she lay in the same room with you. - A. No, in the next room to me, I heard her get up and come down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into this man's room. - A. I did, I found nobody there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been in bed. - A. Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find whether it was warm or no. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no property in the house. - A. He left his nightcap, that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no box. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he no property with him, no linen to change. - A.He left nothing behind, not so much as an handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not bring any thing with him. - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the kitchen window open. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Somebody might have come in at that window. - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the kitchen window was fastened that night. - A. I am sure it was fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing any person in the house to have taken this property, and to have gone out of the door, it would have been unnecessary to have opened the kitchen window. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any appearance of the window being broke. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sash up. - A. I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Then for what you know it may have been up. - A. It may.</p>
               <p>Q. On any persons coming in at that window they might have shut the sash after them though they did not put the shutters up, I suppose you are a hard working girl, you generally sleep the night through. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore any body coming up the stairs, they might have gone down again without your knowing it. - A. They might.</p>
               <p>One of the jury. Were the shutters on the outside or within. - A. The shutters were on the inside fastened with a bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then a person on the outside could not have opened these shutters. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any appearance of any body coming in at the window. - A. No, the window shutter was open enough to give light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body examine the window. - A. I do not think they did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your lordship, in the first place my taking the name of Preston, was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020041"/>not in any way to commit any fraud, but merely from embarrassed circumstances; I solemnly declare that when I went out I pulled to the street door after me, I went out of town not with any view of defrauding the prosecutrix, neither did I know any thing of it at the time; I knew not of the robbery till such times I was accused by the prosecutrix, I had no other intent than to pay the lady for the lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix) Did not he pay for the lodging. - A. No, I received half a crown earnest when he took the lodging, the lodging was eleven shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The lady said I might pay it monthly, I was expecting remittances, I actually did send her a letter, saying I was obliged to go out of town, and that I meant to send her the money</p>
               <p>One of the jury. What led you to discover him in prison. - A. In consequence of information I received he was in prison for an offence he had committed two years ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hope the honourable court will not suffer this to prejudice my case, I was in there for debt; there was a gentleman called there that morning; when I came down stairs I found the door had been unbolted, and that somebody had been out.</p>

            . Mr. Reynolds, the gentleman that I said before was our lodger, intended that morning to go by the Bath coach at three o'clock; this man undertook to call him, which he did, he came down stairs to speak to his friend, he told me that he only bolted the door, he was too ill to go to Bath, he returned to bed again; he is a man of fortune and of great respectability.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q.(to the servant.) Whether I have not called you up several times to go to your sweetheart. - A. He has called me when I wanted to get up at six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. She is a married woman, therefore it is not likely.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. From my embarrassed circumstances it has not been in my power to have brought forward witnesses to my character; my reason for stopping away was I was every moment expecting to be arrested, I went to Gravesend, I was ashamed to send to any body to let them know the situation I was in; during all the time I was in that house, the house was totally free and open for me; if so be I had a bad intent, why go out in that manner, I might have gone when they had been out to the play, as the house was totally open.</p>

             sworn. I am going on fifteen, I work at tambour and satin stitch; I was going up the City Road with two pair of shoes for my mother, I saw three boys standing together at the corner of a little alley next to Mr. Swain's shop, I went up to the Jew boy and asked him how he sold his lemons, he said a penny a-piece, I heard the Jew boy say he helped the woman up with the curtain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020042"/>(that is the sun shade), I have watched the window but I cannot be positive whether he said hay or straw you have got in your hat, and that will do.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he haw or straw in his hat. - A. Yes, one had; I walked about a yard further, and all the three boys went to the window, and the Jew boy stood in the middle, and the other boy and the prisoner on each side of him, the Jew boy took something out of his pocket, and cut the window, and pushed the glass through with his finger, and the prisoner took out a little stick with a hook at the end of it, and took the things out, I called to Mr. Swain, and the boys all three run away.

             and myself, I did not suppose she took it to keep, but would return it; I expected her return the next day, as she had been accustomed to visit me daily in the Fleet; finding she did not return on the third day, I directed a letter to her, where I supposed she was, in Albermarle-street, to which I received no answer; I then became very alarmed for the safety of my purse and the effects deposited in it; from that time to this I could hear nothing of her till she was arrested (which I think was in July last) in an action of trover, joined in with this Dorant, to which bail was given; I did not hear any more of her until there was a public rumour of an action against her for an assault, that I think was in the latter end of November, 1805; that matter was bailed, I could not discover where she was, Mr. Sewell was my solicitor, he was a prisoner, he had a day rule.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had a day rule did you apply any where. - A. I did at Guildhall, and obtained a warrant, which warrant was backed by Mr. Kinnard, she then could not be found, I was removed to Bath; after I arrived at Bath, and was fully committed to take my trial, a writ was issued for the twenty thousand pound, but the affidavit was made in the month of November before; I swore to a debt of twenty thousand pound, in deeds, mortgages, bonds, and bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you recovered any of your things; has your action ever been tried. - A. Not yet, I have proceeded in it as far as I could; this writ was sent down to Bath by my solicitor, as well as this warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was determined to have her both ways; was she with you at Bath. - A. She was with Dorant at Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this diamond ring found or your purse found. - A. I never could find any part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you mentioned it to Mr. Eyles the warden of the Fleet. A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Nixon; I suppose you mentioned it to him, what misfortune you had. - A. I do not know that I ever mentioned it to Mr. Nixon; I mentioned it to Mr. Sewell and several fellow prisoners, but I did not mention it to the warden, because I was told he would order me to apply to a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Certainly he would. - A. I did make the application to Mr. Nixon, he told me he could not get the alderman down.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got the rules of the Fleet why did not you prefer your bill here, you did not ask leave of the warden to come here and prefer the bill of indictment. - A. No, I thought if I mentioned it to him he would have advised me to have a habeas corpus.</p>
               <p>Court. He would not, he might have brought you in the rules, it would have been no escape.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Cummins.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you come to England. - A. In the year 1802 or 1803, I came from the West Indies, I arrived from St. Christopher's, before that I was in St. Lucie, Antigua, St. Bartholomew, and St. Martin's.</p>
               <p>Q. And at all these places you followed the business of a gentleman. - A. I hope so.</p>

               <p>Q. Then I am to understand you, you never lived as clerk with any body in the West Indies; and never was in any business. - A. No business but what was connected with my own; during part of last war I was an officer in the British army, in the eighty seventh regment.</p>

            , a merchant in Liverpool, and sometimes I had bills upon my house, or upon the credit of it by Mr. Stevens, or Mr. Bolton, or upon those; I had credit to draw a thousand pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any one permission to draw upon any merchant in London. - A. I had permission to draw upon Mr. Hope in the month of February or March 1805; I drew several bills upon him for three or four hundred pound, they were drawn upon Mr. Hope's house, Amsterdam, payable in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send them to Amsterdam - A. No, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020044"/>were to be paid in Harley-street.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you told me just now that you drawed upon Mr. Hope two or three hundred pounds at a time, how much did you draw upon him in the whole. - A. I think altogether six or seven hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what house. - A. Upon the house of Arnold and Co. in the Old Jewry.</p>
               <p>Q. In January, 1805, you introduced yourself to Mr. Hope, as Mr. Romney Rouvellet, and that you expected large consigns of sugar. - A. At the time that I visited Mr. Hope, he asked me whether I had any expectations, I told him I had on or before August.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know any men of business in the city. - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you introduced to Mr. Arnold. - A. As Mr. Hope's correspondent.</p>
               <p>Q. You, expecting of having sugar to the amount of fifty thousand pound, you got Mr. Arnold to get an insurance to that amount, what was the insurance paid for that cargo. - A. I believe the instructions were given by Mr. Hope; I expected eighty or ninety hogsheads to arrive on or before the month of August.</p>
               <p>Court. What value might you put upon them. - A. That is uncertain, I cannot say, because the value fluctuates according to the current price.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an answer to my question. - A. I cannot say exactly what sum we insured for, nor how many hogsheads we insured.</p>
               <p>Q. The sugar never arrived. - A. No, not one hogshead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cummins. On your coming from Liverpool, you went into the first hotel, you being a gentleman. - A. I went to the first hotel, I was driven to the York hotel.</p>
               <p>Q. You introduced yourself as Mr. Rouvellet and lady. - A. I introduced myself at the hotel by paying the bills.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you go to the hotel and pass her as your wife. - A. I cannot say that I said to any body so, she certainly did pass for that.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did you address her by. - A. Perhaps by the name of Betsy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you introduce her there as your wife. - A. I believe I did; I kept no company at the hotel, I was only there for my own convenience, I never saw the master of the hotel.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you like to see the servants better, did not you both live there and pass as man and wife. - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you call her your wife repeatedly. - A. Perhaps I might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cummins. How long did you live there. - A. From the beginning of January to the middle of March.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe he quitted your room on the 14th of June. - A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Till the 11th of June that young woman came backwards and forwards. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your chum Cummings that she was your wife, what name did you call her. - A. Mrs. Rouvelet.</p>
               <p>Q. On June the 11th 1805, you were in a room on the top gallery in the Fleet prison; I think you have described you went to your purse, took out half a guinea, carried it to the man at the door, then you put your purse in your great coat pocket again. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the great coat that you have got on. - A. It is not; I did not say a great coat, a loose coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a purse was this. - A. It was a purse of two compartments, one side was the forty guineas and a half, and the other side the diamond ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you often wear a diamond ring. - A. I never wore it in the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have not had any correspondence with Mr. Hope since the consignment of the sugar failed. - A. I have not had any correspondence with him since the failure of the consignment of the sugar was known.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed the purse about twenty minutes after that young woman went out. - A. I did,</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cummings was with you till the 14th or 15th of June. - A. I think on the Friday following he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this the purse and diamond ring was lost. - A. I cannot say what day in the week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention it to Mr. Cummings. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a separation between you. - A. She did abscond, I never saw her afterwards till she was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020045"/>arrested.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say to Mr. Cummings, that you would not hesitate to do any thing to be revenged on her, meaning the unfortunate young woman at the bar, and lamented that you could not make a charge of felony against her. -</p>
               <p>Court. Upon your oath did you or did you not. - A. I cannot charge my memory with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say any thing like it. - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your purse or the contents again. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cummins. I ask you upon your oath whether Mr. Cummings did not on the 12th of June find your purse and money, and that under your bed. A. He did not; I recollect some days previous to that he did.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is whether after the 11th of June a person of the name of Cummings did not find a purse with the contents under your bed. - A. I do not recollect it; I was going to say that some day after I got up out of bed, Mr. Cummings making up the bed, took out the purse and gave it to me; I think that was before the 11th.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cummins. Did you not then say, Cummings this is what I have deliberated. - A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 14th or 15th of June Cummings, your chum, left the prison. - A. I think it was the latter end of the same week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him that order (a paper handed to the witness). - A. I gave him a letter, I believe, to Mrs. Rouvellet.</p>
               <p>Q. With an order for two or three guineas. - A. Very probably I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any authority. - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. This is your hand writing (shewing him a paper). A. I recollect something of the kind.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gleed. On the 6th of May I was in Gracechurch-street; I heard the cry of Stop thief, I saw the prisoner running; the moment he passed me he dropped a yellow purse with some silver, and a brown canvas bag with sixpence and some halfpence, I picked it up and carried it into Mr. Coltson's shop.</p>
               <p>- sworn. Examined by Mr. Gleed. I live at Mr. Coltson's, Gracechurch-street, a shoemaker. On the 6th of May the last witness brought in the two bags and laid them on the ground, he said he could not stop, I gave it to Mr. Barnard.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Barnard) Were you at Mr. Coltson's shop. - A. Yes, I was there, and took the two bags that the prisoner dropped, I took them into the room where the prisoner was searched, and delivered them to the constable.</p>
               <p>- BAYLEY sworn. Examined by Mr. Gleed. On the 6th of May did the last witness deliver to you two bags. - A. Yes, one bag contains ten bad shillings and one good sixpence, the other contains six-sixpences and some halfpence; I searched the man, and found two good sixpences and fivepence halfpenny in good halfpence, which we returned to him; the woman was searched by two women, and nothing found upon her.</p>

This shilling taken from the man is a counterfeit one, it has been newly coloured, it has not been in circulation; the one taken from the woman is exactly the same, and of the same manufactory, they have neither of them been in circulation since they have been coloured, and the ten shillings are all counterfeit; some of the sixpences are of the same manufactory, and some are also good.</p>
               <p>Ambrose Crafton's Defence. I went into this gentleman's house and had a glass of gin, I paid him, and he gave me change, I gave my wife another shilling, I did not know of them being bad at the time; my wife knew nothing of my concerns; the gentleman did not approve of the shilling that I gave her, she came out to me to get the shilling changed.</p>

My head was cut, and my left arm had been beaten from my fingers to my shoulder, and all round my body, and a piece of flesh was cut out of my left shoulder, I had guarded off the blows from my head with my left arm; I could not help myself, I was confined to my bed three or four days, I wrote to my supervisor to send an officer to do my duty.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you unable of performing your duty. - A. Near six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were laying in this state at your lodging, how soon was it after the morning this affair happened that you saw Prescott and Bastin. - A. About two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said to any body that Prescott and Bastin were the men that struck you. - A.I had, I said it to Mrs. Dennis, and to several people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever accuse any body else than these two men. - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened when Prescott came to you. - A. He knocked at the door, the woman that attended me was gone out, I was in bed by myself, I told him to come up, he came up to my bedside, he told me that he had heard that I accused him of being one of the men that beat him, he swore to his d - ation that he was not the man, I told him he was the man, he said farmer Leach would prove that he was in bed with his wife; he staid with me about a quarter of an hour, I shewed him my wounds on my shoulder and arm; he told me that he and his father were about having a vessel built, and it would be all over with them if I swore to him; he asked me whether the nineteen kegs would be of any use, I told him no; he said the nineteen kegs were no object, he did not mind their loss.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you saw the other prisoner, Bastin. - A. I think that was within five or six days, he came to my house with his brother, he said he understood I said he was one of the men that beat me, I told him he was, he said that it was only he and his brother that carried on the smuggling there; he said that he had never beat an officer in his life, and he had been taken a great many times; he asked me whether it was him or his brother, I told him I was positive it was him.</p>
               <p>Court. He denied that it was him that struck you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Now look at the men, upon your oath, to the best of your knowledge and recollection, are you able to say that they are the men that used you so. - A. Yes, I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. You called upon Bastin by name. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an opportunity of seeing him and of seeing the serjeant at the time the blows were given. - A. I had better opportunity of seeing Bastin when I was looking over my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the opportunity of seeing the serjeant so as to be able to swear to him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did receive from some hand or other an hundred pounds. - A. Yes, the hundred pound was received and paidback.</p>
               <p>Q. At any one time did you ever accuse any other person in the world, but the third person that you did not know, besides these two men. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after your complaint was made before you had an opportunity of apprehending these men. - A. I cannot say whether it was in January or February, we endeavoured to apprehend them, it was on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in company with you on the Sunday, when you had an opportunity of apprehending them. -

            , to apprehend them as they came from church, we saw them both coming together, I went up to them and and the other two officers followed, I put my hand to lay hold of them, they ran off in two directions, I ran after Prescott, but could not overtake him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been in that neighbourhood from the 29th of September to December. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had an opportunity of knowing these persons personally. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were, I presume, perfectly sober that night. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the kegs first you saw the marks very plain. - A. Yes, very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a tolerable light night, of course. - A. I could see farther than from where I stand to the bench.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that these men were using you so ill you called him by his name. - A. I only called Bastin by his name once, I did not call Prescott by his name at all, I received a blow from Bastin upon my head, I took all the blows I could upon my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it that you did not call the other by name as well as Bastin. - A. I thought I should be killed, I directed my discourse to Bastin; I had got a pistol in my pocket, I thought I would shoot one as I was likely to die.</p>
               <p>Q. You had only one cut on your head. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You said this kept you six weeks from your duty, how long did the surgeon attend you. -

               <p>Q. You said that they had handkerchiefs about their faces, but you could see their countenances for all that. - A. I could see it was Bastin, his handkerchief came down.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason that you knew the other, did his handkerchief come down. - A. No, I knew him from his voice; his handkerchief was on the lower part of his face, about as high as his mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. When Prescot called upon you he swore with some violent oath that he was not the man, and that he knew nothing of you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then asked you (you are correct about that of course) whether the nineteen kegs would be of any use to you, as he did not mind nineteen kegs, he said that. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave in your account to the excise officer, did you give it in with that circumstance. - A. I did not, I forgot.</p>

               <p>Q. And the night after that. - A. I cannot pretend to say, I only know of this one night, I should not have made the memorandum only I did not know but I might be called upon; the exciseman told me he had been beat, I told him it was a very dark night.</p>
