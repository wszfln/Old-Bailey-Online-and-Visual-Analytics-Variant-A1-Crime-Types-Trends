            , who lives at Enfield. On Saturday, the 26th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was about a quarter of a mile from my master's house, returning home from Southgate - I was walking by myself, and had a lanthorn in my hand. I was in the middle of the road, the prisoner overtook me, I wished him a good night before he came up, as I knew him before - he lived at Enfield with his father, another man was with him. He came up behind me, turned round, and seized me by the throat, the other man came up immediately, and picked my pocket of eighteen shillings in silver, and a tobacco-box; as soon as he seized me the other man took my lanthorn from me, and put the light out. I had an opportunity of seeing the prisoner's face before the light was put out. I did not call him by his name when I spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. After they robbed you what did they do - A. They pushed me back, and went away. I did not know the other man. On the Monday following, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner at a public-house at East Barnet, in custody of Haines; his sister told me he was taken, and I found him there. He was searched in my presence, and three snares and 2 s. 6 d. were found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Do you live with Mr. Idle still - A. Yes. I knew the prisoner before, and he knew me. I went to the public-house at East Barnet the same evening to look for him, but he was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not seen him, and never accused him of the robbery - A. No; he was taken at a public-house, at Rickmansworth, by Foster.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you see him in custody at Rickmansworth - A. About a month ago.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 28th of December I was at Cheshunt, when Gadd applied to the magistrate for a warrant, I and Champness went to apprehend the prisoner; we found him at the Cat, public-house, at East Barnet, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; I told him we took him on suspicion of robbing Gadd - he said nothing then. We searched him, and found three snares and a half-crown on him - Gadd came in. I told the prisoner we wanted his partner, Holdridge. He said if I would go back with him he would take me to where I could find him. I went to a place called Bone, but could not find him; we put the prisoner in the cage. The magistrate committed him to Newgate. Gadd understood the magistrate was to let him know when to appear and prefer the bill, and he did not attend - no bill was found. The prisoner was indicted last Sessions, when he was not in custody.</p>

I went through the next house, and got over the wall, into the yard of the empty house. I found the yard-door of the empty house open. I went towards the street-door, found it bolted at the top and bottom, the lock taken off, and laying in the middle of the passage.

I got over the wall of No. 13 myself, and saw a man drop from the garden-wall of No. 15, into the garden of No. 16. I then saw Nicholson drop from the wall of No. 15, into No. 16 - it was dark, but I had a candle; there is a parapet runs along the houses. I got into the garden of the empty house, and saw the figure of a man drop from a wall, into Cowley-street; I also saw the trees shake towards Barton-street. Two soldiers came to our assistance, and got over the wall of No. 16,; I saw one pick up a bundle and a stick, which he delivered to me. I gave information, and the next day Cooper brought the prisoners to the office; Sandyford had been taken the same night, by the watchman. I observed that a pearl button was off the knee of Nicholson's breeches. A few nights before the robbery, I saw both the prisoners together in King-street; each of them had a stick, like that found in the garden. I stopped them, and asked them where they were going? Another stick was delivered to me, by Tribe, with a small crow, and a pair of mens' shoes; he found them in the garden of No. 16, where I saw Nicholson drop. The prosecutrix's house, is in the parish of St. John the Evangelist, Westminster.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Pace, who lives next door to the empty house. I heard the alarm, ran into the garden, and saw a man on the roof of the tool-house. My master called me back to mind the thieves did not run down off the roof of the house. A few minutes after, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210005"/>heard that one was taken; I went into the garden, and found a stick and a crow-bar. I also found a pair of shoes on the roof of the tool-house, where I had seen the man. He was the same size as Nicholson, and had the same kind of clothes on as he had at the office - I did not see his face.</p>
               <p>JOHN CHURCHILL. I lived in the empty house before his. Hearing of the robbery, I went to the house, and found Gillmor there. Next morning I went to Pace's, and found a pearl button on the roof of his tool-house, among some leaves, which I have kept ever since. I went to Queen-square Office, and found Nicholson had the same sort of buttons on his breeches, and one was off. I cut another off, and produce them to shew they are the same. That found on the tool-house was without a shank - there was no shank left on his breeches.</p>

I saw the prisoner in the crowd, and gave him in charge, as I knew he was suspected of this robbery - he had the waistcoat and braces on at the time. I described the waistcoat to the prosecutor, and he said it must be his. Next morning I took the prisoner to Tothill-fields, he had no waistcoat on that I could see.</p>

On the 30th of March, about twelve o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the shop, and wanted to match a piece of lace; Mr. Vipond was serving two customers at the time - we could not match the lace. I showed her some more; she put her silk handkerchief on the counter, and shook it several times, which made me suspect her. I took the lace-box away, and showed her several cards of lace, and one loose piece - she did not like them. I turned to get more, from the window, but kept my eye on her, and saw her take a piece of lace off the counter very quick, and put it into her shawl. I turned round, and missed the loose piece of lace. She said she would call some other day, and wanted to be going. She went to the door, and looked at something there. She kept moving her hand about her pocket; I thought she was putting it in, and let her go out, then took her by the arms, and brought her back. I sent for a constable, who came and searched her, but found nothing on her. The lace was produced by my brother, who said he found it where she stood. She bought a yard of edging, which came to 3 1/2 d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long was she in the shop - A. About a quarter of an hour. I held her hands down, to prevent her throwing any thing away while I had got her.</p>

               <p>"No - I have no money, it is money you want, and not me;" she said I had got a trifle. By this time we had got through the narrow entrance, by the chapel, she let go my arm, as I thought to leave me, and then snatched my watch, and ran off to the men, as hard as she could; I followed her, she was stopped by a guard. I saw the men push her,; my watch was not found, but I am certain she snatched it. I never lost sight of her.</p>

On the 23d of February, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, my daughter called me out of the back-shop to the front. I found a pane of glass broken, and quite out; it had been cracked sometime before, but was quite safe before this. I missed the articles stated in the indictment out of the window, which are worth about 5 s. The prisoner was brought into the shop in a very few minutes by Taylor, who produced them, also two pair of knee-buckles, and two fruit-knives, which were mine, but I had not missed them.</p>

            . I live in Great Queen-street, about six doors, from Mr. Mead. On the 23d of February, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw three boys run by my shop. Suspecting them, I pursued, and overtook them in Drury-lane; the prisoner was one - I saw him put his hand into his pocket as he was running. I secured him, and took six pencil cases out of his pocket; I took him to the shop, and gave them to Mead. While I stood with the prisoner, a woman came up, and gave me two pair of silver buckles, and two silver double-bladed fruit-knives, which she said were thrown into a passage; she shewed me the passage, which was between the shop, and where I took him - the other boys got away in the crowd. I had seen them lurking about the shop all the afternoon, which made me suspect them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not pick them up - A. No, I was close behind him, and must have seen it if he did. It was a very dirty day, and they were quite clean. He had a dark green ragged coat on, and a ragged apron.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HENRY PARTRIDGE. I live in Orange-street, Red-Lion-square. I was passing Mead's shop, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and saw three boys close together, leaning on the window-ledge of his shop; I passed them, and turned back to look at them. One of them turned and saw me; he informed the rest, and then all turned round, and ran away. The middle one took his hand out of a hole in the glass, which was large enough to admit his arm; he had a great quantity of silver articles in his hand. The other two snatched them out of his hand, and all three ran off together. I only saw their backs, and will not swear the prisoner was one; when he was taken he had a blue ragged coat on, and a short ragged apron, the dress that one of them had. I saw him at the watch-house that day, he had the same dress on then, which enables me to say he is one of them. It was one of the others that took the things out of the window; they were all acting together - I saw some pencil cases taken out. I had seen the prisoner about a week before, in company with the boy who put his hand into the window, he had the same dress on. I think his coat was blue, but it was so dirty that I could hardly judge. I knew his dress when I saw him at the watch-house.</p>

We returned about seven o'clock in the evening - it was nearly dark. I tried, but could not unlock the door, as there was something in the lock; I tried again, and the key went in all of a sudden, when two men opened the door, and ran out. I instantly seized them both - the prisoner was one; he struck me on the head with something which cut my head through my hat. Both hit me several times; the blow stunned me, and the blood ran dow my face, I staggered, caught hold of the wall, and they ran off. The prisoner turned round, and said</p>
               <p>"He is done for." I instantly recovered myself, and pursued. A man caught the prisoner, and I immediately seized him, and brought him back to my house. On my taking him back, he dropped a telescope, which was mine; I had left it on the table. He also dropped a dark lanthorn - I lost the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

               <p>ELLEN DEAKIN. I went out with my husband. I followed the men, who rushed out of the house; they blew the candle out. The prisoner was never out of my sight, until he was taken - I am certain he was one of them; they struck my husband on the head. All the drawers were broken open and emptied, and the articles stated in the indictment gone.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Colston. On the 31st of March, between one and two o'clock in the day, a person rang at the bell; I opened the door, and found the prisoner there. He asked if we wanted a hand in the upholstery line? I never saw him before; I told him I would go and ask. I went out of the shop into the private passage, leaving the prisoner alone in the shop. I called to my master, who was in the yard, and he told me to tell the man to leave his address. When I came back the prisoner was gone, and I missed a piece of carpet, which was safe when I left the shop, on a set of dining-tables. I ran out, turned the corner, and saw the prisoner with the carpet on his shoulder; he was stopped by Porter before I got up; I had not called out. When I got up, he took the carpet off his shoulder with his hands, and said he would take it back. I left him with Porter, and ran back to tell my master.</p>

On the 10th of April, between five and six o'clock, the prisoners came to the shop, and desired to look at the glass of earrings; I put it on the counter. While Edwards was looking at them, Smeed broke a glass on the counter, about three quarters of a yard from the rings. She asked what it came to, offered a 1 l. note, and paid 6 s. for it - Mrs. Jefferson gave her change. Immediately after the glass was broken, we missed two pair of ear-rings out of the case which Edwards was looking at. I said I was certain they were there half an hour before. She said it was unpleasant that it should happen while she was in the shop; she ordered things amounting to 5 l. 14 s. She selected some-before, and some after this. She said she had no money, but wished the things to be sent to No. 28, New-street, Minories, to Mr. E. Jones, and left 2 s. as a deposit. The circumstances altogether made me suspect them, and I said it was very strange. They said did I suspect them? I said it was a delicate thing to suspect a customer, but I must acknowledge that I could not help it. Mrs. Jefferson said if they suffered our man to take the goods with them, and they paid for them, if they lived where they said they did, it would clear our suspicions; the man went with them - they neither consented or refused. He brought them back in about half an hour; they said they came back, being disappointed in receiving some money in the Strand. We again spoke of the ear-rings; Edwards said,</p>
               <p>"If you suspect me, search me," but they both felt themselves hurt, and much insulted. They gave me 1 l. more as a deposit on the things ordered, and then went away. In about ten minutes Gook, the officer, brought Smeed back, and produced a paper. I said it was a paper on which the lowest pair of ear-rings were. He turned to Smeed, and said,</p>
               <p>"Now where are the ear-rings?" He then took a handkerchief from her hand, and in one corner were both pair tied up. Edwards was brought back by Glasborough, but nothing was found on her. We afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210011"/>missed three more pair of ear-rings, which have never been found.</p>

I stopped them in Cecil-court, and asked them to come back? they asked what for, and said they knew where they were going to, and went into Charles-street, stopped there, and one said to the other, that she had money, and could pay for the things if it was agreeable. They gave me 10 s. in the street, and said I might depend upon it they should come for the things. I followed them down Castle-street to the Admiralty Office; they went into the office, came out in a few minutes, and said the gentleman they was going to receive some money of, had been gone half an hour, and they could not receive it till Monday, and if I would bring them on Monday, they would pay for them. I said I should be much obliged to them to go back to the shop, which they did; and as I came up Castle-street, I saw Gook, the constable, and gave him a signal to follow me. I told him to wait at the door - the prisoners went into the shop.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoners go into the shop with Glover, and come out, I followed. They turned backwards and forwards, up different streets. They turned into a public-house in Green-street, and I left Glasborough to watch, while I returned to the prosecutor's to learn the particulars. As I returned I met Smeed alone; Glasborough was following her. He put a paper into my hand. I took hold of her, and said,</p>
               <p>"Now where are the ear-rings?" she said she had not got them, and knew nothing about them. She appeared to be shuffling with her left hand; I told her to hold it still. I took her back to the shop, and Loxley identified the paper - I found the ear-rings in the corner of her handkerchief. I sent Glasborough for Edwards - he brought her in five minutes.</p>

            . I was left to watch the prisoners at the public-house in Green-street - they called for half a pint of beer; Smeed came out in a minute, and I followed her. About the middle of Castle-street, she tore something from the middle of a paper, and threw the paper down. I picked it up, and gave it to Gook, whom I met.

The prisoner, Edwards, gave me two half-crowns and three-pence, I gave her 6 d. Edwards sported some frivolous conversation, which I noticed - they went away together. About nine o'clock the same evening, Gook, the constable, brought the children's shoes to me which Edwards had bought - I knew them to be those which I had sold her. About twenty minutes after ten o'clock, Gook came again with a basket, which contained three other pair of shoes, which I knew to be ours by the private mark - they were on a shelf at the back of the shop; I had dusted them that morning - I had not sold them; they were worth 1 l. Edwards was quite away from that part of the shop, but Smeed was not. No person was in the shop but the prisoners and myself. They did not appear to be intoxicated.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 4th of April, I was at the Nag's Head, Islington, with George Hill - we had a glass of gin each, and left the house ten minutes before ten o'clock - we had not staid in the house above two minutes. Immediately we came out of the house, Hill was knocked down by a gang of about a dozen men, who were coming along as we came out. I went to pick him up - they came up, and asked me what I had to do with it? One of them knocked me down, and I immediately missed my watch out of my fob. I took one of them into custody, and gave him in charge to the watchman - it was Elliott - they took him to the watch-house. They knocked me down first. The watchman came up, and assisted me in securing him. The rest of the gang ran off, and did not attempt to rescue him. I did not see the prisoner, Harris, among them. The gang all assisted each other, and were of the same party. They attacked me on the pavement, hustled me about, and knocked me down. My watch was safe just before. It had a key and seal to it.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I was in company with Willan. We called at the Nag's Head, had a glass of gin each, and came out directly. When we got about three steps from the door, we were met by a gang of ten or a dozen men - they pushed against my left shoulder. I made way for them to pass, and said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo, my lads, what is that for?" Immediately as I said the words, I was knocked down. Willan came to my assistance, picked up my hat, put it on my head, and helped me up. The prisoner, Harris, came up to Willan, and shoved him back - I saw him draw his hand off. Willan immediately said,</p>
               <p>"George, I have lost my watch!" I know Harris to be the man by his dress and his hair. He had a light drab great-coat on, and a small-brimmed hat. Next morning I sent Willan to Lack to give information and to describe him. He was apprehended with two others that morning. I went to the Nag's Head and saw him in custody of Lack, and pointed him out from two other immediately. I said,</p>

               <p>"This is the man who had the watch" - he said,</p>
               <p>"So help me G - d, you are wrong!" I am sure he is the man - I took particular notice of him. He said he was elsewhere that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. I had been with Willan all day - we only drank a glass of gin. We had a pot of half-and-half at another house in the afternoon, Harris drove the prosecutor back, face to face, several paces.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had a better opportunity of observing him than you had - A. They were close together. I saw no watch in his hand, but the moment I saw Harris draw his hand up Willan said he had lost his watch. He was apprehended next day at the very spot where the robbery was committed, and said he was in Drury-lane at the time.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. I received information, and went in search of the prisoner, Harris. On Monday, the 5th of April, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I saw him about two hundred yards from the watch-house, in company with another man, they were leaning against some railing, talking together. I watched them till they got near the watch-house - they then joined a third man. Harris left them, and sat himself down on the railing of the watch-house, close to the door. I sent for Willan and Hill. All three were then coming down together from the watch-house. I followed them into the Nag's Head - I then told them that I took them into custody, and put them into the tap-room. The landlord, the man-servant, and another person were there. Willan and Hill came; I told them to go into the room, and see if there was anybody there they knew - I followed them in. Hill instantly said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man who robbed Willan of his watch" - pointing to the prisoner, Harris. They both said they did not know the other men, and they went away - I kept Harris. I had told him he was suspected of robbing a man of his watch the night before. He asked me what time? I said I did not know. He said he was at home and in bed at ten o'clock, in Drury-lane; and if he had been guilty of the robbery, he would have seen me b - d before I should have taken him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say he was at home going to bed, or that he was in bed - A. I do not know.</p>

On Sunday, the 4th of April, I went to Mr. Branden's, who lodges at No. 8, Charles-street, Drury-lane, for some money which he owed me - I saw Harris there, sitting in a chair by the fireside - it was about quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before ten o'clock when I got there - I was there about five minutes, I went straight home, and got there about twenty minutes after ten. I have no doubt of his being the man who was there. I went to Clerkenwell prison on Tuesday morning to see him, and am sure he is the man.</p>

I found the counting-house had been entered by a pane of glass being taken out, and the lock of the counting-house-door picked withinside. The pane of glass was large enough for a man to get through; every thing was safe the night before.

            . I am constable of Bread-street. On the 4th of March I was on duty as night constable; between three and four o'clock, the patrol informed me that the prosecutor's cellar-door was open. I went and found it so; anybody could then enter the house. We alarmed the house, and went into the cellar to look for the thief, but could find nobody there. I found a pen and ink and a bayonet in the cellar, and on the privy I found a piece of candle, which appeared lately to have been put out. I lit it, and searched further, and by the door of the wine cellar I found a chisel; this door had been attempted, and the marks matched the chisel. I went up to the counting-house, and found a pane of glass broken, sufficient for a man's body to enter; there was an iron chest in the cupboard, which appeared to have been attempted, and by it I found a hammer, which had been broken, and a punch. A screw was forced out of the door of the chest, and driven in; a person must have been a long time about it - it was quite dark when I went in. Two drawers in the counting-house were also broken open, and a door, which enclosed a nest of small drawers. Mr. Blakesley missed some silver, and some halfpence; he could not say how much; he missed a silk umbrella, and a deal box, containing two soldiers jackets. On Saturday, the 6th of March, I apprehended the prisoner in Dover-street, Blackfriars-road, about seven o'clock in the evening. He asked me what I took him for? I said Mr. Blakesley wanted to speak to him; I took a silk umbrella out of his hand, which Blakesley claimed. I found 2 s. on him, seventeen scutcheons, and a hook, which were also claimed.</p>
               <p>CHRISTMAS WINTER. I am a watchman; the prosecutor's house is in my beat. I came on duty about nine o'clock, and examined the doors and shutters of all the premises; every thing was then safe. I examined every thing again at two o'clock, and all were safe - I left my beat at four. About a quarter after three, the prisoner came to me in Friday-street, and asked me if I could tell him where to get a coach. A coachman had put down a fare at the Saracen's Head at the time. It was about 100 yards from the prosecutor's door; I told him there was one, and called the coachman. He asked where it was to go to? the prisoner told him to turn, and go to the bottom of Little Friday-street, and he would go and get his box - I never saw him before but I noticed him particularly; his back was very white, as if he had been against a wall. I suspected him, and thought I would get my lanthorn, and see where he got the box from. While I was getting my lanthorn I lost sight of him, but I had taken the number of the coach - it was 377. I went down Little Friday-street with the coach; the driver asked where the man was who wanted the coach? while I was talking to him, the prisoner came from behind me; I had my back towards the prosecutor's house - he came out of there. He said to the coachman</p>
               <p>"it is not this corner of Friday-street, it is the other, which is next to Bread-street." He went away with the coach - St. Paul's clock struck half-past three. I went and called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210014"/>the hour, and examined all the doors, but not the lower shutters. I came back to the corner of Watling-street, and saw the cellar-door wide open. It must have been broken open before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's door - A. No, but he came from the door. I gave the alarm at the watch-house, as I found the cellar-door forced - Jerwood came down; they had entered by forcing the cellar open. There was a little narrow passage by the wine-cellar, which would have whitened a man's coat, if he had been there. I found the premises as Jerwood has stated. I described the prisoner to Mr. Blakesley, and searched for him on the Saturday morning. I found the coachman, and he told me where he drove him to, and went with me and Tulley to look for him. Tulley told me if he spoke to a man, and called him</p>
               <p>"Danny," I was to notice if he was the man. We met the prisoner in Dover-street; Tully called him</p>
               <p>"Danny," I was positive he was the man that I saw - he was secured. I went up to him, and asked him if he knew me? he said,</p>
               <p>"Who are you?" I said</p>
               <p>"don't you recollect seeing me yesterday morning, between three and four o'clock, in Friday-street?" he made no answer - he had an umbrella in his hand. I saw the things found on him.</p>
               <p>HENRY EAST. I am a coachman, and drive No. 377. On Friday morning, I was in Friday-street, and saw the last witness; he looked at my number. I heard a man asking him if he could get a coach. The man ordered me to follow him down the street, which I did, to the end of Little Friday-street. I waited there about five minutes, and then he said it was the other end - the prisoner is the man, I am confident. He went away, and came again presently with a box on his shoulder; I noticed that the back of his coat was dusty and white, as if he had been rubbing against a wall. He directed me to Francis-street, Westminster-road, by the Bridge and the Obelisk. As we were going along the Blackfriars-road, he pulled the string, and told me to set him down at the next turning beyond Dover-street; he got out there, and I saw him go through a passage into Dover-street - he left the box in the coach. He returned, and asked me what I would take him to Peckham for? we could not agree about it, and he ordered me to Francis-street again. In going along he ordered me to drive to the Coburg Theatre; he got out at the corner of the Theatre, walked some distance, and called me to follow him with the coach; he took the box out, and left me near the Theatre - I had a good opportunity of observing him. He afterwards came back, and rode on the box with me to Dover-street; I had a full view of his person - I cannot be mistaken. Next day I showed the constable the different places I drove him to.</p>

            . I work for the prosecutor, and know the prisoner. He was discharged about three years ago. I heard of the burglary the next morning, and the description of the man, and went after the prisoner; we found him in Dover-street - Winter saw him, and remembered him. I spoke to him, and Winter said he was the man that he saw in Friday-street; I gave him in charge, and told him that my master wanted to speak to him. When we got out of Dover-street, I told him he was suspected of breaking the house open - he said nothing to the charge. He asked me to let him have some drink; we went into a house in Fleet-market, and he had some rum and water; I did not see any thing drop from him. I went away, and on my return was told he had dropped a pocket-book.</p>

            . On Saturday evening, about a quarter after eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner in custody at the Artichoke, in Fleet-market - he passed me as he was going out; the constable had hold of him at the time. He put his head close to mine, and asked me to pick up a pocketbook, which he had dropped - it was just behind him - the persons who held him, could not hear him, I should think. I picked it up as soon as he was gone out, and kept it until Sunday evening, I then heard of the charge, and delivered it to Mr. Blakesley. He described every thing that it contained, before he saw it; I then delivered it to him.</p>
               <p>MR. BLAKESLEY re-examined. I am certain the umbrella is mine, I saw it safe in the counting-house the day of the robbery. There are seventeen scutcheons and the brass hook, the same pattern as those I lost, but I will not swear to them; they are the same pattern as those which are left behind. They were in the nest of drawers in the counting-house, which has a door to cover them, and which was broken open. The pocket-book is mine, and was taken out of a drawer under the desk, which was forced. Harmer brought it to me on Sunday. I know it by the contents, which are a map, papers, and other things, which are mine. There are papers in it which are not mine - they have writing upon them which appear to be the prisoner's hand-writing, as far as I can judge, and a discharge from the army, in the prisoner's name. I have heard he was in the army.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>

I returned, measured my goods, and found eight yards and a half of cotton cut off a piece, only three yards were left - I had sold none of it. I accused her of it, she strongly denied it. A friend of mine came, I told her I had been robbed, and it must be the prisoner, she made no reply, but ran up stairs. I called her father down. Her father and I went to Rich's in consequence of what she said, but found nothing there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go there with an officer - A. Yes, in the evening, and found a quantity of patent cord and fustians of different qualities, which appeared like my goods. I had lost such goods. Next day I went again with the officer, and found a great deal of pocketing, and the black glazed cotton - it was cut up in different quantities - I could not swear to it. I found some velveteen, which I knew to be my husband's. I am positive of part of it.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Cloth-fair. On the 14th of April Barry came with the constable to my house, and took some property which I bought of the prisoner, who said she came from Mrs. Barry. I told them there was more, they came again next day, and took more things, all of which I got from the prisoner. I had sent my son several times to watch her when she brought things, and he watched her into Barry's shop, which is about twenty doors from my house.</p>

She told me, if I confessed that I had sold any thing for them, she would tear my liver out, and I said I sold them, as I was afraid of her threats.

            . I am a journeyman tailor. On Christmas eve Mrs. Barry talked to me - we had some gin together. She said she expected in a little time she should be better off; for if she could get her things home her shop would hardly hold them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where from - A. I thought she meant from pledge, I have seen her drunk twice. She once quarrelled with her husband - they settled it by getting drunk together. The prisoner and her father lived in the house.</p>

            . I live at Stretton-ground, Westminster. On the day before Easter Sunday, I went to the prosecutrix's house to take some straps - she had no money to pay for them. She threw the prisoner down a piece of cloth and said,</p>

I have been to the shop four or five times a week, before and since he was in prison. I do not suppose there were twenty yards of any one thing there, except a piece of flannel and some velveteen - his stock was diminished every time I went there. I have seen Ireland there once or twice. Once, when I was passing, I saw two or three friends with Mrs. Barry - the bottles and glasses were on the counter. I have seen this twice.</p>

            . I am superintendant of the watch, of Christ Church, Middlesex. On the 23d of April, about ten minutes past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner and another man at the corner of a court in Wheeler-street, Spitalfields, looking over a basket, as I thought, to see what it contained. I followed them about four hundred yards into Crispin-street, Paternoster-row, and asked Oakey what he had got there? I took him to a public-house, and asked him how he came by the things? he said he bought them of a man for 10 s. as he returned from Smithfield - it contained the beef, wine, and handkerchief. I collared him, and took him to the watch-house. He put up his fist, cut me across the eye, and said he would go no further - I secured him at last; he made a great resistance.</p>

            . I was filling a drift cart in the road, between two and three o'clock, and saw three chaises coming along towards Barnet; they were a very little way from each other. The one that did the accident was going at a very moderate pace, the other two drove faster, and passed it. There was a gentleman in each of the chaises.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they driving faster than the usual pace - A. After the accident they mended their pace, as the rattling of one chaise passing the other appeared to frighten the horse of the chaise that did the accident; the horse glanced off; I did not see the child till after it was picked up. When the chaise came up to me, I heard the gentleman in the two first halloo out, and then the postboys mended their pace; the other chaise pulled up directly the accident happened. I held the horse, while the gentlemen got out, and the chaise went on for a surgeon. I stopped till Mr. Booth, the surgeon came; I saw Evans take the child up, and take it to a house opposite the road, where the child belonged to; Giddens drove the chaise that rode over the child - the spot where the accident happened was about two yards from the side of the road, but when the horse took fright it turned quite off; it appeared to me to be going at a very proper pace. Both the gentleman and the postboy got assistance immediately.</p>

            . I saw the chaise pass as I stood at my own door. A man named Veals drove one, he passed Giddens, who was going at a moderate pace - Veals got by about twenty or thirty yards. Then Townsend's chaise was passing Giddens's, and Giddens's horse threw out of the road, and ran against the child - it knocked it down. I ran over, and Evans picked the child up; it was carried to its grandmother's house just by, and left in her care.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210017"/>It was hurt about the head; Evans tried to sit it on its feet, but it could not stand.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did it appear to you that Giddens was driving improperly - A. No, he was driving at a steady pace, as he ought to do - it appeared to me to be quite an accident. Veals drove one of the chaises, and Townsend the other - they were going faster than the prisoner's.</p>

               <p>HENRY LANOY HUNTER, ESQ. I was passing in the road on horseback, when the accident happened, and saw three chaises coming towards me, some of them were driving very hard; I got a little out of the road, in order to let them pass, and saw one of them drive over the child, but cannot take upon me to say that it was one of those that were driving fast. Immediately after the accident I rode into Barnet for a surgeon, another man ran by the side of my horse all the way. I sent the man for a surgeon, and Mr. Booth immediately went in the chaise that caused the accident.</p>

I gave him a note out of my box, and he gave me 10 s. in change - I believe it was a 1 l. note that I gave him. About a week or ten days after he brought me some more work home, which came to 10 s. I paid him another 1 l. note - I looked at it of course - I had several other notes in my box of different amounts. There was a 20 l., a 10 l., and a 5 l. He went out for change, and gave me 9 s. 6 d., or 10 s.</p>
               <p>Q. While you was paying him this last note, were you called away - A. I am not certain whether it was the first or the last time that I was called away by the ringing of the bell. I went up, leaving him in the pantry, and my box open. I returned in about five or six minutes, and he was still there.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the 20 l. note between the first and the last time - A. I am not certain; I often went to this box, as it was my clothes box. On the 4th of March I missed it, and got the number of it from Messrs. Pagets, the bankers; it was paid me last May. I went to the prisoner, and told him of it; he said he had not seen it, nor had he got it. I asked him if I had made a mistake in giving him a 20 l. note instead of a 1 l.? he said No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at that time you doubted whether you had given it to him or not - A. I looked at the note that I gave him, but I thought he would not own it if he had stolen it. I asked him what he did with the note that I paid him? he said he did not know, he might have paid it to his currier. I went to a person named Hill, a tailor, in Regent's-mews; after that I went with my master to the prisoner. My master asked him if he knew any thing of a 20 l. bank post bill? he said No, he did not. My master questioned him more closely, and told him that he knew he had been out with Hill one evening to buy some things, and asked him if he knew what money Hill changed? he said at first that he did not exactly, but it might be a large note, and that he did not receive any part of the money. He continued to deny it until he got to the office. He said as he was going to the office that Hill had said that he had taken the note of a coachman or a groom, and mentioned the name of the lady the person lived with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. You missed the note about nine days after he had been to you - A. Yes, I only know the number by what was told me at the bankers - I got the number of six notes which they paid me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you know which of the six it was - A. By the other five coming in before - I never dealt with Hill. I paid no money to anybody but the prisoner, or opened my box in the presence of any one else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never leave your box open - A. When I missed the note my box was locked, but the asp not put in; it was in that state two or three days. I traced the note to Hill.</p>

            , ESQ. I live in South Moulton-street. I went to the prisoner's stall, which is next to Hill's stall, in the Mews. I asked him if he had not changed a 20 l. post bill? he said he never saw any such thing. I asked him if he had not lent Hill 3 l. or 4 l.? he said some month or two ago he had lent him money. I asked him if he had not been out with Hill to make some purchases? he said he frequently went with him. We then asked him if he had not been to Vigo-lane with him? he said he did not know where Vigo-lane was. I told him where it stood; he then recollected, and after persisting that he had not been present at the passing of a 20 l. bank post bill, I told him I was certain he had been at Bedward's shop, and had changed a 20 l. bill. He then said he was present, that Hill changed it, and he purchased a waistcoat-piece, and Hill purchased several articles, and took all the change. I then gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I generally change notes at French's. Bishop brought me a note which has French's name on it, in my writing - I will not say it is that I paid Hill.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say it was a ready-money transaction - A. Yes; he said the man referred him to No. 13, St. Mary Axe - that he met him in the street promiscuously. I found that the prisoner lived where he said. He was out on bail four or five days, and came to the second examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Christmas ask the prisoner from whom he received the note - A. I understood him to ask where he got it - he asked him where he brought it from?</p>

            . I am sexton of the New Synagogue, Leadenhall-street. On the 21st of December I buried the prisoner's mother, she had lived in Still-alley, Houndsditch. It is the custom to have prayers every morning and evening for seven days in the room the deceased died in. The near relatives always confine themselves in the house during the seven days. I attended the prayers every day - the prisoner always appeared very ill; he was obliged to be held up to repeat a certain prayer. I was there on Sunday, the 27th of December, it was the last time of the prayers; he was present, and appeared to be worse than before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You cannot remember how many persons attended - A. No, I have not got my book. There are always ten people present at the prayers.</p>

            . I am a tailor. The prisoner's mother died in the Christmas week. I called several times in the course of the seven days to see the family, the prisoner was always there. His father told me to come at the expiration of the seven days, to make the boys some clothes. I called there on Sunday to measure them - the prisoner said he was ill, and could not stand to be measured; this was about ten o'clock in the morning. I called again about twelve, and found him on the bed. The house is nearly two miles from Stepney Church.</p>

            . In December last I attended the prisoner's mother as nurse, and was there when she died. She was buried the next day, which was Monday. The family sat seven days on the ground on account of the mother's death. The prisoner attended his mother's funeral. He was never out of the house from the time of her death<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210019"/>until I left, which was near a fortnight after the funeral. He could not be absent on the 27th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoner attended the funeral, which was in Whitechapel. I believe he was obliged to attend. He went in a coach, and returned in one - he was very ill.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, &amp;c. I attended the prisoner's mother - she died the latter end of December. After the death of a parent, it is the custom of the family to keep together, and say prayers for seven days; they must not absent themselves. I called at the house during the seven days, on account of the prisoner's indisposition; he was in a general state of debility, and has been a diseased man for three or four years. He was not able to stand, or even attend to the compulsory duties of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have walked two miles seven days after his mother's death - A. It was impossible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you there every day - A. No, my son, or assistant, attended occasionally. The prisoner lived in Cock and Hoop-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you attend his mother last - A. I really cannot say. I am so taken up with one branch of my profession that I seldom went - my son mostly went.</p>

On the 5th of April, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I went out, leaving the notes, watches, and other things stated in the indictment, in the chest; I came home about half-past one or two, met my wife, and went with her to No. 2, Russell-court, up two pair of stairs, and found my iron chest under the bed in the back room - some boys and men took us there - it had a canvas bag over it. I got two men to carry it to Lambeth-street Office. The prisoner,

On the 30th of January I missed these goods, and went with an officer to a person's house of the name of Macintosh, where I found the prisoner at work; I asked him if he had received any goods from Elliott, my servant? he denied it for sometime, but on pressing him further, he said he had received them. I gave him in charge. He said they were at his lodgings, which were a few doors off. We went with him, and found the articles stated in the indictment in his box.</p>

            , JUN. I am an officer. On the 30th of January I apprehended Elliott, and went with Mr. Eland to Macintosh's, where we found the prisoner at work, as a tailor. Mr. Eland gave him in charge, and accused him of receiving the things from Elliott; he denied it for sometime, and seemed much alarmed. Macintosh said,</p>
               <p>"if you have any thing belonging to Mr. Eland, you had better show them where it is." We went to his lodgings, which were about two doors from Macintosh's, went up to the room where he lodged, and he unlocked his box - he took the key out of his pocket, and in the box I found the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Q. What was he in the office - A. A sorter. He opened the bag that morning, and then sorted them. Letters put into the York bag on the 5th of December, would arrive in due course on the 7th.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning would the prisoner finish his duty - A. About ten o'clock; he would then leave the office. It was his duty to sort the York letters.

            . I have known the prisoner two years and a half - I have not known what he was above a year. My husband is a Frenchman, and is not in any trade here, I was servant in a family in Wood-street before I married him. I went abroad with them, and there became acquainted with him.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the prisoner tell you he was - A. A clerk in the Post-office.</p>
               <p>Q. In December, did you purchase a pelisse of Mr. Swift, in Houndsditch - A. Yes, on Monday, the 7th of December; I paid a 20 l. bank note for it, which I received of the prisoner at Mr. Baverstock's, who keeps the Angel and Crown, public-house, opposite Whitechapel church; I met him there by appointment, about one o'clock that day. He gave me the note, and told me to buy myself a pelisse.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner is deaf; when you met him at Baver-stock's, did you converse with him, or did he write - A. He wrote on a piece of paper, that I was to buy myself a pelisse, not to exceed 3 l., and to give the name of Mrs. Gray, No. 24, White Lion-street, Pentonville. I was to meet him again at Longman's, the Grapes, public-house, in Aldgate Church-passage - he wrote all this down. I then left him, went to Swift's, bought a pelisse, and paid the same 20 l. note he gave me - (looks at D. C. Swift) - that is the person I paid it to. The pelisse came to 2 l. 15 s., I received 17 l. 5 s. in change. They asked me my name, and I gave the name and address as he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Swift get you the 17 l. 5 s. - A. I waited while the man went for change. I then went to Longman's, met the prisoner there, and gave him the same notes and money I received from Swift - I think they were all 1 l. notes, but I am sure some were. I wrote the name on the note - (looks at it) - this is it; it has,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Gray, No. 24, White Lion-street, Pentonville," on it, in my own handwriting. I was acquainted with the prisoner until he was taken up, and had no difference with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasioned you to come forward - A. My own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210023"/>safety. I found there was a hand-bill out respecting a person answering my description - I came forward voluntarily, and gave this account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You live with your husband - A. I do; he is not a man of property. I have a great deal of work, and support him in a great part. He is ill, and incapable of working. He used to have supplies from his father in France. We live in Upper Thames-street with my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived with Mrs. Johnston - A. Yes, before we went to Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Johnston tell you she would not keep you any longer - A. No; we left in consequence of her leaving town.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you came forward to save yourself - there is also a reward - A. Yes, I think it is 50 l. I do not know how long the prisoner was in custody before I came forward. I attended two examinations. I do not know Levy's.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never lived at Levy's, in Devonshire-court - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray were you ever at any other public-office but Bow-street - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You was never at the Mansion-house - A. I may have been there - I was never in prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care. Do you mean to swear you never was confined on any charge yourself - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the oath you have taken were you not a prisoner in the House of Correction - A. For one month; it was for pledging things from a ready-furnished lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say you was never in prison - A. I did not recollect it. I was sent there from Lambeth-street.</p>
               <p>A. Then you was at a police-office, besides Bow-street and the Mansion-house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the pelisse - A. I pledged it. It was discovered by the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a married man - A. I did not know it when I first became acquainted with him - I learnt it about twelve months after.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Was any discovery made respecting the pelisse until you came forward and mentioned it - A. No. I communicated it to Mr. Parkin, the solicitor to the Post-office.</p>
               <p>(MR. GURNEY here exhibited the hand-bill, offering the witness a reward to come forward and prove who she received the note of. The reward was not upon the prisoner's conviction.)</p>

            . I have been acquainted with the prisoner two years and a half. When he was in the House of Correction on this charge, I visited him there, I accompanied his sister to Mrs. Coffyne's.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner request you to go anywhere - A. He merely said,</p>
               <p>"Go, and see what can be done with Mrs. Coffyne." I went with his sister to her house; she went in, but I did not.</p>

            . I am one of the presidents of the Inland Office. On the 16th of October, in the evening, the prisoner was on duty - his particular duty was to charge the letters in the Norwich division - he exclusively managed that division. A letter to Bury, in Lancashire, would not necessarily go to him. It was frequently his habit, as well as others to go to the sorting table, and help themselves - he would have an opportunity of taking letters out of the general mass. It sometimes happens that a letter for Bury, Lancashire, goes to the Norwich division, as there is Bury, St. Edmonds, if it came to him it was his duty to put it in the blind letter-box to be sorted again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. JARVIS. Q. There is not a separate basket for each bag - A. No; the prisoner had an aperture to himself in a recess. There are twenty sorters.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was the prisoner from where the Bury, in Lancashire, letters could be put - A. Almost the length of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner went occasionally to the sorting table - A. Yes, particularly at the early part of the evening, as the messengers do not attend then. I do not mean to blame him for it, it is a matter of praise - letters are often missorted.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 29th of January I was sent for to the Post-office, and went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210025"/>with the prisoner to his lodgings in Norfolk-street, Strand. I found he occupied a second floor, unfurnished - he said he paid sixty-five guineas a year for it, and that his salary was 200 l. or guineas. He said he had no other income. I met Mr. Parkin there, and found some new and old furniture there, and a considerable quantity of new. I found about 217 l. in bank notes in his drawer, in different parcels, among them was a 10 l. note, No. 1326, February 8,1818 - (looks at it) - this is it. I was told he had taken something out of his drawer unperceived by me; I seized his hand, and took two gold seals out. As I was taking them out, he said,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use, I have done wrong - I am guilty *."</p>
               <p>* This witness was examined at considerable length, and deposed the same as on the prisoner's second trial, Page 225. It is presumed useless to state it here.</p>

I locked him up, and in consequence of information I searched him again at the watch-house, and found a gold brooch, rolled up in the flap of his shirt.

I said I thought it was not his, and asked him how long he had worn it. He said, a long time. He then said,</p>
               <p>"give me the coat, and let me be off." I refused. He took me to a house in Water-lane, where he said he was known. I could hear nothing satisfactory, and gave him in charge.</p>

            . On the 10th of September I lived with Mr. Laing, who keeps the receiving-house in Princes-street. The letters that day were sent to the General Post-office in the usual course.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Does any one assist you in the shop - A. Sometimes, but I am a great deal alone. The paid letters are put in a desk with the money - it is left open; it is fixed in the window - it is open to my master, myself, and another shopman. The paid bag goes away by itself. It appears by a memorandum, which I have in my own writing, that there were fifteen paid letters that day, two of which were 18 d. each. This is kept as a check between my master and the office; the entry is two for 3 s., which is 18 d. each. The double postage to Stonham is 18 d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The postman who comes with the bell has a bag which is locked, and has a slit in it for paid and unpaid letters - A. Yes, he receives them at five o'clock; those that come after go by a messenger. I make the letters up in a bag, and put the paid by themselves - a messenger calls for them, and takes them to the Post-office. I believe I sealed the bag that night, as the book is made up by me. I always seal the bag when I enter the letters.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you make any distinction between letters that contain money and other paid letters - A. If I know it contains money, I advise the person to take it to Lombard-street, but I ask no questions about letters.</p>

            . I am one of the Presidents of the Post-office, Lombard-street. The prisoner was a charger of letters, attached to the Norwich division. It was a general practice in the early part of the evening for him to resort to the sorting table for letters, but not late in the evening - he could not do it then.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he do it when the letters came from the receiving-houses - A. Certainly; Little Stonham is in the Ipswich division, which is immediately attached to his division. Unpaid letters come sooner to hand than paid, as they go through a more tedious process; but paid, unpaid, and franked letters, all go to the sorting table, and through his hands; and it frequently happens that letters are mis-sorted, particularly those of the Ipswich division, are more likely to be mixed with the Norwich than any others. The prisoner was on duty on the night of the 10th of September.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. JARVIS. Q. The clerks sit in a long room - A. Yes; the entrance is at the north. My chair is at the other end. Paid letters are brought by a messenger from the receiving houses, in a bag, which is sealed. The paid bags are taken out and given to Mr. Hanson, he opens them, and checks the letters - if there is any irregularity he must report it. Adams, the messenger, takes them to be stamped, they are then put before three or four persons, who sort them at a table some distance from the prisoner, and then put into their respective boxes, and taken to the different divisions, at one of which the prisoner attended. This letter ought to have been put to the Ipswich division, but mistakes often happen.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner sat in a recess - A. There was a partition between him and the Ipswich division. Unless the letters were mis-sorted, I do not think he could get them from the Ipswich division. The messengers carry them in their arms in rows not tied up, they may occasionally drop. nobody but the clerks have access to the sorting table; I believe the prisoner had been twenty years in the office - his salary was 200 l. a year, and about 10 l. in emoluments.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. How was his salary paid - A. Quarterly, by a check on the Bank. He has had 200 l. a year ever since 1814.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Ipswich letters are more likely to be missorted to the Norwich division than any other - A. Yes, because some of the Suffolk letters go to the Norwich division - it takes one man to arrange the mis-sorted letters out of the blind box.</p>

            . I am solicitor to the Post Office. On the 29th of January I saw the prisoner at the the Post Office about half-past eight o'clock in the morning - Frances and Adkins were present. I stated to him that he was suspected of secreting letters containing remitances, and asked him if he had any objection to his apartments being searched? he said No. Adkins was directed by me to proceed with him there. I and Frances went in a coach and met him at the door in Norfolk-street. We were all in the room together, and commenced an examination of his furniture and other things. Adkins looked into his drawers in the bed-room, and I saw him find six or seven parcels of notes. I asked the prisoner where he had received them from? he gave some answer about the first and second parcel. He said one parcel was his salary; in answer to another he hesitated, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have done wrong - I am guilty." More notes were found about the same time; I desired him to take a chair. I cast up the amount of the notes - it was 217 l., and consisted of 10 l., 5 l., and 1 l. notes. He said one parcel was his salary, that was 23 l. I have ascertained that is true. There was a 10 l. note among that 23 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. by MR. JARVIS. Q. You staid till he had done his duty before you told him of your suspicions - A. Yes, he was searched carefully there - we got to his lodgings a little after nine o'clock. I did not repeat the charge there. Frances and Churchill went to his lodgings with me. It is the second floor - there is a back and front room, besides a small room where his bed is. We partly searched the front room first; the prisoner appeared anxious to go into the bed-room, while Adkins was taking the things out of a cupboard - Adkins called him back - he did not go into the bed-room. I was taking a memorandum of what was found, and looking over receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any receipts for plate - A. No, when they went into the bed-room I accompanied them - the prisoner was present, he stood by the door in the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive any notes had been found, before he made the statement you mentioned - A. I am, I was nearer to the prisoner than Adkins; he said that he received one parcel of notes from a friend.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had notice to produce the plate here - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner on his examination, make any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210029"/>any declaration, or did he deny it - A. He was not asked whether it was true or not.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. On Adkins stating what he said, did the prisoner deny it, or say that Adkins had mistaken him - A. He did not, I am perfectly clear respecting the words he uttered on finding the notes.</p>
               <p>MR. JARVIS. Q. Did he say the words,</p>
               <p>"It is no use" - A. He certainly might have said so; I do not remember the words exactly, but I am perfectly clear about the other words.</p>
               <p>HARRY ADKINS. I am an officer of Bow-street, I was at the Post-office when the prisoner was first accused. Mr. Stow first told him there had been several robberies of letters in his department, containing money; this was repeated by Mr. Parkin, who said, it was necessary he should be inquired of about them; he said he had no objection. He was asked whether he had any objection to be searched? he said No. I searched him minutely. He was then asked if he had any objection to having his lodgings searched? he said No. I was then ordered to accompany him there - we walked. He took me to No. 26, Norfolk-street, Strand - he said nothing in the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from him what his salary was - A. At his lodging Mr. Parkin asked him what it was? I understood him to say 200 l. or guineas. He said he had no other income besides his salary. While I was searching the front room he pretended many times that he wanted something out of the bed-room - he went once or twice into the bedroom; I followed him, and brought him back, and told him that I could not permit him to go there till the other rooms were searched. I found a quantity of glass and furniture in the front room, and a mirror, large chimney-glass, chairs, and sofa. I then searched the middle room, there was a pianoforte, and a large dining-table, which would dine thirty people, and apparently new carpets to fit both rooms; I then searched the bed-room - we all went in together, the prisoner, Mr. Parkin, Francis and myself - neither of them went in before this. I searched two small drawers at the top of a chest, and found a quantity of packs of new cards; the next drawer was opened, which contained linen, table-cloths and sheets - Mr. Parkin assisted me in looking over that. I found six or seven separate parcels of notes in that drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to the prisoner about them - A. Mr. Parkin questioned him about them - the notes were found very near together. After one of the rolls were found, Francis said the prisoner had taken something out of the drawer. I immediately turned round, and said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Jeffcott, what have you got in your hand?" Mr. Parkin and Francis were then in the room. He turned his face towards the door; as I was taking the seals out of his hand he was much agitated, and said in a faint voice,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use, I have done wrong - I am guilty." I am positive these were the words. I continued to search, and found more notes - he appeared more agitated, and Mr. Parkin requested him to take a chair. I found more notes in a pen-case - he appeared more agitated, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh dear!" and turned away. I marked the notes that were found - (looks at the 10 l. note,) - this is one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. JARVIS. Q. How long were you searching the rooms before you went into the bed-room - A. I should think it was an hour and a half, if not two hours. Some bills of parcels were found. The prisoner was within a yard or two of me - he could not move without my observing him. He went into the bed-room once or twice, I went with him. Mr. Parkin was writing at the time at some distance - he could not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many parcels of notes were found before he made the declaration you speak of - 
               <persName id="t18190421-54-person674">A. </persName>
            I cannot tell, but I think one was found.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear you found any of the notes before he made the declaration - A. I think Mr. Parkin pointed out the roll before he made the declaration. I will not swear it, but my belief is, that the first were found. I did not attend to it so particularly as Mr. Parkin was there. It was not necessary to force the seals from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner take out of the drawer - A. Two ladies' gold seals, they were separate. I did not see him take them out. His first words,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use," were very faint indeed, as he was turning at the time - his back was towards Mr. Parkin.</p>
               <p>Q. These words were said at the time the seals were taken - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure of these words - A. I have not the least doubt of it.</p>
               <p>JONIAH FRANCIS. I am a clerk in the Post-office. I accampanied Mr. Parkin on the 29th of January to the prisoner's lodgings. I was in the back room at the time the drawer was searched. I observed the prisoner take something out of the drawer, and communicated it to Mr. Parkin and Adkins, who immediately said,</p>
               <p>"You have something in your hand, give it to me;" upon which the prisoner immediately gave him a paper containing two gold seals. Nothing farther transpired relative to that fact. Prior to that, I believe one parcel of notes was found - a second parcel was found afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing at any time - A. On the discovery of the first parcel Mr. Parkin asked him how he came by it? he said one parcel was his salary; but whether that applied to the first or second parcel I cannot say. The same question was asked about the second - his answer was, that it belonged to a friend, or was given him by a friend, I cannot say which. Upon the discovery of the third parcel, Mr. Parkin stood between me and the prisoner - Adkins was at that time continuing his search at the further end of the drawer. A similar question was put to the prisoner, he faultered, was considerably agitated, and apparently at a loss for an answer. He then, in an under tone of voice said,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use - I am guilty," or</p>
               <p>"I confess I am guilty;" but Mr. Parkin standing between me and him, I cannot say which he said. I took an account of the bank notes that were found. The 23 l. received for his salary was distinct. One of them was a 10 l. note, dated the 8th December, 1818 - the salaries are paid on the 5th of January. Among the other notes, there were twelve of 10 l. each. The 10 l. note, No. 3548, dated 11th August, 1818, was in the third parcel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. JARVIS. Q. You saw him take the seals - A. Yes. I was quite near enough to hear any thing he might say at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. He said nothing at that time - A. If he had I certainly must have heard him. I believe one parcel had been found at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any question been asked relative to the notes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210030"/>at that time - A. Certainly; he was asked how he came by them? and gave ready answers. He made the declaration on the discovery of the third parcel. I believe only one parcel was found when the seals were delivered up, I remember the words,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use;" it was part of the sentence; but whether at the conclusion or beginning I cannot say. I do not remember his saying</p>
               <p>"I have done wrong." It is possible that I might not hear the whole of the sentence, but what I have said I am certain he did say.</p>
               <p>Q. When the notes were found in the pen-case, did he turn round and say,</p>
               <p>"Oh dear!" - A. I remember he was very much agitated, and spoke in a low tone.</p>

               <p>- TAYLOR. I am a clerk in the Bank. On the 11th of January 52 l. 10 s. was paid; Mr. Field posted the notes.</p>
               <p>- FIELD. I am a clerk in the Bank. I posted the notes in payment for the check. The two 10 l. notes - Nos. 18660 and 18661, both dated the 8th December, 1818, and thirty-two 1 l. notes, among which are Nos. 26012 to 26023.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). From what passed at Bow-street, I was prepared to expect Adkins would give the evidence which he has. I do not mean to impute to him an intention of giving false testimony, though I most positively assert that no such words as he swears to ever escaped my lips. I was told I was suspected, and was willing to be searched. I gave all my keys to Mr. Parkin. My apartments were neatly but not expensively furnished. Every thing was pulled about. A small seal was falling, and to prevent its being injured I caught it. Adkins was called; he seized my hand, and asked me what I was concealing. Conscious of my innocence, this quite unmanned me. I left the bed-room, and said," You are to act as you think proper, I am not a guilty man." Those were my words. I had received 23 l. of the money for my salary. With respect to the rest of the evidence, it would apply to any one in the Post-office. The letter would not come into my hands in the regular course. I was employed in the Norwich division only, and it is next to impossible that it should come to me, except by mistake, and then it might pass through the hands of a hundred persons, and there is the greatest similarity between a letter containing an inclosure, and a single one, and five or six thousand pass through the office every evening. I do most confidently hope that you will consider that some time has elapsed between the time the note was stolen, and when it was found in my possession. The seal was a present from a merchant. As to the money, I have had a salary for years of 200 l. - there can be nothing extraordinary in that. The plate was mostly bought with 60 l. given me by the Post-office. The whole of my furniture, including plate, will not realize 200 l. I paid 70 l. for my lodging, for which I was waited upon. Sometime since I was selected to accept the situation of President in the office, which I declined.</p>

             re-examined. I produce the plate. Here is a silver tea-pot, sugar-bason, cream-jug, two soup-ladles, four gravy-spoons, two of them new, a fish-slice, four sauce-ladles, twenty-four tea-spoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, sugar-sifter, ten salt-spoons, one mustard-spoon, and a punch-ladle, all silver; an opera-glass, telescope, and kaleidoscope. Some of the plate has his initials on it.</p>
               <p>MR. PLAUD re-examined. I have seen plate of this description when I have dined there; I believe I gave him the opera-glass myself, eight or ten years ago. I remember seeing some cut glass at his lodgings ever since he was there; he is a single man. He bore a good character.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. What parties have you dined with at his apartments - A. Only three or four persons; I never saw two soup-ladles, or four gravy-spoons, or twenty-four tea-spoons, nor ten salt-spoons. I was there four or five weeks before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether all the articles found at his lodgings on the 29th of January, were there when you was, I suppose you cannot say - A. No, I only came to England in October.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you dined with him in this particular lodging before you went abroad - A. I believe I had.</p>
               <p>MARY M'BETH. I live in Norfolk-street. The prisoner lodged three years and more with me - his furniture was his own.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think it is worth - A. Not 100 l.; he has had it ever since he came there - he had this plate when he came. He was always very careful of it; he kept it in silver paper, and cleaned it himself.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Do you include the chimney-glass in the 100 l. - A. No, that is worth about 10 l.; the mirror is worth about 3 1/2 guineas. I heard that he bought it at a sale very cheap - he has had it a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the habit of having dinner and supper parties - A. I believe about four times since he came to my house, he has had small parties of six or eight to dinner, and his brother might drop in two or three times a month - he did not have supper or tea parties. I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210031"/>known him eight months at a time, and not a soul with him. He did not stay out at night - my man servant told me so. He never had card parties - I never saw any cards in his apartments - my servant waited on him.</p>
               <p>MR. SEVESTER. I am a jeweller, and live in New Bond-street. I have known the prisoner fourteen years; I am not in the habit of visiting him. The value of the plate in my judgment, on a rough sketch, is not worth above 75, or 80 guineas - it all appears to have been used. The tea-pot is a fashion of about ten years standing. The sugar-bason, cream-pot, or punch-ladles, are by no means modern. The second-hand value is about 20 l. less. The prisoner bore an excellent character.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did he buy any of the plate of you - A. None.</p>
               <p>- TIPPEN. I live in Richmond's-buildings, Dean-street, Soho. I know the prisoner. Here are three seals on a ring among his plate. I made one of them for him sixteen years ago.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. What are the others worth - A. About 2 1/2 guineas each - they are modern jewellery. Here are five more seals, nearly new and modern, worth about 10 l., he bought none of me, except the old fashioned one.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner and another in company at Johnston's print-shop, in Cheapside. They attempted several gentlemen's pockets, who were looking in at the window. They then walked to Tegg's, returned to Johnston's, and then to Tegg's again. I then saw the prisoner come out of the mob. I crossed over, and saw the pocket-book in his hand, trying to put it in his left-hand coat-pocket - he could not get it in. He then put it in the right pocket. I collared him, he tried to get it out. I took it from him, and asked who had lost it? Dudman claimed it. I found a very handsome snuffbox on him.</p>

He remained there from Tuesday till Friday, when I gave him in charge for running up a reckoning at my house; he brought about thirty men there, who he represented as a society of shoemakers, who were striking for wages; they run up a score of 4 l. 5 s. - he said the secretary would pay every thing. I went up stairs, and missed these things out of his room.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's foreman. I employed the prisoner to assist in carrying these bottles from the barge to the warehouse - eight men were employed, the prisoner was one. I observed that he missed his turn, which made me suspect him. I saw him return, and asked him why he was absent? he said he went for a shovel. 158 prickles were delivered from the barge, but only 156 brought to the warehouse.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a Common Councilman. About half-past three o'clock in the afternoon I was going home, and saw the prisoner in Chequer-yard with a prickle of bottles. I was landing bottles at the same time, which induced me to watch him, as he was walking fast. I followed him over Dowgate-hill into Elbow-lane, which is considerably out of the way to the prosecutor's warehouse, which is in Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What dress had I on - A. Either a black or dark coat - I have no doubt of his being the man - I knew him well, being in the habit of employing him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I deny being in Chequer-yard. I took the bottles to the warehouse.</p>

The prisoner came to my house at three o'clock one morning about Christmas, I charged him with stealing a water-cock, and forbid his coming any more - this was about the 14th of January. Next morning, about seven o'clock, he brought me some coal under the Piazza, he said it was composition coal, and was like the Kilkenny coal, which would make a nice fire without smoke. He emptied the charcoal out of my box, and put it in there - there was about a man's hatful of it. He went away. I took it home about ten o'clock, and put a piece about the size of an egg on the fire;

             were near the fire at the time, also myself, and my son Thomas. The moment it was put on the fire it exploded, made a great report, and set every thing on fire; it burnt my face, apron, and shawl - it struck the children on the face, hands, and arms. Cormac was taken to the hospital immediately, with Condon. Cormac lived from Thursday until the Saturday, and then died. My daughter lived near six weeks after. I do not know what the ingredients were. The rest of it burnt in the basket. A spark caught the basket, which was near the fire, and all blew up.</p>

               <p>- BURGESS. I am surgeon of St. Giles's workhouse, where the deceased, Condon, was. I saw her every day. She was burnt shockingly - nearly her whole body was burnt; she died in the workhouse on the 24th of February, which was six or seven weeks after the accident. She was in great pain all the time, and in my judgment the burning was the cause of her death. It produced so much debility and weakness that she was exhausted.</p>

            , we live in Northumberland-street, Strand. On the 9th of February, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was alone in the counting-house, the prisoner came in and asked if I would send a chaldron of coals for his master, Mr. Williams, who had taken lodgings at Mr. Jackson's, No. 7, Newman-street, Oxford-street. I asked him if we had ever sent any there before? He said No; but his master had ordered him to go down to the waterside, and it made no difference where he went to. I said I could send them, and asked him if I should write a receipt for them? he said Yes - he was going to pay for them if I could give him change for a 20 l. note, and if I could not he must go to the Bank for it. He then pulled out a 20 l. note; I looked at it, and then wrote him a receipt, first asking him how far the men were to carry the coals, in order to charge for the shooting; he said they were to be shot through a hole in the street. They came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210034"/>to 2 l. 17 s. 6 d. I gave him a receipt (looks at a 20 l. note). This is the note he gave me, it has</p>
               <p>"Williams, 9 - 2 - 19" on it, which I wrote about two hours after, but I kept it separate in my pocket. I desired him to follow me up to my dwelling-house, as I had no change - he did so, and stood in the passage while I went up stairs for it; I came down, gave him the change, and asked him if it was right - he said it was; I opened the door, and he went out, requesting I would be sure to let them be of the best quality.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed - A. With a large frock coat, straight front, with yellow buttons, corderoy breeches, and top boots, as if he was a groom. We sent the coals by Gower - they came back again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. When did you see him afterwards - A. About three weeks, or a month. I took the name in my book at the time. I wrote on the note in two hours after; I discovered it was forged in two hours after. I remember the man well, and have no doubt of his being the same.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When were the coals returned - A. About half an hour after I discovered the note to be forged.</p>

            . I am a coal-merchant, at Cannon Wharf, Parliament-street. On the 9th of February, early in the morning, the prisoner came to my counting-house, dressed in a brown coat, with large gilt buttons, striped waistcoat, corderoy breeches, and top boots - I have no doubt of the prisoner being the person. He said he came to order a chaldron of coals for Mr. Williams, at Mr. Jackson's, No. 7, Newman-street, Oxford-street. I asked him if Mr. Williams had had coals of us before? he said his master was only just come to town, and had taken lodgings at Mr. Jackson's. I asked him who sent him to my wharf? he said he was directed to the water-side, and knowing my wharf by coming by at times, he came there. I made some objections to sending coals to a total stranger, which he endeavoured to remove, and said, if I would write him a receipt, he would pay me. As I was taking out a stamp, he said,</p>
               <p>"You of course can give me change for a 20 l. note," which I objected to, and said I would send the change with the coals. He said it was not material, as his master had ordered him to go to the Bank if I could not give him change. I intended to send the coals in the course of the day, but did not, in consequence of what I heard from Mr. Wood. The prisoner came to my wharf soon after eight o'clock. It is five or ten minutes walk from Northumberland-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear he is the man - A. I have no doubt of it, but I will not take upon myself to swear to him. I had a very transitory view of his person, but my attention was called to the circumstance the same morning.</p>

            . I am a coal-meter. On the 9th of February I saw the prisoner come down Bent's yard a little after eight o'clock in the morning. I was standing in the yard with Parsons, and took particular notice of him. He was dressed in a brown frock coat, yellow buttons, light corded breeches, and top boots. He inquired of us if it was a coal-wharf? I said it was, and showed him the counting-house - I saw him go in and come out again in five or six minutes, and asked him if he had seen anybody there? he said he had. The same evening, or next morning, I heard something from Mr. Wood, which called the circumstance to my mind. I am certain of his person. I did not see him again till about the middle of March, at Marlborough-street, and knew him again immediately. We both took particular notice of him, and spoke to each other about him.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Thompson and Monkhouse, coal-merchants, Blackfriars. On the 21st of January, about five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the wharf, went into the counting-house, and asked if we could send him a chaldron of coals the following morning? I said we could, and asked him who they were for? he said they were for his master, Mr. Smith, at Mr. Leighton's, No. 17, Albemarle-street, Piccadilly. I told him he must have made a mistake, for we did not serve them. He said he had not made a mistake, for he meant to pay for them. I asked him if I was to make a bill and receipt? he said Yes. I was alone; he gave me a 20 l. note - I said I could not give him change, but if he would step with me to Mr. Monkhouse's dwelling-house, very likely he might give change. Just as we were going, Mr. Monkhouse came into the counting-house, it was candle-light. I told him what had passed. He asked my opinion of the note? I had looked at it, and told him I thought it was a good one - it was quite new. Mr. Monkhouse turned to the prisoner, and said he hoped he was not giving him a bad note. He said his master gave him the 20 l. note to buy a chaldron of coals and other things that morning, and gave him no particular orders where to go; that his master was a single gentleman, and lived at No. 1, Albany, Piccadilly; that his mother was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210035"/>coming to town the following morning, and that he had taken apartments for her at Mr. Leighton's, No. 16, Albemarle-street, where the coals were to be sent to. Mr. Monkhouse wrote Mr. Smith and the residence on the note before he gave him the change - (looks at one) - this is it. He was dressed in a straight brown coat, gilt buttons, top boots, and I think a striped waistcoat, and had a stick in his hand - he appeared to be a groom. I sent Hart with the coals the next morning - they came back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He was about ten minutes with me. I have no doubt of his person.</p>

            , Earl-street, Blackfriars. I believe the prisoner to be the man who came on the 21st of January. I met him coming out of the door with my clerk to get change. I went in with them - the prisoner stood at my elbow; my clerk had the bill and receipt in his hand. The prisoner handed me the note, I examined it by the candle, and handed it in to my clerk for his opinion - he said he had no reason to doubt it. I told the prisoner forged notes were frequent, and I hoped he was not giving me a bad one. He said it was given him by his master for him to buy coals and other things, in the City. I asked him why he came to me? he said he came promiscuously, that his master's name was Mr. Smith, No. 1, Albany, and the coals were for his master's mother, who was coming to town next morning, and he had taken her lodgings at No. 16, Albemarle-street, where the coals where ordered. I wrote the address and name on the note in his presence (looks at one), this is it. I gave him 17 l. 2 s. 6 d. deducting 2 l. 17 s. 6 d. He was dressed in a brown groom's coat, buttoned close up - I did not notice the rest of his dress. I sent the coals next morning, they came back. Nobody called for the 2 l. 17 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You will not swear positive to him - A. I will not, but I have no doubt of him.</p>

The guard directed my attention to a basket, directed to Mrs. Ward, No. 41, Compton-street, St. John-street, Clerkenwell - it was fastened with strings. In consequence of what Mayo said to me, I was induced to undo one corner of it. I got one hand in, and felt something like a fowl with feathers on - on putting my hand a little further, I felt a paper parcel; I then undid it a little more, pulled the parcel out, and opened it - it was folded up. It contained bank notes. One bundle contained five notes not tied up; what the other contained I do not know - this was at the

Mr. Ibberson, another gentleman, and myself, then went to the Bank, and left the basket locked up in Mr. Ibbertson's private office.

Iles took it, I followed, and saw him stop rather short of the house, and deliver it to a person. As he was leaving the door I went up, and saw the female prisoner in the passage with the basket under her arm - Milton followed me into the passage. I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got there, Mrs. Taverner?" she made no answer, but went into the parlour, and threw the basket on the floor - the male prisoner was there. I asked her what it contained? she said she did not know. I asked her where it came from, and who it belonged to? she said she did not know. I asked her what she paid for it? she said 2 s. 3 d. she believed. I said,</p>
               <p>"You would not have paid for it unless you knew who it belonged to, I should think." She said an acquaintance of her's called on her about a fortnight before, to request she might have a parcel directed there for her, and her name was Ward. I asked her where she was to be found, and where she lived? she said she did not know. I asked her when the person was to call for it? she said she did not know - perhaps tomorrow. I cut it open, and showed them the contents -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210037"/>they denied all knowledge of it; the male prisoner was sitting at the table. The basket contained 496 1 l. and 19 5 l. notes - (examines them) - these are them; I marked them all before I parted with them. When I was up stairs, I asked the woman if she had any lodgers? she said she had a young woman and her father, of the name of Card. I asked her if she had any lodger of the name of Ward? she said she had not, nor never had. I said it was very strange she could give no account of Mrs. Ward - she said she never saw her in her life. Mr. Milton said,</p>
               <p>"How is that? why you said she was an acquaintance, and called on you a fortnight ago." She said,</p>
               <p>"I never saw her in my life." He said,</p>
               <p>"How did she procure leave to have the parcel directed here?" she said she received a letter from her about a week ago, asking permission, but she had destroyed the letter.</p>

I saw a paper parcel in his hand, he appeared to throw it on the ground, but whether he threw it into the bar or not, I cannot say; it was done while I turned my head to call Read - I saw it lying in the passage, and seeing him going to the back of the premises, I laid hold of him; he immediately threw a small parcel down the privy, which was at the end of the passage. I brought him back, picked up the parcel in the passage, and delivered it to Read. I waited at the privy till Edmonds came, I let him down, and he brought up a parcel which I opened, it contained five 1 l. notes. The parcel found in the passage contained four parcels, each containing twenty 1 l. notes, and ten 1 l. notes in another; and a small bag, containing twelve 2 l., ten 5 l., and six 1 l. notes, all of which I marked (looks at them) - these are them. Those found in the privy have names written upon them, and were folded up separately; the rest are new.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 17th of March I was at home; I was the last person that went to bed - the house was made fast. About half-past five o'clock on Thursday morning I was awoke by the servant telling me some persons were ringing the street-door bell; I desired her to put her head out of window to see what it was. She then told me the watchman said there were thieves in the house. I dressed myself, went down stairs with her, and took the keys of the warehouse in my hand. I found a bag of tea in the passage, another in the warehouse, and an empty bag in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they get access to the warehouse - A. A hole was made in the cellar, which was not there a week before - the wine-cellar, warehouse, and counting-house doors were forced open, also the counting-house desk. The street-door had been opened wide - it was not forced; the bars were taken down. My husband keeps the house, it is in the parish of Allhallows - the warehouse is part of the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was not dark at half-past five o'clock - A. We struck a light, but it was light enough to see a man's countenance - I did not see the house closed the night before.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 17th of March, I was on duty, and examined Mr. Wilkinson's door - I found it completely fast. In the morning, about five o'clock, I was going my rounds again - I tried the prosecutor's door again, and found it on the latch. I pushed it open, and found three men inside the door - the prisoner was one. I endeavoured to hold the door to until I could get assistance - two men rushed out upon me, but I collared the prisoner inside the door, and never quitted him till I got him to the watch-house - he is the man. The name of the parish is Allhallows, London-wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was just getting light. I can swear to one of the others if I saw him again.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 18th of March, between five and six o'clock in the morning, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house - I was there. Harrington and I went immeditately to search the house, leaving the prisoner at the watch-house. We met Mrs. Wilkinson coming out of the cellar; we went into the cellar, and found a hole in the wall, between the prosecutor's house and the next, which is uninhabited; it is a very thick wall, and would certainly take some time to break through it - it must have taken half or three parts of the night. We went into the warehouse, and found the tea scattered about, and some in bags; we weighed them separately, tied them up, and sealed them. One bag weighed 38 lbs. and the other 42 lbs. - we searched all over the house but found nothing. I ascended the wall of the adjoining empty house with a little assistance, and got in at the first-floor back window; I went down into the cellar, and saw the bricks where they had broken through the wall into the prosecutor's house - the empty house is at the corner of Union-court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q, Was the next house under repair, or untenanted - A. Untenanted; it might have been broken in the day for what I know. It is a party-wall, and very thick - the hole was large enough for the prisoner to get through; I found no bolts there.</p>

I returned to the watch-house with them, and after leaving him in custody I and Croker went to the prosecutor's house, and met Mrs. Wilkinson coming out of the cellar. We found a breach made in the wall that divided the house from the empty house - it was a brick wall about eighteen inches thick; it was more than one brick thick.

            . I am a watchman of Bishopsgate Ward. I heard a call for assistance, and found the prisoner in custody of two watchmen - they had been struggling. Gadbury sent me into the prosecutor's house; a bag of tea stood by the door, and a hat laid by the side of it. There was an empty bag there, and another bag full, not tied up. Three or four chests of tea appeared to be broken open.</p>

He gave the name of Brown, No. 22, Willan-place, which she wrote on it in my presence - I do not remember his saying who he had it from - he went away.</p>

            , who is a corn-chandler, and lives at No. 87, Old-street. In the beginning of February, about the middle of the day, the prisoner came to our shop, and asked for half a bushel of split beans. He said he came from Mrs. Crampton - we have a customer of that name; the beans came to 3 s. - I served him. He paid me a 1 l. note; I gave him the change, and he went away. I put the note in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether there was any other note there at the time - A. Not to the best of my knowledge. I unlocked the till and put it in - I saw no other there. I locked it again, and hung the key up, behind the counter. My father came home in about half an hour - my mother serves in the shop. I had been out of the shop, leaving her there - nobody but us was in the shop until my father came home. I then told him what had happened, saw him open the till, and take out the note, and write Mrs. Crampton on it - (looks at it) - this is it. It has Mrs. Crampton on it in his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time the prisoner paid you the note till your father opened the till, had you put any other note there - A. No, no other customer had been while I was there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say where Mrs. Crampton lived - A. No, I supposed it to be our customer, as we had one of that name.</p>

            . I am watchman to the prosecutors, who live in the Adelphi. On the 13th of March, between seven and nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at the wharf - he came twice a week for the dung. I saw him bring a barrow of dung out of the stable, and under the dung was a sack of chaff, beans and corn; he went on the opposite side of the cart to me, shot it in, and covered it with dung - he then brought part of a truss of hay out, and put it on the fore part of the cart. As he was going away I told him I saw him take something, which he denied - he said he had taken the hay. I told him the sack was in the cart, and if he did not get it down I would have the cart unloaded. He said if that was the case he would get it down, which he did. I took him to the prosecutors. He said it was his first offence.</p>

Groves beckoned to his own boy, the boy beckoned to him, and then went into Thoms's stable with Groves; they could not get the sack untied, Groves said</p>
               <p>"why don't you make haste" - they cut the string, and emptied the sack into a large thing which was there; they then came out, and went away. Soon after Groves brought another sack, and put it into a dark place there; he then laid hold of one end and Thoms took the other, and both carried it into Thoms's stable. Groves told Thoms he must have the empty sack, Thoms said you shall have it bye-and-bye. Groves said,</p>
               <p>"if I can get the sack back, I can get another skin." He went into the stable. I saw Thoms carry a truss of meadow hay into his stable, but who he had it from I do not know. He pulled a piece out, and gave it to his horse - he then locked the stable door, and went away.</p>

On the 27th of February the watchman told me of the robbery; next morning we went to Thoms's stable, and saw a quantity of chaff, corn and beans, mixed - about seven bushels altogether, and about two trusses of meadow hay, it was remarkable old hay, and very full of flower, like mine.

            . I am the prosecutors' watchman. On the 27th of February Inson gave me information - I told the prosecutors next day, and assisted in searching Thoms's stable. I told him he was my prisoner, he asked for what? I told him he was concerned in stealing some hay, clover, and other things from the prosecutors' stable. I was going to touch a truss of hay on my right hand, Thoms said,</p>
               <p>"if that truss on my left hand belongs to Thompson, the other does not." I took eight bushels of chaff, beans, and oats - part of them were in a tub, and the rest in a box. I compared them with the prosecutors' - they appear the same.</p>

            . I live at No. 21, Old-buildings, Lincoln's Inn, on the same landing-place with Mr. Quin. On Sunday, the 11th of April, I had been in my chambers the greatest part of the day. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a noise at my door, or on the landing-place, like some one forcing or wrenching my outer door, which was shut; I thought it was some person coming in to see if anybody was there. In a few minutes I went to the door, looked through the letter-hole, and saw the prisoner at the door, dressed in a brown coat and nankeen pantaloons - he was within three feet of the door, and had a stick in his hand - I opened the door; he had then got about the third step going down - the door is close to the steps. I asked him what he wanted? he said he wanted Mr. Jordan (there is a gentleman of that name). I said,</p>
               <p>"What! who?" he then said Mr. Gardiner.</p>
               <p>"I said,</p>
               <p>"What, on a Sunday!" he made no further answer. As soon as he went down, I shut the door, and looked through a little window which commands a view of the court, and saw him go through the passage by the Hall. I examined my door, and observed marks of an instrument on it, as if it had been attempted to be broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this did you hear somebody on the stair-case again? In about a quarter of an hour I heard somebody on the staircase, which turned out to be Mr. Quin's laundress. I went out to her, and found Mr. Quin's door broken, and very much damaged. I asked her if any one had attempted the chambers? At that moment she heard a noise in the chambers, and cried out that she heard them, and they were getting out on the leads - she had opened Mr. Quin's outer door, and was going up to his inner door. She came down, and went for her husband; I remained on the staircase - nobody passed me down stairs before she returned, which was in about five minutes; I then went into the chambers, and found a stick at the side of the bottom door. Every thing was pulled out on the the floor in great confusion. It is a similar stick to that I saw the prisoner with. I am certain he is the man I saw at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I am not a lawyer. The noise ceased the moment I opened my inner door. My chambers are quite separate from Mr. Quin's.</p>

            . I am laundress to Mr. Quin, whose chambers are at No. 21, Old-square, Lincoln's Inn - they are the upper chambers, and have two doors. After opening the outer doors; there is a flight of stairs to go up to the inner door. Mr. Quin went out about eleven o'clock in the morning, I remained at the chambers till one, and then left. Everything was safe and in order - I locked them up, and locked the inner door. I returned a little after five o'clock, and saw Mr. Milbourne. I put the key into Mr. Quin's outer door, but found it already unlocked; the lock was not taken off, but the door was open. I found a stick inside the door, it did not belong to Mr. Quin, and was not there when I left at one o'clock. I went up the stairs, found the inner door ajar, all the drawers open, and the things laying on the floor. There were shirts, and sheets off the bed, a great-coat, and also a pair of clean sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing in the chambers - A. The moment I spoke to Mr. Milbourne, I heard footsteps up stairs in the chambers - I ran down directly to fetch my husband. The catch of the latch of the inner door was forced off. There is a window opens from the chambers on to the leads - I do not know whether I left it shut, but there was an iron bar over it; when I got there the window was open, and the iron bar taken down. Anybody could get out, and get on the leads of Lincoln's Inn. Mr. Quin sleeps in the chambers.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at No. 48, Southampton-buildings. On Sunday, the 11th of April, I met Mrs. Gough making an alarm in Chancery-lane. I immediately crossed into Lincoln's Inn, and looking up to the top of the chambers, I saw the prisoner on the cock-loft of No. 21 or 22, dressed in a dark snuff-coloured coat and nankeen trowsers. I watched him until he got over No. 24, then lost sight of him. I saw him soon afterwards in custody - he is the man.</p>

The window which leads to the leads was open, the bar taken down, and the padlock which fastened it, was forced off. I got out, and passing over the roofs of No. 22 and 23, I saw the prisoner behind the chimney of No. 24. I made up to the chimney - there is a round tower there; he was not there - he was gone. I went straight on as far as the Baptist chambers, kept there and sent for assistance, as I knew he must pass me - Oakes and Ackhurst came. I sent them down Chancery-lane into the Baptist chambers, and found the prisoner concealed in the cock-loft; I saw him coming down the steps of the cock-loft - he is the man that I saw.</p>

            . I am badge-porter of Lincoln's Inn. In consequence of this alarm I went to the Baptist chambers, got out upon the roof, which communicates with No. 24, and went to the cock-loft; the outer door in the gutter I found open, with the nails of the bolt drawn, and the iron bent, as if it had been forced open - this would be necessary for any person to have got in. I called to Ackhurst for a light, which came; I opened the trap-door, and found the prisoner in the loft, at the further end, drawing himself up as close as he could to the tiles. We asked him to come out? he said,</p>
               <p>"Don't make any alarm, and I will go with you quietly enough" - nobody else was on the roof.</p>

A crow-bar was given to me next morning, which I tried to Mr. Quin's door, and it corresponded exactly with the marks, as if it had been used to the door; it also corresponded with the marks on Mr. Milbourne's, and Mr. Jordan's doors, which were on the same stair-case. The stick was given to me, which was found on the stair-case.</p>

I found several persons in my chambers, all in confusion; the drawers and several presses broken open, and several articles removed from my presses to the floor. I found a pair of clean sheets behind the door, and the dirty ones, and my great coat on the floor, which I hung up behind the door. I missed six plated spoons - my coat and the sheets are worth 2 l.</p>

On the 17th of March, the prisoner was recommended to me to assist in cleaning harness - I was with him about two hours, and then left the mews. He asked me to give him a few halfpence to get some victuals, I gave him 2 s. 6 d. I returned in about an hour, he was gone - I missed two reins and four bridle-bits, and found him in David-street. He said if I would say nothing he would get them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence - (written.) - I fully acknowledge my fault, and humbly implore the mercy of the Court. I lost my mother three years ago - my father is since dead. It is with the greatest pain and reluctance I am obliged to stir up the ashes of my deceased parents, and expose their vices; but when I know I can only attribute my present perilous situation to the profligate examples set me in my infancy, I cannot forbear calling their faults in question, as some excuse for my early depravity, which, under any other circumstance, I should blush to mention. My father for several years kept a Little Go, where I had the opportunity of witnessing the worst of vices and characters. At my poor mother's decease, my father introduced a prostitute to his home, who lived in the house until his death. He was in prison for the lottery several times, and suffered great distress during his imprisonment, which excited my affection and pity, and induced me to pilfer my master to supply his wants. This offence was continued at intervals through the bad company my father encouraged me to keep, which has at length brought me to this melancholy situation. This is the naked truth and history of my unfortunate life, and I humbly hope for mercy.</p>

            , JUN. When I stopped the prisoner, he had these pease in a sack on his back. He said he bought them of Messrs. Field and Child, his masters. I sent for Mr. Child. Before he came the prisoner told me he did not buy them, but a person had, and he was going to leave them near Whitechapel church till called for. I found twenty-two other bags at his house, which the prosecutors claimed.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutors. The prisoner came to the shop, and asked for some narrow satin ribbon - I showed her a drawer, she bought three separate quarters of yards, which came in all to 2 d. While I was cutting it off, I saw her take a piece out of the drawer and put it into her pocket. As soon as she got to the door I told Mr. Ellis - she was brought back immediately, and I saw the ribbon fall from her.</p>

            . I live next door to Mr. Cole. About a quarter before eight o'clock on Saturday evening, as I stood at my door, I observed three men huddled close together at Cole's window - I watched them, and could see distinctly what they were doing, as I was above them. There were lamps in the window, and I have a gas-light over my door. The prisoner was the middle man. I observed him busy at the second pane of glass, he was hooking something out with a piece of brass wire. I went up and collared him, the other two immediately ran away. He struck me, and made my lip bleed. At the time I took him, he was in the act of hooking the things out with the wire.</p>

On the 22d of March, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, the prisoners passed me, between Merton and Green-bridge, going towards town, with a sack, which appeared heavy - they were looking about. I watched them for an hour and a half, and went and told Hawkins - we stopped them, and asked what they had got? they said it was corn for their horses. Russell had a sack with corn and pease. King had the seventeen dead fowls in his sack - they were quite warm.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Amer Curtis. I went up to the prisoners, and asked them what they had got? Russell had two sacks with pease - King had the seventeen fowls in his sack, and they both said it was corn, and tried to hinder us from looking into them. King was going to defend himself, and said a bargeman had given him the fowls to put into a boat - we secured them. It was about five miles from the prosecutor's.</p>

            . I live on Blackheath-hill. The prisoner offered to sell me the gelding for 2 l. 10 s. - he said he lived in the Kent-road, and had lived there fourteen or fifteen months. I suspected him and got Crouch; the prisoner ran away - a man secured him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man asked me to take the horse to Mr. Brannion, who keeps a potatoe-warehouse at Deptford - he wrote down the direction on a paper. When I took it there they had just bought one. I went to the Rising Sun, public-house, the boy asked me if it was for sale? I told him it was, and he brought Lewis to me to buy it.

I turned round, and found the two prisoners close to me; suspecting them, I put my hand to my pocket, and missed my handkerchief. I took hold of Thompson, and between the two I saw the handkerchief drop - they were close together - Thompson got away. I called to him to stop, but he still ran. I secured him.</p>

Mr. Clark seized Thompson, and the handkerchief dropped from one of them. Abbott ran off into Bream's-buildings; I pursued, and brought him back. Thompson also escaped into Carey-street, but was brought back.</p>

I returned about nine o'clock, the prisoner was then gone - I did not know she was going. I missed the property stated in the indictment out of my bed-room drawers, and a box of trinkets out of a tea-caddy, which was in my wardrobe - I had seen it all safe two days before; the prisoner never returned. Next morning I gave information at Bow-street, went with the officer, and found her on the Saturday at Ashby de la Zouch, in Leicestershire. I asked her where the 20 l. note was? she said it was all in her bundle. The officer searched her, found the watch in her bosom, and all the property stated in the indictment either in the bundle or about her person.</p>

I returned about ten o'clock, found my box broken open, and missed these things. My door was still locked, but there had been a hole in the wainscot for some time - it was large enough to admit a man. Six days after I went with the officer, and apprehended the prisoner at the Black Dog, public-house, Drury-lane - he had my trowsers on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not see me before you apprehended me - A. Yes, I saw him the same evening at Bow-street. He said he wished to give himself up, or he should make away with himself. I applied to a man to take him - he said as it was a family affair we had better make it up.</p>

On the 16th of March he asked leave to go out; when he went I saw he had every thing new on, which made me suspect him; he came home at night, and said he had been robbed of four 1 l. notes. I asked him how he came by that money? he said he had received 5 l. from his friends. I asked him to produce the letter it came in; he hesitated and said he would not, and then said it came in a basket. A day or two after I had his box searched. He asked why I did so. I took him into the next room, and asked him to account for the money that he bought the clothes with - he could not within 15 l. or 20 l. He afterwards said he found the notes sticking to the heel of his boot at the top of the stairs, paid the 20 l. note to Nowland for making his boots, and got the change; and that he paid the 10 l. note to Harrison for clothes. I do not know what parish the place is in.</p>

On the 3d of March, she came to me, and produced a letter, purporting to come from her uncle, inviting her to come to Manchester to live with him, and he would support her. I observed that it had no postmark on it - she said her cousin brought it. Next day I gave her two petticoats, a pair of shoes and stockings, and a shawl - she said she should want 20 s. to pay her expences on the road; I told her I must see her cousin. She brought a countryman, and introduced him to me as her cousin - I then gave her 1 l. She came to me again on the 20th in a most wretched state.

            . I am a constable. On the 17th of April, at two o'clock, in consequence of information I received, I and Forbes went to No. 3, Nag's Head-court, Golden-lane, and saw the landlady; I asked for Mr. and Mrs. Dart, she said they were up stairs in the first-floor front room, and immediately called, out</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Dart!" I ran up stairs, and took hold of the door, which was just opened. I went in and found the prisoners and two other men there. I told Dart that I had information that he was dealing in and selling forged bank notes, and was come to search the house - he made me no answer; none of them said any thing. I began to search about the room - Forbes watched the door. While I was looking in the cupboard, one of the men got up to go. I searched the two men, but found nothing on them, and they went away. I observed a little wooden box under the bed, and asked Dart whose box it was? he said he did not know, it was left there by a person. I asked him the person's name, and if he could give me any account of him? they both said they knew nothing about him, he was a stranger to them. I asked Dart for the key, he said he had not got it, and knew nothing about it. I asked him several times for it, he said he had not got it. I said,</p>
               <p>"Then I will break it open," and laid hold of the poker to do so. He was sitting on a chair, he then moved himself, and sat on the window-frame, sitting half out of the window. He pushed the window up a little higher - his head, and part of his body were then out. I desired Forbes to lay hold of him. I forced the box-lid open, and there found twenty-two forged bank notes, all loose about the box - I marked them. I also found a pocket-book in the box, and a few old rags and stockings. In the pocket-book were found three bank notes, apparently unfinished, and some sparring tickets for the benefit of young Crawley. The moment he saw them, he said,</p>
               <p>"They are my property!" and two affidavits of pawnbrokers' duplicates. These are the notes I first found - (looking at them) - and these are the three notes which I found in the pocket-book - they have no date line. One of the affidavits is signed Dart, and the other has the mark of M. A. Dart. I took the prisoners, box and all, to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards return - A. Yes. The landlady gave me a key, which she said she found. Next day she delivered me another key - they both of them fitted the lock of the box.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Nag's Head-court Golden-lane - the two prisoners lodged there eight days - the male prisoner took the lodging, it was furnished. I was in the room making the bed, at the time they brought their things in - the woman and a little boy came first; the boy brought the box on his head. I think it is the one produced - it is the same size, colour, and appearance - to the best of my judgment it is the same - I saw no other box but that; they lived together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the officers coming on the 17th - A. Yes; they went up stairs, and took the prisoners away about two o'clock. After they were gone, about three o'clock, I had occasion to go to the dust-hole, which is immediately under the window of the prisoner's room, and found a key laying lightly on the top of the dust - it might easily have been dropped from his window. Mrs. Jeffrey, who lodged in the opposite room to the prisoners, was in their room with me. I saw her pick up a key from under the ashes of the grate. I gave them both to Thompson.</p>

I went to bed about twelve o'clock at night, having upwards of 200 l. in bank notes in my pocket, among which was this 100 l. note. The servant came in, and took away the candle, I saw her go out. My notes were in an inside coat-pocket, which I put on a chair by the bedside - they were in a pocket-book. I got up about eight o'clock, and in about half an hour I found I had lost my money. I immediately made it known at the inn. I have since seen the 100 l. note which I lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time did you receive it - A. About four o'clock. I did not pay it away, and I am certain that my pocket-book was in my pocket when I went to bed, as I particularly noticed it - the girl shut the door.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Burge, who is an optician, and lives in Piccadilly. On the 1st of January the prisoner came to the shop, and purchased a sextant, which came to sixteen guineas. I told him it was necessary to adjust it before he took it away, which I said would take about an hour. He gave me a 100 l. note, and I gave him the change, which I got from Mr. Burge - there was a 40 l. note among the change. I directly gave Mr. Burge the 100 l. note that the prisoner gave me. I asked his name and address, he said it was Capt. Wishead, Hatchett's hotel. He left the sextant, called in about three hours after in a hackney-coach for it, and took it away. I told him I wished to keep it a little longer. He said he was going off immediately, and could not wait. It was perfect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have no doubt whatever of his being the man.</p>

My son was in the cart with me, asleep.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210053"/>It was a very bright moonlight night. As I was going along the road the prisoner and another man were coming along facing me, as if about to pass me, they were on the near side of me; I had seen them about twenty or thirty yards before they came up. I had full time to see them. When they came up the prisoner stopped right before me, about three-quarters of a yard off, he up with his arms, and shot me directly. I had full time to observe his countenance, had a full sight of his face, and could pick him out from among a hundred. I was wounded in my right eye. I called directly to my son, and said</p>
               <p>"Jack, get up, I am shot." They then ran away, and I saw no more of them. I am certain the prisoner is the man - I will swear to him, and nobody else. I cannot swear to the other man, I had not a sight of him. I did not see what was in the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago was it since you saw the prisoner again - A. About Christmas time I went to Hertford goal, and saw the prisoner there; Mr. Wilson, the goaler, said to the prisoners,</p>
               <p>"All of you come out." Twenty or thirty men came out, and I picked the prisoner out immediately. I became blind for sometime after I was shot. The man was half a yard or three-quarters of a yard from me - he put both his hands out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you attend Watford-market - A. Yes; I never saw him there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you look after the prisoner - A. I was blind, but I looked after him as soon as I got my sight.</p>

I attended him for a month, and in the course of that time I extracted several small pebbles, which I gave him - (looks at some) - these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a man to become suddenly blind from an accident, would the last object he saw make a deep impression upon him - A.

            . I am keeper of Hertford goal. I remember the prosecutor coming down to me just after Christmas, about two months before the Assizes - the prisoner was in custody at the time. He asked if I had not a man there charged with shooting another man? I told him I had - he wished to see the man. I told him I could not point him out, but I would call all the men out of the same yard, and if he saw him he might point him out. I should think between twenty and thirty men came out of the room, the prosecutor immediately pointed the prisoner out as being the man who shot him. The prisoner was committed to me from Watford, on the 31st of August - nobody pointed him out to the prosecutor; he had not the slightest intimation from anybody of his being the man.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the same thing - A. I do not know; but on the 24th of July he was at home with me, very ill in bed.</p>

               <p>Q. What makes you remember the day - A. Because I had a letter from his wife to go down to Godalmin, on the 22d.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear of his being charged with shooting Vine - A. In August - in July I heard it. On the 24th of July I heard that very thing. I heard his sister say so.</p>

            . I am patrol of St. John, Hackney. On the 12th of February, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me in Grove-street, Hackney, and asked me what o'clock it was? I told him; he had a cow with him. He asked the nearest way to Kingsland? I told him, and walked with him to Hackney; he said he should know his way then. I asked him where he brought the cow from? he said, from one</p>

I knew Mr. Bellows kept a good many cows about fourteen years ago, but not then. I observed that the cow was tied down with a small string instead of a halter, and that she was dry. As we were going along, I asked him where the calf was? he said it had been gone six or seven weeks - we had then got near the watch-house; I collared him, and took him in. I found that the cow was very heavy in calf - about seven months gone. Rainham is above twelve miles from where I met him. I sent to Bellows, and in consequence of what he said, I detained the prisoner.</p>

The prisoner is the man who pledged it on the 13th of April - my master, Mr. Ramsay, took the others in. On the Thursday following a man came to redeem one of the articles. I gave him in charge - it was not the prisoner.</p>

I walked to the corner of Dean-street, she followed me; we went into a public-house, and had a pint of beer, in a short time I fell asleep in the tap-room, as I had been walking from the country, and was tired; the landlord awoke me, and asked me if I had lost any thing? when I missed my watch from my fob, and my money from my pocket - he produced my watch, and I claimed it - I was quite sober.</p>

About half-past eleven o'clock at night Cook brought the prisoner to the watch-house, she said the man was her husband; I said I would go and see if he was or not. I went to the Black Horse, public-house, and found the prosecutor coming out - he went to the watch-house and claimed the watch - he said she was not his wife. I found 1 s. 6 d. on her. I found a bag lying in the sand-box, where she sat; Phipps said it was the purse his money was in. I put her in with another woman, she sent out half a crown to buy bread and cheese. I fetched her out, searched her again, and found half a crown and some halfpence upon her.</p>

I told her she had better give up the watch and property, or I would call the watchman. I called him, and told her to leave the watch with me till the morning - she gave me the watch, but not the money, as she said it was her own.

             was Ruffle's servant, I never saw the prisoner with the waggon. Appleford's meat produced 21 l. 2 s. and the other 5 l. About eleven o'clock in the morning, after market hours, the prisoner came, and said he had called for Ruffle's money. I asked whose money? he said, Mrs. Peacock's and Mr. Appleford's. Seeing him a stranger, I asked him where his fellow-servant was? He said, poor fellow, he has met with a very bad accident, for on Sunday one of the ropes of the waggon broke, which made the horse go on, and one of the wheels passed over his body; and on his return home, no doubt, he should find him dead. I then paid him two 5 l. and sixteen 1 l. notes, and 2 s. 2 d. He said he had lived upwards of four years with Ruffle. I asked him if he knew Collins, who had just left Ruffle? he said, Yes; and Mr. Ruffle was extremely sorry that he had left. About a fortnight after I saw him in custody.</p>

            . I am waggoner to Mr. Ruffle. On the 12th of October I left Coggleshall at six o'clock, with this meat in my waggon; I fell in with the prisoner at Boreham, he walked as far as Chelmsford with me, then went with a cart, and joined me again near Brentwood. I supped there, and then went on to town. He went into the cart, joined me again at Romford, and came to town with me, on a horse which I had behind my waggon. I had told him the meat was going to Cross; he assisted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210056"/>me in taking it out, and heard me tell the porters to take it there. He never paid me the money for the meat, nor did I authorize him to go for it. I met with no accident on Sunday. I afterwards applied to Cross for the money, and found the prisoner had received it. They described him, and I found him out.</p>

On the 27th of March, in consequence of what I heard, I went to Beaconsfield with my haybinder and a constable, and found four of the trusses of hay in the prisoner's shed where his horse stood, the other was loose - the horse was eating part of it at the time; we took him into custody. He said he bought it at Croydon, in Surry. I am sure the hay is mine.</p>

On the 10th of March I was cleaning the door, and went down for some water - I returned in less than a minute, saw footmarks in the passage, and missed the coat off the nail in the passage. I went to the door, and saw the prisoner come out of the next house with the coat on. I told him he had been into No. 35, and taken my master's coat - he asked me how I dared to say so? He came back with me, threw the coat off in the passage, and said he insisted on seeing my master, and he would send for a constable, and have me taken up. I sent for a constable, who took him to the watch-house.</p>

I met her in Petticoat-lane on the 9th of February, and took hold of her arm; she beat me, and called to some persons, who tried to rescue her, but I kept my hold, and gave her in charge.</p>

            . I am a carrier from Norwich to London. On the 8th of February, 1817, I left town with my waggon, and on the 9th, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I heard something fall off the waggon - I was then near Tottenham. I put the tilt up, saw my goods uncovered, and three men ran away from the waggon - two ran towards Stamford-hill, and the other to Edmonton. I sent my man after the other two. He called me - I went back, the men were gone. I returned to the waggon, and found I had lost a chest of tea, a box of lemons, and two bags of nuts. I told the watchman what had happened. When I got to Norwich I heard two men had been taken, but they had escaped. On the 13th of February last I saw the prisoner in the Kingsland-road, and told him he was my prisoner for stealing the things. He said his mother gave him 30 s. to make it up, which was not the case. I knew him before - he used to assist my fellow-servant to drive the waggon. I did not see him that night. I never saw him after the robbery till this time. I had been told he was the man.</p>

            . I am a watchman at Edmonton. Aves told me what had happened that night, and about a quarter after three o'clock in the morning the prisoner, and a man named Bell, were coming down the road with a chest of tea - the prisoner had about five pecks of tea in his smock-frock. They had broken the chest open, and the other man had got the chest on his back. I asked them where they were going to? they said they were guards to to the waggon, that somebody had cut the ropes, and got the tea off, and they were going to take it to the waggon. I followed them to the next watchman. - Page ran away with his load - I kept Bell, and locked him and the tea up. We followed the prisoner through the fields, found him behind a haystack, and put him in the cage, and on Sunday night he was rescued out of it. I found a chest of lemons next morning, in consequence of what Piper told me. I am positive the prisoner is the man - I should know him again from a hundred. I could never find him till now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not lay hold of me in the field, instead of behind a haystack - A. He ran from the haystack.</p>

               <p>"Do, for my husband wants some clothes in the morning." In the course of the morning of the 20th, I borrowed the money of Mr. Twining, my draper, and went to No. 46, Shouldham-street, with my little boy, and saw the prisoner, and his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Now state distinctly what passed - A. The prisoner's wife said,</p>
               <p>"Have you brought the change?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have." She showed me a folded note, which I took to be the same I had seen the night before. I then put my hand into my pocket, and took out 13 l. 6 s. 6 d., and gave it to her - the clothes came to 6 l. 13 s. 6 d. The moment she gave me the note, I gave it to my son - I did not look at it. I told him to take it home to his mother, as quick as he could, as I had promised to send the 20 l. note to Mr. Twining. I then stopped to measure the prisoner. My son returned while I was there, and said,</p>
               <p>"Father, mother wants you immediately." - the prisoner was present. I then went home, and my wife showed me this paper - (looking at the bill) - this is it. I said I was deceived, for I thought it was a bank note for 20 l. I went back immediately to the house, and saw the prisoner's wife; the prisoner was gone. I did not get my money; I went to the house six or seven times that day, but did not see the prisoner. He came to me with his wife about eight o'clock the same evening, and said the promissory note was as good as the Bank. I produced it, and he said it was as good as the Bank; that he knew

               <p>Q. The bill was made payable at No. 3, Staining-lane, Wood-street - A. Yes, he requested me to go there, where I should have proper satisfaction, and if not, he would see what he could do in giving me the change again. I asked him the name of the person in Staining-lane? he said he did not know the name, or any thing of the people there. The bill was due on the 19th of March - my wife went with the bill.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You dealt with her brother for the clothes - A. Yes; the prisoner's wife offered me the 20 l. note in the presence of

               <p>Q. The second time she gave you the note - A. Yes, and I gave it to my son. I believe it to be the same that she offered me at first - I was in a hurry.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at the time - A. He was talking to my son, and looking at his writing-books - he was a yard or two off. He said nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. He came at seven o'clock in the evening of his own accord - A. After my going to him six or seven times.</p>

               <p>Q. After you had satisfied yourself by enquiry at Staining-lane, you measured his children for clothes - A. Yes; but they paid ready money, I would not leave them without.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If a man lived there seven years, and had had no letter, you would not know him - A. I think I must know him if he had no letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a custom in the country, that if a man takes a farm he does not take possession till the end of May - A. It is; the old tenant holds it till the 1st of May.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I shall give a faithful narrative of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210062"/>the transaction between myself and the acceptor of the bill. A short time before I came to town, I sold 
               <persName id="t18190421-141-person1476">Owen</persName>
             a horse - he then lived near Manchester. I came to town, and wrote him to remit me the money. While I was in company with 
               <persName id="t18190421-141-person1477">Carter</persName>
             I met Owen, and asked him for the money. He said he had just taken a farm at Knutsford, and had no objection to my drawing a note on him at two months, and promised to pay it when due. He wanted it made payable at Messrs. Jones, Lloyd's and Co., but he had no account there. I said I dare say Chadwick would let it be made payable at his counting-house, which he did, and Owen made his mark to the bill. I left the bill at home, to be paid to any one I owed money to, and my wife gave it to the prosecutor instead of giving him money. I have every reason to believe Owen has an interest in a farm at Knutsford, or occupies one himself. He has deceived me by making it payable at a house he did not know. I am innocent.</p>

            . This bill and acceptance, all but the mark, is my hand-writing - I drew it by desire of the prisoner in Mr. Key's shop, who is a stationer, in Coleman-street, where we bought the stamp. The prisoner fetched a man into the shop to accept the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen these two persons together - A. About a fortnight before. The prisoner told me the man's name in his presence. I did not speak to the man myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man who made the mark see and know what you wrote - A. I do not know. He was in the shop, and made his mark after I wrote it - I showed him where to make his mark. Nothing was said about meeting the bill. I had taken a small warehouse at this time at No. 3, Staining-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the bill to be made payable at your house - A. I met the prisoner in Cheapside - he asked me if I did not remember one Lowndes? I said it was thirteen years since I had seen him. In consequence of what he said, I let it be made payable at my house, as he said he would see it paid. After two or three solicitations, I agreed to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. Q. What are you - A. A broker in the Manchester line. I sell goods on commission. I took the place in Staining-lane in December, for six months certain.</p>
               <p>Q. The time is not up yet, are you carrying on business there now - A. No, in fact I did not use this place at all; I found it inconvenient, and told Mr. Stone to tell the people I would not keep it. I received some goods in there - they remained there about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear the goods did not come in in the morning and go out in the evening - A. Yes, I will. My warehouse was a small room. I have not paid the rent, as there are some fixtures; when they bring in their bill I shall pay it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Stone attend at the warehouse for you - A. He did - I knew nothing of Owen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give Stone authority to give any answer about Owen - A. I told him to say Lowndes had told me it was sure to be paid.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner wished to have the bill made payable at your house - it was not Owen's desire - A. No; I have seen no other bills of Owen's; I now live at a private house on Stamford-hill - I do not use any warehouse now. I took the warehouse to receive goods, but I found it did not answer.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How do you sell your goods - A. By pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the warehouse for six months, which are not expired - A. I think I took it for twelve months; they know where to find me, and have not applied for the rent.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You took it for six or twelve months, and have left it entirely - A. Yes. I am not a sworn-broker.</p>
               <p>JESSEE CARTER. I now live at Holloway. I know the prisoner - I do not know Owen. In January last I was in Coleman-street with Chadwick, I believe the prisoner was with us; it was the first time I ever saw him; he asked Chadwick to draw a bill for him on a person named Owen; we went into Key's shop and bought a stamp; Chadwick 
               <persName id="t18190421-141-person1479">drew</persName>
             the bill, the prisoner being a bad writer - the prisoner put his name on it. Owen said he could not write - it was accepted with his mark. Owen said he would make it payable at a banker's. He was asked if he kept cash there? he said</p>
               <p>"No, but I shall have it there when it comes due." The prisoner then, I believe, asked leave to have it made payable at Chadwick's warehouse, which was done.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know Chadwick - A. I have known him many years; he once kept the Duke Humphrey, public-house, in Earl-street, about eight years ago; after that, I believe, he kept the Waterman's Arms, at the foot of Westminster Bridge. I was never at his warehouse in Staining-lane.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you known Owen - A. I did not know him, the man called himself Owen.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Chadwick must have heard him say so - A. He said his name was Owen.</p>

               <persName id="t18190421-141-person1481">drew</persName>
             the bill, the prisoner called a person into the shop, asked him some questions, and then asked him to put his name on the bill, which he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The man was in the shop half a minute, not more; he seemed very awkward and very unwilling; he did not mention his name.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole thing was manufactured before he was called in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You did not attend to what was going on - A. Not exactly; I had no interest in it - some questions were asked him about where it was to be made payable. I have some faint recollection about it being made payable at a banker's, and afterwards it was made payable somewhere else.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did this man take any part in it - A. He scarcely said a word while in the shop - he followed their direction; he did not come in with them. They looked about a good bit before they found him; they thought they had lost him, at last they beckoned him over.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw Harvey lurking about the shop window; Cox was on the other side, opposite the door - Harvey went up to the shop, then crossed over, and spoke to Cox; they then sat down on the bench of the public-house, and talked together. Harvey then went over again - Cox stood opposite the door with his hat in his hand, as I thought making a motion to Harvey when nobody was in the shop. Harvey then went to the window, took a pair of boots, and ran away; Cox walked away in the same direction. I stopped Harvey - he dropped the boots, and threw an open knife away. Another person secured Cox immediately - he struggled a good deal.</p>

On the 13th of March, about a quarter after six o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in the Commercial-road, heavily loaded, and asked him what he had got? he said he was moving, and the things were his own. I said I must see what they were - he put them down; the first bundle contained these hats - another had canvas, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210066"/>the other had meat in it. He said the hats belonged to his lodger's children - I secured him.</p>

I put my hand to my bonnet, as a signal to the officers, who came and took her into custody. They searched me immediately, and found the seven shillings she had sold me.

            . I am an officer of Worship-street, and have been so forty years. On the 25th of February I met Willis at the corner of Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, my son and Gleed were with me. We took Willis to the Three Compasses, she was searched; I saw my son mark her money. We sent her on and watched her. I saw her join the prisoner by St. Giles's church; they returned into Compton-street - the prisoner went into a house, and staid a few minutes, Willis remained in the street. The prisoner came out, and they joined company. When they had walked about twenty yards the signal was given - we took the prisoner into custody, and found the money we had marked on her.</p>

            . I am officer. I searched Willis, and found two shillings, three sixpences, and ten-pence in copper on her, at the Three Compasses. I marked the silver - she had no other money about her. I told her when she met the prisoner and had dealt with her, to put her hand to her bonnet as a signal. We followed her to St. Giles's church; the prisoner met her; they returned to Compton-street - the prisoner went into a shop, and Willis staid at the door - the prisoner came out, and they walked about twenty yards together. I saw Willis give something to the prisoner, who immediately returned something to her. Willis gave the signal; I ran and caught hold of her right hand - she dropped some silver, which Gleed picked up; it fell through my hand. I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got there?" Gleed took a parcel from her - it contained counterfeit shillings. I asked her where she got them from? she said from the prisoner - the prisoner said she knew nothing about them. She would not tell me where she lived.</p>

            . I am a fisherman. I was with my son and my father on the River Thames, on the 1st of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210069"/>February, about seven o'clock in the evening, near Teddington. My father was in the punt, and we were ashore near Crowlake ait. I have known Chamberlain eight years, and Facey four years. Two men, who I believe to be the prisoners (but am not certain), were in a wherry; they went into <placeName id="t18190421-176-crimeloc967">Crowlake ait</placeName>

Two or three minutes after I heard the same crash, and the swan cried again. I was right opposite to them. I left my father and son to listen to what they were at. I was five minutes there, and then heard them strike a third time, but did not hear the swan scream then - as they had a wherry they could go faster than us, and so we directed our course up the river to Hampton Court bridge. My father and I got out, and sent my son in the punt up to a summer-house below the lock, and left him there. About half an hour afterwards I returned to the punt, my son showed me cygnet lying about twenty yards from the waterside, in a little hole in a field adjoining the banks of the Thames, and about two miles from the ait - it was about half a year old, it was dead, but warm. I had seen that cygnet alive that day, in Crowlake ait - there was no other there for a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRIC. Q. When did you fight with Facey - A. I had no fight with him; I hit him twice, and so I did Chamberlain. The moon shone very bright that night. I will not swear the prisoners were in the wherry. Crowlake ait is on the Middlesex side of the water.</p>

I then saw the persons row the boat opposite to Hampton Court lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same boat you saw before - A. I cannot say; I only saw one that I know. I saw one of them get ashore opposite Hampton Court, on the Middlesex side - he had something with him like a swan - he went to the wherry again, and they went away. I went ashore, and found a cygnet, dead, in a hollow of the field. I knew both the prisoners before.</p>
               <p>Q. From the opportunity you had of observing the wherry, what do you believe - A. I believe them to be the men. Chamberlain lived at Twickenham. I showed my father the cygnet.</p>

            . On the 1st of February I was near the river, on the tow path opposite Long Ditton, which is between Crowlake ait and Hampton Court bridge. I first saw the Kemps go up in their punt - I knew them before. I have known the prisoners about a year. In about half an hour I saw a wherry go up in the same course - there was one man in the wherry, and two others - the prisoners were towing it. Chamberlain spoke to me, he said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo, Bill!" I said halloo! too - he was towing.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other man that was assisting him - A. I did not notice, he held his head down, and did not speak. After they went down I went to the waterside to look into their boat, when I went to their boat they went faster. I saw something in the boat's stern, it struck me it might be a swan, it appeared like one. As I went to the boat they started out further in the river. A great many swans had been missing from the river.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It might be a man's jacket you saw - A. It might, it was after eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. How far was it from Crowlake ait - A. About half a mile; they were going against the stream; the towing path is about a mile from Hampton Court bridge. I was close to Chamberlain. They passed me.</p>

            . I am a fisherman. I had the care of the swans, and bred them - there was a brood of four young ones and two old ones at the ait; the young ones would be about six months old in February; they cannot fly till they are a year old, and never leave the old ones till then. When they went into the water they remained at Crowlake ait I saw all six of them a fortnight after Christmas. I missed three young and two old ones, one was left by itself, it was hurt when it was young; I saw that safe about the latter end of January, which was ten days before the prisoners were taken up. All the swans had been taken away before they were apprehended. I missed eight or ten.</p>
               <p>Q. They swam about - A. Yes, but they do not go far from home.</p>

            . I am stageman and swan marker to the Vintners' Company. The swans belong to the King, the Dyers and Vintners Companies - nobody else have a right to keep swans on the River. I occasionally go and look at them, and saw them all safe about Christmas - there were thirty-two on the river; I missed the whole about the 12th of February, from Twickenham to Hampton Court bridge every swan in that neighbourhood was taken off the river. On the 26th of February I went with the officer to Chamberlain's lodgings at Twickenham, we found him and his wife there; he was asked what he had done with the skins of the swans he had killed - he said he had no swan skins. We searched the room, and in the cupboard I saw a swan's quill - Bishop pulled it out. He was asked where he got it? he said he did not know, he had never seen it before, it must have been in his lodgings before he took them. In another cupboard in the same room we found the skin of a cygnet, about six months old. He was asked where he got that, his wife and himself both answered at the same time, that they found it. They were asked where, and both answered at the same time,</p>
               <p>"in Holborn." I asked at what time it was found, one answered in the day, and the other at night. I said, why, what do you mean by that? the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Why, it was neither day nor night, it was twilight." He was taken into custody, and brought to town. A few days before I was at his lodgings, I was going up the river, and found the carcases of four swans, skinned, and lying on the edge of the river at Richmond - two young and two old; a sack was lying by them. I cut the beaks off, and know by the marks on them, that two belong to the King and two to the Dyers Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210070"/>COURT. Q. When you go to mark them, you and the King's officer go together - A. Yes, the King's officer and the Dyers' officer go with me; if there is a brood of five, the cock claims three, and the hen two; if it is even, we share alike. I should think, by the size of the bird that was killed on Crowlake ait, that this skin corresponds with it. I mean the bird that was found at Hampton Court. They never stray after they have paired. Four swans would be worth 11 l. They were marked and pinioned.</p>

            . I was in the House of Correction when Chamberlain was confined there, in the same room with him. I was detained to be a witness at Kingston. which I did, and am now at large. While I was there I asked Chamberlain what he was detained for? he said it was knocking down a swan or swans, and asked if I thought they would let a man swear to him, by seeing him over the water. He said he was taken through a fisherman, who he had previously had some words with - he did not mention his name. He said his master had been to him, and told him that the fisherman had been to him, and told about knocking down the swans; and his master told him not to be afraid, for if he got into any trouble he would assist him in getting out of it. He said he saw a man on the water, who spoke to him, on the night of the robbery as I suppose; and that the officers afterwards came to his house, and took him; that they found a swan skin and a quill in his house; that they took him to a public-house, and gave him some beef steaks and beer, but he could neither eat nor drink. I asked if the fisherman was there? he said, I believe that he was. I asked if any one else was there? he said he thought he saw a man who he had sold a skin to, but he was not certain, as he could not look him in the face, but he thought it was him by his watch-chain. I asked if he was afraid of any other skins being found? he said No, for they were sold at such a place as they could not have a thought of looking for them. I asked him if any other persons were concerned with him at the time he was seen on the water? he said his master and his mate were with him. I asked him if his mate was taken, whether he would not say any thing against him? he said he was not afraid of that, for he knew he would sooner suffer death first.</p>

On the 2d of February, about one o'clock, I marked a piece of silk serge, which measured about forty yards, and left it in the drawer - I left the prisoner in the shop; I returned about half-past two, and found some of it cut off. In the evening I went to Snaith's shop, looked at some pieces of serge, and bought one yard and a quarter of him, which I knew to be mine by the mark. On the Thursday following I marked another piece, and missed some of it about the same time - I afterwards saw it in the officer's possession. I afterwards saw Thomas, he said he had not been to Snaith's for twelve months; at last he said he was there.</p>

            . I am the prosecutors' clerk. On 4th of February I went with Plank, and stationed myself at the corner of King-street - I had a view of Snaith's house, which is in King-street. In about ten minutes I saw Thomas cross the street, and go into Snaith's shop. We went round a little way, and then went into the shop, Plank told Snaith that a tailor in the neighbourhood had been robbed repeatedly, and he suspected the stolen goods were sold to him. I saw a piece of serge on the counter with our private mark on it, and told Plank that that was the piece which had been stolen that day. He said he could not tell who he bought it off, as so many people came to his shop it was impossible for him to say when he bought it. Plank said, "you must know, the person has not gone out above ten minutes." He said he did not think he should know the man again.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Dickens, and saw the prisoner, Thomas, came out of the prosecutors', and followed him to Snaith's. I went in myself in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210071"/>about five minutes, he was then gone; I asked Snaith if he had bought any silk serge? he said he sometimes bought such things, but not very lately. I described the dress and height of the prisoner; he said no such person had been to his shop, and he did not know such a person. Dickens claimed the serge which was on the counter; Snaith said he did not know who he bought it of. He said it was impossible for him to know any body, and he had something else to do besides looking at their persons. I was desirous of fetching Thomas, but he said it was of no use. I took Snaith into custody. I afterwards took Thomas to the office - Snaith denied all knowledge of him. Thomas said he took the serge, and sold it to Snaith. Snaith made no answer.</p>

I went on the opposite side to watch, and saw them return, and rattle the things about - the dog came out, and drove them away.

            . I have known the prisoners three weeks, and was with them. Hanson pulled the handkerchiefs down, and Frederick put them under his coat; we ran away, and went to Isaacs in about a quarter of an hour - Hanson went into the shop to sell them; we two stood outside, He came out and said Isaacs would only give 9 d. a piece - they were all in one piece; he said there were only eight of them. Frederick went back with them, and returned with eight; they said there were only eight, and they would not sell any. They took the eight to Lewis, and said they sold them there for 6 s. 6 d., and gave me 2 s. 2 d. as my share. As we were going along Bluegate-fields Frederick was taken.</p>

We found three more at Lee's lodgings; his wife was there; I left town about half-past six o'clock in the evening, and got to Acton a little after eight.</p>

I was at Lee's appartments, No. 29, Tower street, Seven Dials; he only lodged there two days - his wife lived with him; I used to go to clean up the place. On the 26th of March, I got there about seven o'clock in the morning; Mrs. Lee desired me to pick the mark out of a table-cloth - the prisoner was present; one of the marks was N, I do not remember the other. While I picked the mark out of that, Mrs. Lee picked out the mark of two others - I saw twenty-two table-cloths there. Henry came in between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and looked at eighteen of them; Lee asked 4 l. for them? he examined them, and offered 2 l. 15 s. for them, which was agreed to, and he took them away. He said he was a dealer in oranges - he staid about an hour.</p>

I went there about a quarter after nine o'clock, in the one-pair front-room, and found four or five Gipsies there. I sat down, and in two or three minutes, Lee's wife came running into the room, put her hands together, and said to her father,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, put away the table-cloths, for Furzeman has taken the girl." I shut the door, and called out of the window for Kendrick, and the prosecutor to come up. I searched the room, and found three dirty table-cloths in a drawer - Lee's wife claimed them. I took her, with her father and brother-in-law, to the office - they were discharged. About a fortnight after Lee was taken into custody at Bow-street; I had been looking for him without success; I found them both in custody on another charge. They were brought to Marlborough-street, and Hall pointed them out.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I met the prisoner, Campion's, cart, with three men in it, about half-past seven o'clock, on the 20th of March, they were going towards Bedfont. In about three minutes after I met Goring, went back with him, and found the cart opposite the public-house - the prisoners were then in the cart; the third man was gone, and the butter stood by the cart wheel. I asked where the third man was? a by-stander said he had ran up the road. I pursued, but did not catch a sight of him. The prisoners did not attempt to escape - they said the butter belonged to another man.</p>

I put the bag on board, the prisoner was employed as boatman - I went away about a quarter of an hour - I returned between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and it was gone. I had left Little on board. As I returned, I met the prisoner in another boat, going from the Liberty, with something under his frock, about the bulk of the bag - I did not suspect him. When I got on board, Little gave me information, and I missed the bag, went in pursuit of the prisoner, and found him at the White Lion, public-house, and took him into the counting-house.</p>

            . I am a type-founder. On the 10th of March I was going along Tabernacle-walk, and saw the three prisoners together in company - they walked very slow. I passed them, and heard Miller say,</p>
               <p>"there is one in the window." I watched, and saw them go to the prosecutor's shop, and look in, they then passed - Williams came back, went into the shop, and stopped there two minutes; I saw him come out with the silk handkerchief in his hand, he ran off down a street, I ran round another street to meet him, through a court - immediately as I got into the court, the other two prisoners ran against me. I followed them up Paul-street into Clifton-street, and saw them looking into a corn-chandler's window; I passed them, and went into a shop to watch them. I saw Crawley doing something to his breeches - they then passed the corn-chandler's three times, one went in and the other two followed. I went in, and found nobody in the shop but a little girl - I shut them all in together - they wanted to get out, but I would not let them. In a few minutes I sent for a constable, who took them. They were searched, and the handkerchief found in Crawley's breeches - he had joined them in Clifton-street.</p>

On the 2d of March, after he left work, I broke his bin open, and put several pieces of brown paper with the corn, mixed them up together, and fastened the bin again; next morning I went to where I suspected he was going to sell it, and saw him come and call very loud to his horses, which I thought was a signal; I then saw Purser come with an empty sack, he held the sack open, and Perry shot the corn into it, out of his own sack. I followed Purser home to his house up to his loft, he came down with part of the corn in the sack, and threw it into his cart. I secured him - he begged of me to think of his family. I then went and secured Perry. I examined the corn, and found my labels in it.</p>

            . I was cabin-boy on board the Alliance - the prisoner was mate. I remember the puncheons of rum being shipped on board, some of them were seized.</p>
               <p>Q. Before any of them were seized, had you and the prisoner any thing to do with them - A. Yes, the mate told me to go down into the hold and fetch some rum, I said I would not go; he said if I did not he would flog me. The captain was not on board at the time, and the prisoner had the command of the ship. He went, pulled a key from his pocket, and took a half-anker - he got down into the hold, and called me down; I went down, he took a gimlet from his pocket, and bored a hole in the top and side of one of the casks - he made me hold the half-anker, and half filled it - he took about two gallons. He then went and gave the people some work on the top of the vessel, that they might not come down to see him. He then came down and put spiles in the top and side of the puncheon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to more than one puncheon at once - A. He filled the half-anker out of two puncheons that day, and gave it to me through the hole, to put in his birth where he sleeps. He afterwards told me that he had sold the rum to a man in a boat, for 28 s. I told the captain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days before he was taken up did you take the first quantity of rum - A. I do not know; I was on board when he was taken - it was two or three days before he was taken up. Nobody charged me with stealing it. I told the captain of it two or three days after, on the same day that Gatty came on board; I was with him, and told him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you spill much in taking it - A. A great deal.</p>

            . I am surveyor of the Thames Police. On the 20th of March I apprehended the prisoner on board the Alliance. The last witness went into the cabin with me. I saw the prisoner, and asked the boy, in his presence, which way they got the rum out of the hold? he pointed to the scuttle, and said they got it up that way; and that they put it in an half-anker. I asked him what they did with it? he said they put it in the mate's cabin. I turned to the prisoner, and asked him what he said to it? He speaks English distinctly. He said it was all true. I asked him what he did with it, whether he took it to the shore, or whether anybody got it away? He said a man came on board and fetched it. I asked him what the man gave him for it? He said 28 s. for three half-ankers, which is about twelve gallons. The captain gave me the information. The prisoner went with me to find the man whom he said had bought it.</p>

            . I am clerk to the Magistrates at the Thames Police Office. I remember the prisoner being examined. He appeared to understand English very well, and spoke it very well. I took down what he said - neither threats or promises were held out to him - (reads)</p>
               <p>"A man came three or four times on board to sell stockings, waistcoats, breeches and knives, and asked me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210077"/>several times if I had any spirits or tobacco to sell. When we were loading rum he came sometimes on board, and said I should try to get some rum to sell him. I had a half-anker on board, I filled that out of the hold, and sold it to him. He fetched it. Another day he brought an empty one, and I sold him a full one. He a third time brought an empty half-anker - I filled that, and sold it to him. He asked for some more, but I would not let him have any more. He gave me 28 s. for each half-anker. The man to whom I sold the rum is a Swede, and I know he is a patrol. I have seen him in Ratcliff-highway about eleven or twelve o'clock at night."</p>

On the 26th of March, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoners came to the shop together, and looked at some printed cottons; Wood looked at those which I was showing them, while Munday was looking at some in the window. I observed Munday take a piece of print from the window, bring it to the side of the counter, and give it to Wood under the top of the counter - Wood put it under her pelisse. They said they did not like the prints, and asked to look at a common blue one - they bought a quarter of a yard, which came to 4 d. They were then going away, but my brother jumped over the counter, seized Wood, and took her to the other end of the shop. As she went she dropped the print; Munday attempted to get away, but was stopped at the door. We gave them both in charge.</p>

About the 2d of January I met the prisoner in Compton-street - he asked me if I wanted a situation on board a ship? I said Yes. He showed me where his father lived, and said he would get me a place, as he knew a Captain who would take me. He kept on in this way about a week, and said he would get my things washed, in order to go before the Captain. He persuaded me to let him have them washed, and I gave them to him for that purpose. Next day I asked him if they were done? he said he could not be bothered with me, and left. I never could find him. I had given him these things to get washed as my mother was ill. He said he would give me the trowsers out of the bundle before I left him. He afterwards said he would give them to me in the morning. In about a week I met him, and asked him for them - he promised to meet me next day, but he never came. I have never got a single thing back. I found him in custody at Bow-street.</p>

            . I am a helper in Mr. Crawford's stables, in Wimpole-street. On the 12th of April I called the coachman at a quarter before five o'clock, then went and stood at the corner of Bowling-green-lane, and saw the prisoner coming down Beaumont-mews, with the coach-glasses under his arm. I called the watchman - he ran away to the corner of Great Chesterfield-street, and there laid it down. I saw him at Marlborough-street about eleven o'clock, and am sure he is the man.</p>

Atherley was carrying a load, and King was following close behind. I secured Atherley, and asked him what he had got? he said they were old sacks that he had picked up. King said he picked them off a dunghill, at Woodford. I took them to the watch-house, and found Surry's name on them.</p>

I had not been there many minutes before a person sprang from the crowd, and seized two men who were in front of me. Immediately upon his seizing them, I heard something fall on the pavement, and the breaking of glass. I looked down, and saw my watch lying there. I stooped to pick it up, but before I could reach it, the person who had seized the men had let one of them go, and picked it up. I claimed it, and assisted in taking the prisoner, who was the other, to the office. I did not feel it go.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Luke's. I went down Chancery-lane with the procession, and observed a man (not the prisoner) with the watch in his hand. I saw him turn his back to the procession, and reach the watch over to the prisoner, who took it, and concealed it under his coat. I seized them both, and heard the watch drop. I let the other go, and picked it up at the prisoner's feet - the other man ran away, and got off. I never let the prisoner go. I am sure I saw him receive the watch.</p>

On the 15th of April, Wallwork came to the shop about ten o'clock in the morning, and desired to look at some Irish linen - I showed him two pieces, he asked me if I could send them for a friend to look at? I tied two pieces up, and took them with him myself. He took me to a public-house in Leigh-street, kept by Mrs. Churchill. He desired me to sit down in the parlour, which I did, and presently the prisoner, Morgan, came in; both of them looked at the linen, after that Wallwork left the room. Morgan then wished me to recommend him the best piece of the two - I recommended that at the highest price; he said he would have it, but he must have some French cambric for frills - he wished me to fetch him two or three lengths to look at. I went home for them, leaving the linen he had chosen with him. I returned immediately with the cambric, and found they were both gone with the linen. The landlady said they were gone out with it, and that Morgan had it under his arm. I ran out, caught sight of them, and secured them both together in Gower-street - Morgan had the cloth. He said he was going to show it to the person who was to make his shirts. I gave them in charge.</p>

On Friday morning, about five o'clock, I heard the pigs making a noise; I got out of bed, and went to my window, which commands a view of the prosecutor's yard. In a little while I saw a man get out of one of the styes; he had a small bag, which appeared to be full. He got over the fence, which is six feet high, and then over another fence into the road - I then lost sight of him. I dressed myself and pursued him, but lost him.</p>

            . I was coming out of my house a little after three o'clock in the afternoon, and saw a young man inside my garden railing; one or two of the railings were broken - I made him come out - the linen was hanging up to dry. There was another man standing by the railing - they both went away. I do not know them.</p>

Next morning, I saw her come down with a bundle under her arm; she told my husband on the evening of the 18th, that she wanted to go out early in the morning, and I showed her how to open the door. Next day, about five o'clock I looked through a hole in the door, and saw the flock laying about the room. About seven o'clock my husband went up stairs, intending to go into the room; she said every thing was right, but the things were dirty. I went in with the constable, and missed the property stated in the indictment. The bed was emptied, mattress, and tick and all were sold - they were let to her with the lodgings.</p>

On the 9th of March, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, these things hung in my parlour to dry; the door was a little ajar - I was backward. The prisoner pushed the screen aside, and my daughter said there was a woman; I saw the prisoner going out; she said she wanted Mrs. Gregory - I said she did not live there. My daughter said she had got all the things under her arm - she said they were Mrs. Gregory's things. I pulled her into the room, and took them from under her arm - she had got to the door.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house. I found two kidnies and a large spike nail on him, and two knives, one in each stocking - I also found some fat in a bag in his hat. The prosecutor saw the mutton, and compared it with one of the knuckles - it corresponded exactly; it was double-jointed.</p>

On the 17th of April, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was taking my scales and weights to the public-house, and saw the prisoner and another young man rush out of the door as I went in; as I returned to Covent-garden I saw them again about twenty yards from the door, the prisoner took a handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket, turned back again, and went into the public-house - I followed him, and stood by the door; he came out again with the same young man - they went up the street, and both stood against a railing in the street. I passed them, three gentlemen and a lady came by, returning from the Theatre, they both followed them, and I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket - it was a blue and white one. I pointed him out to the watchman. I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not stop the gentleman, and tell him - A. Because I was once robbed myself, and when I took the man I was surrounded by a gang of about twenty, and got almost killed.</p>
