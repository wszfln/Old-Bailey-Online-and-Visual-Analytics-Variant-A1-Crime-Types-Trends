And immediately after, D - mn you Bitch, where is your Money? give me your Money. And presently coming up with another Man, he said to him, did not you hear the Groaning? he reply'd, Yes, I did. That then he desired him to go along with him and see what was the matter; but he seem'd not willing to venture. That then he said lend me your Stick and I will; and he stood ready to assist him upon occasion. That going up to them, he found there was a Woman lying on the Ground, and the Prisoner on the Ground busy about her . That when he came near, the Prisoner cry'd, D - mn you what are you? He reply'd, A Man. He cry'd, D - mn you what do you want? He reply'd, to know what he was doing there. He reply'd that there was nothing but a Drunken Women. That then he call'd for Help, and they laid hold of him, and some People came by with a Lanthorn and Candle. That the Deceased lay in a very odd Posture, and a very bad Condition, with her Coats up to her Belly, Streams of Blood issuing out of her Eyes and Mouth; that he called to her, but she could not speak, but made a gagling Noise as if she had something in her Mouth, which appeared to be Blood. Another Evidence deposed, that as he was going home from Work over Bunbil-fields , he heard a groaning, and stooping down towards the Ground saw a Man, I went up to him and ask'd him if he heard the Groaning; he replied, Yes; I desired him to go up, and he refused, I desired him to stand by me and I would go. I did, and going within five or six Yards of the Place he saw the Prisoner upon the Ground with the Woman, the Woman's Coats were up to her Belly; that the Prisoner said, G - D - mn you , what do you want? that he reply'd, he wanted to know what was the Matter; that the Prisoner replied, it was nothing but a Drunken Woman, and lifted up her Foot and said it was a Man. That then be enquir'd of him where he met with her, he said first at an Alehouse, then at a Brandy-shop, another time at the Burying-Ground Gate ; so they seized him and carried him to the Watch-house; his Hands Coat and Apron were all Bloody; he deposed that the Woman was very Bloody in the Face, and one of her Eyes beat out of her Head; be added, he heard the Prisoner damning her for a Bitch before he came up to him, and was sure it was his Voice. The Constable depos'd, that the two former Evidences brought the Prisoner down to the Watch-house; that he was all over very Bloody, and that he would have gone away ; saying that he had done nothing; but he told him, he knew him to be a Thief and a Rogue, and if he did not sit down he would knock him down, or throw him into the Fire. That then he went to see for the Woman, but being very dark the Evidences miss'd the Place ; and be followed in the Field, that if any Body was in Distress they were come to assist them; but there was no Answer made; but a Dog he had barking about the Body, gave them notice where to find her. That when they came they found her lying in a sad Condition, as had been before described; and besides some of her Teeth knock'd out, which were shown the next Day before the Justice, and one of her Arms broke; that then he got her carried to the Watch-house, and sent for some Women to hold her forwards, for she was choak'd with Clots of Blood in her Mouth and Throat, and could not speak. That then he sent her to a Nurse, and ordered her to be taken Care of. The Nurse deposed, that she was brought to her in the Condition before described , adding that she could not speak a Word all the while she lived; that she said to her tho' you can't speak you can hear, make some Signs how you came by your Hurt: that she lifted up one of her Hanes , not being able to stir the other; and put it to her Head, Throat and Belly, signifying that she was Hurt in those Parts: that in this miserable Condition she languished 4 Days and then Died. Mr. Goodman the Surgeon deposed, that being sent to the Deceased he found her in a sad Condition, a Wound above one Eye , her Eye started out of her Head, which he depressed and put in again, that she had another Wound near her Nose, her Throat very much bruised, her Scalp of her Head so bruised and contused he had scarce ever seen the like, that the upper part of her Womb was very much core and larated , and that her Wounds were the Cause of her Death. The Woman's Husband deposed , that his Wife used to sent Cakes and Gingerbread about the Streets, and went out that Morning very well about 10 a-Clock, that his Son came home about 10 at Night, and she having the Key he could not get in , and so sat down at the Door waiting her coming home and fell asleep, but waking and she not being come home, he came to him to the Watch-house in Cheapside (he being a Watch-man )<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171804230005"/> to enquire for her, that he knew nothing of her till he heard the next Day of the Accident in Bun hill fields, The Prisoner denied he knew anything of the Fact, but that as he was coming from Holloway-lane he saw three Men crossing the Field, to Chequer-Alley, found something lie in his way, kick'd at it with his Foot; found it was a Woman, and lifted her up, but she could not stand upon her Legs ; and while he was doing this was apprehended.

             deposed, That Mary Ipsley hired her Cart, giving her 2 s. to carry the Corps to Eling; that a Boy drove the Cart, and that she was went along with it; that by the way the Horse fell down, upon which Mary Ipsley cried out, and she asked her what she was afraid of: she replied, she was afraid the Coffin would burst open; that she answered her again, suppose it had, what then? she hoped she had not buried the Corps naked: she replied, No, she had buried it in a white Mantle . She added, that she said it was a Woman who died in a Convulsion-Fit, but she said nothing of a Child. Mr. Tille, the Curate of Eling, deposed he gave the Clerk Orders that when any Persons were to be buried to let him know of it before hand, that he might be in the way; that there were two Children to be buried the 30th of December, and he having been invited to ne that Day with the Church Warden of Brentford, he desired him to let him know when they would be ready and he would be there as soon as they, and that the Overseer of Brentford and his Wife dined there also; that after Dinner he went to Eling, and the Children being brought there to be buried, he looked behind him and saw a Coffin in a Cart, upon which he asked the Clerk from whence it came: he answered, from Tumble-down Dick's at Brentford. He then asked the Clerk if there was a Grave ready for it, he answered him there was one almost ready; he enquired if the had gone for it, and was answered No. he then enquired of the Prisoner who the Person to be buried was; he answered Wife that came to her House the last night, and was taken with a very violent Fit, and continued in it till she died. He said that was a little odd. He asked her if she had acquianted the Church-warden or Overseen of the Poor with it, The answered she had: he asked her if she was sure of it, the fact she had acquainted them with it; he asked when, she replied about 2 or 3 Hours ago: he asked her again if she was she had , she then snapped at him, saying, don't I tell you so? That then he answered her it was false, for he had been for 4 Hours at the Church-warden's House, was at Dinner there , and the Overseen was at Dinner with him there, and if so he should have heard of it. Then she made him no Answer He then told her, I much suspect you, I will see the Corps: she replied to him, can you answer that? he made answer, I can't tell whether I can or no, but however I will try for once: With that she came and whispered him, telling him in the Ear, she died of a very bad Distemper , she is all over full of Plague Spots ; that then he replied, let it be Pox or Plague, he did not fear; he was in the way of his Duty, and with the help of God he would see. Then she came to him again, and said, to tell you the Truth she has no Shroud on: to which he replied, the more Breast you then, and sent for Tools to open the Coffin, and desired what Woman were present to inspect the Corps, and also that the Men would withdraw at a distance, and that he himself stood at some distance from it, but observed how Mary Ipsley behaved her self: and when the top of the Coffin was railed at the Head and about half open, she ran to it, put her Hand into the Coffin, took the Corps hold about the Head or Neck and shook it: he asked what that was for, and she answered to make her purge and ink them all out of the Church. That after the Women had viewed it, he was informed that the Corps was indeed stark Naked , as when born, and that they saw Marks of Violence and barbarous Usage; and that there was also a young Child in the Coffin.

There was no Spots on the Woman's Body, but a clean Corps from head to foot: there was a Call over the Face of the Child, one of the Women pulled it off, and there was no Nose, but what was flat, even with the Face, only two Nostrils did appear. This was also confirmed by Mrs. Floyd, Mrs. Prestons, a Midwise , deposed the same with the other Women, adding, that the Blood stood in the Left Ear of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171804230006"/> Deceased ready to run, that there were two places on each side her Mouth looked as if they had been hurt, and from her Shoulder to her Elbow as if there had been hard Gripes, a very great Bruise on the Right side of her Belly, and that there was such a Vacancy that no Child ever made in a Woman by its Birth; that the Call being taken from over the Child's Face, the Nose was flat, the Nostrils of the Child Bloody, and the Blood flew out of the Child's Mouth in a Bladder, and there was a Bruise on the Child's Head and the right side of the Neck, and that the Child was at its full Time, and that upon the whole she did not believe that Life of the Woman and Child went out by the common Course of Nature. Mrs. Banister confirmed what the other Evidences had said; and deposed it was her Opinion, that the Deceased had been cut, for that no Woman ever received so much Damage, or could, by the Birth of a Child; and that the Child had no Nose only Nostrils, and was as flat as the back of the Hand. Mrs. Levings, another Midwife, also confirmed what the other Evidences had said; and added, she did belived the Woman was ded dry, because she never purged in the Coffin first nor last.

               <p>Mary Ipsley pleaded in her defence, that the Deceased came to her House on the Monday before Christmas-day in a very poor Condition, and desired she might lodge there that Night, but she refused to let her, till by the Persuasion of some Men who were drinking there she did; that the Deceased said she would go to London early the next Morning; that about 9 a Clock the next Morning she sent to call her, but no answer was made and wondering at it, they went up to see, and found her in a Fit; that she got Geneva and robbed her Temples, got Sack and Black Cherry Water, and her Teeth being set they could not get it down her Throat; that some time after she seemed to be a little recovered by lying still, but soom after she fell into another Fit, and so continued all Day on Wednesday, on Thursday she fell into her Fits again, and continued in and out of them all Thursday, and so Friday and Saturday; and she never heard her speak from the Night she came till she died; and on Sunday Morning a Woman that came with her from Windsor, and tended her as a Nurse, went up Stairs to see how she did, and came down in a Fright and said she was in Labour; they went up immediately, and both she and the Child were Dead, the Child being born dead.
