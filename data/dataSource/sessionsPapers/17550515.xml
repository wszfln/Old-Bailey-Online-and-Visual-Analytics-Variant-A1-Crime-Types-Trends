               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>A. Bristow. I have seen him at my house four or five times; about four o'clock in the afternoon on the 3d of March he came in and called for a tankard of beer. I bid the boy go and draw it, which he did, and put it before him, he staid till about six o'clock. I had been up to my husband, who was then sick, and when I came down he was moved to another box, and the tankard standing before him, and in about ten minutes time a person spoke to me on the left-hand-side, I turned my face that way, in the mean time I saw the prisoner give the door a violent jirk; I said that fellow had taken away the tankard; I ran out after him into the street; I met a young man that is now in court, I said, Dick, Run after that fellow, for he has taken away my tankard, I saw him run up Harp-lane, he ran after him, but could not overtake him. Having some knowledge of his wife, I, with two friends, went and found the house where he lived, and took him about two in the morning, I took him before the justice, he owned he was in my house but denied having the tankard. I advertised it, and Mr. Dyer came and said he believed his man had bought such a tankard, and he had got it at home. I went to his house, this was on the Wednesday evening, after advertising it on Monday and Tuesday.</p>

               <p>Hunt. No, he did not; he said he bought them at Low-layton for five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of Ducks were they?</p>
               <p>Hunt. Two of them were Muscovy, and two English, intirely white, except one, which had a little black on the tail.</p>

The four ducks were in the pond about seven o'clock in the evening on the 19th of April; I did not miss them till a gentleman sent word he had taken a man with some ducks, and they were brought to our house with the prisoner; the two Muscovite ducks were dead, their heads were cut off, the other two were alive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They swore they were geese.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. That honest fellow stopped me with the ducks.</p>
               <p>Clark. He had the four ducks; I stopped him thinking they might be mine. I asked him where he got them? he made no answer, as I remember. I took him and them to my neighbour Mr. Hunt, and he owned them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is very true what he says.</p>

               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Enough said. I bought the ducks in Wood-street at Walthamstow; I have got no witnesses but myself, although I am a poor fellow I am an honest fellow, and a coachman too.</p>
               <p>Q. Can any body give an account of this man's behaviour of late?</p>
               <p>Mr. Akerman. About a fortnight ago I went up into the gaol in order to set some little affairs to right; I found the prisoner had been beat; the other prisoners, which we call the gate-men, told me that some of the boys, who are since transported, had been using him ill, and had got him to burn his cloaths. My turnkey can give a better account of his behaviour than I can, he sees the prisoners every day. I never saw any particular acts of lunacy by him any farther than hearing what the other prisoners would say of him.</p>

We have been called up on his account sometimes at two or three o'clock in the morning, fearing he should set the gaol on fire.</p>

He said, no more will I; and said he would certainly give her trouble if she took away his character. I went for a search-warrant, and when I came back, my mistress told me she had been at the prisoner's house, and seen several things: I went, and there found the things contained in the indictment, the property of Mrs. Bond.

I am the constable; I was sent for on the 9th of this instant to the prosecutrix; I went to the prisoner's house, when the prisoner went backwards, and took the goods mentioned in the indictment and tied them up in his apron. I thought there was no other way of coming out but at the door I stood at, but he went out with the goods at the back door; I pursued him, when he dropt some of the things; and finding I got ground of him, he turned up a little narrow turning, where he dropt the whole; and while I stopt to take them up, he running fast, got out of my sight. I brought them back to his house, and sent a person to acquaint his mistress. She came and looked at the goods, and said they were hers.

I went on, and carried them to the man at the warehouse; he said I came just right, for he had nothing but a coal-scuttle to scower. As to the looking-glasses, I had been used to mend my mistress's things in the shop, I had broke the two looking-glasses, and I took them home to mend them.</p>

I said I would not, and took him to the Compter that night, and the next day before the alderman, and he was committed. I have advertised the spoon twice, but at present it has not been owned.</p>
               <p>The prisoner being a foreigner, and pretending not to know English, an interpreter was sworn. His defence was as follows:</p>
               <p>I came over from France to go to Holland, and having never seen the rarities of the king's going to Holland, I wanted to see it, so I staid for that purpose. I went and lodged in St. Martin's lane two days and nights. When I came here I had but two shillings, and I could not go beyond-sea, so I thought of going to sell the spoon; it was on a Sunday, and as I heard the Jews might trade on Sundays, I went into Duke's-place. I asked six shillings for it, or four shillings per ounce. I had not been in England above a fortnight before. The spoon I bought in France.</p>

               <p>Higgens Peyton. On this day fortnight I was informed my cook-maid, the prisoner at the bar, used to admit a man in at the fore-parlour window, and after staying there some time, return back the same way; and that she handed out a basket, which he used to take away. I got up the next morning, between three and four o'clock, and opening one of the shutters of the dining-room window, from whence I could see the fore-parlour window, I saw a man in a great coat getting in at it, and after staying about half an hour, returned, and received a basket from the window, but I could not see who gave it. He then unlocked my area-door, and went away with the basket. On the Monday morning I saw him come about five o'clock, and open my area-door, and get in at the window; I had two people in readiness to take him, it was the same man whom I saw on the Saturday morning. After staying in my house some time, I saw him get out again, and a basket was handed to him as before; he went out set down the basket, and locked the area-door; then took up the basket, and was carrying it away; but he had not been a minute from my house, but as soon as I got down, they brought him back; the man confessed he had been in six or seven times, and begged I would forgive him; so did the prisoner. He confessed before Mr. Fielding he had taken away the things that these baskets contained. There were two baskets which I saw opened before Mr. Fielding, there was a cag of small-beer in one basket, in the other there was about half a quartern loaf of bread, about half a pound of butter, and about two pounds and a half of roast mutton, and about half a bushel of coals; these they both confessed they took from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she confess she was the person that handed out these things?</p>
               <p>Peyton. No, she did not; but said she had committed the fact. Upon the prisoner's delivering the key of her trunk to me, I delivered it to my wife; she will give an account what she found there. After this, I carried the prisoner and the man before my Lord-Mayor, when he was pleased to commit the man to the house of correction, and the prisoner to Newgate; he has since made his escape.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any arms he had got ?</p>
               <p>Tricket. No, I did not then; I said, what demand have you of ten guineas upon me? he said, for fun; I said, fun, what do you mean by fun, have you no other demand? then he put his hand to his pocket and pulled out a pistol, and clapped it to my breast, then my son pulled out a purse from his pocket and said, here friend, here is ten guineas, for God's sake take your pistol away. As I got up from my seat he still held his pistol in the same position directed to my breast, I gave a spring and took hold of the arm that held the pistol, and turned it from me, and took hold of his collar, my son jumped upon him and took hold on his other arm and collar too; I found I was not strong enough to take the pistol from him, but he turned it towards me again, I turned it from me again, and then took hold of the barrel of the pistol and let go his arm, and took hold of the handle of the pistol and wrenched it out of his hand, then he strove to get away, but we secured him. When we came to examine the pistol we found it was not charged; we carried him to the justice's and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Was I sober or in liquor?</p>
               <p>Tricket. When I took the pistol out of his hand I thought he had been drinking spirituous liquors, but he came to me very straight as if he was sober, but when he was taken away he did appear to have had a little liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. By what did you judge him to be in liquor, by the smell of the liquor or by any other behaviour?</p>
               <p>Tricket. Only by the smell of the liquor, he walked as well as I can, but before the justice he behaved as if he was in liquor.</p>

            , a constable; he came, and brought a watchman along with him. Then Kennedy told the prisoner he had a warrant against him at such a one's suit. Said he, where is my prosecutor? The officer said he was not there. Said the prisoner, then I will not go along with you. And Beach said, I have got a warrant or a writ against him, I know not which, and he shall not go along with you.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Beach?</p>
               <p>Bury. He is an officer, and came in along with the prisoner. Then the prisoner's wife went out, and brought him in a pistol, or pistols. Then the prisoner said, where is my prosecutor? The constable said, he is not here. The prisoner said, who gave you charge of me? The constable said, Mr. Bury did, and I have commanded him to aid and assist me. A person in the room said, take care, he has pistols about him. Then the constable thought proper to take his word till the next morning. I went to Spital-fields for the prosecutor, but did not know where he lived; so I went to the house of Mr. Wright, in Mason's-court, and desired him to come down to us; but he said he was afraid of being murdered. I returned without him; but I had not been in the house above ten minutes, before James Green and Stanley came in. The prisoner then said some words, which I think were these, there is Bury that had me taken, cut away. Then they all fell upon me at once; some had sticks, and James Green had a hanger. I then received these wounds ( shewing scars on three fingers and his thumb on his left-hand, another on the thick part of his right arm, and several on his head ); I am told there were twenty-three cuts on my head; my nose was cut on the upper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175505150010"/> part, and the end hung down on my upper lip. I have lost the use of my three fingers.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there upon you?</p>

I plunged in among them, in order to make my escape; I got out into the street, but how I can't tell. It was very dark, and I got on the other side of the way, where there was no lamp, with intent to secrete myself. They pursued me, and called a bull-dog of Green's which they called Bosson, and set him upon me. He seized me, and I got hold of the dog.

            . I was headborough for Whitechapel parish at the time; Bury came to me on the 21st of January about eight or nine o'clock at night, and brought a warrant for me to serve on Mr. Hudson, I was loath to go knowing him to be a resolute man. I went with him to the Rose-and-crown, Church-lane, and told the prisoner there I had got a warrant for him, he said, will not you take our words for me? I said, no, but if Mr. Stevens the landlord of the house, will pass his word for your forth-coming any hour to-morrow, I will take his word, but the landlord would not; then one Beach that was there said he had got a warrant against him; I said my warrant is better than yours. Mr. Hudson put his hand by his side and said, I had made a mistake, his wife coming in, after which he said, Blast my eyes if I'll go with any of you; he went out, I followed him, he said, what do you follow me for? if you do I'll blow your brains out, don't come a foot further. Bury came in and called for a pint of twopeny, then in came Green, Stanley, Hudson, and Beach; Hudson said, this is he, and they cut away as fast as they could upon him; how Bury got out I could not tell, but upon tracing the blood I found him in the street, I got a watchman to carry him to the hospital.</p>

I took the prisoner to Clerkenwell-bridewell; after which justice Cross sent me to her to see for the shirt and stockings, and I found she had them on; I had them taken off (producing a shirt and a pair of black stockings, deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

We went into my room, he took his buckles out of his shoes and gave them to me, and he pulled off his shirt for fear of vermin, and laid that and his cloaths upon a chest, and unfortunately I got up and went away with them, and I shewed the watch to two beggar-men going up Highgate-hill, they told me if I would give it to them they would let me go, and I was not willing, so they took me to the constable.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say how she took it?</p>
               <p>Berry. She told me she came into the kitchen to light a candle, and she took it from off a nail.</p>

               <p>I was going to a chandler's-shop for some sand, and there came a man and asked me to carry a watch to pawn. I went to carry it; going along,

               <p>Q. to Berry. Did she come to you and tell you Perry had the Watch?</p>
               <p>Berry. No, she did not; another woman came and told me the prisoner had taken it, and I went to her, and asked her if she took it, and she said yes, I did; I took it to the constable's house, and

               <p>Wood. The prisoner told me it was her own property; I told her she did not look like the person that owned it; then she fell a crying, and said it was a family spoon, and she did not want her friends to know she was going to sell it. My wife came in, and said that was the woman that sold the small tea-spoon the Wednesday before. I shewed it her, and asked her if she sold it my servant? She said she did. I asked her what mark was upon it? She said the letter C; but it proves to be an S. (producing it).</p>

She said she had carried her husband some victuals in it, that works at the brewhouse at Bow. She said she lodged at Mrs. Collings's, and she had pawned this table-spoon there, and fetched it out again in order to sell it. I seeing the letter S. upon the little spoon, carried it to Mr. Skinner's, where it was owned. Then I went to Mrs. Collings, and asked her if

I carried him the next day to justice Fielding, the justice asked him how he could be guilty of such a thing? he answered, it was the first time he ever had been guilty, but said he did not steal it, but there was another man with him that did.</p>

I said, I don't know, let me look at it. I had about half a crown and two-pence in my pocket; I said, what do you ask for it? he said, three shillings; I said, I have no more than half a crown and two-pence, I'll give you half a crown; one of them said to the other, let him have it, so I bought it, and the watchmen stopped me. I am a tiresmith, and have worked with a great many masters, which, if they were here, would give me a good character.</p>

            . I left a room to the prisoner with these goods in it at three shillings per week.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lett the room to him?</p>
               <p>Carroine. About six months ago, to the best of my remembrance, but he knows better than I when these things were missing. I advertised them in the paper and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them?</p>
               <p>Carroine. On the 19th of March; my wife and I looked in at the key-hole of the room, and we saw the room was stripped; I went for the smith and he forced opened the door, and we missed the goods mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Carroine. He was taken up at High gate, there he owned the d - I assisted him to do the like, and that he took the things, and we found upon him a sheet made into shirts and shifts, and an apron, and the like, and his wife had on the quilt made into a petticoat; he had on a coat made out of a blanket, and another upon his son.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Make him speak out, I can't hear him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took him at Highgate?</p>
               <p>Carroine. One Randolph did, for a little guinea reward, and I paid it before the prisoner's face.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. First and foremost, all that I have to say is this; all those things I have taken, it is true: but please to ask him if they were not mine before I took them?</p>
               <p>Carroine. No, they were not his property, they were mine.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did I not change a silk gown of my wife's for three old bits of blankets? Have not you the silk gown now at your house.</p>
               <p>Carroine. There is no such thing. His wife brought a silk gown, and desired my wife to lend her half a crown upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that gown now?</p>
               <p>Carroine. It is now at my house; I keep it for him; his wife ran up fifteen or sixteen shillings upon it.</p>

            . I sell a few books about the streets, and was going to Hampstead and Highgate, in order to sell a few; at the farther end of Highgate I happened to meet the prisoner's wife and children, and knowing they were advertised, I asked her how her husband did? She said, very well. I got it out of her where to find him; she said that he lodged in a barn on the side of Finchly-common. I went to the officer of Highgate, at the Brown-bear, and told him such a man was advertised, and desired him to go with me to take him; but he would not. Then I went to St. Giles's, to the prosecutor, and told him; afterwards returned and took the prisoner as he was going towards the barn; bringing him along I met the prosecutor. The prisoner said, when I told him what I took him for, that if I would go to the barn, there was one sheet tied up in a bag, and we might have it. We brought him to Highgate, and from thence to London.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did I not say they were my own things?</p>
               <p>Randolph. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>This is nothing but spite and malice, to banish me from my family, or take my life. The prosecutor wanted me to go into divers parts of the kingdom, to shew how the roads lay to the French; I was to lead about a blind man, but to enter into the French service at the same time; and he wanted me to go to the priest about it, but I would not, and from that is the spite. This evidence of his is a ballad-finger.</p>
               <p>Q. to Randolph. What are you?</p>
               <p>Randolph. I sell books about.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you sing ballads?</p>
               <p>Randolph. I do sometimes, and I also sell pamphlets and godly books.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Have you had much intimacy with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No never.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he lodge at your house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make any proposals to him to go about the roads, as he says?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I live at St. Giles's, and sell coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you concerned in the army?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in England!</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175505150017"/>Prosecutor. I came from Ireland here seventeen years ago the 4th of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been used to pay for his lodging?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He paid me when he had it; but there is fourteen or fifteen shillings owing now.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his employment?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He and his children used to go with godly books of questions and answers about the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any quarrel with him?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the goods you lost worth what they are rated at in the indictment?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are not put down at a quarter of the value they cost me.</p>

I told him a piece of salt beef, and apple-pye. He said he would dine with me, which he did, and staid till between six and seven at night. Then he went out to see for his wife; he came back again, and said she was a coming. He went into the kitchen, and called for six-penny-worth of rum and water; it was brought him in a silver pint mug, and I sat down by him; he put his stick up, and went to put the candle out, and said we did not need a candle, then I took the candle and put it out, and hung it up, and we had no other light than from a small fire. He drank to me, and I to him, till there was about three spoonfuls left. Then Mr. Morton came in, and asked for the prisoner. I went to speak to him, and in the mean time the prisoner went away. I did not see him go. I got up the next morning, but could not find the mug. I went immediately and took up the prisoner, and he confessed he had pawned the mug for three pounds, and said if I would lend him three guineas, he would give me a note for five guineas, to be paid in five or six months time, and I should have my mug again that night. He cried very much, but I would not lend it him. I took him before justice Welch and justice Fielding, and he was committed to New-prison. I went to him there, and desired him to let me have my mug again; he said, as before, if I would lend him three guineas, &amp;c. which I did not then agree to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he had pawned it?</p>
               <p>Gibbs. No he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen it since?</p>
               <p>Gibbs. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out to speak to Mr. Moreton, did you leave any body in that room with him?</p>
               <p>Gibbs. No, I left him alone, and he had the mug with him then.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether or no I had not three-penny-worth of rum in the afternoon?</p>
               <p>Gibbs. I don't know that, any farther than hearing my maid say he had.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. During the time of the drinking the six-penny-worth of rum, whether or not his wife was not in that room, pouring out brandy or rum from a gallon pot, and her grandson by her?</p>
               <p>Gibbs. There was no soul by but himself and me.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Was my prosecutor right sober that night?</p>
               <p>Gibbs. I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What time on the Sunday morning did you miss the mug?</p>
               <p>Gibbs. About seven o'clock, when I arose first in the morning, and there had been no soul in that room after he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What time did you go to bed on the Saturday-night?</p>
               <p>Gibbs. I went to bed about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. When you went down on Sunday-morning, did you find the kitchen-door locked?</p>
               <p>Gibbs. It was, and the key hanging up, as usual, over the door.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether I did not altogether deny that I owned any thing about it before the justice?</p>
               <p>Gibbs. Before the justice he denied all; but he owned to me, in Jockey Smith's skittle-ground, that he had really pawned it for 3 l.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you send me word if I would pay you a golden guinea, and two shillings per week, you would not prosecute me.</p>
               <p>Gibbs. No, I never did.</p>

               <p>I was at the prosecutor's house about one in the afternoon, he said to me, what is the matter, Wilson? I have not seen you a great while; I said, I had been much afflicted with the gout; he said, his wife wanted to talk with me about an affair; I said, where is she? he said, she was not at home, but would be soon; I said I would call in about an hour or two; then I asked him what he had for dinner? he said, a piece of beef. I staid to dine, and had some beer, and rum and water in the kitchen, and went away and came back again, and said, I would have six-penyworth of rum and water. What he has affirmed about his wife is false; she was in the kitchen filling some bottles of rum; when I went away, I said to her, I wish you a good night, and I shook him by the hand at going out, and he desired me to be there on the Wednesday, I said, I would, and on the Monday morning as I was in an alehouse, he came to me and said he had lost the mug; I went with him, without making any opposition, before justice Welsh, and was sent from thence to New-prison. I find they are very positive as to the mug being in my custody, and nobody being in the room besides, therefore I humbly hope if your lordship should be of opinion that I am guilty, though I am no ways so, that your lordship would be pleased to recommend to the jury to find some particular value, for as it is laid, it is capital, and must affect my life, therefore I hope you will recommend it so as to save my life, though perhaps it may go hard with me, under the dilemma of the gout, with which I am now afflicted, and the noisome stinking gaol which is very bad to me, there is no absolute proof, only circumstances. I did write to a gentleman in Chancery-lane, whose business is so circumstanced, that he cannot attend to give me a character, but I see here are two gentlemen that know me; they are Mr. George and Mr. Newman, who I hope will give me a character.</p>
               <p>To his character.</p>

               <p>John Collings. I had tied this linen up that is mentioned in the indictment, and more, into a bundle, in order to go to be washed on the 7th of April last; these are what we found again, (produced in court) we missed them between the hours of five and six in the afternoon. We had a suspicion of the prisoner at the bar, and took him up on Monday the 14th of April; he at first absolutely denied taking them. On the Thursday after he was re-examined, between which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175505150019"/> two days we had found out where he lodged, and went, and I found one of the night-caps in his lodgings; that night-cap being produced on his re-examination, and I swore to it; then he desired to speak with me in New-prison; I went there, and he gave me information where to find the following things; two shirts at Mr. Harrison's in Bride-lane, two shirts, two pair of stockings at Mr. Brown's a pawnbroker, one shirt, three pair of stockings, at Mr. Price's a pawnbroker's, one shirt, three neckcloths at Mr. Rawlins's.

             is the owner of the indico; we lost a large quantity of indico about the 28th of April; I went down into the hold, and there I saw the prisoner at the bar move forwards, I thought I saw him take something up in his hand, but could not tell what it was; after that I called up upon deck to the carpenter to bring me down a light, they called and told me he could not come, then I bid them send the captain down; after that I saw the prisoner sidle sideways towards the head of the ship; I said to him, my friend, what have you got there? I came close up to him, and he tumbled down on his back with his hands behind him, and just under him, where he had laid, I took up this indico ( producing about four pounds weight).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of the casks broke?</p>
               <p>Rayment. I found a hole in the staves of a cask supposed to be drove in by an iron crow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the indico loose when you found it?</p>
               <p>Rayment. No, it was tied up as it is now in a piece of an old apron. I asked him how he came by it? but he did not own he had had it; our people were impressed for his Majesty's service, so that I had none on board, only what are called Lumpers, he was one of them employed to empty the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been on board long?</p>
               <p>Rayment. He came every day to work on board.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175505150020"/>Rayment. This was about ten in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he employed?</p>
               <p>Rayment. He was in the hold with the rest, breaking loose the casks, that is, to roll them into the hatchway, in order to take them up out of the hold.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person near the cask that was broke at that time?</p>
               <p>Rayment. There were several more of them in the hold; but none so near it as he; the merchant that the indico was consign'd to missed sixty pounds weight.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of sixty pounds weight?</p>
               <p>Rayment. It is worth twenty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who broke the hole in the cask ?</p>
               <p>Rayment. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not there some more of the casks broke by the ship's rolling?</p>
               <p>Rayment. Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. How many casks of indico were there?</p>
               <p>Rayment. There were upwards of twenty casks.</p>
               <p>Q. When you go before the wind, the ship turning to one side and t'other, might not this cask be staved by the sailing of the ship?</p>
               <p>Rayment. Yes, it might.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible this indico might be loose in the hold?</p>
               <p>Rayment. Yes, but then that would have gone down to the lower tear.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say you saw that parcel in the prisoner's hand?</p>
               <p>Rayment. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. How much may the casks contain?</p>
               <p>Rayment. Some of them contain two hundred weight; there are all sizes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the place where you first observed him near the cask that was broken?</p>
               <p>Rayment. No, I imagine he had taken it before, and put it in the place where I saw him sidle from.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was but just gone down into the ship's hold before the mate, it was dark; I went forward to bring the casks to the hatchway; there was some logwood and staves in my way, and I tumbled down. He took up this indico, and asked what it was? I said, nothing that I know of. I did not know what it was any more than the man born.</p>
               <p>Q. to Rayment. How long had he been in the hold that day?</p>
               <p>Rayment. He had been there about half an hour or better before I went down.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is the value of this indico?</p>
               <p>Rayment. Here is about four pounds, it is worth about 9 s. per pound.</p>

               <p>I. Colebourne. Sir Samuel asked her if she did take the things? She said she did take them to be sure; then he said, that was justif ication enough.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by that expression?</p>

She said it belonged to her mistress where she worked. I asked her her mistress's name? She told me she made mantuas, and lived in Church-yard-alley, near the Whitehart. I said, I hope what you have said is true. She said, if I pleased to send a servant, I might know it was true. I asked her what she wanted upon it? She said eight shillings.

               <p>Prosecutrix. I live facing it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Enderson. Was the prisoner gone long enough from your shop (when she said she would go and ask whether she might take the six shillings) to go so far as the prosecutrix's house?</p>
               <p>J. Enderson. No, she was not gone long enough; I then supposed she spoke to somebody in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her speak to any body?</p>
               <p>J. Enderson. No, I did not. She came on the Friday following with a shift, and said to me, you seemed to be afraid when I came with the gown, that I did not come honestly by it, this belongs to the same person. She said her mistress used the Lane, she asked two shillings on it, saying, she wanted some money to buy things.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she mean by the Lane?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175505150023"/>J. Enderson. Rosemery-Lane. I lent her two shillings; and in the afternoon she came with an apron, and had ten-pence on that. I never saw her again till the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. When did Isabella Colebourne come to ask for the things?</p>

               <p>J. Enderson. She came on the Thursday following, and told me I had a gown of hers, and described it, and also told me it was left in a napkin; I readily went and took it down and shewed it her; she told me also I had a shift of hers, and I must know it was hers, for it was wrapped up in an old rag, plaited down the shoulders, and that I had an apron pieced across the bottom; I told her I had them. She asked the name of the person that brought them? I said, 
               <persName id="t17550515-25-person231">
                  Anne

            ; then she told me they were stole; I said, she told me she brought them from a mantuamaker by the White-hart in Churchyard-alley, and said she lived there. She told me the person that brought them had took three gold rings and other things; just as I was taking the gown down she pointed up to it, and said, that was hers.</p>
               <p>Q. Could she see any part of it then?</p>
               <p>J. Enderson. No, I believe she could not. She said, the shirt is pawned for five shillings, the shift for one shilling and six-pence, the apron for six-pence. I said, it is very odd these things should be stolen, and you come for them in this particular manner. I said the gown was pawned for six shillings, the shift two shillings, and the apron nine-pence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say the person had told her they were pawned for that money?</p>
               <p>J. Enderson. She said, no; she had it from one Rachel that the other had sold it to; then I shewed her my book; she went away and left them. After this the headborough came and took me up with a warrant, and carried me before justice Manwaring, and I delivered up the goods.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Tell in what manner I came and surrendered myself.</p>
               <p>J. Enderson. The justice told me he hoped I would be vigilant in taking up the person that brought the goods. I heard she was going to work with some person on the other side the water; I went there, the people told me she was not come; I returned, and about eleven o'clock she came into my shop, and said, I hear you have been brought into trouble upon the account of the things I brought, I am come to clear myself, and will go wherever you please. (The goods produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>The prosecutrix's husband was a little involved in debt; the first thing I carried to pawn for them was a duffel cloak, and I fetched it out again; the silk gown I carried to Mr. Wright in Nightingale-lane, they would let me have but four shillings for it, so I brought it to Mrs. Enderson's, she offered me six shillings on it; I went to ask whether I might take it or not? she said I might pawn it for that; she herself rolled it up in a napkin, and said to me, she had no opportunity of fetching it out till her mother went to the water-cock. She went to the pawnbroker's door, and I went in and carried it, and brought her out the six shillings, she at the same time gave me one shilling for my week's hire. I had of her twelve-pence per week, and victuals and drink. Some time after that she sent me to pawn a shift, which she wrapped up in an old rag, which I pawned for two shillings; after that she sent me out with a check apron, and a white apron, and bid me get the most I could, I carried them to a pawnbroker in East-smithfield, one I got one shilling and six-pence on, the other I carried to Mrs. Enderson, and she lent me nine-pence on it. Please to call Raby, she heard her say I carried these things for her own use, the prosecutrix desired me to lay them in my maiden name, because she had been guilty of pawning things, and her mother would not be ready to find them out.</p>

            . The prosecutrix came and asked me if the prisoner was gone away? I said, I believed not, but if she was she is gone over the water; she said, if she is gone away she has done a very wrong thing by me, for she may fetch out my things and go and sell them; I said, what has she pawned of yours? she said, she has pawned a gown for a crown, an apron for one shilling and six-pence, and if her mother came to miss them, she said she would swear she had stole them.</p>

She asked me, as I was standing at the door, if I wanted any lace? I said I did not. She said she had some that was very fine. I told her I wanted none at all. Then she told me she saw something in my face, from which she knew I little thought of coming in this place to live, or even living as a servant. I said I thought so too once. She said she would tell me a great deal more, if I would let her come in. I let her come in, and she and I went into the compting-house together; we sat down fronting the windows upon two leather chairs. She told me I was born to good fortune, and she understood all that by extrology; and that there was money hid in that house, in the cellar, and had been there for a long time, and that the time was expired when it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175505150025"/> was to be found, and it was to be my good fortune to find it. She said there were of it forty pounds in gold, and forty pounds in silver, two gold rings, two silver spoons, and such a gold cup as they used to receive the sacrament in in old times. She said she did not like to be in that room to talk with me, and asked if any body was in the house? I said there was no body in the house but us. Then I took her up into the dining-room, where she said, if I would trust her with six-pence to go out of the doors, to consult her books, she could tell me a great deal more when she came in. Accordingly I let her have six pence; she went out, and staid some time; and when she came in, she said, I was born to exceeding good fortune, and desired me to trust her with a couple of shillings more, and she could tell me more, which I did. She told me, before she went out, I must get two guineas in gold. I told her I had not so much. She asked me if I could get so much? I said I believed I could. Then she went out, and I went to madam Dunbar's to borrow two guineas. The young man told me he had no such money; but I was welcome to a three-pound-twelve-shilling piece, which he lent me, and I returned. She had before bid me put three pepper-corns in a little salt, and go into the farther part of the cellar, put it all together, and tie it all in the corner of a silk handkerchief, which I did accordingly; after which she came in with the two shillings, and asked me if I had got the money? I said I had not two guineas, but I had a three-pound-twelve shilling piece, and five shillings in silver. She said it would do just the same as in case I had five pounds. She and I went down into the cellar, to the place where I had been before, and took up a little of the dirt, put it into a handkerchief, and came up stairs with the money into the kitchen. She put up three-penny-worth of halfpence she had of her own in a little bit of a rag, and I put the three-pound-twelve, and five shillings in silver in another rag, with the dirt and pepper-corns, and the salt, as she had ordered me to do. She asked me if that silk handkerchief was the best I had? I said it was. She put as I thought, the half-pence and gold up in that together, and ordered me to keep it in my pocket till four o'clock, then she would come, and the stones were to turn all on one side, and the money was to come in a copper pot in the cellar. She asked me then to bring down the best gown I had, saying, she could have the same impression on the gown as on my person. She said she would only take it with her, and bring it again about four o'clock; I was not to look at the money in my pocket till she came at four o'clock. I believe she did not stay above five minutes after I came down stairs. After the woman was gone some time, I was willing to know my good fortune; I put my hand in my pocket, and to my great surprize, found only three penny-worth of halfpence, and some country dirt, not such as is in London, and some salt.</p>
               <p>Q. How long, after the woman was gone, was it that you went to look at the money?</p>
               <p>J. Meredith. I believe it was hardly half an hour after she was gone; then I came down stairs out of the dining-room, and looked about to see if she had not got something else. There were some drawers in the kitchen, in which were a good many silk stockings, I found them all safe; then looking round, I missed my cloak, a white linen apron, a silk handkerchief, and a white one, all my property.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them last?</p>
               <p>J. Meredith. I had had the silk handkerchief and white apron on that morning at breakfast, and there had been no body near them from that time to the time I missed the things, but the prisoner and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other woman or servant belonging to the house besides yourself?</p>
               <p>J. Meredith. No, none but myself, and both my masters were out at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever met with your cloak, handkerchief, or apron since?</p>
               <p>J. Meredith. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner at the bar since?</p>
               <p>J. Meredith. Never till yesterday; except once I saw a woman, which I thought was she, at a chandler's shop; I went soon to see for her, but she was gone. I laid a trap for her at the Baptist's-head, that if ever she came there again, I would give half a guinea to have her taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge her with taking your cloak, money, and other things yesterday ?</p>
               <p>J. Meredith. I charged her with all the things and money I lost. She had an apron on, that was altered, and is an old thing now, but I knew it to be made of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that this is the woman that took the money and things from you?</p>
               <p>J. Meredith. I am sensible this is the very woman.</p>

I felt and found it was of the capuchin; I was for stopping to try if we could see the person that did it, but the young lady was not willing; so we walked up to the end of the Old-bailey; then Mr. Mansel stopped us again, and said, if I was willing we might put his wife, who was with him, and the young lady with me, into a house, saying, he would be lurking about and we might take him, adding, he should know the man if he could see him; so the two women went in to an acquaintance's house of his, and he and I had not gone down past three or four doors from the Old-bailey corner towards Fleet-bridge before he said that was the man, pointing to the prisoner, he was very remarkable, having got a dog wig on, that is such as some coachmen wear. I went up and seized him by the collar, and begged assistance of people that were coming by, so we secured him; we carried him to a tavern at the bottom of the hill; then we sent for the two women; the prisoner said he was in hopes to be forgiven, and said, if he was hanged or transported the lady should have her capuchin again, and accordingly he sent a person for it, who returned with it; he begged very hard for forgiveness; the cloak was laid down on the table, the lady would not touch it. We sent for a constable; she would have taken her oath to the capuchin.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the lady?</p>
               <p>Miller. She had taken a place in the Norfolk-coach, and was obliged to go on the Friday morning, (the capuchin produced in court).</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same which was picked out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Miller. It is very like it; but one may be like another, so I will not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this that which the prisoner sent for and was brought in by his order?</p>
               <p>Miller. It is.</p>

            . I was following the gentleman and the lady he speaks of, about half an hour after eight that night; I saw the prisoner and his companions meet them, the prisoner turned very short and slipped in betwixt my spouse and I, and the gentleman and lady; I observed him as he followed them make three attempts to pick the gentleman's pocket, and when we got just by the Fleet-market I saw him pick Mr. Miller's pocket, but of what I can't say; I saw something drawn out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour did it appear to be of?</p>
               <p>Mansel. It appeared to be black; after the prisoner had done it he went down towards the Fleet-market, and his companions with him; I ran up to the gentleman and asked him what he had lost?</p>
               <p>Q. What companions had the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Mansel. He had a girl about twelve years old and a short man along with him, they seemed to walk pretty fast; I told Mr. Miller I had seen his pocket picked, he clapped his hand down, and said, he had lost a capuchin; I told him I saw the man run down towards the Fleet-market that took it, and I am positive of knowing him again; I was so near him I could have taken him in the fact, but was fearful of his companions. I said I would go along with him to help take the man if he would get some assistance, they went still before me; I thought it a pity to let the opportunity slip; I ran to him again when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175505150027"/> they were at the Old-bailey end, and persuaded the lady to let us try to take the man, so we put my wife and her into a house; and as we were turning down from the Old-bailey we saw the prisoner coming up Ludgate-hill; we got two or three people to assist us, and took him, and carried him into the Fountain tavern; then we sent for the women, and the lady pleaded she wanted to go into the country the next morning, and it would be a great disappointment to go without the capuchin; the prisoner then supposing he should have a pardon if he produced it, consented to send for it, and said, whether he was hanged or transported she should have her capuchin again; I believe there were a dozen people heard it, he sent a person for it and it was brought and put into the constable's hands, the lady would not take it, and when the prisoner saw her determined to prosecute, he took it up himself, and said, if he must be prosecuted for it, he thought it was his property, but the constable took it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this capuchin, can you take upon you to say this is what was taken out of Mr. Miller's pocket?</p>
               <p>Mansel. I can't say that, but I heard the lady say it was her capuchin.</p>

            . I am constable; about ten o'clock that night I was sent for to the Fountain tavern on Ludgate-hill, the capuchin lay on the table, there was the lady, Mr. Miller, and this gentleman sitting by; the lady said that was her capuchin, I told her she must appear next morning, the prisoner said, I am likely to suffer for it, I think it is my property, and he took it up, I took it out of his hand, and said, if you'll give me leave I'll keep it till the affair is decided; and I have had it ever since in my custody.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming along by the Fleet-market, and picked up this capuchin, and carried it home to my washerwoman; after that I came to go up to my horses on Ludgate-hill, this man took hold of me and three or four more, and took me to the Fountain tavern; after we had been there about a quarter of an hour, the lady said she had lost a capuchin; I said, I had picked up one, and if they would send a porter they might have it; they sent out for a porter, when he came, I told him to go to such a place, and desire the people to send the capuchin I brought and left there; the lady said, young man, I am sorry for you, as I have got my capuchin again you may go about your business, but that gentleman would charge the constable with me.</p>

               <p>Chandler. About a fortnight ago. These goods mentioned had been taken away by a little at a time; some of them I found were pawned nine months ago, some eight, some seven, and some four.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss the goods when she went away?</p>
               <p>Chandler. I can't say I did. There was a relation had left some child-bed linen at my house in a chest; she came for some of them, and called to my wife to know if she had done any thing with them, missing them out of the chest. The prisoner went away that night. Then I looked into the beaufet, and missed two silver spoons, then we suspected the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn her away?</p>
               <p>Chandler. No, we did not. After she was gone we missed the things; we went and took her up, and she confessed where she had pawned them, and went along with us to the pawnbroker's, where we found them.</p>
               <p>Q. When was she taken up?</p>
               <p>Chandler. She was taken up on the 23d of April, and by her direction we found the silver watch, two silver spoons, four sheets, three tablecloths, two petticoats, one napkin, five or six shirts, and two linen waistcoats, at a pawnbroker's in Houndsditch.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Chandler. The prisoner lived servant with me ten months and about ten days; I always, took her to be a very honest person till the 22d of April; then I had a relation came for some things, which she had entrusted under my care, and when she came to look for them, they were gone; and she went away at the time. We missed the goods mentioned in the indictment and more; and when we took up the prisoner, we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175505150028"/> found what are here produced, by her confession and direction.

               <p>Mr. Barnard. I being a near neighbour, and hearing Mr. Chandler's servant had robbed him, went to know about it. I went for the officer to come and take her up, we took her, and I heard her confess she had taken the things mentioned at several times, and told us where they were pawned. I went with the prosecutor and she to the pawnbroker's house, and found them accordingly. We could get nothing but what we named, and we were obliged to call for some things that we did not know were pawned before, and by that means we got more than we had missed; for the pawnbroker would not, at our request, look over her books, to see what she had of the prosecutor's; for the prisoner had pledged things so frequently, that she did not know what she had carried there.</p>

               <p>M. Nelson. It was on the 15th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. In the church, or church-yard?</p>
               <p>M. Nelson. In the church. It was after the music was over; there was a very great crowd of people walking. I told Mr. Law my purse was gone, and he went and laid hold of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in your purse ?</p>
               <p>M. Nelson. There was a guinea, a crown-piece, and some other silver, I don't know how much.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this happened had you felt your purse in your pocket?</p>

               <p>M. Nelson. I had taken my purse out about half an hour before, to give to the collection at the door, and put it in my pocket again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you put it in your pocket?</p>
               <p>M. Nelson. I am sure I did; but am not sure the prisoner picked it out. The rehearsal was just over when I went in, and the coronation anthem was singing then. We took the prisoner to a house in Cheapside, I asked her to give me my money again; she said she had it not; we had her to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her?</p>
               <p>M. Nelson. No, we did not; we suspected, if she had taken it, she had given it to some others that were near her.</p>

            . I was in company with Mrs. Nelson at the rehearsal at St. Paul's; as we were walking at the west door, she said there is somebody picking my pocket; she turned about, and the prisoner at the bar was just behind her, with her hand under her sack.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her hand under her sack ?</p>
               <p>Law. I did; likewise I observed two more that seemed to be acquaintances of hers arm in arm; as soon as ever the lady discovered her hand in her pocket, the other two turned short and made off; she said, I believe I have lost my purse, keep your eye upon that person (meaning the prisoner) till I examine my pocket; she did, and found her purse gone; after that we had her taken up and carried her to the Nag's-head tavern, Cheapside, there I sent for a constable; we asked her to produce the purse, and said, if she was agreeable we would not prosecute her. She stiffly denied it; we were apprehensive she had given it to her companions, so we did not search her.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they pick you up, or you them?</p>
               <p>Stears. We neither of us picked the other up; I was going along the street, and they spoke to me, and I went into the room with Jacobs, the other fetched a tankard of beer, and I gave her three-pence for fetching of it; she went out of the room directly, and I was with the prisoner there near half an hour; after I had been gone from her, I went to the Three Nuns, and had been there half an hour before I missed my money.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you miss?</p>
               <p>Stears. Sixteen guineas and a two-guinea piece.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you meet with them first?</p>

               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Stears. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the prisoner afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Stears. I found her in Darkhouse-lane at the Three Tuns, and took her up by the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Darkhouse-lane from the house where you and she were together?</p>
               <p>Stears. I believe they are a mile distance; we took her to the watch-house and searched her, and found two guineas and half upon her, and upon the bench where she sat in the watch-house I found a two guinea piece. (The two-guinea piece produced in court).</p>
               <p>Q. Is it so remarkable a one that you can swear to it?</p>

I turned and saw the prisoner just by the shop where they fell gingerbread. He looked very suspicious; I laid hold of him, and told him I had lost a handkerchief; he had a companion, and he ran away. I gave my friend charge of the prisoner, and I ran after the other, but he got away; then I came back. I asked the prisoner who he was? he told me he was a very honest lad, and that his father was a blacksmith and lived in Black-friars; I went with him, and instead of taking me to his father's house, he took me to the house of Mr. Davis a blacksmith, the person with whom his father works; he asked if his father had done work? Mr. Davis told him he had, and was gone home. ++ The mob sadly wanted him from me to duck him. I found by Mr. Davis his father is a very honest man, but he is a very bad lad, the prisoner insisted upon being searched, saying, he was innocent; I said to Mr. Davis, let him come into your house, as he insists upon it, and let us search him; we went in, the prisoner pulled off his coat, I searched about it, and the bottom of his coat was open, and I saw and pulled out my handkerchief which I lost, it was down in the lining; then he cried, and fell down on his knees; the excuse he made, was, that he was but newly come into the gang, having been in it but two days; he said the others desired him to follow me, which he did, and the other tried at my pocket and took it out and put it into the prisoner's bosom, then it dropped out, and the other fellow that was run away took it up and put it into his pocket, and it slipped down into the lining.</p>

               <p>Wilkins. I missed a quilt, two blankets, a pair of sheets, two copper saucepans, and lids to them, a looking-glass, a copper tea-kettle, a pewter tea-pot, a brass candlestick, two flat irons, a pail, a frying-pan, and several other things more than are mentioned in the indictment. I went and got a constable, and took her before a justice, there she confessed where the things were pawned, some at one place and some at another. We went and found the quilt and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175505150032"/> two sheets, a blanket, one copper saucepan, and the copper tea-kettle, at Mrs. Hill's. We never could find the looking-glass. We went to Mrs. Kennet's the prisoner said she pawned the saucepan there; but we could not find it there. About a week after, Mrs. Hill went by our desire there, and asked for a saucepan in the name of the prisoner, and Mrs. Kennet gave her the saucepan, and said it was pawned for six-pence, and took seven-pence for it. The prisoner said she had pawned other things at Mr. Wood's; we went there, but could not find them; but Mrs. Hill went there, and she got them.</p>

             came voluntarily to me, and said, go and take Coulson up, for he is the biggest rogue amongst them. He was taken and brought into my shop, there Heard charged him with stealing ten gallons of red wine out of the store-cellar of Mr. Grimes, in Suffolk-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he say this was stolen?</p>
               <p>Bruin. I can't say what month it was stolen in. Mr. Barnes was along with Coulson when Heard charged him. He asked Coulson if it was true? Colson down'd on his knees, and said yes, it was, and hoped we would forgive him this time, and he never would do so again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any wine out of the cellar ?</p>
               <p>Bruin. I know nothing of my own knowledge of his taking it; a person may go and take twenty or thirty gallons, and it never be missed, out of the great quantity there is in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you take Collins before ?</p>
               <p>Bruin. I was with him before aldermam Bethell, alderman Chitty, and alderman Hankey; before them he was charged with stealing this wine; but to the best of my knowledge, he denied it before them all.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say against Westwood ?</p>
               <p>Bruin. Westwood was my apprentice, and worked in the same vault, and he has laid out of my house many nights, and this Coulson has harboured him in his house.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he has harboured him?</p>
               <p>Bruin. I have taken him out of his house, and I have great reason to believe he has been drawn into bad company by Coulson; there they used to drink wine together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his delivering him any wine?</p>
               <p>Bruin. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Coulson?</p>
               <p>Bruin. He is a taylor; the affair was discovered by a quarrel between Coulson and Heard.</p>

            . I asked my father, the day the Medway man of war was launched*, to give me leave to go to see her, which he did. Coming home between five and six at night through Barking-alley, where Westwood and Coulson had a cellar; I saw a light there, and Coulson was standing with a ten-gallon cask in his hand, and wiping the sweat. I said, you sweat; he said he had a good load; he had brought that cask from the vaults in Suffolk-lane; Westwood said it was the same vault that you have been with me in; he had put it down but once between Suffolk-lane and there, and that was near Mr. Wilton's, a cheesemonger. There was another little cask by it, and I was going to sit down upon it; but they bid me not, for fear I should jostle it.</p>
               <p>*The Medway man of war was launched the 17th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Suffolk-lane?</p>
               <p>Heard. It turns down out of Canon-street. Coulson said they must make up twenty gallons of wine, and Westwood could sell it to

            ; but they must have ready money for it, if they spent half a guinea to get it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Westwood in the hearing of this ?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. How came they by the two bottles of wine?</p>
               <p>Heard. There were bottles of wine in the cellar, besides casks.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in Coulson's house?</p>
               <p>Heard. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any wine there?</p>
               <p>Heard. I have, bottles of wine; he never wanted wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Westwood there?</p>
               <p>Heard. Yes, many a time.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he appear? as a visiter?</p>
               <p>Heard. He might be there seven or eight times a day at his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Coulson rent a house?</p>
               <p>Heard. He rents two rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever present whenever any of the prisoners confessed taking this wine?</p>
               <p>Heard. I never heard them confess any otherwise but then in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the words, we are to make up so many gallons, or I must make up so many gallons?</p>
               <p>Heard. Coulson said to Westwood, we must make up so many gallons, and we must have ready money for it; and Westwood said, if they would let him have ready money, he would spend ten or fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. from Westwood to Mr. Bruin. Whether or no we were doing any business in that vault at that time?</p>
               <p>Bruin. Westwood was at work there a little after Christmas, I can't recollect the time.</p>
               <p>Q. from Westwood to Heard. At what time was it you saw me in the cellar in Barking-alley?</p>
               <p>Heard. I don't know the day of the month; it was the day the Medway was launched at Deptford, about six or seven at night.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did it begin to be dark at that time of the year?</p>
               <p>Heard. It began then to be dark about half an hour after four. I went that morning to Westwood, and asked if he would go and see the ship launched? He said he could not go.</p>

            . On the Monday morning after the last sessions ended, I was at Mr. Bruin's house, he lives next door to me; he told me his man had been out all night, meaning Westwood; he frequently used to lie out of nights; there came a servant maid, I took it to be the witness Heard's father's maid, to tell him Westwood was at Coulson's house. Said Mr. Bruin, I will go and fetch him; so he and a watchman went and fetched him home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Coulson come with him?</p>
               <p>Barnes. No, he did not. I heard Mr. Bruin say to Westwood, you use me very ill. No, said Westwood, I don't think I do. He said, you had better confess, and perhaps you may save yourself.</p>
               <p>Q. Confess what?</p>
               <p>Barnes. That was about stealing some linen, which Mr. Bruin charged him with. In the evening on the same day Heard the evidence came to Mr. Bruin's house, and said I will clear myself, for I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was by then?</p>
               <p>Barnes. There was I and Mrs. Bruin together; then she said, who is this? though Heard is my neighbour, I do not know him. He said that Taylor is the biggest rogue; if you will but take him, you will find this house has suffered prodigiously; he has stolen wine out of a vault in Suffolk-street. I went and fetched Mr. Gardner the constable, and he and I went and took Coulson.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the taylor the evidence which Heard meant?</p>
               <p>Barnes. He is; he happened to be at home. I laid hold of him, and said, you are my prisoner, and you must go along with me. He said, so I will with all my heart. Coming down the bottom of the street, he made a spring to get away; but having hold of his collar, I held him fast; then he said, what business have you with me? You are no constable. Then Mr. Gardner held his staff to him, and said, smell of this. We took him to Mr. Bruin's house, there was Heard the evidence, who charged him with stealing lead from the Customhouse, and wine from a vault in Suffolk-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Westwood then?</p>
               <p>Barnes. He had been sent to the Compter that morning; Coulson and Heard then began to charge one another, each saying it was not me, it was you; upon being charged with taking wine from out of a vault in Suffolk-lane, all on a sudden Coulson called out, for God's sake have some pity and compassion on me, and let me go, and I shall never do so any more. I have always lived well.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175505150034"/>Q. How much wine was he then charged with taking ?</p>
               <p>Barnes. A ten gallon cask of wine from that vault; I asked Coulson if it was true what the lad said, he said it was true, and still kept begging for God's sake I would let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. from Coulson. Whether ever you saw me do any thing that was bad?</p>
               <p>Barnes. No, never in my life; I have seen him go backwards and forwards as a taylor, but never had any acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>Q. from Westwood to Mr. Bruin. Whether there was any ullage or any red wine missing in that cellar ?</p>
               <p>Bruin. There is an ullage of red port in that vault.</p>

            . Coulson came to my house, my wife was at home, but I was at the India warehouse where I do business; my wife sent for me, Coulson wanted to take a cellar; he asked me what he must give per year for it? I said forty shillings; he agreed to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who he took it for?</p>
               <p>West. He said it was for another person that lived in Bread-street; he took me down to a house in Water-lane, there fat Westwood, he told him he had taken the cellar of Mr. West at forty shillings per year, and said to him, you must give Mr. West a shilling, then Westwood gave me a shilling, I called for a pint of beer, and threw down three-halfpence for it and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that shilling for?</p>
               <p>West. That was earnest for the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you take to be your tenant ?</p>
               <p>West. I looked upon Westwood to be my tenant, but the agreement was made with Coulson.</p>

            . I had the charge of the two prisoners at the bar; I am constable; I carried Westwood to the Compter in the morning, and in the evening Heard came and surrendered himself; then Mr. Barnes came to me and desired me to go and take Coulson, which I did, and we carried him to Mr. Bruin's house, there he was charged by Heard with stealing ten gallons of red wine; he denied it at first; I asked him how he could be concerned with such youths as they were? and said, I believe he had been the ruin of them; at last he fell down on his knees, and desired we would let him go, and said he never would be concerned in such a thing any more.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose barge did you take the oats from?</p>
               <p>Hicks. From Mr. Groves's barge.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you acquainted with the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Hicks. Because we served the latter part of our times pretty near one another.</p>
               <p>Q. Who proposed first to go and take these oats ?</p>
               <p>Hicks. Never a one of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not one propose it first?</p>
               <p>Hicks. No, we both went together to rob the lighter.</p>

               <p>Q. Who said first we will go and rob that lighter?</p>
               <p>Hicks. Never a one of us.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it possible you should go and rob the lighter, and never a one of you speak a word about it?</p>
               <p>Hicks. We did not know what was in the lighter till we came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with a design to take what was there?</p>
               <p>Hicks. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who mentioned that design first ?</p>
               <p>Hicks. He had told me his design, and I told him mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. We went to steal the oats both together; to be sure Haynes did not receive them all, there was another bargeman had some; Haynes had but four quarters of them, another bargeman had two quarters and a half; we stole six quarters and a half in all.</p>
