On the night of the 9th of May, between twelve and one o'clock, I was on duty, and met the prisoner in Green-lane, near Winchmore-hill, in the parish of Edmonton - he was leading a black gelding; I asked where he brought it from; he said from Potter's-bar, and was taking it to Mr. Kimpton's, at Highgate. I took him in charge - he said his name was Sedgell, but afterwards that it was Benyon, and said his master, Mr. Westley, of Potter's-bar, had bought the horse for eighteen guineas, of Kimpton, at Smithfield-market, and he was taking it back because his master should not pay the deposit money; I went to Potter's-bar, and could find no Mr. Westley - on my return my brother officer directed me to English.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the morning of the 10th of May, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was on the road near Southgate, about a mile from Winchmore-hill, and met the prisoner with this gelding; I asked where he brought it from; he said from his master, Mr. Westley, at Potter's-bar, and was taking it to Mr. Kimpton's, at Highgate - that his master had brought it home the night before, and tried it in harness, that it kicked, and he was going to take it back, to save the deposit money. English claimed it that morning, in his presence. I told him he was very wrong in sending me to Potter's-bar when there was no such person there; he said voluntarily, "If I had known you were going there I would not have sent you, I would have told you all about it - I took the horse from Mr. English;" English lives about a mile and a half from where we met him. I left the horse in the stable while we went to Potter's-bar; Fitch had the key. I afterwards took the prisoner with the horse towards English's house, and met him on the road - he claimed it in the prisoner's presence. It is particularly marked.</p>

On the 20th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190004"/>April I went to bed a little before ten o'clock - I sleep in the parlour; my shop door was locked and chained. My wife awoke me about eleven o'clock (I have no children;) we laid listening some time, hearing a noise at the door; I got up, and saw Morgan in the shop, in the act of taking off my goods; I pushed him aside: Brown was in the passage. I ran and shut the street door, and shut them both in - my shop door is a side door in the passage; I called the watchman, who came: he searched the house, and found the prisoners up in the cock-loft; they had run up stairs while I was calling the watchman. They had broken the lock off the shop door - I had seen Morgan with both hands lifting my goods up; he was in the act of handing them out at the door - Brown was near enough to take them from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Does one Spearing lodge in the house? A. There is a little deformed man lodging there - I cannot say that Morgan visited him. I shut the street door before I went to bed, but lodgers come in and out as they like, and I cannot say whether they went out afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other Christian name? A. My name is Thomas Mitchell.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no other name? A. My name is Thomas Reynal Mitchell.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you use the name of Reynal? A. No, my Lord. I sign my name T. Mitchell. I have been married nine months, and was married as Thomas Mitchell - I have not signed my name as Thomas Reynal Mitchell for years.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear your name is not put down in the parish books as Thomas Reynal Mitchell? A. I never wrote it so. I was married at St. George, Hanover-square; I have not written my name as Thomas Reynal Mitchell for three years. I cannot say when I used that name last, it is so long ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you hesitate when asked if you had any other name? A. I was confused; I did not think it would get the prisoners off if I had another name.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had you seen the prisoners before? A. No. I had no light, but a light reflected from a gas lamp into the passage. I was certain when I saw them again that they were the same boys. I ran out to call the watchman, but kept the door in my hand all the while to keep them in; I was about five minutes in the street.</p>

Mitchell called me about a quarter past twelve o'clock - I went to the place, searched the house with two more watchmen, and found the prisoners in the cock-loft, at the top of the house; nobody else was there: they were dressed. The house is four stories high. We told them to come down, which they did. I asked where the other two were whom I had seen with them opposite the house, at twelve o'clock - they said they were in the loft, but they were not. I had my lantern when I saw them at twelve o'clock, and there was a gas-light; I know them to be the same men; I knew them before; the parents of one live in Oxford-buildings, and the other in Gees'-court.</p>

I jumped out of bed, ran partly down stairs, and heard the watchman's rattle spring, which led me to think the disturbance was in the street; I went to my sister's bed-room, looked out of her window, saw a watchman, and told him to come to our door - I ran down stairs, found the door open, and him there; it appeared to have been opened from within. I saw the mark of a centre-bit on another door and the pannel was broken - that door appeared to have been opened by a centre-bit; the hole was large enough to admit a man; there is a wall at the top of the house, with spikes on the top. The watchman found an umbrella in the passage, and that morning the servant picked up a centre-bit. There were marks on the wall (which is white-washed) as if persons had got over there.</p>

A person getting through that pannel must break open a door to get to the shop - an attempt had been made to cut the lock of that door away. I am sure all the doors were fast the night before. I manage the business; the prosecutors pay rent, taxes, and wages.</p>

On the 22d of February, between twelve and two o'clock, the prisoner came to the house - I opened the door; he said, "I perceive you have an apartment to let;" I said Yes: (there was a bill up to let it.) He said, "I want one for my master, who is a respectable elderly gentleman, who has not very good health, and is obliged to sleep out of town for air;" that he had just been to Hampstead to take a letter for his master, to Mr. Hoare, and his master desired him to look for an apartment as he returned - that he had lived with him twelve years, ever since the death of his father, and having lived with him so long he almost knew what would suit him as well as he did himself. I took him up stairs into the front room; he looked round the room several times, and said he was sure his master would be pleased with it, for it was airy and pleasant, and would just suit him. I took him into the sleeping room - he made the same remark. I went down into the parlour with him; he complained of being tired, saying it was a long way to walk from the City and back again; I asked him to sit down - he sat down between the sideboard and fire place. He asked me to write my address, that he might give it to his master, and said he had no doubt I should hear from his master next day, and perhaps he would send a note by him. I wrote my address in the room, and gave it to him - he put it into his pocket. He appeared tired, and remained sitting there; he asked for a glass of water: I thought he looked ill, and asked if he would have a little spirits in it (he had said he would either take porter or beer - I told him we had none) - he said he would; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190006"/>went down to fetch the water, and when I returned with it I found him standing with his back to the door, near the side-board - I asked what he would like to take in the water; he thanked me, and declined taking anything in it, saying, perhaps his master would smell him, and think he had been loitering away his time at a public-house, and blow him up; he took the mug, drank a little water, and went out of the house very quick; I went to the door and let him out. In about ten minutes I went into the parlour to open the side-board drawer, in which I had left the key; I missed seven table spoons from the front of the drawer: I had opened the drawer not twenty minutes before, and they were safe; I am sure I had seen them after eleven o'clock. There was nobody in the house except the servant, who was at the top of the house, and had been there for an hour or two before. I was sitting in the parlour, writing, when he came, and for an hour or two, and had not been out of the parlour after I saw the spoons safe; I have never seen them since. I heard nothing of his master, nor did he ever come back. I did not see him again till after he was taken up; he was in the room with me some time: he was not dressed as he is now, but I saw him once at Worship-street in the same dress as he wore on that day. I am positive he is the same person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. When did you tell your husband of this? A. I went to town the same day and told him. When I saw the prisoner afterwards he was in custody; my husband told me a man was in custody answering the description. I never said I did not miss the spoons for seven days.

I went to the stables about half-past three o'clock in the morning of the 16th, found the lock of the door broken to pieces, and laying on the ground - three geldings and one mare were gone; another horse had been untied, and tied up in a different place; that horse was marked in a particular manner: the mare was in foal. I saw two of them on the Sunday following, and two on the Monday, one at the Plough public-house, Mile-end, and one at the Nag's Head, public-house, Whitechapel, in care of the officers.</p>

            . I keep the Sun, public-house, at Lemsford-mills, Hertforshire, about three quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's. On the 15th of March, about six o'clock, the prisoner came to my house with another man, by the Hitchin coach; they had a flag basket, which they threw down off the coach, and something rattled in it like iron; they came into my house, staid about an hour, and went away about seven o'clock, up the road which leads to the prosecutor's. On Friday, the 18th of March, I went to the Plough, Mile-end-road, and saw the mare in foal - I knew it very well to be Batten's; I knew all his horses. On the Saturday I went to the King's Arms, public-house, at Bow, and saw a horse called Black Jack, in possession of Butcher; I knew it, having sold it to Batten. I found two more of Batten's horses at work in Mr. Rayment's field, at Bethnal-green.</p>

            . I am hostler at the King's Arms, at Bow. On the 17th of March, about half-past nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came there, in company with another man, with three horses, and a mare in foal, brought them into the yard, and left the mare in foal and one horse with me, for the night; next day he came for the mare - he said he should either come or send for the other, and if he sent he would send a note in the name of Williams, with the money for the keep of the horses, and told me to let nobody have it, and not to let it be seen if I could help it, till he came or sent for it. I saw the same mare at the Plough, at Mile-end, on Saturday morning - I have since seen the four horses at a stable in Whitechapel, (I think the Nag's Head,) and knew them again: they were the same. Clark claimed the one which was left with me, as Batten's. Clark and Batten were present when I saw the four horses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the person who came with him? A. No. Most that was said was by the prisoner - I do not recollect the other person saying anything: I know the horses very well - I did not know them before; I believe them to be the same. He came for the mare next morning, and took it away with him; I knew him before, but did not know his name. On the Saturday the other horse was claimed; I delivered it to Clark; it was one of the three which the prisoner brought.</p>

            . I live in School-house-lane, Ratcliff, Middlesex. The prisoner, to the best of my belief, is the man who came on the 18th of March, in company with another, and brought two black cart horses; he said he understood I wanted to buy two, and he thought they would suit me; I looked at them, and thought they might suit me; he said I might take them, and put them to any work I liked for two hours; I said I always expected to have them on two or three days trial - he said he had heard my character, and was not afraid to trust me, and I should have the trial if I gave him 10 l., and when he came up from the country he would call for the rest, or return the money if I did not like them; we were to meet at the Red Lion, public-house, in the evening, to tell him how I liked them; I went there about seven or eight o'clock, but did not meet him or his companion - I went again next day, but did not see them. I saw a notice up in that public-house, offering a reward of 20 l. for some stolen horses. They never came to me for the horses or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190007"/>money. Clark claimed them on the Saturday morning, and the prosecutor claimed them; I delivered them up by the Magistrate's order, to Jeffries and Judge, the officers, in the prosecutor's presence.</p>

On the 3d of May, about twelve or one o'clock, I retired to bed, and after being in bed some time, I was disturbed by hearing the sashes of the parlour window make a noise - I was sleeping on the sofa in the parlour, as my apartment was let, and I was only going to remain in town a few days; I thought it might be the wind, but was disturbed a second time by the same noise; I still thought it might be from some natural cause, and took no further notice, and in about ten minutes I heard it a third time, and in a few seconds the sash flew up with a crash. I got off the sofa, took up the poker, proceeded to the window, and found the sash was thrown up above the space of three inches, and the fastening broken off, and on looking out of window I saw three persons proceeding towards Bury-street; the window shutters had not been put quite to; there was a large crevice, by which means I could see, as the gas light was very strong there - I saw three men turn down towards Bury-street; I determined to watch and afterwards heard a noise of footsteps on the pavement - I looked out and saw a person on the opposite side of the way, and two passing on the same side of the way as myself; I still kept on the watch and shortly afterwards one of them came back, and I saw him with his hand on the window; he threw the sash up rather higher; he then retired and shortly afterwards I saw two others - one of them pushed the venetian blinds back against the shutters, which threw them some distance open; I then saw a very strong light which proceeded from a small lantern, and after a few seconds they retired; they again returned and threw the sash still higher; the light again appeared in the room; they retired - returned a third time, and threw the sash completely up, and the shutters were thrown back with great violence; they are inside shutters; the light was thrown forward so that I saw part of a hand and arm holding the lantern (I was standing in the recess of the other window at the time;) this convinced me that the person must be inside, and I immediately made a blow at the arm with the poker, which fell on the lantern - part of the glass fell inside the room, and the lantern was found in the area, and part of the glass on the pavement; I immediately called out "Stop thieves!" putting my head out of window, and immediately heard a rattle spring in St. James's-street, and a voice calling out, on my left, in Bury-street, "Where?" and almost at the same moment I saw a watchman running round from Bury-street; he was pursuing somebody; I could see to the end of Ryder-street, which does not extend above fifty yards from the house; I got out of the window, and just as I got over the railing I saw a man running back from St. James's-street towards me - one of the watchmen called to him to stop - he stopped for two or three seconds, and the watchman attempted to lay hold of him - he rushed by - I immediately pursued myself, and came up with him in Bury-street, telling him to stop or I would knock him down with the poker; he stopped and said "What is it for? what is the matter?" I said I would explain that hereafter; the watchman came up, took him by the collar, and said "This is he;" it was the prisoner; on returning I picked up a hat close to the railing, also a piece of very thick glass, which I imagine to be part of the bull's eye of the lantern; I went into the house, put on my clothes, and went to the watch-house; he gave his name there as John Tuck; when I returned from the watch-house the dark lantern was found in the area - when he was taken he had a seal-skin cap on.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose arm you saw put in you do not know? A. No, his arm was within the room, the shutters protruded full 22 inches from the sash windows - the lantern was beyond the shutter or I could not have seen it, for I was in the recess of the other window; I saw the hand - part of the arm must also have been in; I advanced two or three steps before I gave the blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Who did you take your apartment from? A. Martha Wisdom - her sister lives with her - their father is living but not in the house at this time - my clothes were entirely off - I had been asleep - I had not been drinking that evening; I heard the clock strike three some time after the transaction began; the first noise I heard was about half-past two - the house is on the left hand side going from St. James's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state to the Magistrate that you concealed yourself in the corner to see if any body came in?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190008"/>A. No, I said in the recess of the window, which is about two feet from the window where the lantern was put in. Until the shutters were forced in I only saw through the space occasioned by their not being put close too; I could distinguish a person through that crevice quite plain - I know his person but not his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that man a hat on? A. I did not take particular notice of that - it was not day-light - there was a strong gas-light, and a light from the moon - the shutters were thrown back with great violence the last time - I felt convinced some person must actually be in the room by the lantern being so far in - the shutters made a great noise - I had come home about twelve at night; I had been in company with some gentlemen - I had been with a friend from the country in Ryder-street - I did not expect him to come to me next morning, for he went off into the country by the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there day-light enough, without the gas or the moon, to discern the face of any body? A. Certainly not - when the shutters were opened I put my body out of window at once, and saw three men, two running towards St. James's-street, and one laying under the window - he had a hat on; I saw one watchman coming from Bury-street; the man under the window jumped up and ran off - I cannot say whether the watchman saw him - I was looking towards St. James's-street, and cannot say how far the watchman was off. I called out Thieves! stop thief! and the prisoner came running back from St. James's-street, towards me; a watchman was pursuing him. I am certain he is the man; he stopped for a second or two, and spoke to Adams, the watchman, who was calling to him to stop - he rushed by him towards me, and passed me - I did not stop him because I could not - I wished to stop him without doing him an injury - I stopped him myself afterwards in Bury-street; I did not see the hat tried on his head at Marlborough-street to my recollection. I am in no business; I have lodged with Miss Wisdom, backward and forward, for four years; I used to farm an estate in Bedfordshire, and have sufficient to live on.</p>
               <p>MARTHA WISDOM. I live at No. 5, Little Ryder-street, and rent the house. Neither my father nor sister have any interest in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there not a lease of it? A. Yes, it is in my name only - I pay the rent to Mr. Humbey - he does not give a receipt in our joint names.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Little Ryder-street is in the parish of St. James's. On the 3d of May, about 3 o'clock, I heard a cry of Thieves! watch! I turned round and ran in a direction of the sound, and saw a gentleman without hat or coat, jump out of this parlour window, and saw a man, with a fur cap on, run towards St. James's-street as fast as he possibly could - I joined in the pursuit, and in St. James's-street, by my calling Stop thief! he was turned back by another watchman; he could not run down St. James's-street as other watchmen were coming up at the springing of the rattle, and he came into Little Ryder-street again - I made a catch at him, just touched his collar - he swore a heavy oath, threw himself aside, and ran towards Bury-street, but being unable to get down there, as the watchmen were coming up, he turned to the left up Bury-street, towards Jermyn-street - I continued to pursue with the gentlemen, who got before him, with the poker in his hand, and told him to stop or he would knock him down; he turned again and I collared him till I got assistance. I had lost sight of him for a minute or a minute and a half, just as he turned out of St. James's-street into Ryder-street. I am certain he is the same person - he never changed his cap - I observed that he had a cap on when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you swear to the cap or the man? A. To the man; I have got a hat, which was tried on to the prisoner at Marlborough-street; it did not fit him; Enderby might have seen it tried on I dare say; he was at the office; it was not day-light when he was taken - I call it a good moon-light morning, and there was plenty of gas; I have the dark lantern, which was given to me.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. James's. I had began to call three o'clock on this morning, when I heard a person call out "Stop him, stop thief!" I saw a person running out of Little Ryder-street, across St. James's-street, towards Bennett-street, and pursued across towards him; he turned again as I nearly got up to him, and went into Little Ryder-street; I was springing my rattle all the time, and never lost sight of him till he was taken by the gentleman who gave the alarm; I returned from the watch-house and picked up a crow bar on the very spot where he turned out of St. James's-street - the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it day break? A. It was so light that I never lost sight of him, by the light of the moon and gas; I cannot say whether it was day-light - it might appear so; I said at the office that the day was breaking; I never said it was broad day-light.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The witness swore positively that it was day-break.</p>

            . I work at the Three Cups, Aldersgate-street. On the 15th of April, between five and six o'clock, I saw the prisoners in Wood-street - another man was with them; they were following the prosecutor's waggon, on the pavement; Warren stopped, and pointing to a house, said to the third person. "I am going there on Saturday morning;" I had seen them all three before. I told the carman my suspicions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How soon afterwards did you see either of the prisoners? A. About half-past six o'clock, and on the 26th I saw Warren in Goswell-street - I did not know where he lived; he was moving goods in a truck, and was taken that day.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutors' service. I was following Hitch's waggon, and met Thrale in Wood-street, and from what he said I followed the waggon down Wood-street, and before I got to London-wall, it turned into Whitecross-street; I had a cart myself, and when I came into Fore-street I saw a man going down the street with a truss; Warren came up, hit him on the shoulder, and told him to go on; I kept running after the man with the truss, and at the corner of Grub-street he threw it down and got away. The prisoner Henry came and shoved me away from him, to keep me from catching him; I am certain of Henry - he said, "You *** what have you to do with it?" I turned round, and secured him directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain of Warren? A. I really believe him to be the man.</p>

            . I live in Weymouth-street. On this evening I saw the prisoners in Fore-street - my attention was first attracted by Warren saying to another man, who had a truss on his shoulder, "Go on," in a hurried manner; I looked at them, and as I turned to go on Underwood was in pursuit, and Henry was behind him; Underwood got up, and a scuffle ensued between him, the man with the truss, and Henry; the truss was thrown down - the man got away: Henry was scuffling with Underwood. I cannot say whether Warren was near then.</p>

               <p>MR. LEE conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>MR. JOSIAH ROBERT HARRISON. In the year 1819 I was in possession of one hundred sets of prints from the original plates of Hogarth; there were one hundred and eight in each set; they were delivered by the printer to my friend Williams<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190010"/>- I found them at his premises, where I had directed them to be sent - I examined, and collated them there, with the assistance of the witness Steeds; they were in a ware room, which I frequently went to, and were removed in December, 1821, by the carrier, to Thornton-heath, near Croydon, where I resided; I saw the bundles from time to time, but whether they were correct or not I could not tell, not having occasion to examine them - I moved from there to Brixton in October or November, 1823, and they were moved in a caravan, and were constantly under my observation till May 1824, when I counted the bundles, and found the number of bundles correct, but on opening them I found eleven bundles contained five sets instead of six - I have never seen them since. I inquired about the trade if such impressions had been offered for sale - the retail price was twenty guineas a set, and the wholesale price 15 l. 5 s.; I never sold a set under that price - there were no sets in the market at any time, except two, which I sold to Mr. Wilkinson, and I have since had them back. On the 30th of April I saw the prisoner, and told him I understood he had delivered four or five sets of Hogarth's prints, to Mr. Harding, for sale, and begged to know where he got them from; I said nothing whatever to induce him to confess. In answer to my question he said they were my prints, and that he took them from my parcels.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When you saw him he was in Newgate? A. No, at his own house in Great Bell-alley, Coleman-street; I told him I had been robbed, and understood he had sold four or five sets, and said, "Bannantine, as it is said you have done so, pray tell me how you got them."</p>
               <p>Q. Were you desirous of discovering the receiver? A. My object was to discover all who were concerned; I had no suspicion then who the receiver was: I have now.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your object now to prosecute the receiver if you can find him? A. That will depend upon circumstances. Dixon, the printer, delivered the prints at Mr. Williams's, by my order; I put no mark on them: there are no others like them; we can distinguish them from other impressions by the colour of the paper and ink. I can swear to both.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Harrison's employ. In July 1819, I received these prints - I ticked off Mr. Dixon's bill (which I produce) when they were delivered, and if I found one impression more that was stated in the bill, I put it down in pencil. I found one hundred complete sets, and some odd prints; I collated them all at Mr. Williams's, in Cornhill, and tied them in parcels of six sets each - I could tell them from any other impressions, both from the ink and paper. I was in the house of Messrs. Boydell and Co. eight or nine years - I never knew these impressions sold for less than 15 l. 5 s. in the trade. The prisoner was Mr. Williams's shopman; the prints were at the top of the house at first, but afterwards moved down to where he had access. I know these prints by the colour of the ink, the paper, and method of printing - I produce a set.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know where they came from? A. From Dixon's, who printed them; I did not see them delivered: I found them at Mr. Williams's, and collated them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did these come from to night? A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were these produced before the Magistrate? A. I did not examine them; there were some there bound in a similar manner. Both the sets which I have examined are undoubtedly two of what were at Mr. Williams's.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. How can you take on yourself to say that? A. The colour of the paper and appearance altogether convince me of it.</p>

            . I am a copper-plate printer, and was employed by Mr. Harrison, who bought these plates of Messrs. Boydell and Co.; I printed one hundred copies from these original plates, by his direction; there might have been one or two over, but they were all sent: we sometimes have an accident, and do not like to send a bad impression. I cannot identify them by this light, as my eyes are not good.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not print them with your own hands? A. No. I looked them all over; I am sure there was not two extra copies taken, for I saw them taken off the press; it could not be done behind my back.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. When prints of such consequence are entrusted to you, you exercise more than ordinary care about them? A. Oh! Yes. I have been a printer forty years.</p>

He was taken before he got out of sight.</p>

I saw the prisoners in Worship-street, about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock at night, on the 25th of April, both carrying a piece of wood; I asked what they were going to do with it - they both said to take it to Mr. Bonner's premises - I let them go, but soon afterwards I heard it was stolen; I went to Mr. Bonner's, and found the wood inside the door: he is a willow weaver: I am certain it is the same wood as I saw the prisoners with. About half-past one o'clock I saw them in company again, in Long-alley; I knew them before, and have no doubt of their persons: I took them into custody with assistance, and charged them with taking the wood; they said, "What wood?" I said they would hear more about it; one of them had a smock-frock on - the other had a black coat.</p>

I am quite certain of his person; he had the same dress on then as he has now.</p>

            . I belong to the Irish charity school. I was at play with Kennifie, and about fifty other boys. I saw the three young men come across the field; the prisoner got upon the cow-house, and pulled off a board - he then got in; I saw him come out with a bundle, tied in a blue silk handkerchief; he threw it down, and fell on it - then took it up, and walked away - one of the boys cried Stop thief! and one of his companions threw a stone at him.</p>

I saw a light in the stable yard, and when the watchman came at twelve o'clock I gave information, and they were taken in a few minutes.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I received information from Knight, and got assistance. I placed some watchmen to prevent persons coming out of the premises; I then went to Breedon's house, and got the key; I opened the door: we rushed in, and found the two prisoners in a cart, which was tilted up; Cox and myself stepped up to secure them: they made a rush, got on the top of the cart, and then on the tiles - I went round a court, and heard a great crash of tiles, and in a few minutes Atkins appeared on the top of a wall; I said, "You may as well come down;" he threw down twenty-three bricks at me, as fast as he could - one of which struck my hat; I stooped down; he thought I had fallen - he then made a bolt, and got down; I followed, and overtook him: I found some picklock keys on him. I took him back to the stable, where we found, in a bag, eight fowls, just killed, and a dark lantern; we went up the steps of the loft where the fowls had been kept, and the padlock had been forced off with the handle of this brush, which has some red paint on it, and their hands were covered with the same paint.</p>

On Monday there was a pair missed, which I had seen safe that morning. On Tuesday I saw him with them on his feet.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner on Wednesday, in consequence of information I received from Toole - he said he was going on an errand, and could not stop: I took him to the watch-house: he said he bought the shoes of a man in the street, and then of a man in the fields.</p>

I said, "To the Green Man:" he said, "I will give you 6 d. to carry this basket;" I, being a poor lad, took it to carry. He went on about ten yards, and then told me to go up to the top of the lane, and I should see his brother, and to tell him to come to him; I left the basket by his side, and ran up the lane, when a man stopped me.</p>

Check, whom I knew before, came to my shop on the 20th of April, with a bundle of wood in his hand, which he offered for sale, at 4 s. a hundred; I said I did not want any - he then offered me some smaller wood, but I did not have any; he asked for some tobacco, but I had not got the sort he wanted; he then went away, and I went into an adjoining room; in about two minutes I heard somebody in the shop, and saw him going out at the door; I came into the shop again, when he turned back, and asked for a quarter of an ounce of returns tobacco; I said, "What business have you in the shop - you have stolen something:" he said he had not. I went to the door, and saw my soap laying at the door; I cried Stop thief! he took his coat under his arm, and ran, and cried Stop thief! too; he was stopped by some working people. The soap had come in that morning, and was laying by the counter.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. On the 14th of April I found two cheeses inside the prisoner's pockets; he said he was a carpenter at work at Brewer's quay: I said I would take him back to see if all was right; he said, "Oh! No, never mind;" I took him back, and Mr. Day spoke to the cheeses. I saw a great number in the warehouse, of the same mark and appearance.</p>

I stopped the prisoner coming on shore in a little boat belonging to the Albion; he said he belonged to the Princess Charlotte: I went to a vessel he described; they said he did not belong to it: he then pointed to another, but he did not belong to that. I found the Albion the next morning, and showed the watch to the mate. I had taken it from the prisoner.</p>

I brought him into the house, and said to my men, who were at work, "Here is my basket of tools," and while I went to get a pair of shoes on he got away into the Harrow-road; he took up two stones, and swore he would kill any man who came near him; at last we got him into the fields - three farmer's men came up, and we got him on his back and secured him; a man came up who had been an officer, and handcuffed him, and as we were bringing him along he begged for a pint of beer: when he got that he ran away like a shot; I pursued him, and took him in about three quarters of an hour; he had the County dress of the prison on him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long might he be in your presence rolling up the lead? A. About ten minutes. It<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190021"/>was not laid flat as it had been before. I was about four hundred yards from him when I first saw him.</p>

            . On Saturday morning, the 23d of April, I saw the prisoner come out of the premises at half-past four o'clock, with a basket of tools - he said he was going to a job of work in the brick fields, to cut up some planks - that it was his master's job, and not his own. On the Monday, when Mr. Brown told me he was in the watch-house, I found him there, and said to him, "You rogue, if I had known you to be a thief, I would have taken you" - he made no reply.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live at No. 43, Duck-lane, opposite to the prosecutrix. On Monday night Harlow told me what had happened; I had seen the prisoners come out of her passage door, about a minute and a half before; I knew their persons before, but not their names; I did not see them go in, only come out; Royston held his coat, as if he had something heavy in it: I went after them in consequence of what Harlow said; I lost sight of them. I shut up my shop, and went after them again, and found them sitting on the pavement in Orchard-street; the watchman took them: I went to the watch-house, and saw 2 s. 4 d. is halfpence and pence found on Royston, some in his breeches, and some in his coat pocket; he said he got the money in St. James's, by holding gentlemen's horses - nothing was found on Flowers. Harlow's house is in the parish of St. John the Evangelist, Westminster.</p>

On the night in question I was calling eleven o'clock, and just by Cat's-head-court I saw them sitting on the curb stone, eating sheep's head and bread; I crossed over, and asked what they were doing there; they said they would get up and go directly: I told them to go instantly. One got up, and threw the bread and sheep's head into the other's lap; in about half a minute Hunt called out, "Stop those two boys;" I stopped Royston first, and the other ran away; I left Royston with Hunt, then followed, and took Flowers - I searched them at the watch-house, and found 2 s. 4 d. in Royston's trowsers and coat pockets; the constable of the night asked how he came by the halfpence - he said he got them in St. James's-street, by holding horses.</p>

I found that brandy had been taken from one of my vats, and have since ascertained that about six gallons were taken - it cost 24 s. a gallon.

A third man (Mills) came up before them, with a can and basket in his hand; I saw all three come out of the cellar: I collared Mills with the can and basket, and tussled with him - we both<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190023"/>fell into the kennel, and the liquor was spilled. I heard the bottles in the basket break, and the liquor flew out of the can over me; we both got up, and at that instant Smith returned, and gave me a violent blow on the side of my head, by my ear and cheek - it appeared to be done by some weapon, but what I could not tell; it was not with his fist: the blow knocked me down again, and I let go of Mills.

            . I am a watchman of Mary-le-bone. On the 23d of April, about four o'clock in the morning, I heard an alarm, ran into King-street, springing my rattle, and found Healy all over blood; I looked round, and found a basket with a whole bottle, and about seven broken ones in it, just by the cellar flap; the prisoners were brought back by Robinson and Muett. A great deal of liquor was spilled on the pavement. Day begins to break about half-past three o'clock in April. Healy said positively that the prisoners were the men - that one struck him, and the other was the man he took hold of, and Edmonds said they were the men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SMITH. Q. You recollect that it was a very wet morning? A. It was not wet at all, nor was it very dark.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 23d of April I heard a rattle spring - I came out of Bryanstone-mews, across George-street, and saw the two prisoners come out of Brown-street, both running towards me; one had a milk can: when they came up to me they looked very pale, and much out of breath; I held my stick up, and stopped them; they asked what I stopped them for - I said I had heard a rattle spring; they said they were going about their business, and I had no right to stop them, I sprang my rattle; they started from me, and ran off; I followed, and Robinson stopped them, before they got out of my sight; we took them to the King's Head, public-house; Healy immediately said he could swear to them: he was bleeding very much, on the stones - it was rather a damp morning.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I assisted in taking the prisoners to the King's Head; Mills had this can; I found a basket close by the cellar flap, with six broken bottles in it, which smelt of Sherry - part of one had some left in it; the pavement was wet, and smelt of brandy and wine. The morning was neither wet nor dry.</p>
               <p>EDWARD WORDLY. This basket was in my cellar the night before - I have no mark on the bottles: I have tried the strength of the brandy left in the can; it corresponds exactly with mine: the can is not mine. I lost three dozen of Sherry, worth 8 l. 2 s.</p>
               <p>SMITH'S Defence. I was going to Southwell; I came down King-street, and saw my fellow prisoner in contact with that man, who held him by the throat, and was kicking him - I said, "Don't ill-use him;" he kept ill-using him, and I hit him across the face with my stick, and ran away, but know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>MILL'S Defence. I was going to work at Mr. Gardener's - I turned into the corner for a necessary purpose - this man seized me, and said, "What are you doing here?" he began kicking me; my shins are not well now. Smith knew nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HEALY. The two who first came out of the cellar were Smith and the one who has escaped.</p>

On the 19th of April, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I was behind the counter, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner pane of the window for a minute or two; he then dashed his hand through the glass and broke the square to pieces. I immediately ran out - he was running and turned down a court four doors off, and through several courts; I at last took him in Stanhope-street; I only lost sight of him in turning the corners; I am sure he is the man; I collared him - he said it was only a window broken, and I could not take him, but I detained him; he immediately took off his hat and said "Here is what you want, take it;" giving me this silver chronometer in a mahogany box; I knew it to be master's; our shop ticket is on it now; I had seen it in the window, about an inch from the broken pane, a quarter of an hour before; we have had it six months; I did not see him take it; I produce it - it is marked eighteen guineas; it is worth 10 l.; my master and his family were in the house all the time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not swear at the office that I had a glove on when I broke the window? A. I do not think I did - you had one in your hand as I took you to the watch-house, but when you were searched you had not got it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was going towards Drury-lane between seven and eight o'clock on this morning - I saw several people running, and heard a cry of Stop him! I found the prisoner in custody - Frost had the property in his hand. I searched the prisoner's hat, and some pieces of glass dropped out; I compared them with the window - they corresponded, and appeared to have formed part of that pane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. From the witness's evidence he stood some distance from the pane, and spoons hung in the glass-case; it is for you to decide whether he could have a distinct view of me: he only momentarily lost sight of me. Now, while I turned the corner could I possibly put the property into my hat? I was passing up a court - a person ran against me, and shoved me; my hat fell off: the watch and case fell down from him; I picked them up, put them into my hat, and ran off - when I was taken I gave it to him; distress made me do that. I had witnesses yesterday to prove I did not break the window.</p>

On Thursday evening, the 5th of May, I left my reticule in my kitchen; it contained five sovereigns and a few shillings: the prisoner was in Mr. Butcher's kitchen, which joins mine, and there is a window between them. I have a servant of my own. I returned for my reticule in four or five minutes, and took it up stairs, but did not examine it till next morning, when I missed four of the sovereigns, and the silver. I was present on Saturday, when her box was searched, and some things of mine found, which I had lost before.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I believe Mr. Butcher's house is in St. James's parish - it is near the Colonade, below King-street chapel. On Saturday, the 7th of May, I went to Mr. Butcher's, searched the prisoner's box, and found two handkerchiefs and some muslin. While we were searching the prosecutrix's servant I saw the prisoner doing something, which caused my suspicion; I went to her - she went from me to go up stairs, but I stopped her on the stairs, and found, wrapped up close in her hand, in a cap, 15 s. 6 d., and three sovereigns in a rag; I asked how she came by it - she said, "I found four sovereigns on the press bedstead the night before last, and yesterday changed one to pay 4 s. 6 d. for a pair of shoes." I found the new shoes in her box.</p>
               <p>MISS PATON. I know this cap and the other articles - I have no mark on the sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the Court.</p>

On Saturday, the 26th of February, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was going through Islington turnpike, and saw two men on two brown or bay horses - one with a darkish snuff or brown coloured coat, and the other with a dark blue or black coat; one horse appeared to me to be higher than the other - one had a snaffle bridle, and the other a chaise or coach bridle, with a white rosette in the centre. I thought they were gentlemen's servants, exercising their horses, and were in a hurry, as they trotted very sharp; they were coming towards town. I saw Brooks and Yaxley on the 17th of May, at Worship-street, and think they are the men, but will not swear positively to them; I did not know the horses.</p>

I afterwards went home, and hearing a noise at the top of my street, I turned my head round, and saw Yaxley (who I can swear is the one who was on the grey pony at the Artichoke) with another taller man and a boy - they were quarrelling about a horse-cloth which was on the grey pony, at the top of the street; nobody was then on it: Yaxley spoke across the pony to the boy, and he gave the horse-cloth up to the man immediately; they directly went towards Jones's stables - I only saw the pony then.</p>

I am positive of Harper and Yaxley, but rather doubt about Brooks; they were drinking rum and milk, and Brooks, if he is the man, was laying down. About six o'clock that evening I met four men, all on horse-back, at Bethnal-green turnpike, going towards Shoreditch; one was on a grey pony - one appeared to be a coach horse: the other two did not appear so tall as that - Harper and Yaxley are two of them - I particularly noticed them; one of them was on the grey pony, and I believe Brooks to be the man who was on the large horse.</p>

            . Yaxley's father took a stable in my yard, Dog-row, Bethnal-green, nine or ten months ago. - On Saturday, the 26th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I was going to Old Ford, and as I went out I saw some person ride a bay horse down the yard - I did not take notice of him. I was absent all day, and came home about 6 o'clock in the evening. Yaxley's father owed me two guineas for rent - I took a broker to the stable, and found two horses there; I think the bay horse was one: the rent was brought that night by a woman, and the horses were taken away while I was in my kitchen. After they went away I found a bridle hanging up, and took it in doors - it was given up to the officer by my wife (looking at one;) this resembles it: I recollect there were the letters T. A. J. on it, in the same place as on this. I saw a bridle similar to it on the grey horse when it came into the yard.</p>

I have known Yaxley about six months; he used to clean the horses in the stable: I remember seeing him up my father's yard, about a month ago, with a grey pony, on a Saturday - I saw him on the same day with a brown horse, which he rode away, between eleven and twelve o'clock; I did not see him again: I saw a bridle in the stable -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190026"/>my father brought it in doors; I saw my mother give it to the officer - I know it to be the same.</p>

            . I am a horse-dealer, and live at Ipswich. On Monday, the 28th of February I had been out; I came home about eleven o'clock, and found my lad cleaning a bay horse in my stable; a man named Cutmore came into the stable in about half an hour; I bought it of him for 37 l. - I had known him for ten years before - he said he lived by the Regent's-canal. Mr. Jeaffreson's servant claimed it. I have not seen Cutmore since.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COLSON re-examined. I found one horse at Smith's; he had about two joints taken off his dock, and the hairs of a white star taken out of his forehead - I am positive it is one of master's - this bridle is also his.</p>

I saw two parcels of corn within about two rods of the gate, and traced the horses feet on to the forest. One was a light brown gig horse, with a rat tail; the other a dark brown muzzled saddle horse - I have known them for eight or nine years, and always looked after them.

The horses were quite warm - one had a saddle, and the other a halter on - they appeared to have come a good way. The man said, "Give them half a peck of corn a piece, and that will do for the night;" Yaxley did not speak: the other man said he should want them at ten o'clock in the morning, and I was to put the saddle on the same horse.

I answered; and after the door was opened two persons came and pushed me into the passage - the landlady had gone up stairs - the prisoner held me while the other took my watch from my fob and ran off with it; I tried to go after him, but the prisoner still held me to prevent my pursuing; I saw the other turn the corner of Sandy-street, and when he had got away I held the prisoner, and cried out Stop thief! a milk-man came and helped me to take him to the watch-house; he never got out of my hold. I charged him at the watch-house with assisting the man in robbing me of my watch - the milkman was not present when the watch was taken; I never let go of the prisoner, and am certain he is the man who held me - it was a silver hunting watch, worth 30 s., and had a chain and keys, attached to it.

About five minutes - I told him as soon as I saw which way they went; I had two friends with me who rather checked my giving information - I took some time to consider of it; the prisoner was searched at my suggestion - I had seen the other receive the handkerchief; I might have informed the prosecutor in two or three minutes; I told him as soon as I could - I had lost my own handkerchief not three minutes before.</p>

On the 5th of April I was coming from Smithfield into Duke-street, and saw two boys at Jones's shop window, one of them laughed and turned to the shop, holding his apron up, as if to receive something - I turned my head and saw the prisoner come out of the shop with this Dutch cheese in his hand - I stopped him with it, and gave it to Jones's mother.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He caught hold of me and said a cheese was gone. I said I did not take it.</p>

On the 6th of May I missed some articles from my apartments in the house of Mr. Steitman - the prisoner lived there, and I spoke to him about searching his box - I went with him to his room and saw his box - he tried several keys on a bunch, but they would not open it; a carpenter was then sent for and the box was open; I found there a shirt, a silk handkerchief, and a neckcloth, which I had not missed, but they were mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the box unlocked the second time you saw it? A. Yes; any person can have access to the room; it is not locked - there are twenty-three scholars in that house.</p>

Silburn was present, but she did not say any thing to us. I left her then with her master for a short time - when I returned I was directed to have Donahoo up, and I desired her to point out her box, which Mr. Cuff opened and partly searched, but did not find any thing of his; he then asked for the key of a box which stood in the corner, which she said she had sold to the other prisoner. Mr. Cuff gave me some keys which came from Donahoo's box and with one of them I opened that box; I found about thirty plates, saucers, and glasses, which were wrapped up in various articles to prevent their breaking. Donahoo said, she knew nothing about them; I locked up the box and went for an officer.</p>

I then asked if she had any objection to my searching - she said she had not; and while I was searching a box she came and took this pocket-book out of it, and sat down by the fire. I went on searching and when I turned round, I saw her doing something at the fire-place. I went up to her, and found this bundle in her left hand, with a gown thrown over it which I had laid on the table: I asked what was in the bundle - she said she did not know, that a woman had left it there, and she did not know who she was: she then gave me this pocket-book, and I found in it twenty-eight pawnbrokers' tickets - four of them are for these articles; I took her into custody, and when the man came to see her I took him.</p>

On the 12th of May I saw the prisoner in company with two others, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, at Mr. Brown's window, in Ratcliff-highway - I watched them some time, and saw the prisoner bring something across the street, and go to a boy who stood at the corner of a street. I still watched, and saw the prisoner beckon to the boy, and put the articles in his hat - as the prisoner was going away I stopped him, and found the black silk handkerchiefs in his hat.</p>

The prisoner worked for me about a fortnight - he called on the 18th of April, and staid about an hour; about half an hour after he was gone I missed the scissors, and when I left work at night I missed a black silk handkerchief. Next morning I took the officer, and found him in bed; the officer found the scissors in his pocket - he was taken to the watch-house, and there stated that the handkerchief was in pawn at Mr. Baylis's, in Hampstead-road; that he had pawned it, but did not take it. I had left him in my room while I went to tea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you a shop-boy of the name of Henry? A. Yes; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Henry owe the prisoner 1 s., and they changed scissors for the 1 s.? A. No.; they did not. -

We then went down stairs again, and found a man ill in bed; Way's husband was there: we found a key of my wine cellar in the bottom of a trunk. I had wine of various kinds -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190037"/>there was Port, orange, and currant: I afterwards missed some wine from my cellar. I had had eight or nine dozen of Port, and the orange and currant wine was on a shelf; I could see that the number of bottles had been diminished: I generally kept the key about me or in my desk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Can you tell exactly what number of bottles of orange and currant wine you had? A. Not exactly; I understand Mr. Way is a cow-keeper and milkman.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Thursday, the 14th of April, the prosecutrix applied at the office, and I went to Chequer-alley, Whitecross-street, and found the three prisoners there; I charged them with this - they denied all knowledge of it; I believe Glanfield keeps the house, and the others lodge there. I saw a trunk there, and after I had threatened to break it open Glanfield gave me the key; I opened it, and found the greater part of the property, and some duplicates; the prosecutrix found two caps of her's in the yard: she said they were her's, and Hickey and Orrigan abused her very much - I thought they were going to lay violent hands on her; but before the Magistrate Hickey stated that she had a pair of stockings on, and a shift, which were her's. I went again next day, and found this basket; and on Sunday morning I found these shoes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do you know that Glanfield lives there? A. I believe so; but I was never there before.</p>

I saw the prosecutrix find the two caps, wet, on the line, and the other articles now found. On the Friday morning, when I went to take the prisoners to the Police Office, I said there was shift, a pair of shoes, and pattens, which had not been found - Hickey said she had got the shift on; she took it off; I then asked where the pattens and shoes were, and Glanfield said if I went to the house and searched a coal cupboard I should find them - I went and found the pattens; the shoes were found on the Sunday morning.</p>

My house and the next are both in a yard, enclosed by one gate, but there is an inner gate, which leads to no house but mine; after passing that gate there is a yard leading to the scullery and the front kitchen. About ten minutes or a quarter past nine o'clock in the morning of the 4th of April, I heard that my plate was stolen; I then missed it - the plate is always counted up at night, and brought into my bed-room in a basket - it is a flat open basket; the servant fetched it about eight o'clock that morning. I have seen none of it since - the tea-pot was worth 9 l. or 10 l. an old silver. My house is in the liberty of Norton Falgate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure it is in that liberty? A. I understand so. I pay the taxes to a surveyor, who collects the rent. I am certain it is in that liberty; I saw the tea-pot in the basket when the servant fetched it; the spoons were covered with green baize - the basket has no cover.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Samuda. I am called Elizabeth. On the morning of Easter Monday, after getting breakfast ready, I went down to the kitchen. I had not noticed the plate basket; I was sitting in the back kitchen at breakfast, with my fellow-servants, a little after nine o'clock; the up-stairs bell rang and Maria Ward left the kitchen, and in two or three minutes I heard a kind of rattling noise at the back door - it appeared as if a basket was scraping against a brick wall; I called out "Who is there?" Maria had not left the kitchen more than two or three minutes; I ran to the back door, and saw the prisoner going out of the yard door with a great basket across his shoulder; the yard door only leads to master's premises; I knew the prisoner by having seen him four times before in master's yard; he had never asked if I wanted any thing, but if I asked what he wanted he said "I have come to see if you want any lemons." I had told him twice never to come there, for we never bought any thing at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him with the basket on his back what did you say? A. I was so alarmed I could not speak, but Hannah, another servant, called out "What do you want?" he turned, and looking very confused and pale, said, "I have come to see if you want any lemons;" at the same time pulling a lemon out of his jacket pocket; the basket he had was large enough to contain master's plate basket; it is a large one, such as carpenters carry; my fellow servant said "You know we don't want any, and you have been told never to come here again," and, before he could be out of hearing, she called out "Elizabeth where is the plate?" she ran and looked in at the door of the front kitchen, and said, "It is not there!" that did not take her a moment; the prisoner was then gone from the yard. I instantly ran after him, as quick as possible, but could not catch sight of him; I had steps to go up and to come down before I could get into the square - there are forty-four or forty-five houses in the square, and several turnings each way; I must have turned down the wrong street. If a person was selling lemons there were plenty of houses in the square where he would be likely to find customers; I have never seen the plate since - I had put all the plate (stated in the indictment), into the basket the night before (enumerating the articles); I carried them into master's bed-room at half-past eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in the service? A. Seven months. I was in the back kitchen when I first saw him - he was going out at the yard door, just stepping his foot up to go from the house; he had his foot on the step of the gate. I am house-maid, and had been employed up stairs that morning; some tradespeople had been there - the last person went out about half-past eight - my fellow servant could see a person coming down the yard as she sat at the window. He had a basket such<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190041"/>as I always saw him with - it was hung across his shoulder with a strap or string.</p>
               <p>Q. Must you not have seen him run across the square? A. I had several steps to go up, and a long yard to go through - he was full eight yards from me when I saw him - I was at the back door of the scullery - the nearest turning is forty or fifty yards from the outer gate.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the other servant go another way? A. Yes - his basket bulged out a great deal</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Samuda. I took the plate basket from his room at eight o'clock on this morning, and put it on the dresser, in the front kitchen, at a quarter past eight o'clock, and then got breakfast ready, and was sometimes in the front and sometimes in the back kitchen; the basket was always on the dresser; I had seen it there as late as five minutes past nine o'clock; a person could go by the back kitchen and get the plate; we were at breakfast, and the bell rang about ten minutes past nine o'clock - I had been up stairs about ten minutes, when I heard the plate was gone - my fellow servants had then returned from pursuing. I saw the tea-pot at the top of the basket - the rest was covered over with a baize. I took out nine tea-spoons and the sugar tongs about a quarter to nine o'clock - the rest was all safe then - I had been in the two kitchens all the morning, and had seen nobody come to the house to go into the kitchens.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there a window in the front kitchen? A. Yes - when you are at the back kitchen window, you can see a person pass to go to the front kitchen. I have been twelve months in my place; a person might come without my knowledge, when I was up stairs, but I do not think they could.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw the plate safe five minutes before you went to breakfast? A. Yes - the milk had been brought before that; while we sat at breakfast we could hear a person come down the steps, though we could not see them.</p>

            . I have been nine years in Mr. Samuda's service. I was at breakfast with Elizabeth on the morning of Easter Monday; something was said about a noise - I went to the kitchen door and saw the prisoner; I am convinced he is the man - I had seen him four times before, and had told him never to come again - because I once found him half-way into the scullery when I had shut the door, and he said he came to see if we wanted lemons - I said "No, we never buy at the door - never come again." On this morning, when I got to the kitchen door, I saw the prisoner going out of the yard door, with his basket across his shoulder - I said</p>
               <p>"What do you want?" he said "I am come to see if you want any lemons;" he was going from the house then - his foot was on the step, and his back towards me - he turned half round towards me, in a confused manner, when I spoke to him - his basket was very bulky, and I saw the handle of another basket pointing out of his basket; I turned round and said "Elizabeth, where is the plate?" I turned round to the kitchen door and said, "It is not there, run;" we both run out but could see nothing of him or any body else; I only ran through the square, and looked down Norton Falgate, then returned and told the family. The house belongs to the liberty of Norton Falgate. I saw the prisoner again that day three weeks at Worship-street - master had given information there; I had no doubt whatever of his being the man - I knew him the moment I saw his face - he was with other people, and his face was sideways to me at first, but I knew him again in a moment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had seen him before - did you ever miss any thing before? A. Never - I never saw him with more than one lemon. I had seen the plate in the basket on the dresser ten minutes before - nobody could have gone into the kitchen in that time because I was sitting at breakfast. When he must have come in I was reading a cookery book, or I must have seen him through the window - nobody could have passed before I took up the book, which I had done the moment before my fellow servant left the kitchen, or I should have seen him - I had been sitting there more than ten minutes. Hunt went after him rather before me - she was nearer to him than me. Vann took me to the office to see him - all the prisoners were let out into a yard - we were asked if it was either of them - four came out first - the prisoner was the fifth - he was not pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is there more than one window to the back kitchen? A. No - I sat near that window reading at the time Elizabeth said she heard the noise; we went to the door together - I turned back to the front kitchen door, to look for the plate - Elizabeth was then nearer to the street than I - we were both equally near to him when I saw the handle of the basket in his basket.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On Monday, the 4th of April, I received instructions, and in consequence of the description the servants gave me I apprehended the prisoner three weeks after, and told him at the office that it was on suspicion of robbing Mr. Samuda, in Spital-square, of a quantity of plate - he said "I don't know the house, and know nothing about it;" I found nothing but money and a new great coat on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he any lemons? A. No; he was dressed like a gentleman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you afterwards take the two servants to see him? A. Yes, with five other prisoners - they were all put out together, and they selected the prisoner - I had known him for two or three years - he is a farrier.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord - on the morning I was taken, I was in a public-house in Worship-street - Vann came and asked if my name was not so and so - I said "Yes;" I walked by his side to Worship-street - he went to the prosecutor and I was put into a back place.</p>

The prisoner had been in their service at a concern they have at Knightsbridge, and had left about two months - he had been to our house in the interval. On the 26th of April, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, he came to the shop and asked for Mr. Sewell - I saw them in conversation - he afterwards was talking with Brown, who is in our employ, and after that Mr. Sewell came into the warehouse, and said to him "If you are not engaged this evening you may as well come behind the counter and help us to straighten some prints, and have supper with us." Mr. Sewell went away and he told me he did not like to go behind the counter, because he was obliged to wear spectacles, and the young men looked at him so; I was called into the shop, and told Mr. Sewell he was not coming in; he told me to send him to him - I went and he told me to say he did not like to come in. Mr. Sewell afterwards came and asked him to come - he said he did not like - Mr. Sewell said "Never mind, come in about two hours, and then we will have supper; he said he would; Mr. Sewell left him, and as he went out I saw two parcels in his hand; he then ran off as hard as he could - I immediately ran after him and brought him back with the parcels - it was a paper of muslins which I had tied up in his presence a minute before.</p>

One sleeps at No. 44, and the other at No. 45 - both dine at the same table - it is one house, communicating in six places - the goods were in the warehouse which communicates with the shop - the muslin was on the warehouse counter when he came to speak to Mr. Sewell - I gave it to Cross.</p>

I think I asked him who it belonged to - I asked him to allow me to try it - he said "Ride it where you like;" I rode it about a mile, to Mr. Smith's, who I knew wanted one: I shewed it to Smith, then rode it back, and asked if he would go in harness - he said yes, I might try it, which I did, and bought it of him, with the saddle and bridle, for ten guineas. As I went out of the yard I saw a very respectable man who lived at Tottenham - he said he knew the prisoner, and I was satisfied that all was right. I went back to the public-house and paid him for it: we had some ale together - a person called me out and said something which rose my suspicions; I then told the landlord to keep his eye on him; I rode to his parents at Tottenham, and inquired of his mother about it, then returned, and gave him in charge - I went to Islington, and left word at Howe's about it; he came to me on Saturday and claimed it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Was the coach coming in one direction, and the man in another? A. He was crossing; he had an opportunity of seeing the coach some time, but he was an old man. There are five large gas-lights in the dials, which makes it very light - you could see to pick up a pin. I heard nothing said before the Magistrate about it being moon-light. He arose off his seat, sat down, and went on - he would have escaped if he could; he saw what he had done - I do not mean to say that he saw the man.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Bloomsbury-market. I was in the street, heard a coach coming behind me, and an alarm given, but could not distinguish any particular words; I looked round, saw the coach coming towards me at a fast trot, and the deceased on the ground - it was not coming at an uncommon pace; the streets are well lighted: if the coachman was sober and attentive it was quite light enough for him to see a man before his horses. When I first saw the coach he appeared to be in the act of pulling up, and just at that moment he arose, and looked over to where the deceased lay - the wheel had not then gone over him; instead of keeping the reins tight he loosened them; the horses went on, and the wheel went over the man's body; I did not hear him call out to the man: I did not see him attempt to whip his horses - he only loosened the reins, but when he found the coach had gone over him he whipped them, not to be detained.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At that time of night a man might drive fast at less danger? A. Yes. The street was thin of people; another man was on the box, but the prisoner had the reins.</p>

            . I live in Onslow-street. On the 22d of April, between eleven and three o'clock, I was in and out of Tencham's room, and saw the prisoner there; I had seen him in Peter-street about nine o'clock, with Tencham - both seemed very much intoxicated; the prisoner had a flannel jacket, but no coat on. Between eleven and twelve I saw him go into the house with Tencham, dressed as before; I went in, and saw them both sitting together; Tencham took a coat, trowsers, and handkerchief out of his box, and hung on the line; and between two and three o'clock, as I sat at dinner, the prisoner passed my window with the same coat on as I had seen Tencham put on the line; Brooks, who was in my room, went out to stop him - they were tussling together; she asked how he came by the coat - he said it was nothing to her. I went out, laid hold of him, and saw part of the handkerchief hanging out of his hat; Brooks took his hat off, and took it out; we forced him into Tencham's room, and Tencham said, "John, take my coat off," which he did. The coat and handkerchief were brought into my place. I was with Mrs. Tencham on the 23d, and met him on Saffron-hill - we gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the prisoner tipsy when he left the house? A. Not that I saw - Tencham was with him when he had it on, walking in a friendly manner.</p>

I paid for it and went away, leaving my brother with the boy, by the horse, to look after it. I had not given orders where to have it sent. I have a two-stall stable in Ham-yard, Great Windmill-street; I left my brother in care of it while I went to the Greyhound; and as I came back I saw the prisoner riding away with it - I knew his person before by seeing him about the market - I saw him going up Duke-street on it; I had not time to speak to him; he was going quickly; he never brought it back; I have not found it since; I had neither given my brother nor the boy authority to dispose of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Who did you buy it of? A. I know the man by sight but not by name; I bought it in the market, and might have sold it directly, if a good price had been offered, but I had a customer at home who I thought it would suit.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry Stop thief? A. I did not know but my brother had sold it, thinking if he had got a good profit he might have let it go; most of the people had left the market; it was dusk - the light of the gas glanced on him; I could see him as plain as I can see your face; I had seen the horse for two hours before, but did not buy it till near eight o'clock; it was a light dapple grey horse, six years old, (reckoning to May,) about 15 hands and an inch high, had a cut tail, not very long, and had not been bishoped; it was about a half-bred horse, and in good condition; it had been fired; it had rather a violent cold, and I did not know whether it would get better or worse; I have seen the man I bought it of since; I did not perceive that it was lame; I should call it a lightish grey; I did not see the prisoner again till he was at Bow-street - I never dealt with him; I might be thirty or forty yards from the horse.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother. I saw him buy this horse about eight o'clock, or a little after - he paid for it and went away, telling me to wait with it till he came back; it was dusk; I cannot say where he went; I gave the horse into the hands of a boy to hold by the halter when my brother was gone; it had no bridle or saddle. I knew the prisoner before by sight; about half-past eight he came round to me and looked at the horse, and asked me if it was for sale; I said I did not know, for I was waiting for my brother to come back; he asked me to let him see the horse go; I rode it up and down two or three times; he said that would do, and asked me to go and take a drop of gin with him; I declined at first, saying I could not leave the place as my brother might return and miss me; I afterwards agreed to go and take a drop of porter with him, at the first public-house in Long-lane; I gave the horse into the boy's hands to mind, and then went with the prisoner; I stood with the public-house door in my hand, to look after the horse while I drank; as it was a strange horse I thought it might get from the boy - after drinking with him he paid; he then asked if I had any objection to his riding the horse; I said "You have seen me ride him up and down, and therefore you cannot want any more;" he asked if I was afraid he should eat it, or ride away with it, and as soon as I turned from the door for a necessary purpose, he whipped the horse out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190046"/>the boy's hand, mounted and rode him off, and turned down Duke-street, towards Little Britain; I waited there for two hours, expecting he would bring it back, but have not seen it since; it was a grey gelding; I saw my brother pay 7 l. for it. I saw him at Bow-street two or three weeks after, and am sure of him; I knew him when he worked with Mr. Hall, of Gravel-lane, and cannot be mistaken in his person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him by name? A. Yes; I do not recollect ever speaking to him before. I could see the horse for fifty yards; I dare say it was half-past eight; I had seen him many times before; I thought he might give me the gin for my trouble in riding the horse to shew him; he did not ask the price of it, nor was any mentioned, as I had no order to sell it. It is two years since I knew him in Gravel-lane; he worked at Hall's stables. It was a light dapple grey horse, about fifteen hands high, and a short cut tail: it was not bishoped, nor its ears cut, and was six years old this month; I had it in my care about half an hour; it was a quiet horse, but I thought it might get his halter out of the boy's hand. I have not asked the prisoner for any money, nor did my brother ever tell me that he had; I know nothing about that; I believe they have offered something. I live at No. 20, Coal-yard, Drury-lane, and job at times.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner; I met him on Tuesday night, the 3d of May, about half-past nine o'clock, in company with another man, in Church-street, Brick-lane; I said nothing to him about this horse, not knowing any thing of it.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW to WILLIAM ROWLAND. Q. Where is the boy? A. He is not here; when I came back he was gone, and my brother was gone - he was a strange boy - I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you tried to get a little money about this? A. No, Sir - I certainly should have liked to have had my horse or the money - I never asked for any money - I have been asked by his relations to take money - I never offered to settle it for money - I do not know Elliot by name - I may know his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never offered, in his presence, to take money? A. Of course I would have taken the money, but I should have gone on with the prosecution - they offered me 7 l., which I said I would take for the horse; they proposed it, not me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not, in the presence of Elliott, Crane, or Rogers, proposed to take 7 l. for the horse? A. I should certainly have liked to have had the money, but they proposed it to me; I said I would take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, "How much will you give," or words to that effect? A. No. I said "If I take the money I shall expect 7 l. for the horse."</p>
               <p>CHARLES ROWLAND re-examined. Q. Did you take any steps to find the boy? A. Yes; he was gone in a moment: I gave him the penny as soon as I missed the horse, and then went after it, and the boy went - I did not ask his name or address - I could not find him out. I ran round the corner to look after the horse. I waited two hours for the prisoner; he never returned.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you make any offer to him at Bow-street? A. I did not; he made the proposal to me. I heard nobody offer to settle it with him at Bow-street, or at any other place.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Has he made this offer to any body else? Yes; they were in my company at a public-house over the way; he made the offer twice or three times in my presence and others, and said he was ashamed to bring the thing into Court.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say he made the offer at Bow-street, was that before your nephew was committed, or after? A. Before; I had not the presence of mind to tell the Magistrate of it. I thought my nephew was innocent.</p>

            . I live in the City-road. The prosecutor offered in my presence to give up this prosecution for money, yesterday, and this evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? A. I was asked by the prisoner's father to come to speak to the prosecutor, that he might lean to mercy.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor know you before? A. No. He said to me directly I was introduced to him, that he had no inclination to prosecute, and if I would agree to give him 5 l. he would not appear.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who introduced you? A. I do not know his name, but he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the person say who introduced you? A. He wished me to speak to him not to interfere any further than he could help - he said it was not his inclination, for the horse was of very little value. I was in Court when the prisoner's uncle was examined. The man who introduced me has just left the Court.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you to do with it? A. Nothing further than the father said he was distressed at his son's being in trouble, and would I speak to the prosecutor to lean to mercy - as he was in the habit of bringing goods to my shop, I said I would. I first asked Rowland if he had any case against the prisoner; he said, "Yes, I have, but my intention is not to go against him if I can settle matters with any one who will come forward and advance 5 l."</p>
               <p>Q. Now, before he said that, on your oath, had you not asked him if he would take money? A. No; I said it was a pity he had not some friends to come forward and advance it, but I had not the money about me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask whether he had really lost a horse? A. Yes; he said he had - that he only wanted the money for it, and did not intend to do any thing further if he could get the money. I do not know the attorney in this case. I live at No. 29, Anderson's-buildings, City-road, and keep the house.</p>

               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You went to him at the father's desire, and the prosecutor proposed, himself, to take the money? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BROOKS re-examined. I am a horse-dealer, and live in Ropemaker-street, Little Moorfields, on the first floor.</p>


               <p>MR. LAW. Q. It was at Bow-street that the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190047"/>himself proposed to give this up for money? A. Yes; he said,</p>
               <p>"I will take your note if you will promise to pay me 7 l."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He did not know you before? A. No; I suppose I might be pointed out to him - he came up to me.</p>

            . I am a stable-man, and lodge at No. 5, Chapel-street, Grub-street, Cripplegate. I worked for Mr. Rhodes, in the Borough, last, but am out of place now. I know the prisoner's father - he did not apply to me to interfere in this business, but I was standing outside the gate this afternoon, and the prosecutor agreed to take 7 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer that? A. It was offered to him by Mr. Cutts (See page 369,) and he offered to take it if the money was put into a persons hands who he could depend upon, and the man is outside who was to have it put into his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it refused? A. It was refused in one respect, because none was given.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prosecutor propose to take it? A. He agreed to it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you here? A. I came merely to hear how the case went on; I was here last night, and they were arguing about it then, at a public-house over the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were? A. Rowland and his brother - Elliott and William Brooks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you first hear Elliott and Brooks propose to him to make it up, or did he offer it to them? A. Elliott made the offer to give him 5 l. last night.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Before Elliott offered 5 l. had Rowland said any thing about 7 l.? A. No; he said he wished to have the whole of the money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was that before or after Elliott offered 5 l.? A. After-7 l. was mentioned as the whole, and today it was agreed that he should take 7 l. The offer to day was made by Cutts; he was at the public-house last night, but I do not think he was there when the offer was made; he was in the same box.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought you here? A. I was asked to come and state what I had heard; I know the prisoner's father very well, and was asked since five o'clock to come and state what I had heard. I came here to hear the trials, and happened to go to the public-house, as I knew the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a constable of the Thames Police. I saw the prosecutor in Watling-street, at twelve o'clock in the day - I saw the prisoner in company with two others, following him; I was on the opposite side of the way, and watched them; I saw them come near to Nunney, and saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from Nunney's right hand coat pocket - he tucked it into his trowsers: I am certain of it. I immediately ran across the road, and secured the prisoner in Budge-row; the others immediately ran away. When I laid hold of the prisoner he took the handkerchief out of his trowsers, and I took it out of his hand; I shewed it to Nunney, who asked me to give it to him, and let him go, but I kept it, and took him before the Lord Mayor. Nunney did not express a doubt about its being his. The prisoner had an old one in his hat.</p>
               <p>HENRY NUNNEY. I have no mark to recognise it by; I think I had one of this kind, but cannot say this is it; I never took particular notice of the pattern.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My father gave me that handkerchief. I was going on an errand when the officer took me.</p>
               <p>Five witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character; one of whom was his father, who stated that he had never seen the handkerchief.</p>

On the 11th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was on the Pavement, Moorfields, opposite to Albion chapel, and saw the prisoner there - she asked me to give her a glass of gin; I took her into a watering house opposite the chapel, gave her a glass of gin, and desired her to go about her business; I was sober; I had a bundle under my arm, containing a shirt, a coat, a waistcoat, and a pair of unmade trowsers; she turned one way, and I went towards London-wall, and stood against a wall for a necessary purpose; she came and took the bundle from under my arm, and ran away with it; I turned round, but lost her. I found her at the Mansion House four days after, with all the property; it was a very fine night: I am certain of her being the person I gave the liquor to. My face was towards the wall when the bundle was taken; I could only see that it was a female who took it.</p>

On the 11th of April, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came round into Broad-street-buildings, in a hurried manner - I told her it was no thoroughfare: she had a bundle under her arm, and the coat tail hung out of it. I followed her towards the gate, and asked where she came from; she said from Mr. Wilson's, in Bishopsgate-street - I asked what number - she said No. 10; I said Wilson's was No. 43, and took her to the watch-house. The bundle contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Dark. On the 20th of April I had been out about three o'clock, and as I came to the end of my master's window, I saw the prisoner come out of the shop, with the tea-caddy under his arm; I did not follow him: I saw him again on the Monday following, and think he is the man - he had a light fustian jacket and blue trowsers on. Nobody was in the shop.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Luke's. I was coming down Chiswell-street on Wednesday, the 20th of April, at twenty minutes past three o'clock, and met the prisoner with something wrapped in a handkerchief; I let him pass, and saw him turn down Whitecross-street, into a narrow passage, and then into Red Lion-market-place - he then put the bundle into his apron; I collared him, and asked what he had there - he said a tea-caddy, which a gentleman gave to him in Finsbury-square, to carry; I asked where to - he said to some street in Oxford-street: I detained him, and on the Friday following I found the owner. I found two skeleton keys on him; one of which opens Dark's door; he had a fustian jacket and blue trowsers on.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Sunday night, the 10th of April, I saw Bryant and the prisoner pass my box, at the corner of Compton-street, at twenty minutes past twelve; Bryant had the harness on his shoulder; I followed them and they said "It is all right, the man who gave us the harness is at the coach stand;" I said "Fetch him;" and Bryant went to fetch him, but did not return; I took the prisoner to the watch-house - he said he got it from Bryant - I have known them both from children.</p>

            . I am a scavenger at No. 12 wharf, Paddington. The prisoner came on the 21st of April to my house with another man, and brought three sets of harness in a cart, which they offered me for 4 l. - I considered it was worth 15 l. or 20 l., and detained him under pretence of getting change for a 10 l. note, while I sent for an officer, who took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was there not another person in company with the prisoner? A. Yes, but he ran away; the prisoner waited for the money as I told them I had sent for change for a 10 l. note; the night before they had brought me a bridle; the other man has been taken to Marlborough-street, and let go on his own recognizance: the prisoner was committed.</p>

I had been up all night; I was quite sober - the prisoner accosted me and I went with her to her lodging, and sent her for some gin; I remained in her room about five hours - I went to bed, and was partly undressed: I put the watch on the table, and desired her not to touch it; I awoke between ten and eleven o'clock, when I missed my watch, purse, and money - I asked if she had taken it - she denied it - the door was open and she was walking about the room; she went out - I followed her - she did not get far away from me; she was never out of my sight; I gave charge of her to a watchman, but the watch was not found: the purse was found in her bosom. Upon my oath I was sober and had not given her any of these articles.</p>

               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>DIGGINS'S Defence. He offered to leave his watch for 10 s. at the house, and they would let him have but half-a-crown: he then asked if I would let him have 9 s. or 10 s., as he should like to go with Harris: he went into a house with her; they came out and were quarrelling - he said she had got his watch - she said she would not let him have it till he gave her 4 s. which he had promised her.</p>
               <p>HARRIS'S Defence. We were coming down the street; he came and asked us to have some liquor - he took her into a house and gave her some liquor, and gave me 6 d: we went to another house, and he gave us ale and liquor till we were almost intoxicated; then he and I went into the house - he asked the servant to go and ask her master for 10 s. on the watch - they would let him have but half-a-crown; and then he gave me the watch; he then said he would have it or he would have my life; I ran from him and he pursued.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GRESHAM re-examined. Q. Did you give any one your watch to pledge? A. Yes; the servant of the house, but it was returned to me, and I put it into my pocket - I did not perceive that it was gone till the prisoner Harris left me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not at the office when Newman was brought up, and did you not say you did not know whether he was one or not? A. No, I did not. They had been in the shop about two minutes.</p>

I inquired where the other was, and Morgan told me where she lived; we went to the house, and saw Farrell, who said she threw it down, for the others to take it back. When we met them they were coming back towards Mrs. Baldwin's.</p>

In consequence of information I had received, I gave instructions to a man named Larom; I gave him one crown, one half-crown, and ten shillings and a sixpence, and marked one part of the money, and Perry marked the other. I had searched him previously - he had no other money about him but this 18 s. - we went in company to the house of the prisoners, in Petticoat-lane, on a Saturday evening: Larom and a man of the name of M'Carty, who was to introduce him, went into the house - Perry, and Drew, a brother officer, stood near the house, and I stood a little further off: after they had been in nearly an hour, Larom came out, and he said he had got twenty shillings and four half-crowns for 9 s.; we then went to the house and there found the prisoners and M'Carty: I asked Daniel Driscoll what money he had about him; he said very little; I pulled this sixpence out of his pocket; he said "That is a good one, is it not?" I said "Yes;" it had my mark upon it. I found on Armstrong two shillings, one has my mark, and the other has Perry's: I then searched Thomas Driscoll, and found on him a sixpence of my marking: I took from Larom twenty counterfeit shillings, four counterfeit half-crowns, one crown piece, and a half-crown of the marked money. I found on Thomas Driscoll, one shilling which was not marked, which I gave him back; the counterfeit money was wrapped in a rag with some paper inside.</p>

I then said I would take 20 s. in shillings: I then gave 3 s. more to Daniel Driscoll, and said could he get me four half-crowns - Armstrong said she would try: she then went out and was gone about eight minutes, and returned with two different parcels - one contained twenty shillings and the other four half-crowns; she opened the parcel with the twenty shillings, and said, "Here, my dear, here's the 20 s." - she then opened the paper with the four half-crowns, and took some tallow off the candle with her thumb, and said she would make them look dull, and I must rub them all alike, and they would look like good ones. Thomas Driscoll then came round the table and rubbed one of the shillings in the same manner: he then got a piece of rag and wrapped them up in it: I told him he had no occasion to do that as I could do it when I got home: this is the money which the officers took from me: I then said if they could let me have a sovereign I should be glad, and they said, a respectable young man like me, with a horse and cart, could easily pass sovereigns if I had another person with me; Thomas Driscoll said, I could easily take a bit of grease from my cart and make them look dull; I asked if it was all right, and they said yes; they had been there sixteen years, and had never got into trouble about it. When we were all in the room, in custody of the officers. Armstrong said "For Christ's sake make a bolt;" I said to James M'Carty "What a pretty mess you have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190055"/>brought me into;" and D. Driscoll said "It is all right, never fear."</p>

               <p>DANIEL DRISCOLL'S Defence. When these men came into my room they brought half a pint of gin and a pot of beer - the witness gave me a half-crown to get some more beer - they then said "There is no tobacco;" I gave a shilling to get some, and I then had 1 s. 6 d. in change; that is all I can say.</p>
               <p>ARMSTRONG'S Defence. They brought in the liquor and the beer, and told me to give them a glass, to drink some gin in; he made me take two glasses: he said that as he was coming down the lane two men asked him if he wanted any thing, and said they could get him some bad money, and perhaps, as I lived near, I might know how to get it better than him: I said I had not any thing to do with it; but he pressed me to go, and gave me 9 s. to go; I went to the door and then returned and said I could not get any; he pressed me to go again and very unfortunately I did go, and a man, who I think is here now, gave me the money wrapped up in a bit of paper, and said it was 9 s., - I took the paper but do not know what was in it - I gave it to him - he put it into his pocket, and then went down and brought up the officers to take me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DRISCOLL'S Defence. I did not get off my seat at all; I was just going to bed and had been but a short time from the country: I had nothing to do with the money: the sixpence I had given to the man was what I had given for my lodging.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I went with Mr. Gunter's groom and Plank to No. 24, Peter-street, about seven o'clock in the evening - I saw the female prisoner there; Plank told her he had got a search warrant, and asked if she had not bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190056"/>some pewter and some lead; she was rather agitated, and then said she had, and it was under the counter - that she gave 4 d. a pound for the pewter, and 1 1/2 d. a pound for the lead. I took Driscoll into custody on the Wednesday following, in Church-street, St. Giles's; he denied all knowledge of it then, but on the following Saturday, at the Office, he said he had been in company with Denton twice that day, and went with him to the shop on the first occasion, with some lead - that he had carried it part of the way, and Denton the rest, and sold it; that upon the second occasion he went to the shop but received no money for it: this was said when Denton was coming into the room - he mentioned that Dunderdale was the person who purchased it. I do not think I stated the whole of this to the Magistrates - I certainly stated some parts of it before Sir George Farrant, who generally takes it down himself.</p>

I went with Schofield to the house in Peter-street; I saw Mrs. Dunderdale there - she knew me; I told her I was come to search for some pewter, and she said "Mr. Plank it is under the counter;" I said "If you had not told me I should have found it as I have a warrant:" I delivered them to Schofield.</p>

               <p>DRISCOLL'S Defence. Denton swore "D - n your eyes, will you have some of this pewter?" on the Monday, while we were; there and he came and called me out of a pub-house - he took an empty basket down, and put some lead into it, and put some rubbish on the top of it; I thought it was all rubbish, and was going to empty it out; he followed me, and said, "Go on, go on," and then I put down the basket; he took it, and did what he pleased with it. I then came back, and said to one of my companions that I thought all was not right, and I would have nothing more to do with it. Denton then came back, and went to the ice hole, and came up again with a basket of pewter; Mr. Gunter's man saw him with it.</p>

On Wednesday morning, the 11th of May, about two o'clock, I was returning from a public-house on the other side of Westminster-bridge, and found I had drank too much - some person came to me, and in a kind manner offered me his assistance, which I was glad to accept. I suppose I must have told him where I lived - when we got near my own door I pulled out my watch to see the time; he immediately snatched it from me, and ran off; I gave an alarm, and be was taken in a minute or two.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Mary-le-bone. On the 11th of May, at four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner running round Davis-street; I pursued him, and saw him in the custody of Winnett; I assisted to take him back to York-place, where we found the prosecutor, who asked him for his watch; he said he had got none: the serjeant of the night came, and we searched him, but found nothing. In going down Baker-street the prosecutor again said, "Take counsel, and give me my watch;" the prisoner said he was never in a watch-house in his life. I then asked him where it was, and he said he had thrown it down the area in the street where we came from; I went back, and saw it down an area, and a person who lodges in the house gave it me up.</p>

            . I am an extra constable. I was in the pit of Covent-garden Theatre on the 21st of April, and saw the prisoner on the Princes' side, and then on the King's side, near to where Mr. Oliver was placing two ladies in their seats; the prisoner ran up right against him, and deliberately put his hand up to the pin, and drew it out; I instantly seized him by the collar, and called to the prosecutor that his pin was gone - at the same time I saw the prisoner throw it down in the passage; a party of young men came up, and said I should let him go, as he was a gentleman. I was beat about, and severely wounded, but I kept him in custody, and called Murder! Chiswick pointed out the place where she found the pin, it is where I saw him throw it down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the pin roll? A. Yes, down to the left. There were persons in the boxes over head, and persons trying to get seats all round the pit.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there besides yourself a single person who will say they saw this person deliberately take the pin out of the prosecutor's breast? A. I thought myself sufficient; they were both standing up: the ladies were sitting by his side.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. OLIVER. Q. Who were the ladies that were with you? A. The wife and daughter of a tradesman at Stratford. I can swear to the prisoner being one of the persons about me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence I have not been in town above three weeks. I was in the pit, but know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. OLIVER. Q. Did you see the officer being beat by the party? A. I heard some noise, but did not see him beat; he said he had been ill-used, and his side was hurt.</p>

               <p>JOHN ANGSTROM. I am a Swede, and live in Margaret's-buildings, New Gravel-lane. On the night of the 17th of May I went across the water, and took out my money to pay the waterman; I dropped a sovereign in the boat, and the waterman pushed me into the water; I could not swim to catch the boat, and so I got to shore. I came across the prisoner in the street, and he took me to a countryman of mine, to get something to drink; I sat by the fire, and dried myself, and sent a man to get me a pair of stockings; I wanted to come to this side of the water again with this man, and he put his hand into my pocket; I said, "What are you about?" and he said, "Never mind, I will go with you to the other side of the water," which he did - when we came here we went into a public-house, and I gave him something to drink. I had had five sovereigns, and the waterman took one; I then found I had but one left: the prisoner went away, and I told the people of the house what I had lost; a man took my part, and went to get the prisoner back again. I was very drunk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were about a hundred persons round, and the prosecutor was standing with some money in his hand; my master said to me, "Take this man home with you;" as we were going along he asked me where he could go to dry himself, as he was wet - we went to a house, and he called for rum; he said then to me, "You had better take this money, and give it me in the morning" - he gave me two sovereigns. He would not go home, and I said I would take it to his brother. Witness. I did not give him my money at all.</p>

The prisoner left the house shortly afterwards - an account was then given that the prosecutor had lost his money; I went after the prisoner, and told him to return - he refused at first, but I threatened him with an officer, and then he came back. As he was returning into the public-house he stooped down to his shoe, and I saw three sovereigns roll out of his hand; I picked up two of them, and he picked up the other.</p>

On the 23d of April, in consequence of information, I went with Joyce into Aldersgate-street, to a print shop - the name of Follett is over the door - I asked a man for prints; he said they belonged to a female, and called the prisoner, Oxley, down; she was asked if she had prints to call for a scrap box; she produced a port-folio - I immediately recognised a print in it as being one of mine, which had never been published: I went for an officer, and on my return Joyce had selected a number of prints, all of which I knew; I bought one of them for 2 s. 6 d., that had not been published; I then laid my hand on the whole, told her they were stolen, and begged her to tell me who she had them from; she said she could not tell; she had bought them of different persons who came to the shop - they were delivered to the officer - there were a good many belonging to works printed at my house, which had been published.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was fetched to Aldergate-street - these prints laid on the counter - Mr. Fenner looked them over and said "Madam, these are stolen." I took charge of her, and one print, which he gave me - I have the whole which were selected.</p>
               <p>MR. FENNER. Here is the one which I bought - here are about two hundred in all: I suspected Gore, and took an officer to my house, called Gore aside and charged him with taking prints out of my house, and selling them to his daughter-in-law; he said he had never sold a print out of my house in his life, but that he had given these to his daughter-in-law.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is it not common with those who take off prints to take one for themselves? A. Not to my knowledge - I know nothing of such a custom: about sixteen sheets of waste paper is allowed in a ream - they generally strike off one or two more than the number in case of accident, but are directed by me to burn all prints that are waste - if they are not burnt they remain in the warehouse: Gore had been a printer but worked in the warehouse, having broken his thumb: he was employed to clean these very prints - they are not allowed to take them out of the house, and are not allowed to have the waste - many of these are quite perfect.</p>

            . I have been a copper-plate printer thirty of forty years, and have been five years in Mr. Fenner's employ - the men have no right to take prints - the Stafford gallery had been in hand six months; all these plates were in Mr. Fenner's possession in April - many of them could be cleaned - it was Gore's business to clean them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not workmen often take one impression? A. It is understood that if a man works a print he should have one to keep, to compare, in order to arrange prices, but never to sell - but here are three of one sort.</p>

While he fetched an officer I selected what I thought belonged to the Stafford gallery. Mr. Fenner returned and bought one - she said she bought them of various people who came to the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there prints in the window? A. Yes, one side of the shop has books, and the other prints.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the evening after the robbery (Monday) in a coffee shop, in Hart-street, Covent-garden; I told him the charge, he said he was never near the place, and that he slept in a stagecoach at Westminster that night, by himself; he said it was down a street to the left; I understood him to mean the New-cut; he had a seal skin cap on.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, complaining of the officer attempting to prejudice his case, denying that the hat belonged to him, or that he had seen the witnesses for a month before.</p>
               <p>JURY to JARVIS. Q. Did you know the hat by any particular mark? A. Yes, by its being sewn round the rim, and on the side behind.</p>
               <p>JOHN SCOTT. I know it by the sewing behind.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

I saw Williams take a hat from the door post, and turn down the corner, when I collared him, with it in his possession; Johnson stood on the opposite side of the way - I took him before he could get away; it is a new hat, marked 14 s.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to apprehend the prisoner: I asked how he came to do this; he said it was not his intention to rob any one; that Newland put the hay into his cart, and he threw the ropes and the tilt in; he did not deny but that he knew there was hay in it - he wished the prosecutor not to have him taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he deny having the hay in the cart? A. No; Newland has been seen once since, but he has not been caught.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). After unloading, it appears the man had taken this hay. I had not the slightest knowledge of its being in my cart till I got up to put the ropes in: I then saw it and was afraid to get myself or the man into trouble if I threw it out - so he went off with the cart.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character and was recommended to mercy.</p>

I was in Doctors'-commons - Mr. Birch was ten or fifteen yards from me; I saw the prisoner follow him - he put his hand into his pocket and took the handkerchief out, which he folded up, and put into his bosom - I called out "Stop him, he has got your handkerchief!" he ran and I pursued him - he was taken on Addle-hill, in my presence - I am sure he is the person.</p>

            . On the 22d of April I was in the service of Mrs. Mary Scholes; the prisoner came into her shop, purchased a hat, and went away - in consequence of information I followed him to a public-house, and found him with the hat he had purchased and another, which I knew to be Mrs. Scholes; he had two in a bag, and the one he had stolen in his hand; he gave it to me, and told me to put it in its place, and take no notice of it.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mrs. Scholes. I saw the prisoner purchase the hat; the leather wanted tacking, and he sent Thomas into the back room to get it done - he then placed this other hat near the end of the case; he then took it and the one he had bought away: I told Wix of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been in the habit of buying hats; I wanted a damaged one, and they wished me to take a good one - I said, "I don't know whether the person will give the price of it, but I shall see him at the next house," and asked if they would give me leave to take it to the public-house, for about a quarter of an hour - he said I might if I would take care not to soil it. I went to leave it at the public-house while I went for the man, and I was taken.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WIX re-examined. Q. Is this true? A. Upon my oath it is not; he had bought one that morning<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190063"/>before, and one at the time he stole the hat; he has bought upon an average one every day for six months.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the house. I heard this complaint, and saw the prisoner coming down stairs with his hat in his hand, which he put down beside him, on the seat of the coffee-room; he asked for his boots, and one of the servants said they should be brought in a few minutes. In the mean time my master sent for an officer, who came, and took him into another room; he left his hat on the seat where he had been sitting; I fetched it, and it had two clean and one dirty shirts in it. Mr. Waddington's room was on the floor under that in which the prisoner slept in; it was about half-past two o'clock on Sunday morning before the prisoner came down.</p>

            . I was sent for to apprehend the prisoner; I searched him, and found a large spike nail on him, wrapped up in a handkerchief, which, I should think, would open a strong lock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found the nail on the Woolwich-road, coming to London; and it is reckoned very unlucky in my country if you should find a thing, not to put it into your pocket.</p>

            . I am a neighbour of Mr. Jones's. I went, and desired to see the prisoner in a private room - he was searched, and nothing found upon him; I then found the three shirts in the hat, and the shirt and pin between the bed and mattress.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The hat is not mine; mine was bought at Liverpool, and had a Liverpool mark upon it.</p>
