               <p>Millet. I don't know any thing relating to the Murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know at any Time, or when she was with Child?</p>
               <p>Millet. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it you know of a Child being wrapped up in a Petticoat?</p>
               <p>Millet. I know I went up Stairs a little before Nine; I don't know the Day of the Month, it was of a Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago was it? In what Month Mrs Millet?</p>
               <p>Millet. It was about a Month ago last Tuesday, I went up Stairs in the Room where she lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been ill before that, or kept her Bed?</p>
               <p>Millet. No, when I went up to her, I asked her what was the Matter, and she said nothing at all to me; and I was very much surprized and came down Stairs, and went and fetched the Midwife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing that made you to think a Midwife was necessary?</p>
               <p>Millet. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that?</p>
               <p>Millet. I thought by what I did see, there must be a Child.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you this Thought by what you observed upon the Prisoner, or by what you observed in Relation of any Linnen or Bed?</p>
               <p>Millet. By what I observed on the Bed, and in the Room too.</p>

             examined this Child? Did you and she examine the Child together ?</p>
               <p>Millet. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form any Kind of Judgment whether this Child had been alive?</p>
               <p>Millet Really, Sir, I cannot tell that indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. At that Time what was the best of your Judgment, whether the Child was born alive or dead.</p>
               <p>Millet. To the best of my Judgment the Child might have been born alive, but for want of proper Assistance to be sure the Child could not live long.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you cannot take it upon you to say whether the Child was or was not born alive.</p>
               <p>Millet. I can't indeed, Sir</p>
               <p>Court. You don't know she was with Child, or this was the Child she was delivered of? nor you don't know whether she was actually delivered of any Child ?</p>
               <p>Millet. Sir, I cannot say, I was not in the Room with her.</p>
               <p>Court. Nor you can't certainly say by these Marks you saw, that she was delivered of a Child?</p>
               <p>Millet. I could not be sure, but I thought it must be so by what I did see.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not discover this Child at the Head of the Bed till the Midwife came, did you?</p>
               <p>Millet. I was in a great Fright, and I did not look for it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what Condition was the Prisoner, was she in her Senses?</p>
               <p>Millet. I think she was not in her right Senses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any Behaviour at that Time that induced you to think she was crazy?</p>
               <p>Millet. I think the Nature of a Woman, except she was out of her Senses, would not make away or destroy her own.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk to her at that Time?</p>
               <p>Millet. She talked to no Body, nor gave no Body any Answer.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time might it be between your going up first, and the coming of the Midwife ?</p>
               <p>Millet. About five or six Minutes to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been up Stairs before you went up Stairs after her?</p>
               <p>Millet. About an Hour and an Half, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any Conversation with her afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Millet. No, Sir, only asked her how she could do so, but she made me no Answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you construe by her Behaviour that she was stupified; that she was in her Senses, or was not?</p>
               <p>Millet. I believe she was stupified.</p>
               <p>Court. You believe she had not the Government of her Understanding ?</p>
               <p>Millet. No, I believe she had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a sensible Woman at other Times?</p>
               <p>Millet. She is a very sensible young Woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any Conversation with her since that Time?</p>
               <p>Millet. Yes; and she said her Child came dead into the World.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she since talked sensibly?</p>
               <p>Millet. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think from the Condition she was in at that Time she was sensible what came upon her? Had she drank any thing that Day?</p>
               <p>Millet. Nothing at all, any farther than common drink.</p>
               <p>Q. What was her Behaviour in general ?</p>
               <p>Millet. She always behaved like a very sober, honest Girl; I never heard her speak an ill Word in my Life.</p>

               <p>Q. At what Time did you lose these Things?</p>
               <p>Scott. The 21st of January I went out at Half an Hour after One, and came home Half an Hour after Five, and found my Door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this Duffil Coat and Petticoat there at Half an Hour after One, when you went away?</p>
               <p>Scott. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know they were taken by this Woman?</p>
               <p>Scott. I found them the 24th of January at this Woman's, Joannah Cornish.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your own Knowledge, how Joannah Cornish came by this Petticoat and Duffil Coat ?</p>
               <p>Scott. The Prisoner confessed before the Justice, that she had sold them to her.</p>
               <p>Q. What things was she charged with taking?</p>
               <p>Scott. She said she had a white Cloak, two Caps, two Hats, a white Wig, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with the Prisoner before the Justice when she made this Confession? Was the Confession signed by her?</p>
               <p>Scott: I can't tell, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing further of your own Knowledge? Did the Prisoner tell you at any other Time what she had taken?</p>
               <p>Scott. When I went to her at Newgate, she stood to that, that this Woman had all but a blue Rug for 3 s. 3 d.</p>
               <p>Q. to Joannah Cornish. What do you know of Matter ?</p>
               <p>Cornish. The Prisoner came to my House the 24th of January, and brought me a quilted Petticoat, and an old blue Frock or Shirt, made in the Form of a Shirt; she asked me 5 s. for it. I said they were not worth it, and I gave her 3 s. 3 d. for them, the quilted Petticoat was dirty, I washed it, and hung it up at my Door for Sale; the Prosecutor came by and saw it, and said it was her Property; they were to give me eight Days to find the Prisoner, but instead of eight they gave me but one, and sent me to Bridewell, till I was bailed and found the Prisoner.</p>

            , Esq; Will you give an Account of what you know in Relation to the Fact charged upon the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Mr Meade. On the 26th of January last, about eight o'Clock in the Morning, I was told that Mr Dingley's House was broke open and robbed; upon that I goes directly to see what was taken out of the House; I went over, and the first Room I came into, that I call the Red-bed-chamber (I let this House to Mr Dingley) I missed a Feather bed, two Pillows, three Blankets, a Bed-quilt, and four Camblet Bedcurtains, and two Harateen Window-curtains.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you let this House to Mr Dingley ?</p>
               <p>Mr Meade. Yes, my Lord, he had it for three Years, from Year to Year.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner's having these Things?</p>
               <p>Mr Meade. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. You don't know any thing particularly, whether this House was located or fastened, but as you have been told?</p>
               <p>Mr Meade. I know as much as this, my Lord, I found it open, and it used to be locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any Marks of Violence on the Door?</p>
               <p>Mr Meade. No, my Lord; there is a great old Peartree at the Side of the House: I apprehend he came upon that Tree, and got in at a little Window at the Side of it; for I found the wooden Bar of that little Window broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing concerning these Goods?</p>
               <p>Mr Meade. It was noised about that Mr Dingley's House was broke open; it was my Servant found the Goods in the Prisoner's House.</p>
               <p>Q. To the Prisoner. Will you ask Mr Meade any Questions ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg to know whether he can swear to that Blanket the Bed was wrapped in; it is very hard that the Blanket should be sworn to amongst the rest, which I bought in May last.</p>

            . What is it you know in relation to the breaking open Mr Dingley's House, and stealing Goods from thence?</p>
               <p>Ashely. Mr Dingley's Man, Thomas Clark the Gardener, called me over, and said, I believe the House is broke open: He said, let us look in the House; so I went directly, and there I found the Bed, Blanket, and all those Things Master has mentioned, gone out of the House.</p>
               <p>Q. What Bed was it?</p>
               <p>Ashly. It was a large Feather-bed, with a brown Ticking; there were all the Pillows gone, put into a Sack.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any Blankets?</p>
               <p>Ashly. Yes, my Lord; I am sure we missed three, and a Bed-curtain too.</p>
               <p>Q. What were those in the Bed room ?</p>
               <p>Ashly. In the Bed room the Curtain was taken away, and the Feather-bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any Blankets out of the other Room missing?</p>
               <p>Ashly. I believe there was, my Lord; but I cannot speak so particularly as to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of these Goods since?</p>
               <p>Ashly. My Lord, I found the Feather-bed in the Prisoner's House.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Ashly. In Warden-lane, in Thistleworth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else?</p>
               <p>Ashly. He had taken the Feathers out of his own Bed, and put my Master's Feathers and Tick in his Sack: I can swear that was my Master's Bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else there?</p>
               <p>Ashly. I know only of the Feather bed and Blankets; a large fine white good Blanket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that large fine white Blanket?</p>
               <p>Ashly. On the top of the Bed; the Bed was made, and he had put it upon the top of my Master's Bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner present, when you seized these Things in the Sack ?</p>
               <p>Ashly. No, my Lord; he was run away.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say that was your Master's Blanket ?</p>
               <p>Ashly. I don't know directly; but I can swear to the Bed.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you cannot swear positively to the Blanket's being your Master's Blanket.</p>

               <p>Roads. On the 27th of January last, I went up to Hounslow on a little Business, and I went with a Friend to the Crown to drink a Glass of Beer, and they were talking of a Gentleman's House being robbed, and several such Sort of Goods stole, as have been mentioned. Mr - that keeps the Rose and Crown, the Post-house; he was saying there was a Man came up the Lane, by his House, with a Wrapper of Goods, about Six o'Clock in the Morning; he said he pitched them upon the R before his House; he said to him, Does the Windsor Caravan stop at your House? Says he, I have these Things to send to London: He told him, it did not. With that I said I would go up to the Red-Lion, to see whether this Wrapper or Goods were gone; by that Means, perhaps, we shall trace it out. So I enquired if there was not a little Man came there yesterday Morning. Says the Landlord, there was a Man brought a Sack with some Goods in it. I asked where it was: He said it was not gone, his Hostler forgot to give it the Caravan; so I opened it, and I saw in it there was a Blanket tied a cross, and I examined farther; and there was another Blanket, &amp;c. So I said to the Landlord, I would have you carry them into your Chamber, and if any body comes after them. I would have you stop them. So I acquainted Mr Meade with it, and he dispatched one of his Servants to see if they were his Goods. When we came again to the Red Lion, where the Goods were left, we heard the Prisoner had been there to see after the Sack of Goods left on Monday Morning; he wondered they did not fond them, for he had been at London, and they were not come: They were directed to be left at one

Then we heard that he was gone to Gravesend: We went there, but we could not find him. On Saturday was Fortnight there was a Woman to nurse his Wife in her lying in; and she told me he was to be at her House on Saturday Night late, or on Sunday Morning: So we waited till Seven o'Clock in the Morning; we waited till the Fore-door was open. I said, now is the time, let us go. So I drew my Hanger, and put it under my Coat; so his Wife asked who was there: I told his Wife I had a Letter for him: I said I came from a Woman the Nurse down at Thistleworth: I heard the Child say, Mamme, and Dadde; then I thought I was sure of him. I said to his Wife, where is your Husband? She said, he is not here. I said, I had heard the Child cry Dadde; so I examined the Bed, and looked at the Feet of the Bed, and I saw his Clothes; I put my Hanger under the Bed, and said I would cut him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174702250006"/> if he did not come out; so I touched him at his Neck, and

I said I would have gone a thousand Mile to apprehend such a Rogue as you, you have committed many Robberies; he said if he had Pistol he would have shot me dead; I said, would you have shot me that am an innocent Man? he said, my Life is as dear to me as your's, and I would have shot you dead: he confessed that he had sewed the Feather bed, and that he was in a great Passion with his Wife, that she did not let him have the Thread soon enough.</p>

The first Time I saw the Prisoner at the Bar, was the 5th of February: he came into the Stable, his Majesty sent and ordered for the Officers Horses to be got ready; a Serjeant then desired me to give him Change for a Guinea, I said, Sir, I believe I can do it, upon that I opened the Chest, where I put the Books and other things, and I pulled out 5 l. in Silver, in an Handkerchief, upon this, the Prisoner see me put up this Handkerchief; when I had so done, the Prisoner stayed all the Afternoon, pro and con, alter I had given the Serjeant Change: upon seeing this Silver put into the Chest, he staid with me the Afternoon, came again the next Morning, and brought with him some little Books, which he took in by Subscription; he went away again till Saturday, between seven and eight o'Clock, the next Morning about Six, when I came to the Stable I saw the Prisoner, who said he had been robbed, his Coat and his Hat taken off, and 15 s. taken out of his Pocket; upon this I said, my Lad, I am afraid you keep ill Company; Sir, says he, I don't keep ill Company. I accidently left my Key in my Chest, left it for about eight Minutes; when I returned and saw it, I thought I was a Fool for it; I opened it and found the Bag taken away, and the Money gone; I called out and said, What is become of that Lad? they said he was just gone out; I said which way did he go, I was afraid he had robbed me of such and such Money, at last we heard at Westminster-bridge that he was gone down the River Thomes, we searched all about the Borough, and at St James's, there we heard his Name was Lovat, and his Father and Mother lived in Duke-street; we heard of him again in the Evening, that he had landed at Westminster-bridge, that he had been at the Alehouse going to the Bridge, I think, the Magpye; he came into the City, and bought him a new Suit of Clothes: With this, a Waterman that was with him, came the next Day, and told me he had been at Supper with him, at the Horn Tavern. I heard of his being gone to Windsor; I pursued him there, and found him in Pescot street, Windsor. With that I brought him to the Bell and Castle, and I goes to Mr Mayor, and sends for an Officer. When I met the Prisoner, I said to him, Your Servant, Sir; I am glad to see you at Windsor. Sir, says he, I never saw you. I said, to my Sorrow, I saw you at the Horse-yard, so soon. He told me, he would make a free and ample Confession, if I would not hang him. I then called his Name

               <p>Mc Ovey. She had lodged with another young Woman that lodged up another Pair of Stairs; and they happened to fall out; so my Wife she took her in out of Charity, till she could get a Lodging of her own. Yesterday Morning she stayed out till Four o'Clock. Accordingly she came in with a lighted Candle in her Hand, and took my Watch, 2 s. 6 d. in Money, a Scarlet Cloak, and one Pair of Shoes, and a Pair of Stockings of my Wife's.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do with her, when you met with her?</p>
               <p>Mc Ovey. I carried her before the Justice.</p>

               <p>Mc Ovey. I accused her of the Watch, and Buckles likewise, and the Shoes and Stockings, and Cloak, and she owned them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say? Tell us the Words. Was there any Account taken in Writing?</p>
               <p>Mc Ovey. Yes, I think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found your Things?</p>

            . Are you a married Woman?</p>
               <p>Mc Ovey Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that last Witness your Husband?</p>
               <p>Mc Ovey. Yes, Sir; and I have so far to say, that I took the Prisoner in as a Lodger; I let her sit up till my Husband had got up to work; then she has come into Bed. Yesterday Morning, about Four o'Clock, she came in with a lighted Candle in her Hand: I asked her what Time it was; I think she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174702250009"/> said it was about Four o'Clock; with that she went away. I turned myself, and went to sleep. About Six o'Clock my Husband awakened, and desired me to get up, and warm him some Broth. When he got up, he told me he had been robbed; and I looked, and I found that she had taken my Shoes, and Scarlet Cloak, that she had taken the Night before; I found her in an Alehouse, near Clerkenwell Prison, there she had a hot Pig, that she carried to a Prisoner there. She said she was going to Bed, and somebody put it into her Head to take the Watch. She would not own it at first, but she did at last.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Cloak?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, she lent it me; she keeps a common House for every body; she has three Husbands living now.</p>
               <p>Q. to Solomon Lewis. What have you to say against the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I went along with the young Woman who wanted to take the Prisoner. We went beyond Hicks's Hall I don't know the Name of the Street; I think they call it Jones's-lane: I think it was at the York-shire-Grey, or White-Horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Prisoner accused of there? Mr Mc Ovey speaks of a Watch, a Pair of Buckles, and Cloak, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Lewis. She at first strictly denied it, then afterwards she made an open Confession; she said she was sorry she had taken them; she believed she was undone, but she sold them to one in Newgate, the Watch for 18 s. and the Buckles for 9 s. which she did not deny before the Justice of Peace the last Night. The Prisoner at the first denied it, but when Mrs Mc Ovey was gone, she asked me for half a Quartern of Brandy. I said I would give it her. Then she said she would confess it: She confessed she sold the Watch for 18 s. and the Buckles for 9 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any Cloak upon her Back?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Yes, Sir; I think it was the same Cloak that the Woman mentioned something about; but particularly I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Lewis. In Gravel lane, Houndsditch: I work in Rope-making, and sometimes in Rigging.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoner. What have you to say in your Defence? Have you any Witness?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I was with that Woman about three Months; I used to borrow her Cloak of her; she keeps a House for Fellows to come in all Hours of the Night, and it might as well be any body else as me: I know no more of it than this Candlestick.</p>

I was obliged to go out of Town on the Saturday. I came home on Monday Night, and I desired her to give me the Remainder of the Money, and she gave me nine Guineas, and told me, she had changed one for the Use of the House; and she would give an Account of the Things committed to her Charge. But before I got up in the Morning, she was gone. I must tell you, my Lord, when I came home on Tuesday, I saw the Pint Mug on the Dresser in my Kitchen, and the two large Silver Spoons, which I did not see when I came home; which she owned before the Justice. She went away on Tuesday Morning. She sent back the two large Silver Spoons, and Pint Mug, by a Porter, on the Wednesday before she was taken up: I took her up after she had sent these Things; because I lost a great many Things, and I could only judge her to be the Thief.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did she tell you this?</p>
               <p>Pymer. She told me at New-Prison, where she was, that she had pawned a Shirt. When I came out of the Country from Mrs Bowyer, she desired I would let the Maid have every thing she wanted; and I took Care of the House, and paid every thing myself, I laid out about forty Shillings in Housekeeping, while her Mistress was gone. The Maid took care of the House from Friday till Monday Night; she provided every thing herself, she laid out about seven Shillings of her own.</p>
               <p>Q. to Thomas Brown. What have you to say in relation to the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Brown. On Tuesday in the Afternoon I called at Mrs Bowyer's House, to know whether she wanted me: I heard Mrs Bowyer to say that she had lost a Pint Mug, and two large Silver Spoons. I called between twelve and one o'Clock; and when she had told me of the Loss of these Things, I left Mrs Bowyer, and went home to my House. I found the Prisoner at my House: She asked me what her Mistress said about her. I told the Prisoner, that her Mistress was very much enraged against her, and would take her up, if she could be found. She desired the Favour of me, if I would be so good, as to let my Apprentice step down, and acquaint her Mistress that she was at my House. Upon this her Mistress came in a Coach along with Mrs Pymer, and desired me to keep the Prisoner till she came back again, for she was going before the Justice. I went up and told the Prisoner, that her Mistress was gone to take out a Warrant for her; but I did not offer to detain the Prisoner in the least, as I thought I had no Authority. Mrs Bowyer took her at my House.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say? Did she offer to go away?</p>
               <p>Brown. No, my Lord; the Prisoner said she pawned these Things, the Pint Silver Mug, the two large Silver Spoons, while her Mistress was out of Town, for the Use of the House.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the Prisoner any Time?</p>
               <p>Brown. Not before she lived with her Mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived with her Mistress?</p>
               <p>Brown. I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs Bowyer. How long has the Maid lived with you?</p>
               <p>Bowyer. Since last March, to the best of my Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoner. What have you to say for yourself? and what Witnesses have you to call?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I have none here; I never had any Opportunity to send for any body; the Plate was pawned for the Use of the House.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs Bowyer. She says the Plate was pawned for the Use of the House.</p>
               <p>Bowyer. My Lord, she had eleven Guineas in her Hands, from Saturday to Monday.</p>
               <p>Court. Though she had the eleven Guineas, she was not to apply them to the Use of the House by your Leave; I thought you gave her the eleven Guineas to pay to some particular Person.</p>
               <p>Bowyer. Yes, my Lord; but she had changed one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lived with her from last March, and I wanted Money to make use of: I laid out a great deal of Money, for I never had but 16 s. of her from the Time that I lived with her.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs Bowyer. You have not paid her any Wages.</p>
               <p>Bowyer. She borrowed 16 s. of me, that was all.</p>

            . I am Headborough; as there were several Officers of us together, we were walking about to see if we could find any disorderly People; we heard a pretty great Noise at the House where the Prisoners were; we all of us went in, when the Door was opened, that short Man, Cordoso, dropped the Buckles; I shut the Door to prevent any more coming out, for some made their Escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it that little Man that dropped the Buckles?</p>
               <p>Newet. Yes, from his left Arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time was this?</p>
               <p>Newet. About Eleven o'Clock, it was last Tuesday was a Week.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sent for you?</p>
               <p>Newet. Every Tuesday Night the Officers meet together, and we went out then to see if we could find any disorderly People; we heard a Noise at this House, and when they opened the Door we went in, and that little Man dropped the Buckles from under his Arm; I ran to the back Door, I saw two go out there, and I ran to the Door to prevent any more from going out.</p>
               <p>Q. What Quantity of things were there?</p>
               <p>Newet. There were more things than the Buckles found in the House; when we entered the House there were Twelve besides what made their Escape, of Boys and Women.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that you saw the other three Prisoners as well as Cordoso.</p>
               <p>Newet. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the other things besides the Buckles ?</p>
               <p>Newet. There were some Silk Stockings, some Seals, and some Screws.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with all the Things?</p>
               <p>Newet. What we took away we have here, there was about fourteen Yards of Duffil Cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. to John Savage. Do you know the Prisoners at the Bar? What do you know of this Matter?</p>
               <p>Savage. I work for Mrs Hartland, and have done for sixteen or seventeen Years, and I know that some of these Buckles belong to Mrs Hartland.</p>
               <p>Q. Who produced the Buckles?</p>
               <p>Savage. The Officer.</p>
               <p>Court. You say some of the Buckles you know belonged to Mrs Hartland?</p>
               <p>Savage. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing to charge the Prisoners?</p>
               <p>Savage. No, my Lord, I made some Part of them the white Metal, but here is another Workman, one Mills.</p>
               <p>Mills. I made part of these yellow Buckles for Mrs Hartland.</p>
               <p>Q. to Holloworth, the Constable. Did you search that Man?</p>
               <p>Holloworth. Yes, about two Hours after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the Buckles?</p>
               <p>Holloworth. I was present when they were taken: we were told that a Pack of Thieves used that House, and a Pack of Jews to buy the things, and there were six of us and we went to take them, and I know these are some of them; six of us rushed in all at once, and I thought Newet had taken the Buckles from under Cordosa's Arm, but he says that he dropped them, and he took them off the Ground.</p>
               <p>Q to the Prisoner, Jacobs. What have you to say?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. My Lord, I work at the Water-side, I help to unload Lighters, and when I came out from my hard Labour, it was about ten o'Clock, being late, we got ourselves a little merry in Thames-street. I comes in at the Sign of the Cock Ale-house, in Petticoat-lane, at one Loaf's and I asked for my Wife; says they, your Wife is gone to the Woman's that mends Stockings for you; I goes into this Place and I sees my Wife there, I said, Peggy, how came you to stay so long? I had not been there above five Minutes, before the Officers came in, and took my Wife and I to the Watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Holloworth, the Constable. What was this House where you took these Prisoners?</p>
               <p>Holloworth. At one Mrs Grey's in Cobb's-court, near Cox's-square, Spital fields, a little nasty Hole, where they sold Gin. We took Twelve, and and Eleven were sent to Prison.</p>

I saw a Pair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174702250013"/> that was as near to them, as ever any thing could be. My Mistress told the Constable what they weighed, that was three ounces and one penny weight. My Lord, she is not here; she is not well; I can swear to them, as much as my Mistress can; the Minute I saw them, I said they were the Buckles that were taken out of my Mistress's Show-glass: When the Pawnbroker brought them to my Mistress, my Mistress weighed them; when she came to weigh, they weighed three Ounces and one Penny-weight to a Hair, as my Mistress mentioned.</p>

            . What do you know about the Matter?</p>
               <p>Holloway. My Lord, the Prisoner at the Bar and I went out one Day to see what we could get, and we saw this Show-glass something loose, and the Prisoner at the Bar hoisted up the Show-glass, and took out these Buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the Prisoner, that Boy, took out the Buckles?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Yes, my Lord; and I saw them in his Possession; and I had them in my Possession, and pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Show-glass?</p>
               <p>Holloway. It was in Russel-court, near Drury-lane; there was the Place where we took the Buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the Buckles ? Did you go with him to pawn them?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Please you, my Lord, I gave him eight Shillings for my Share, and so wore them for a long while; and last Monday was Se'nnight I pawned them at the Sign of the three Blue-balls in the Hay-market.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hollingsworth the Constable. What do you know about the Matter?</p>
               <p>Hollingsworth. The second Time this Chap was examined, he said he thought of this afresh, and said he had pawned the Buckles at such a Place in the Hay-market.</p>
               <p>Q. What, Holloway the Accomplice said so?</p>
               <p>Hollingsworth. Yes, Sir; when I went to the Pawnbroker, I told him our Warrant; then he said he would prosecute; however, afterwards he gave me the Buckles; his Wife thought it more safe to deliver them to me, being the Constable.</p>

               <p>Hollingsworth, Constable.

            , a Person with her, had some Gin together; as we were sitting by the Fire-side, she said she lived but three or four Doors from that House, and said her Husband was out, and I should be welcome to lay down upon the Bed a little, and she would be a Customer to me; when I went up Stairs, there was a Bed in the Room, and immediately half a Pint of Gin was brought up without my Order; I says I don't want any, but as 'tis come, I shall drink; I went from thence back to the Gentlewoman's that bought the Sheets of me, and she bought a Remnant of Check.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. I was there about a Quarter of an Hour, from first to last; I packed up my things in that House, then went and told the Gentlewoman at the other Place where I sold the Sheets, I would bring her some more sheeting, and two Pounds of Snuff.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing when you went away?</p>

               <p>Reynolds. I opened them to pack them so as the Rain should not hurt them in carrying them Home.</p>
               <p>Q. When you opened your things there, did you miss any thing?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. Yes, my Lord, I missed a very large Parcel of Handkerchiefs, which might be to the best of my knowledge, 63 or 64.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what Kind were they?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. There were a Dozen or Fourteen printed, and all the rest were checked.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Worth of all of them?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. The whole, take them all together, might be worth 3 l. or 3 l. 10 s. I told the Gentlewoman of the Gin-Shop, in case these Goods should be found upon these two Women, they should stop them and give me Notice; I went back directly to the Place, but the Women were both gone.</p>
               <p>Court. Then those two Women that were with you at the Gin-shop, and at this House, were both the same that yo u suspected took your Goods?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. Yes, though I did not see them take them away, but as the Evidence will prove it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Afternoon was it you went away from the Gin shop? and what Time was you there in the Morning?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. About Nine in the Morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Who cut the Handkerchiefs ?</p>
               <p>Barrow. Philpot the Prisoner. I afterwards went down to my House; after I went home, the Prisoner followed me with a Pretence to make me drink. I told her I had drank enough already; I would go to sleep. She followed me, and said she would treat me with a Dram; and carried me to the Woman where we were before, and called for a Quartern of Gin. The Woman and she went up Stairs together; I stayed the Space of half an Hour, then she came down. I saw she had something in her Apron. I said, I will go. Here, stay a bit, says she; I'll go home with you. Says she, I have got some Handkerchiefs gave me; and Mrs. Thornton will have Part of them; and the Prisoner sold three of them for 1 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any put under the Hog-tub ?</p>
               <p>Barrow. Yes, my Lord; she crammed one in the Yard, under the Hog-tub.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she put it there for ?</p>
               <p>Barrow. For Fear it should be searched, and found about her. I did not know she put it there, till she was took up.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. What have you to say in your Defence ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lived along with this Woman: Upon Candlemas-day we went to drink with this Man that lost the Goods: The Prosecutor sat down upon the Bed with

            , drinking with her; and they drank half a Pint of Gin out; and she said she was a-dry, and wanted some Beer; and they brought a Full-pot of Two-penny up: He desired they might go to Bed together. The Woman said, she had not a Room to let, and they should not; and we went out of the House together. When I came out, my Garter dropped off; and before I could pick it up again, they were gone.</p>
               <p>[The Prisoner insinuated that she went afterwards to Barrow's House, and found eight Handkerchiefs in her Bed; and she gave her three of them]</p>

               <p>Q. When were these stole from you ?</p>
               <p>Tall. The 29th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say the Prisoner stole them?</p>
               <p>Tall Because I saw the Goods in his Apron.</p>

               <p>Tall I live in Mountague street, Cox's square; these Things they hung on a Nail at the Door: About three o'Clock in the Afternoon, I heard the Crack of the String that was broke: I was serving in the Shop, and I took hold of him, and called for Assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with him?</p>
               <p>Tall. I carried him before the Justice, and he committed him to New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Tall. He told the Justice he was going to buy an Handkerchief of me.</p>

               <p>Leech. In Petticoat Lane. I was at Mrs. Tall's House, at the Time these Handkerchiefs were lost; I believe it was about two o'Clock. I was buying something, and I heard something snap; and I went to the Door, and this young Man had the Handkerchiefs in his Hand; and I took them out of his Hand: He had got a green Apron on, and just about to put them into his Apron; so I took them out of his Hand, and gave them to Mrs. Tall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know how many there were ?</p>
               <p>Leech. No, I did not know how many there were. Mrs. Tall keeps an old Cloath-shop, and they hung at the Door; the Prisoner was secured, and carried before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the Handkerchiefs afterwards?</p>
               <p>Leech. The Constable had them.</p>

            . Do you know the Prisoner? What do you know in Relation to the cry of Stop Thief?</p>
               <p>Hicks. I was in my Master's Shop, the King's Glazier, Mr. Carn.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your Master live?</p>
               <p>Hicks. In St. Martin's-lane. I was lighting Candles, and I heard a gre cry, Stop Thief, stop Thief! The Prisoner run with a Mob after him up Hemming's Row; I was informed the Prisoner at the Bar ran down with a Bundle under his Arm, and went down the Red Lyon Inn Yard in Castle-street: a Man turns down there, and sees the Prisoner doing his Occasions there, under a Shed; when the Person came that see him run away from the Woman's Door, he would swear that he was the Person that run from the Woman's Door; he said I had wronged him, I said I hoped I had, for you look a likely young Fellow, and I hoped he was not guilty of the Fact; we looked in the Chaise, he was between the two Shafts, doing his Occasions; and looking about the Chaise I picked up these two Bundles of Stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say then?</p>
               <p>Hicks. He would not own any thing of it; with that I brought him to this Woman's Shop, and she said that was the Person that went away with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew the Stockings to Mrs. Colley?</p>
               <p>Hicks. Yes, Sir, we gave them into her Possession directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prisoner say there?</p>
               <p>Hicks. He said nothing there, but we took him before Justice Burdns, and he owned it, that his Comrade stooped over the Compter, and took them up for him to run away with them.</p>
               <p>John Ware. I was standing at my Master's Door, Mr. Gulte's, a Silver-Smith in Chandois-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How near Mrs. Colley's Shop?</p>
               <p>Ware. Almost over against it: I heard a Noise, Stop Thief! and I ran on as the rest did to see what was the Matter, and I run up Hemming's-Row, and we could not tell where the Prisoner was gone; some said they see him run down Red Lion yard, and there he was found doing his Occasions, and these two Bundles were found under a Board, hard by the Chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him to Mrs. Colley's?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174702250019"/>Ware. Yes. Sir, and Mrs. Colley owned the Goods. but he said another Man was along with him, and took them.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. What have you to say in your Defence?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The young Man that was with me, that belonged to the Duke Privateer, he took these Stockings, and as there was a Cry of Stop Thief. I ran away too, for fear of being taken up.</p>

               <p>Sleep. From Falconbridge court, in St. Ann's Parish, in the Liberty of Westminster; I was going to my own House at Whittlebourgh, in Watford Parish, where my Wife was gone for her Health; she was very sick, so was my Child; and between <placeName id="t17470225-18-crimeloc78">Hoasden green</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was it the Length of a Horse-pistol?</p>
               <p>Sleep. Not quite so long I believe. When he demanded my Money, I told him I had but little; I was going to see my Wife, and I had not Occasion for much Money, so I gave him my Money, which was 6 s. it happened to be in my Pocket alone, for I had changed a Guinea that Day, and paid 15 s. for the King's Tax; then he asked me for my Watch, and afterwards he demanded my Perriwig; it was a frosty Night, I desired him not to take my Wig, for I should catch cold; I told him it would do him very little Service, I did not wear costly Wigs, so for that Reason I obtained my Wig again; then he went to the other Person in Company, to whom he swore if he stirred a Foot further, he would strike him dead, still joining Oaths to his Words.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Menace made to the Carter before he robbed you?</p>
               <p>Sleep. During the Time of his robbing me.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the Carter stood still during the Time he was robbing you?</p>
               <p>Sleep. Yes, Sir, he went and demanded Money of him, but I don't remember that he had any of him. I forgot one thing, my Lord; before he left me, he insisted upon my swearing I would say nothing of what had past; I told him I was never used to swear since I was 18 Years of Age, and am now upwards of forty; I said I would lose my Life rather than I would swear an Oath; then he left me, and said two others would have robbed me if he had not; I said then what shall I say if any Body should attack me; he said, say Thomas, that was the Word, upon that he rode off; after he had given me that Instruction. I rode forwards towards Harrow; and in about a quarter of a Mile, I did meet two Persons, who rode swiftly past us, who said nothing to us, nor we to them; and I judged they were the Highwaymen, and had some Intelligence that they might know that he had robbed me, and so thought it in vain to stop us any more. So I said to the Man in Company, these were the two Men that he told us of, they had the Appearance of Highwaymen; for 'tis not usual for Persons passing in the Night, but they say good Night, or something to that Purpose; so I apprehended these were the Persons he mentioned; one was on a black and the other on a white Horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What Horse was the Prisoner mounted upon?</p>
               <p>Sleep. Upon a brown Horse, a very fine one. - I says to the Carter, I'll follow these two Men, I believe they belong to him, and by following them, perhaps we shall come to the Knowledge of this Person; so then without going to my House in the Country, I turned back towards London. As soon as I came over against the Place where I was robbed, I heard two Horses jump into the Field, and I could hear the Horses Hoofs trumpting at a great Rate between Edgware and Harrow Road; I rode on further to Hodsden-green, there I met several Persons that he had attacked, one Man had lost his Horse, and they rode towards London, so did I; they thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174702250023"/> they should overtake him; but it was all in vain, for he was better mounted than any of them. I rode as far as Paddington, and put up my Horse; I considered my Wife would be frightened if I did not come, so I went my intended Journey, and got there about Eleven o'Clock at Night.</p>
               <p>Court. You say it was about the Hour of Five when you set out from Falconbridge-court, and you say you rode about five Miles from thence, between Stone-bridge and Hodsden-green, and the Prisoner came up to you; as it was dusk, how came you to know that the Prisoner at the Bar was the Person you met?</p>
               <p>Sleep. That Person at the Bar was so near me, and the Moon shone so bright, that I could see his Face as plain as I can now. I told the

               <p>Court. Now, Mr. Sleep, you say it was the 18th of October last; how long might you take in going from Falconbridge court to this Place where you met him?</p>
               <p>Sleep. I can't say, I did not ride fast; I apprehend I was about an Hour in riding of it, hardly so much.</p>
               <p>Court. You said you should know him again; and that upon Reflection his Grand-mother you knew, and you knew him a Boy?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Ask him what Time of the Night it was, whether there was any other Persons nigh at that Time; whether I hollowed cut or any Pistol fired, or any Person asked him for a Hat or Wig.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Sleep. Was there any Body near you?</p>
               <p>Sleep. There was no Body but the Carter.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you met several People, did you communicate the Robbery to the People you met ?</p>

               <p>Q. to Justice Nodes. Do you know any thing with Relation to the Prisoner's being brought before you, or conveyed to Bedford Goal, or any thing taken from him?</p>
               <p>Justice Nodes. On the 20th Day of October last, I was informed that the Warrington Coach was robbed, and they had taken an Highwayman; when the Prisoner was taken, there were three Watches taken from him, one was a gold one, and one of the silver ones this Witness came and owned; when under Examination, the Prisoner confessed that between Harrow on the Hill and London, he had robbed several People.</p>

               <p>Justice Nodes. I did deliver the Watch taken from the Prisoner, to Mr. Sleep; when under Examination he did own to me he had robbed several Persons between Harrow on the Hill and London, the 18th of October.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Justice Nodes. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am sure it was not a proper Officer that search'd me; I don't know what they might put into my Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Sleep. Is that the Watch you was robbed of?</p>
               <p>Sleep. Yes, my Lord, it is.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Would you ask any Questions to the Justice of Peace?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he found that Watch upon me.</p>
               <p>Court. He does not say that he found it upon you; but you hear what Mr. Sleep and the Justice has sworn; Have you any Witnesses to call, or any thing to say in your Defence?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As for bringing of People to my C haracter, 'tis only troubling the Court; but I apprehend the Law is so tenderly made in such Cases, that I don't think any Jury in the World will bring me in guilty upon this, to have a Bill found against me, when the Witness did not know that I was the Person, till I was at a House buying a Pair of Boots. I shall say no more, my Lord, at present.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Sleep. The People told you that he had produced the Watch?</p>
               <p>Sleep. Yes, Sir.</p>

               being then and there armed with, and carrying Fire-arms, and other Weapons, to wit, Blunderbusses, Pistols, Guns, Sticks and Clubs, feloniously did assemble themselves together, in order to be aiding and assisting in the clandestine running, landing and carrying away certain uncustomed Goods, (to wit) four thousand Pounds Weight of Tea, then imported here from Parts beyond the Seas, for which certain Duties were payable to his Majesty; to the Terror of the King's Subjects, to the Hindrance of his Majesty's Officers of the Customs, in the Execution of their Office; to the Diminution of the Revenue, against the Statute in that Case made and provided; against his Majesty's Peace, his Crown and Dignity
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Council. Please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am Council in this Cause for the King against Henley the Prisoner at the Bar, who stands indicted of a Felony for being armed, and carrying Fire arms, in order to be assisting in the carrying off of four thousand Pounds Weight of uncustomed Goods; this Indictment is laid as being against an Act of Parliament of the ninth of his present Majesty; this was laid to put a Stop to that infamous Practice of Smuggling that has prevailed over the Kingdom; we shall prove to you, that the Prisoner has been pretty well known for some Years past to be a very notorious Practitioner in smuggling; he is a Person that has went by the Name of a Captain among them.</p>
               <p>The particular Fact upon which he now stands indicted was in April last, that he with about thirty other Persons were assembled at Northforeland, there they were armed with Fire-arms, Pistols and Blunderbusses; their Purpose in coming there was in order to assist, to be helpful in running and landing some Tea, that was brought in a smuggling Cutter, belonging to one King; they landed about four thousand Weight of Tea, loaded it upon Horses, and proceeded in a Body together; these People so armed went from the Place where they run this Tea, they kept in a Body together, when they were come to a Place of Safety, then they dispersed, and carried their Goods away to their several Places. Gentlemen, we shall prove that the Prisoner at the Bar was one of these Persons.</p>
               <p>Council. I am Council for the same Side. Gentlemen, you all very well know the Necessity of publick Prosecutions of this Kind, 'tis a Practice of such a Nature, that the Consequences of it are so extensive and obvious, that there is hardly any Ocsion to mention them: it tends in the first Place to the Prejudice of the Fair-Trader, because these Persons not doing Justice to the Publick, are capable of selling Goods at an under Rate, and that Trader, that trades fairly and honestly, must be a Sufferer by this Practice.</p>
               <p>In the next Place, it immediately tends to the Diminution of the Revenue, and that Diminution does not effect the Crown merely, but it effects the Subjects of Great Britain, because you all know the Duties laid upon those Sort of Goods, are appropriated to answer a particular Part of the national Debts; the Consequence is, if any Diminution is made upon them, the Legislator must lay new Duties upon the Publick, and it will effect every Man that is to contribute to them.</p>

               <p>Besides, this Gang of Smugglers are grown to that Pass, that they are too big for the Law itself; every body knows what Riots, and Tumults, and open Violence in Contempt of the Laws of the Country, and indeed setting the civil Magistrate at Defiance; therefore Practices of this Kind call upon those entrusted with the Government of the Nation, to look closely into them, and, if possible, put a Stop to the Consequences that result from them. Gentlemen, you perceive by the Act of Parliament, it is an Offence of a peculiar Nature, not an Offence of running<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174702250025"/> Goods, and defrauding the Crown, that has been provided by other Acts of Parliament; but the Legislature finding that these Fellows were got to that Pass, that it was almost impossible to detect them in the Act of running of Goods, because they were collected together in such formidable Banditties, that no body could detect them to the Satisfaction of a Jury; therefore the Legislature thought fit to take a Method for preventing this Practice, by anticipating, if I may so say, that Offence: This Act of Parliament makes the Fact of being assembled together armed, in order to purpose the running of Goods, it being an Offence to which the Law hath set a particular Punishment; therefore there was only that Way Left; they might be seen armed and assembled, but it was impossible for any body to pry into the Fact, to charge them with the particular Fact of running Goods. The Question upon this Indictment will be, whether or no we shall lay before you a satisfactory Evidence, that this

            , who was so notorious in the County of Kent, that, according to my Instructions, he was Captain, and stiled Captain of one particular Gang; the Question will be, whether we can shew you, according to this Act of Parliament, whether he was actually assembled, with other Persons armed, in order to be assisting in clandestine running of Goods: It happens in this Case that there can be no doubt in the Evidence we shall lay before you because we shall not call Witnesses who were at a Distance, and might mistake the Person, but we happen to have one of the Confederates, who was actually concerned with him, who could not be mistaken with respect to the Prisoner, he being with him in Northforeland, in the County of Kent.</p>

               <p>Shaw. No other Reason but from the Date of the Book; I am satisfied he was there upon the 14th.</p>
               <p>Council. What Time might he come back on the 15th?</p>
               <p>Shaw. I don't recollect the exact Time.</p>
               <p>Council for the King. What Sort of a Horse was it you sold to him two Years ago? it was a good strong Horse, I suppose, fit to carry a Burthea ?</p>
               <p>Shaw. Sir, it was fit to carry me.</p>

               <p>Shaw. Because I had it, or I could not have let him have it.</p>
               <p>Council. You say he came the 10th, and on the 14th; was it upon the Day he went out; or the Day he came in, you lent she Sum of Money? Can you produce that Note?</p>

               <p>Batson. It stood till the 14th; he came to look at it between the 10th and 14th, to look at it once or twice; the 14th I got him a Chaise, and he went out and came in the 15th.</p>
               <p>Council. How long did the Horse stay in your Stable afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Batson. Till the 18th.</p>

               <p>Council. Do you use constantly to make an Entry of every Horse that comes in ?</p>
               <p>Batson. Commonly.</p>
               <p>Council. How came it in your Book ? There is no Notice of any thing in your Book from February to April.

               <p>Lepard. It was given me by the Prisoner; and I went to the Gentleman, Mr. Riley, and he accepted it; he said it was his Note.</p>
               <p>Council. When did the Note come to your Hand ? Was there any Debt owing to you?</p>
               <p>Lepard. He owed me about eight Pounds for Goods sold</p>

               <p>Lepard. Yes, Sir; in order to be a Witness.</p>
               <p>Council. What is the Reason he gives why he does not come?</p>

               <p>Lepard Yes, Sir?</p>
               <p>Council. Mr. Riley must be a very odd Man not to pay a Note of five Guineas in a Year's Time. Does this import the Time when he gave it. You produce it as a conclusive Evidence, that on the 14th of April the Prisoner was in Town; which I can by no Means admit of; that Note might have been signed at Northforeland, as well as at London.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174702250028"/>Harrison. I can't be positive at in the Day: but by carrying a Wig to fit a Person that came from Newmarket Races.</p>
               <p>Council. Can you tell how near the 15th of April?</p>
               <p>Harrison. I tell you, Sir; I looked in the Almanack; yesterday. Morning, and see the Time of the Race was about the 13th of April; it was about the 12th or 13th of April: it was the first or second Sunday, I can't tell which.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you see him the Day after you delivered the Wig.</p>
               <p>Harrison. I think I did.</p>
               <p>Council for the King. So the Prisoner bespoke his Wig a Week before the Person that came from New-market Races. I understood at the first that the Prisoner bespoke his Wig one Day, and the, Gentleman the next.</p>
               <p>Harrison. It might be a few Days I can't be positive.</p>
               <p>Council. Was it not two or three Days before this Person came up from the Races at Newmarket ? I don't know whether you are acquainted with New-market; because I believe their Races hold the whole Month of April</p>
               <p>Court. Are you positive you saw the Prisoner the Day after the Wig was delivered?</p>

               <p>Harrison. I am pretty positive of that.</p>
               <p>- Kelley, the Lawyer. It was but yesterday Morning I looked over my Book cursorily, to see if I could find any Entry or Transaction with the Prisoner on the 14th of April; he called on me in the Morning, my Wife being advised by her Physician to go into the Country for the Air, I asked him about a Chaise, and he recommended me to the Red-lion in the Borough; there we had a Pint of Wine: He lent me his House almost every Night, and I returned again in the Morning: I believe, upon my Oath, I saw him almost every Day; he dined with me, he and his Wife, the first of April. I believe I saw him the whole Month of April.</p>
               <p>Council. Can you be very sure the Defendant was with you at the Red-lion?</p>
               <p>Kelly. He was, to the best of my Memory; and it was upon his Recommendation that I went to hire the Chaise.</p>
               <p>Council. Can you remember who else was with you?</p>
               <p>Kelley. I believe the Man of the House was there.</p>

               <p>Staples. As to that I can say but little, one way or another, but he is not a Man that ever I had a great Opinion of.</p>
               <p>Council. I ask you upon your Oath, whether he is a Man to be credited ?</p>

               <p>Staples. Not a very good one.</p>
               <p>Council for the King. I suppose not a very good one, because he appears an Accomplice with these Smugglers.</p>
               <p>Staples. I believe once, Sir, he stopped a Man upon the Highway, and took a Watch from him.</p>
               <p>Council. Was he ever prosecuted for it? was you concerned with him?</p>
               <p>Staples. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. How came you to suspect it then?</p>
               <p>Staples. Because he brought it to me; he told me to the best of my Knowledge, that he had taken a Watch from the Man, or he gave it him, I cannot say which, he told me it belonged to a Gentleman whose Name was Hammon.</p>
               <p>Council for the King. Then if I understand you, the Man had given you the Watch; why surely you could not be a Man of so bad a Character, that any Man would come to you, and tell you he had stole a Watch, and offer it to you?</p>
               <p>Staples. The Reason that he did it, he offered the Watch to another Man before he came to me; he brought it to me to send it to the Gentleman the Owner.</p>
               <p>Council for the King. Now you and I differ very much; that seems to be a very honest Act to return the Man the Watch: Then you would insinuate from this round about Story, that this Man stole a Watch; and you having such a Character in the Country, that you was a proper Person to bring stolen Goods to: This is the History of you and your Neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Staples. I keep a Publick-House, rent 177 l. a Year; and likewise keep a Turnpik.</p>

            . Are you acquainted with Shaw, that keeps the Hand and Arm in Barnaby-street? What Character has he?</p>
               <p>Walker. I had an Information against his House; I can't tell any otherwise.</p>
               <p>Council. What are you?</p>
               <p>Walker. I am an Officer of the Customs: I had an Information against his House; but I found nothing.</p>
               <p>Council for the King. I must beg your Lordship, and Gentlemen of the Jury, to take notice that the Fact we charge the Prisoner with, is sworn directly and positively by an Accomplice with himself, who could not but know whether he was or was not there, let his general Character be what it will, in the Manner of his dealing with other People; there is plain and direct Proof the Prisoner is guilty of this Fact, whatever other People believe of him, that are his Friends and Neighbours. The Defence they have set up is, that he was in another Place at the Time when he was concerned in the landing of these Goods: For that Purpose they have produced one Shaw, who tells you he keeps a Publick house in Southwark; that he has kept the Publick-house for three Years, and he has known the Prisoner for two Years; he sold him a Horse, and upon the 10th of April last he bought a Horse at his House; he went out the 14th, and back again the 15th of April; and, to confirm this, he appeals to his Stable-keeper. But observe, that he himself tells you, that the Prisoner is a Captain; he passes among themselves and his own Friends by the Name of Captain, when he is in no Regiment.</p>
               <p>You see, Gentlemen, that he deals in Horses with this Man pretty much: This Account that the Man himself gives of his House, pretty much corroborates what by the Witness we called to the general Account of it. Shaw, he believes it to be the 14th of April, from his Book, and his own Memory; he plays backward and forwards, with relying upon one and another: In this likewise he tells you, he went away from his House in the Morning before Dinner, and came back again the 15th.</p>
               <p>To corroborate him, comes the Hostler and the Stable-book. The Hostler tells you, he knows the Prisoner, but he has not lived above Twelve Months in the House: He entirely grounds himself upon his Stable-book, where he had entered, Captain

             came there the 10th: The Entry is produced, I wish you would look at it; because I think it is difficult to make any thing by that Entry, it comes in very oddly. But, Gentlemen, he contradicts his Master. In another Part of his Evidence, he tells you, it was not till the Afternoon, the 14th of April, he went away. It is not impossible, but that a Man might be in Southwark in the Morning the 14th of April, and a smuggling the 14th of April too. The Master says he went away in the Morning, the Hostler in the Afternoon; and he builds the whole of his Evidence upon what he finds upon an Entry in his Stable-book, which may answer any Purpose he may apply it to; for I believe fearce any Man in the Kingdom can understand it. As to the Note Mr. Riley is said to give to Mr. Henley the 14th of April; he produces no Sort of Evidence; they could not make it Evidence; the Gentleman that gave it does not appear: Supposing it might be dated the 14th of April, it might be at Northforeland, as well as at another Place; so that Evidence is to have no Place at all.</p>
               <p>The next Person produced, he tells you he is a Peruke-maker. Some time in April last the Prisoner bespoke a Bob-wig of him; which Bob wig he delivered to him; the same time he received Orders to make a Wig for another Person: He says the first was in April, and, as near as he can guess, it was about the 12th. The Circumstance upon which he would pin this upon that Time of the Month is, that this other Person came from Newmarket Races, and what he grounded his Assertion upon, was his looking upon the Almanack; but he does not tell you why he is apt to believe that Person was come from the Races: If he came from the Races, he must come from the Races before the Races began: He speaks positively to nothing at all; he does not fix it certain to any Day.</p>
               <p>The next Witness, Mr. Kelley, he has looked over his Book, as it is very natural for him to make Entries:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174702250031"/> all he says out of that Book is, that he went to the Red-lion to hire a Chaise; he finds he was at the Red-lion the 14th of April; there he spent a Shilling: There is no Entry that Mr Henley was there with him; and if Mr Henley was there with him, it would be very material, if they could prove positively, that he was at the Red-lion that Day: Mr Kelley is induced to believe Mr Henley was there with him.</p>
               <p>This is the only Evidence set up in Defence by the Prisoner, and these, by collecting of them, don't exactly tally one with another; these Circumstances, so connected together, don't seem to have any natural Cohesion at all; but these are the Circumstances to take off the Weight of a positive Evidence of a Person that was aiding and assisting in his Company. The Evidences they have called, I don't impeach their Characters at all, that he has had Dealings with them, and he has paid for what he has bought of them; and therefore, upon their Dealings, they have no reason to suspect but he is an honest Man: All that being allowed, it does not prove, he does not smuggle: And especially most of these Gentlemen, when they came to be asked, could not but acknowledge that he had the common Reputati on of a Smuggler. Now common Fame is no Proof; but common Fame will produce a strong Suspicion upon a Man, when he is charged with a positive Fact.</p>
               <p>What they have farther attempted, was to impeach the Character of a Witness called for the King. This they have done by the Oath of one Man, who tells you, that he don't think this Man upon his Oath is to be believed, because he brought him a Watch, that he said a Gentleman had gave him, and that he did not believe it was rightly come by; and Smith, the Witness, wanted him to send it to the Gentleman that it belonged to.</p>
               <p>Now that, Gentlemen, I will leave for your Consideration, whether there is any Foundation to imagine that can be a Reason why the Man may not be credited upon his Oath.</p>
               <p>The next, Mr. Thomas, he tells you he don't know Smith's Face, but he knows his Actions; he has a Hearsay, but he can't tell upon who, for he don't know his Face; and he believes this Man was capable of some particular Fact, and which, if true, he must try after another Manner; and this is his Ground, why this Man, that he never saw his Face, is not to be believed. These are Facts to take off the Weight of what we have laid before you on the Behalf of the Crown; you know the Danger of these Kind of Practices, and I hope you will give your Verdict accordingly.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Herbert. At Chelmsford; the 11th of January my Lodger, after she heard me say I was robbed, she said, did you not come in the last Night, between the Hours of eight and nine, did you not tumble over the Pail? I said, no; she said she heard some Body come in, and go up Stairs, and open your Drawers; upon this I had a Suspicion of this Man's stealing these Goods; I had a Jealousy of this Man, and pursued him into the Country to Witham, and from thence to London; I pursued him here to London, and found him in Drury-lane; I challenged him with it, and he confessed it to me immediately; I said, what is become of the Breeches you made on Saturday? I says I shall lose my Trade; I said if the Coat is not found, I must never go Home again any more; he directed me where to find it immediately of a Pawnbroker; the Coat was at one Place, and the Breeches at another.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon this?</p>
               <p>Herbert. We went before the Justice, and I was bound over to prosecute.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you charge him with?</p>
               <p>Turney. I charged him with stealing two Pounds of Tea; I told him if he would tell me where it was, or pay me for it, I would not hurt him; so he desired to go up Stairs; and he said, will you not hurt me? I said I would not; then he confessed he had sold the Goods in Fee-lane for 6 s. I told him, George, I will not hurt you, if you will tell me where it is: and he told me that he sold it to a Woman in Fee-lane for 6 s. one Part of it, and the other Part he sent into the Country.</p>
               <p>Q. Any thing else?</p>
               <p>Turney. We went before the Justice, and he said before the Justice he had taken it, and sold it for 6 s.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be that Tea?</p>
               <p>Turney. I can take my Oath of it, because I brought the Parcel out but about a Quarter of an Hour before.</p>
               <p>Court. You have informed us in the Course of your Evidence, that you would not hurt him; how came you to endeavour to get his Confession in that Way, and then set up a Prosecution? You got his Confession at the Breach of your own Word, which should be sacred to every Man.</p>

             the younger, this Mr Horn came with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Billings He said his Father had fetched it out of Pawn, for five and twenty Shillings; I gave him a Guinea and a half for it, and he cheated the Prisoner out of a Crown of it, for he gave him a Crown less than I gave him; when the Constable came to me, I delivered the Clock last Tuesday.</p>
               <p>[The Clock was produced in Court]</p>
               <p>Franket the younger. The Prisoner brought this Clock to my Father, and he lent him Money upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come to your Father to lend him Money upon this Clock?</p>
               <p>Franket About three Weeks ago the Prisoner came to my Father, and told him he had a Clock in Pawn for 16 s. which was his Mother's; my Father went with the Prisoner to get it out of Pawn, and they brought the Clock back with them.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Clock was brought back, what then?</p>
               <p>Franket. When the Clock was brought back, my Father made the 16 s. up a Guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your Father give the Remainder in your Presence?</p>
               <p>Franket. I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do afterwards?</p>
               <p>Franket. The Prisoner at the Bar came several Times to my Father, and wanted more Money upon it, but my Father said he would have no more to do with it; so the Prisoner came afterwards to fetch the Clock; he said he would let him have what Money he advanced for it; and my Father sent me as a Security along with him; to bring his Money back again.</p>
               <p>Court. You went with him, where did you go?</p>
               <p>Franket. As we were going along the Street, he (the Prisoner) said he would not carry it to a Pawnbroker's, they would not let him have so much Money upon it, so he would sell it out right.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go then?</p>
               <p>Franket. So Mr Horn made Answer, and said he could carry him to an honest Person's House, that would give him as much as any Body; so we went to

               <p>Q. What is the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Franket. He was an Apprentice by us in Red-lyon-Square.</p>
               <p>Horn. About a Fortnight or three Weeks ago, I went into Franket's for a Pint of Beer; when I came in, young Franket and the Prisoner were going to pawn this Clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Horn. Very slightly; I never was in his Company.</p>
               <p>Q. What Discourse had you with the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Horn. None at all, my Lord; Mr. Franket desired. I would go with them; the Prisoner said he believed he could not pawn it for so much as would pay Mr. Franket, and he said he would sell it; so I told him of a Person that I had known a great while, that would give as much as any Body; so accordingly I went to this Gentlewoman's Husband, but he was not at Home, but the Gentlewoman was, so I went and shewed him the House; so Mrs Billings gave him a Guinea and an Half for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else going along?</p>
               <p>Horn. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any Question asked by Mrs Billings, when she bought it?</p>
               <p>Horn. While she was giving him the Money, says she, whose Clock is it, is it your own? is it that young Man's that stands over the Way? then she made Answer again, he is a Clock-maker; says Franket the younger, he is, for he has a green Apron on.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back again, what did he do with the Money?</p>
               <p>Horn. Whether he gave it his Father, or what, I can't tell; when we all came back, he (the Prisoner) was very free, and offered to treat me at Mr. Franket's House, with Half a Crown's worth of Punch.</p>

            , sen. The Prisoner came to my House along with a Neighbour, about three Weeks ago, with a Shoemaker.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174702250034"/>Q. Did he bring any thing with him?</p>
               <p>Franket. He had a Pint of Beer, and said he was almost starved, and had not a Shoe upon his Feet, and he wanted Money to fetch a Clock out of pawn, that he had made almost all himself; he said if I would do it for him, he should be bound to pray for me as long as he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say the Clock was pawned?</p>
               <p>Franket. At one Singleton's a Pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prisoner say of his Mother?</p>
               <p>Franket. That his Mother was dead; I went along with him to Singleton's, whereof they would not let me see it, before I paid the Money down, so I paid 16 s. and one Shilling for the use of it; it was pawned in his own Name, and he said it was his own Clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the Clock?</p>
               <p>Franket. I brought it Home; he says I shall be pretty well when I have Shoes and Stockings; I made it up a Guinea to buy him some Shoes and Stockings; I drawed him but one Pint of Beer; I told him to go and lay it out for himself; I brought the Clock Home, about three or four Days after he comes to me himself, and he said, Mr Franket, I do not know why you should be afraid to trust him, you have three or four times the Worth in your Hands than what I owe you: he would have sold it for four or five Shillings more, but I would not have it; I said he might take it, and do what he would with it.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoner. What have you to say in your Defence, in Answer to this Charge?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Nothing at all.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have not seen any one Soul that I know.</p>
               <p>Dr Barker. The Prisoner worked with me at the Time I lost the Clock; and for seven or eight Months; I never found him deficient before.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you take him again if you wanted a Servant?</p>
               <p>Dr. Barker. Yes.</p>

               <p>Tempest. On Saturday last, about two o'Clock in the Afternoon, she and her Husband came into my Shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What Shop do you keep?</p>
               <p>Tempest. A Broker's Shop in <placeName id="t17470225-23-crimeloc104">Silver street, Golden-square</placeName>

They took up a Poker, and cheapened it; we did not agree; Then they cheapened a Coffee-pot, and he bought it, and paid me for it. After he had bought that, my Lord, he asked for a Tea-kettle; he took up an old brass one that was not good enough, she wanted a better; Then they cheapened half a Dozen of Knives and Forks, and then they asked for Pewter spoons, and bought them, and paid me for them; He bought a Coffee-pot, a Tea kettle, six Knives and Forks, and two Pewter-spoons: Then they went away. When I went to put up my Things, and they were gone away, they had not been gone long, a little Boy at home says, the Gentlewoman has got a Pair of Candlesticks under her Cloak; I told the Boy to step after her: The Boy ran down James street, and the Boy said, Madam, I believe you have got something more than your own. Says she, I am a very honest Woman. She comes hastily to my Shop again, and from under her Cloak she draws out a Pair of Candlesticks.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she put them?</p>
               <p>Tempest. She put them upon a Pair of Chest of Drawers, and said they are there?</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Tempest. That's all that I know.</p>
               <p>Council for the Defendant. I think you say that both Husband and Wife came into your Shop, and they cheapened your Goods. I would ask you, among those different Things, did not the Husband or Wife cheapen the Candlesticks?</p>
               <p>Tempest. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council Well, but, Sir; had you not at this Time in your Shop a Boy? Now did the Wife say nothing to the Boy in relation to those Candlesticks?</p>
               <p>Tempest. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Council. Where did those Candlesticks first of all stand?</p>
               <p>Tempest. They stood upon the Window on the Left-hand.</p>
               <p>Council. As to these Things, I think there was a Dispute, whether he should pay 10 s. 6 d. or a 11 s. I would ask you how far Distance the Woman was gone when you went out of the Shop?</p>
               <p>Tempest. I never saw her till she had been gone a great Way.</p>
               <p>Council. Did not the Buy say to her, you have taken away a Couple of Candlesticks among the rest of the Things ?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174702250035"/>Tempest. I heard him say this, they are under her Cloak.</p>
               <p>Council. Did not the Woman say, I thought the Candlesticks had been agreed for and paid for by my Husband ? When you came before the Justice of Peace, did not the Boy say before the Justice, that the Woman cheapened the Candlesticks ? Now, Sir, did not you check him, or rebuke him, for saying that the Woman had cheapened the Candlesticks ? The Justice asked the Boy whether she had cheapened the Candlesticks; and the Boy said, Yes; for 3 s. Did not the Boy say before the Justice, that she had talked about the Price?</p>
               <p>Tempest. No.</p>
               <p>Council. I have several Witnesses that the Boy said she had cheapened the Candlesticks, and you rebuked him for mentioning of it. I would ask you another Question. This Woman took these Things with the rest, and they were under one Arm, and the rest of the Things under the other Arm; did you see the Candlesticks under her Arm?</p>
               <p>Tempest. I did not pull up her Cloak in the Street; in Fact, she ran too fast for me.</p>

            . On Saturday in the Afternoon, I had occasion to open my Window to look at something; and I saw the Prisoner at the Bar coming down from Mr. Tempest's Shop, with a Tea-kettle and Coffee pot; she called and asked her Husband if he had got the Spoons: Her Husband said they were in the Coffee pot. After they were gone out, I saw Mr. Tempest in a Hurry; in a very little Time I saw the Prisoner came back very fast, and set down a Pair of Candlesticks by a Chest of Drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live opposite?</p>

               <p>Council. Do you remember that she said that she thought her Husband had agreed for them?</p>
               <p>Turnwell I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Council. Mr. Tempest was in a great Passion; was he not ?</p>

               <p>Turnwell. I think the Boy said she had cheapened the Candlesticks, and his Aunt allowed them for 3 s.</p>
               <p>Council. Recollect Mr. Tempest did not upon this Occasion rebuke the Boy, and seem to be angry with him; he said 3 s. was too small, and he was a Blockhead for saying so.</p>

               <p>Bird. Please your Honour, I was coming by, and I wanted to buy a Pair of Bellows; seeing a Pair hang up at Mr. Tempest's Shop, when I came to cheapen them, Mrs. Tempest said a Woman had taken a Pair of Brass Candlesticks away, and Mr. Tempest was gone out after her. By and by in comes the Woman and Mr. Tempest, and she puts them down upon the Drawers: There they are says she, why do you charge me with them?</p>

               <p>Q. to the Prisoner. What have you to say in your Defence ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went into the Shop, my Lord, on Saturday, as I had done in other Shops before, and cheapened these Candlesticks: The Boy told me they were 3 s. I was gone to look at a Coal-box, and I set down the Candlesticks; I let them alone till I had looked for a Coffee pot and Tea-kettle some Things we could not agree for as to Price, and I laid them down: We agreed for several Goods, and my Husband paid 11 s.

               <p>Council: Do you know that she was entrusted with Things of Value?</p>
               <p>Brett. Yes, Sir; there were all Sorts of Plate Candlesticks, Salves, and a great many Things were in her Power to take away: I was with her Mistress<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174702250036"/> this Day and I asked her what she thought of her; she gave her a very good Character; she was very ill, or she would have been here herself.</p>
               <p>Mr Tibb. I belong to the Clerk of the Kitchen; I know she was entrusted with Plate, and Things of Value; her Mistress said she never had a better Servants and the only Reason that she was discharged, was, because she was married.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bell. I have known the Prisoner for two Years, and she bears an honest Character.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Matocks. Did you hear Tempest's Nephew say this Woman cheapened any Candlesticks?</p>
               <p>Matocks. When she was brought before the Justice, this Boy was examined; he likewise promised Mr. Paulson to bring the Boy here upon his Word; therefore the Justice did not bind him over.</p>
               <p>Tempest. The Reason I did not bring him, he is too young.</p>
               <p>Matocks. I'll give the Reason why I believe he did not. The Boy was examined. Says the Justice, what have you to say about this Woman; do you know any thing about her cheapening any Candlesticks? The Boy said, as they were cheapening the Candlesticks, his Aunt said they were 3 s. Mr. Tempest put himself into such a Passion, that I thought he would have struck the Boy; he said, You lye, Sirrah; I never put such a price upon them.</p>
               <p>- Orton. The Justice asked if any Body else were in the Shop, the Boy was mentioned; Justice Poulson said it was necessary to have the Boy brought; when the Boy came, Mr. Paulson asked him how old he was, he said thirteen; then he asked the Boy what he knew of the Affair of the Prisoner at the Bar; he said, the Prisoner at the Bar and her Husband came in, and he bought a Coffee-pot, half a Dozen Knives and Forks, and Mr. Tempest went into the Back room; and the Prisoner at the Bar ask what was the Price of a Pair of Candlesticks; Mr. Tempest went backward, and the Boy and his Aunt was in the Shop, and the Prisoner at the Bar asked the Price of those Candlesticks, and his Aunt said they were 3 s. and Mr. Tempest repremanded the Boy for saying 3 s. when always the set Price was 3 s. 6 d. The Boy was in the Shop when the Woman went out; when they were gone, the Boy said, Unkle, Did the Woman pay you for those Candlesticks? he said no; then he said they had got a Pair of Candlesticks not paid for; upon that, Mr. Tempest went after her as far as Queen street; when he came to her, she said she thought her Husband had paid for them.</p>
               <p>- Ashley. I was at the Justice's along with the Prisoner; I was afflicted with the Gout, so the Justice indulged me to sit down in a Chair, accordingly I did; there was some Talk of this Kind, but I can't charge my Memory particularly with it, because I did not take particular Notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any Talk about the Price of Candlesticks?</p>
               <p>Ashley. What the former Witness has said of it, upon my Oath, I apprehend to be the Truth.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner was honourably <rs id="t17470225-23-verdict105" type="verdictDescription">
                     <interp inst="t17470225-23-verdict105" type="verdictCategory" value="notGuilty"/>
               acquitted
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>It appeared to the Court to be a very rash Piece of Conduct in Mr. Tempest; and that Circumstance of his not bringing the Boy upon the Trial, according to his Promise, made his Cause appear doubtful. The Prisoner's Husband petitioned for a Copy of her Indictment, but that was not granted.</p>

            . When I caught Corp with the Wood, and he told me where he was going to sell it; I told him I was sure she would not buy it, for I says she was tried in May Sessions for such a thing; he said she would, for she had bought many a Piece of him; so I went with him to the Door, and he showed the Door, and went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see there?</p>
               <p>Skarf. I saw Mrs Walker and her Daughter, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you by?</p>
               <p>Skarf. I was looking on all the Time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she offer him?</p>
               <p>Skarf. First a Penny, at last she gave him three half pence for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ask him any Questions?</p>
               <p>Skarf. Not any, for I was at the Door, and I saw and heard all that past, for I did not believe that she would buy it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her give him the three half-pence ?</p>
               <p>Skarf. Yes, my Lord, he brought it out in his Hand, and carried it down to the Keys in his Hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that Fustick worth?</p>
               <p>Skarf. Mr. Lucas can tell you, I cannot tell?</p>
               <p>Q. to Lucas. Do you know the Value of that Fustick that is produced in Court?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I asked the Opinion of two Brokers, and it was valued between three and four Shillings, 'tis between 30 and 40 Pounds Weight.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoner You have heard what the Witnesses have sworn; you are charged with receiving these things knowing them to be stolen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, this poor Fellow used to bring Hoop-sticks, and I used to give him a Penny or Two-pence. There was a House a pulling down a little from us, and he brought it from thence. I am innocent: I am as innocent as your precious Heart within you; if it is any otherwise, it is Ignorance.</p>
